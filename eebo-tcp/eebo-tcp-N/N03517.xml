            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN the Goſpel of Chriſt was firſt publiſh'd in the World, it had innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prejudices to conquer, and the ſtrongeſt oppoſition to break through. A crucified Saviour was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumbling, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>The Peple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were intoxicated with the dream of earthly grandeur, and vainly expected that the promiſed Meſſiah would aſſume the enſigns of royalty and power, ſubdue all Nations by the force of his victorious Arms, and exalt them to the ſupreme Government of the World. When therefore our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour appeared in the humble circumſtances of poverty and diſgrace, and they beheld (inſtead of a Conquering Prince) a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief; they deſpiſed his perſon, rejected his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, accuſed him as an Impoſtor, and condemn'd him as a public Malefactor.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were intoxicated with the dream of earthly grandeur, and vainly expected that the promiſed Meſſiah would aſſume the enſigns of royalty and power, ſubdue all Nations by the force of his victorious Arms, and exalt them to the ſupreme Government of the World. When therefore our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour appeared in the humble circumſtances of poverty and diſgrace, and they beheld (inſtead of a Conquering Prince) a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief; they deſpiſed his perſon, rejected his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, accuſed him as an Impoſtor, and condemn'd him as a public Malefactor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> were profeſs'd Admirers of Wiſdom, and diſtaſted every thing that was not recommended with the beauties of Wit, and adorned with the flowers
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004295_0005_10040F8F86ECF300"/>of Rhetoric: the Goſpel they therefore deſpis'd as a ſimple and ill-contriv'd fable, deſtitute of Art and Eloquence, and treated its profeſſors with ſcorn and contempt. But notwithſtanding the unhappy preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, and the inſolent Pride of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philoſophers, the Goſpel was attended with ſurpriſing ſucceſs, and Multitudes of all Orders and Degrees flock'd to the ſtandard of Chriſt. This is plac'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in our Text, among the Myſteries of Godlineſs. <hi>Great is the Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking unto theſe Words (by Divine Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) I ſhall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Evidence the truth of the Fact,</hi> and ſhow that Chriſt was believed on in the World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall conſider this as a <hi>Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> beyond the power of ſecond Cauſes, and to be aſcribed to the ſupernatural influences of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt. I am to <hi>evidence that Fact</hi> mention'd by the Apoſtle, and ſhew that Chriſt was <hi>believed on in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner was the Goſpel publiſh'd by the firſt Miniſters of his Kingdom, but it was attended with aſtoniſhing ſucceſs, and made a triumphant Progreſs through the Earth.</p>
            <p>When the Great Author of our Religion aſcended into Heaven, the number of his Diſciples was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: But no ſooner was the Spirit poured out upon the Apoſtles, but there was immediately a mighty Acceſſion made to the Church, <hi>and three thouſand were added unto it in one Day</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts <hi>2.41.</hi>
               </note>. <hi>The Word of God increaſed, and the Number of the Diſciples multiplied greatly in Jeruſalem; and a great Company of the Prieſts were
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004295_0006_1004109D8440D630"/>obedient unto the Faith</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7</note>. From thence with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſwiftneſs it paſs'd through all <hi>Judea, Samaria,</hi> &amp;c. and by degrees penetrated to the more diſtant parts of the World; ſo that within thirty Years after the Death of Chriſt, and before the great and final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was not only diffuſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Seat of Learning and Politeneſs, but the dark corners of the Earth were inlightned with the Doctrine of Salvation, and the moſt barbarous Nations had the Goſpel of the Kingdom convey'd unto them: and wherever it came, it flouriſh'd exceedingly; multitudes of all Ages and Sexes embrac'd the faith of Chriſt. So quick and ſurpriſing a progreſs it made in the World, that in a few Years we find the Chriſtian Apologiſts boaſting of their mighty numbers, and repreſenting to the pagan Emperors, <q>that their Cities and Provinces, their Camps and their Courts, yea the Senate-houſe and Palace, were filled with the deſpiſed Sect of Chriſtians, and that it would be impoſſible to deſtroy them without exhauſting the ſtrength of the Empire, and leaving all places in a ſtate of diſmal ſolitude and ſilence<note n="*" place="bottom">Tertull.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' at firſt the Diſciples of Jeſus were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of wordly wiſdom and learning, without power and policy, of an humble and inferior character: yet in a few Years Men of uncommon Sagacity and Learning, of ſuperiour Genius and Figure, laid aſide their ancient prejudices and chearfully embrac'd a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Goſpel. Thus the Word of God went on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and to conquer, until at laſt the mighty Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the Earth were ſubdued by its victorious power, and reſign'd their lawrels at the foot of the Croſs. The Sovereign Princes of the Roman Empire were perſwaded to ſubmit to the Obedience of Faith, and zealouſly to propagate that Faith which before
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004295_0007_10040F9A1E2DC8C8"/>they had inhumanly perſecuted. Thus was that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Iſaiah accompliſh'd, <hi>In the laſt days the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and be exalted above the hills, and all nations ſhall flow unto it and be ſaved</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. <hi>2.2.</hi>
               </note>. But the ſwift progreſs of the Goſpel being a Fact to fully known, and ſo univerſally acknowledged, I need not enlarge any further in the proof of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly. I am to ſhew, That this is <hi>a Myſtery,</hi> beyond the power of ſecond Cauſes, and to be aſcribed to the ſupernatural influences of the Spirit of God. And this will appear, if we conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The aſtoniſhing Change it produced in the Lives and Manners of its Profeſſors.</hi> They were at once transformed into new Men and became obedient to the Faith, not in word but deed; they renounc'd their ancient Idolatries and became chearful Victims to the Croſs of Chriſt. When they chang'd their Profeſſion they reform'd their manners, and from the depths of iniquity were recovered to the unfeigned practice of Piety. The proud Maſters of Philoſophy forſook their beloved Sentiments and ſubmitted to the diſpenſation of Grace, the ſenſual and voluptuous were perſwaded to mortify the Fleſh, and renounc'd the forbidden Pleaſures of Sin, the ambitious deſpiſed their earthly honours, and receiv'd the Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom as their higheſt Glory, the covetous Miſer became beneficent and charitable, and conſecrated his Wealth to the ſervice of the Saints; Perſecutors were diſarm'd of their fury and grew ambitious of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Martyrs of Jeſus; the fierceſt Natures were ſubdued into Meekneſs, and inſulting tyrants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came patrons of oppreſs'd Innocene and Vertue.</p>
            <p>This mighty change was happily exemplified in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Converts, who were practiced in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004295_0008_10040FA8E7BFB860"/>vileſt iniquities, but after their receiving the Goſpel were eminent for their temperance and ſobriety, <hi>they were waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus and by the Spirit of our God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11.</note>.</p>
            <p>Yea ſo exemplary were the lives of Chriſtians in theſe firſt and pureſt Ages of the Church that their very enemies repreſent them as <q>a devout, innocent and charitable ſort of men,</q> and the ancient defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the faith challenge their adverſaries to produce one of their Number <q>that was condemn'd as a thief or a murderer, or was guilty of any groſs enormities for which the pagan world was ſo infamous.</q> Now certainly nothing but a divine power could produce ſuch a wonderful Change in the lives and manners of men; it is only the almighty Spirit of grace, that can ſubdue the perverſneſs of human Nature, reſtrain the tumultuous paſſions of mankind, and transform Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Vice and Impiety into patterns of Sobriety and Vertue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider <hi>the Meanneſs and Simplicity of the Inſtruments, that were employed in this Bleſſed Work.</hi> A Stranger to the ſacred Hiſtory will perhaps imagine that the Goſpel was propagated at firſt by Men of ſuperior Genius, intimately acquainted with the ſecrets of human Learning, well vers'd in the Art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, and aſſiſted by the Charms of Perſwaſion and Eloquence; and had this been the caſe, the ſucceſs of the Goſpel had not been ſo wonderful, nor the divine power ſo clearly diſplay'd: therefore <hi>God choſe the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, the weak things of the world to confound the mighty, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 29.</note>. The Apoſtles were Men of contemptible figure, inferior extract, and of plain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; they were not poliſh'd by Education, nor improv'd by ſtudy, but brought up to the meaneſt employments; they had neither Art to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

Theſe were the firſt Heralds of the Everlaſting Goſpel, and by theſe (in themſelves contemptible Inſtruments) it pleas'd God to humble the Pride of man, and ſubdue the world to the Croſs of Chriſt. This then declares the divine power that attended the Publication of the Goſpel: <hi>we have this treaſure in earthen Veſſels, that the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Power may be of God and not of us</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note>. And this divine Power will further appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The manner in which the Goſpel was propagated in the world.</hi> The Inſtruments employed were not only mean and contemptible, but the method they took to accompliſh their deſign was contrary to carnal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and moſt unlikely to prevail. Impoſtors have always endeavoured to propagate their doctrines by force, or inſinuate them into the minds of men by policy and contrivance.</p>
            <p>Thus the Prophet of Arabia introduc'd his religion by the Sword, and by his victorious Arms oblig'd the Nations to receive the Alcoran. The Papal Empire was at firſt eſtabliſh'd by force, and has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ever ſince by continual Stratagem.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtles of Chriſt abhor'd all methods of deceit, nor did they propagate their doctrines by force and ſword; they were not attended with conquering Armies to prepare the way for their reception, nor did they make uſe of torture and violence to ſupport and enlarge their conqueſts. <hi>The Weapons of their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare were not carnal but ſpiritual:</hi> They addreſt their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004295_0010_10040F9D2E704E40"/>nearears <hi>not with the inticing words of man's wiſdom</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</note>, with ſtudied Ornaments of Speech or engaging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of perſwaſion, but in the moſt plain and artleſs manner declared unto them the doctrine and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the death and reſurrection of Chriſt; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him whom the Jews had ſlew and hanged upon a tree, the Saviour of the World, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth. They promiſed an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of Happineſs and Glory to thoſe that believ'd in his Name and obey'd his Commandments: but on the contrary they threatned deſtruction and miſery to ſuch as ſhould impenitently deſpiſe and reject him. And yet by theſe contemptible methods, in the midſt of innumerable difficulties, they gain'd proſelytes to the faith and baffled the Wiſdom and Eloquence, the power and policy of the world: this certainly exceeds the power of man and evidences that the almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit attended them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Doctrines inculcated in the Goſpel make it ſtill more myſterious,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould be believed on in the world. Had the doctrine of Chriſt been ſuited to the Pride of human Nature and calculated to flatter Men in their Vices and Pleaſures, we might juſtly have expected that it would be ſuddenly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally embrac'd: for men are fond of gratifying their ſenſual inclinations, they eaſily receive a doctrine which indulges their Pride and Paſſions, and affords them an unlimited enjoyment of their darling Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>By this means the religion of Mahomet, became pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable to a vicious World, and quickly over-ſpread the Nations of the Eaſt; for it encouraged an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded indulgence of men's appetites and luſts upon Earth, and promiſed an eternal paradiſe of brutiſh and ſenſual enjoyments in a future world.—But the Goſpel of Chriſt had nothing of this nature to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the public reception; the doctrines it taught
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004295_0011_100410AF5ADE8658"/>were ſublime and myſterious, contrary to the Pride and paſſions of men; the duties it inculcated were harſh and ungrateful, againſt the grain of our corrupt and defiled Natures; it obliged its profeſſors <hi>to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, to live ſoberly and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and godly in this preſent world</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.</note>. It required them to renounce their darling iniquities and part with their moſt deſirable enjoyments when they became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with a good Conſcience. Theſe were hard ſayings indeed and difficult to be practiſed by a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Age: and yet notwithſtanding theſe difficulties and diſadvantages it prevailed exceedingly in the World, and triumph'd over the vices and follies of men. And this is ſtill more wonderful, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5. The unhappy Prejudices, that prevailed againſt the Goſpel-diſpenſation.</hi> Prejudice is always an enemy to truth, and fixes the mind in an inveterate oppoſition againſt it, and no prejudice is ſo ſtrong as that which is received from the birth and founded in Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially when it is ſtrengthned by Authority and recommended by the venerable claim of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. It is next to impoſſible to eraſe the early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that men receive in their tender Age, and perſwade them to renounce that Religion, which from their infancy they have been taught to revere and obey. And this was a mighty difficulty which the Goſpel had to encounter at its firſt appearance. Both Jews and Gentiles were filled with the ſtrongeſt prejudices againſt it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> the peculiar People of God, had the higheſt reverence for the Law o Moſes, which was unqueſtionably of divine Authority, and deliver'd unto them from Heaven, with the utmoſt pomp and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. They had alſo a venerable regard for the traditions of the Elders which they believed to be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004295_0012_100410B3F85A3D30"/>ſacred and binding upon the Conſcience. But above all their minds were filled with a flattering expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of earthly dignities, and delighted with a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hope that their Meſſiah would be a temporal Prince and appear with a proſperous and conquering Army; this filled them with an invincible averſion to our humble Redeemer, and they deſpiſed the afflicted State in which he appear'd.</p>
            <p>And the prejudices of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were as ſtrong as thoſe of the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were addicted to the moſt execrable Idolatries and ſunk into the loweſt State of Ignorance and ſuperſtition; the Prince of darkneſs reign'd in their Hearts without controul, and for many Ages maintain'd an undiſturb'd dominion over them; the worſhip of their Idols was eſtabliſh'd by immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial preſcription, and the method of it was ſtately and magnificent, their Prieſts were engaged by Intereſt to maintain their ancient Cuſtoms, and perſwaded the multitude that their coſtly Sacrifices and ſuperſtitious modes of worſhip appeas'd the Anger of the Gods and procur'd continual peace and proſperity.</p>
            <p>The Philoſophers were puffed up with a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their knowledge, and were too proud to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the humbling diſcoveries of the Goſpel, they deſpiſed the plainneſs and ſimplicity of its teachers, and diſtaſted the ſtrictneſs and purity of its precepts. The Doctrine of the Croſs they eſteem'd a ridiculous Story, and the Reſurrection from the dead the groſſeſt abſurdity; thus St. Paul was ſtiled a babbler by the Wits of Athens, <hi>and look'd upon as a ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods, becauſe he preach'd unto them Jeſus and the Reſurrection</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.18.</note>: and yet the Doctrine of Chriſt bore up againſt all oppoſition, and triumphantly prevailed in ſpight of all partiality and prejudice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Theſe prejudices were increaſed by the bitter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions to which Chriſtianity was expoſed.</hi> The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004295_0013_100410B74F34CE98"/>believers had not only the Corruptions of humane Nature to conquer, the propoſſeſſions of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſurmount, but the Rage and Malice of Earth and Hell to contend with. The Dominion of Satan was diſturb'd by the preaching of the Goſpel, and the prince of darkneſs was unwilling to loſe ſo many ſubjects of his Empire, he therefore engag'd the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the World ſtrongly to combine againſt it. <hi>The Kings of the Earth and the Rulers took counſel together againſt the Lord and againſt his anointed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2, 2.</note>. The High Prieſts and Governors among the Jews uſed their utmoſt endeavours to ſtifle Chriſtianity in the birth, and ſuppreſs it in its infancy. And when it began to increaſe in the World, the whole face of the Roman Empire the Miſtreſs of the Earth was engag'd againſt it, and mighty perſecutions were continually rais'd to extirpate and deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>How many forſook their moſt valuable enjoyments and were baniſh'd into the moſt deſolate Corners of the Earth for the teſtimony of Jeſus? how many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the moſt barbarous Cruelties rather than make ſhipwreck of faith and a good Conſcience, and ſuffer'd the moſt affrighting Deaths for the honour of our great Redeemer. They were expos'd to hunger, thirſt and nakedneſs, they were deſtroy'd by fire and ſword, they were condemned to be devoured by Beaſts and forc'd to expire in the midſt of torments. In fine, the King of terrors was preſented to their view in its moſt formidable appearance, to deter them from the profeſſion of the Goſpel, or perſwade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and forſake it.</p>
            <p>And yet theſe ancient Heroes of the Chriſtian Church, this noble Army of Martyrs, perſiſted in their Faith in the midſt of their bittereſt ſufferings, they took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, and patiently ſubmitted to the moſt exquiſite miſeries, they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004295_0014_100410C2B6829AE8"/>gloried in the Croſs in the preſence of their enraged perſecutors, and rejoiced that they were counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt; they encountred Death not only with patience and reſignation, but embrac'd it with extacy and triumph; they hugg'd their Chains as the trophies of their honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their Executioners as the Meſſengers of Heaven; to convey them to the happy manſions of Paradiſe. They enter'd into the fire with Joy, and breath'd out their Souls in chearful Hallelujahs.</p>
            <p>Nor was this peculiar to men of undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and manly Reſolution, but the Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors was vaſt, and conſiſted of Perſons of all Ages and Sexes, of all Orders and Conditions. The hoary Heads deſpis'd the Weakneſs of their declining Years, and joyfully devoted the remainder of their days to the defence of the truth. Blooming Youths forgot the tenderneſs of their Conſtitutions, and with undaunted Courage entered the fiery trial, and even delicate Virgins renounc'd the ſoftneſs of their Sex, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Death, tho' attended with the moſt ghaſtly terrors.</p>
            <p>Now what but a divine Power could preſerve the Church in the midſt of the fiery furnace? Had this Work or Counſel been of men, it muſt certainly have been overthrown, when all the Powers of Earth were united to oppoſe it: but under all the diſcouragements that the Policy of men could invent, or the Malice of tyrants inflict, the Goſpel flouriſh'd, mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were made to the Church, all attempts to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it prov'd ſucceſsful methods to advance its Glory. The Contradiction of Sinners redounded to the Credit of its Diſciples. The Blood of the Martyrs was the ſeed of the Church, and like the ſhowers of Heaven upon the thirſty Earth, made it more fruitful and flouriſhing. This muſt be acknowledged the work of the Lord, and it ſhould be marvellous in our Eves. It certainly deſerves a place among the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004295_0015_10040FEA71C86280"/>of Godlineſs, that Chriſt was believed on in the World.</p>

               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us all be perſwaded to believe the Truth and Divinity of the Goſpel, which was ſo eminently confirm'd from Heaven, and ſo miraculouſly prevailed in the world.</hi> The Great Author of our Religion evidenc'd his Miſſion by the moſt unqueſtionable Authority; the Father teſtified his approbation from Heaven, and in a Voice of thunder, declar'd him his beloved Son in whom he was well pleaſed.— The Miracles which he wrought in the preſence of Multitudes declar'd him to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World.— The wonderful deſcent of the holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, and the aſtoniſhing Gift of tongues with which they were at once inſpired, was a viſible confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Doctrine, and a ſtanding teſtimony that the Goſpel was not a cunningly deviſed fable, but of divine and heavenly extract.</p>
               <p>But were all theſe forgotten, the incredible ſucceſs that attended it at its firſt promulgation againſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane probabilities, would be a ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it was of God and not of Man.—Is it poſſible to conceive, ſo unacceptable a Scheme could be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the world by men deſtitute of Education and Learning, without art and addreſs; and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally prevail in ſpight of prepoſſeſſion and prejudice, in oppoſition to perpetual force and violence, without any advantages to recommend it, but the promiſe of an unſeen and future Reward? What but a ſtanding Miracle could propagate a Doctrine ſo ſevere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ungrateful, ſo repugnant to the Appetites and Paſſions of humane Nature, ſo diſpleaſing to fleſh and blood, ſo contrary to the Wiſdom of the World; a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that was ridiculed by the great Philoſophers of the Age, and perſecuted by the Princes of the Earth? Muſt not the happy Entertainment it met with, be principally aſcrib'd to the demonſtration of the Spirit
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004295_0016_10040FB609FB3CA0"/>and power that accompany'd it?—What but an almighty Arm could deſtroy the Kingdom of Satan, and baniſh the Prince of darkneſs from his ancient dominions?— Who but the Spirit of Grace could ſubdue the obſtinacy of rebellious Sinners, and ſet up the Throne of Chriſt in the Hearts of Men?— What but a divine power could ſupport the primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians under their numberleſs hardſhips, and influence the moſt ſoft and delicate Natures to deſpiſe the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of Tyrants, and bravely encounter the moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Deaths? This muſt be own'd to have been the Work of God, and a remarkable evidence of the divine Authority of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How vaſt is the Guilt, how awful the danger of thoſe, who reject the Doctrine of Chriſt!</hi> The Jews per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Chriſt in his State of ſuffering and weakneſs, and the Gentiles oppos'd the Progreſs of the Goſpel through the ſtrength and prejudice of Education; but the Infidels of the preſent Age inſult him upon his Throne, and caſt contempt upon him, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is committed; and that after the cleareſt diſcoveries of his divine Authority, and the fulleſt evidence of the truth of his Miſſion. Their Sin therefore is of a deeper Dye than the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be more ſevere than the deſtruction of ignorant Heathens. Had the Princes of this World been acquainted with the dignity of his Perſon and the excellence of his Doctrine, they would not have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of Glory; this therefore was an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Guilt, and render'd them capable of Pardon: but now the Sun of Righteouſneſs hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in ſuch viſible Glory, chaſed away the darkneſs of Heatheniſm, and eſtabliſh'd his Kingdom upon the Ruins of Superſtition and Idolatry, it is unaccountable Obſtinacy not to acknowledge his Authority, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his juſt and righteous Government. Such have no Cloak for their Sin, no excuſe for their Infidelity;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004295_0017_100410C955492C48"/>but may juſtly expect that the Saviour whom they deſpiſe, will clothe himſelf with Vengeance as with a Garment, and execute an exemplary puniſhment on his Enemies, in proportion to the degrees of Light they have reſiſted, and the invaluable Mercies they have abuſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Sanctity of manners, ſo remarkable in the firſt Days of the Goſpel, ſeverely reproves the awful degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the preſent Age.</hi> The Primitive Diſciples of Chriſt were ſhining examples of Virtue, they caſt a Glory upon their Profeſſion, and recommended it with advantage to the World. Their Piety was fervent without Superſtion and Idolatry, their Charity diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive without hypacriſy and reſerve; they practiſed an aſcetic Virtue in the midſt of alluring temptations, and manifeſted a generous contempt of the World, when ſurrounded with its moſt agreable enjoyments;— but where is that ancient Piety and Virtue, by which the primitive Chriſtians were ſo juſtly diſtinguiſh'd?— Where that Purity of faith and ſanctity of manners, by which they ſhone as Lights in the World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired their very perſecutors with awe and reverence? Alas! in this degenerate Age, Religion is wounded in the Houſe of its Friends, the Profeſſors of the Goſpel are oftentimes Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, and the venerable Name by which we are called, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and blaſphemed by reaſon of the ſcandalous miſcarriages of thoſe who enroll their Names among the number of his followers: this is indeed a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflection, and ſhould inſpire us with a pious Indignation againſt the Vices and Impieties of the Age, and inkindle in our Breaſts a fervent Zeal to advance the honour of that holy Religion we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us ſincerely endeavour after a ſaving acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with this Myſtery of Godlineſs.</hi> Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is propos'd unto us in the Goſpel as the proper Object of our Faith, and recommended to our Eſteem
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004295_0018_100414F8C37256E8"/>and Regard by the moſt powerful and perſwaſive Arguments. This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt is come into the World to ſave Sinners; our Neceſſity loudly demands his aſſiſtance, and his gracious Invitations ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to fly to him as our Saviour. It is not enough that we yield a naked aſſent unto the Goſpel, but our Faith muſt purify the Heart, and produce the works of ſincere Obedience, if we would be entitled to the favour of Chriſt, and own'd as his faithful Servants; if we believe his Doctrines, we muſt regulate our Lives by his excellent Precepts, and imitate his perfect and ſhining Example: for a Chriſtian in Name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only, having a form of Godlineſs but denying the Power of it, is one of the worſt of Infidels, and will be diſowned by Chriſt in the great Day, and herded among the number of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, therefore let us now be perſwaded to accept of Chriſt as our Saviour, and adore him as our Lord and Maſter. Let us be imitators of their Faith, Patience and Holineſs, who through Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Promiſes. Let us earneſtly long and pray for that happy time, when <hi>all the Enemies of Chriſt ſhall be ſubdued under his Feet;</hi> when that promiſe to the Son of God ſhall receive its fulleſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion;</hi> when the <hi>Kingdoms of this World</hi> ſhall in a more illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious manner <hi>become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt.</hi> To whom be Glory and Dominion for ever.<note place="bottom">Preach'd <hi>Sept.</hi> 10, 1737.</note>

            <p>This is an important Article of the chriſtian faith, frequently inculcated in the ſacred Oracles, and almoſt univerſally received in the world.

            <p>Firſt. I am to conſider the <hi>Evidences of a future Judgment.</hi> And here I ſhall obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The voice of conſcience bears teſtimony unto it.</hi> There is implanted in the breaſt of every man a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, on which is engraven with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond, the neceſſary and immutable diſtinction between virtue and vice, between good and evil:— hence ariſes that happy ſerenity of mind, that ſecret joy and ſatisfaction that attends the practice of virtue, and thoſe diſtreſſing fears and gloomy ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, which are the melancholy companions of vice and impiety: So that the good man has an inward ſupport and comfort, even when he meets with nothing but frowns and diſcouragements from without, and is often filled with joyful expectations of a reward in the midſt of worldly darkneſs and difficulty; on the other hand the wicked are haunted with perpetual terrors in the moſt proſperous circumſtances of life, and terrified with the apprehenſions of future vengeance, tho' their crimes are concealed from the world, and committed in the darkeſt privacy. At the approach of death, when all hopes and fears are at end with reſpect to this life, then theſe apprehenſions are the moſt lively and vigorous: in that melancholy hour the wicked are in a more eſpecial manner ſtung with remorſe for their iniquities,— reflect with horror upon their paſt lives, and tremble at the apprehenſion of impending
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004295_0021_100410DC62E41D18"/>vengeance; whereas the righteous are oftentimes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the moſt ſprightly hopes, and amidſt the agonies and convulſions of nature, are revived with the joyful proſpect of immortality and glory.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe impreſſions of futurity peculiar to men of narrow minds, of gloomy and ſuſpicious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but men of all orders and degrees, of all ages and conditions have felt the force of them. Conſcience exerciſes its power without reſpect of perſons, the greateſt monarchs are equally liable to its reproaches with the meaneſt of their ſubjects; — inſulting tyrants have trembled at the remembrance of their guilt, tho' plac'd above the reach of any human tribunal, and ſurrounded with a ſervile train of flatterers and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. Conſcience is neither aw'd by greatneſs, nor brib'd by riches, nor charm'd into ſilence by gaieties and pleaſure: it breaks through, the ſtrongeſt guards, inſinuates into the palaces of the mighty, and is not afraid to ſay <hi>to a King, thou art wicked, and to Princes, Ye are ungodly.</hi> It ſets before them a black catalogue of their crimes, cites them before the inlightned tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of heaven, and fills them with fearful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a judgment to come.</p>
            <p>The Sinner may indeed filence the voice of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for a time, and ſuppreſs theſe uneaſy impreſſions while he is amuſed with company and ingaged in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or diverſion, yet they are hardly ever quite ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd and obliterated; but when the wicked are retir'd from the vanities of the world, when any accident intervenes, that puts a ſtop to the gaiety of their thoughts, and diſpoſes them to ſeriouſneſs and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the mind awakes out of its ſtupidity, and is haraſſed with continual Images of horror. Now to what ſhall we aſcribe theſe awful apprehenſions of futurity, that ſo univerſally poſſeſs the breaſts of men, and attend us to the laſt period of Life? Muſt we not ſuppoſe that they are impreſſions ſtampt upon our nature by the wiſe Author of our beings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004295_0022_10040FC631ADE928"/>to warn us of a future judgment? and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that theſe Joys of the righteous are the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of immortality and the earneſt of eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that the terrors of the wicked are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Sorrows, and the firſt fruits of endleſs and intolerable miſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Perfections of God, the ſupreme Governor of the world, ſeem to require a future judgment.</hi> The firſt notion we entertain of God is, that he is infinitely perfect in all his attributes; and whatever implies the leaſt imperfection, ſtrikes at the very exiſtence of the Deity, and baniſhes him out of the world.</p>
            <p>The admirable beauty that appears on the face of Nature, the wife diſpoſition of its various parts, and their mutual ſubſerviency to the good of the whole, are ſtanding evidences that this world was made at firſt by a wiſe and powerful Being, and is continually preſerved and governed by his gracious providence: Nor can it be ſuppoſed that infinite Wiſdom ſhould be employ'd in ordering the inferior creation with ſuch ſurpriſing harmony and exactneſs, and caſt off the care of man, his favourite creature, and the moſt noble part of his workmanſhip.</p>
            <p>Now if God is ſo infinitely perfect in himſelf, and human affairs are ſubject to his wiſe and univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we may juſtly conclude, that as he loves righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity, ſo he will encourage the one and diſcountenance the other, in a way agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the undoubted perfections of his nature, and conſequently will make a viſible diſtinction between the generation of his faithful Servants, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his implacable enemies.—The Purity of the divine Nature, and the juſtice of his Government aſſures us, that he will not condemn the innocent, nor always ſuffer the guilty to eſcape with impunity; this would be an unanſwerable reflection upon an earthly Prince, and ſoon bring his Government into univerſal confuſion and contempt, and therefore muſt not be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004295_0023_100410E9B86B9698"/>attributed to the ſupreme Governour of the world, who is wiſer than the Kings of the earth.—The only queſtion then is, Whether in the preſent diſpenſations of providence, there is this viſible difference made between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerves God, and him that ſerveth him not?—Is virtue always rewarded in this world, and vice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably puniſh'd?—This cannot be pretended, the contrary is evident to the moſt careleſs obſerver.</p>
            <p>We daily behold a great deal of darkneſs and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty appearing upon the face of providence, and good and evil ſeem to be indifferently diſpenſed to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teons and to the wicked. <hi>There is one event to the juſt and to the unjuſt, to him that ſweareth, and to him that feareth an oath</hi>

The vertuous man is not ſecured from the common trials and afflictions of life, but oftentimes ſtands peculiarly expoſed to the blaſts of adverſity; his ſtrength and beauty is conſumed by waſting diſeaſes, his eſtate devoured by oppreſſion and injuſtice, and his reputation ſullied by the breath of envy and malice.—While the wicked are triumphing in proſperity,<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>Thus we have not only the teſtimony of conſcience, the infinite perfections of God, and the goodneſs and

            <p>Secondly, To make ſome <hi>Improvement</hi> of this aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doctrine. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This manifeſts the juſtice of divine Providence, and anſwers the objections that are ſo frequently brought againſt it.</hi> When we ſee the tabernacles of robbers proſper, and the prophane and ungodly flouriſh in eaſe and proſperity; when the vileſt men are exalted to the height of honour, and poſſeſs the largeſt afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of worldly enjoyments, while the children of God are bow'd down with an heavy weight of cares, and loaded with contempt and diſgrace:— When im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent tranſgreſſors depart out of the world in peace, and <hi>the wicked have no bands in their death;</hi> while the righteous are perſecuted to their graves with reproach, and take farewel of the world in darkneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; — Men are apt to draw the moſt dark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable concluſions, and to imagine that either there is no God, or that human affairs are not under his wiſe and righteous adminiſtration.— Yea, this has oftentimes been a ſtumbling-block to the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints, and cauſed their faith to ſtagger and fail, <hi>their feet have almoſt ſlipp'd,</hi> when they beheld the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted proſperity of the wicked, and the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing calamities of the righteous. They have been ready to pour out that melancholy complaint of the Pſalmiſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13</note> 
               <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004295_0028_10041100696F77B8"/>waſh'd my hands in innocence:</hi> and to join in that pathetic expoſtulation of the Prophet: <hi>Wherefore do the wicked proſper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.</note>? — And indeed theſe would be inextricable difficulties in the diſpenſations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that it would be impoſſible to account for, if this were the only life of man, and there were none elſe to ſucceed it.</p>
            <p>But the doctrine of an eternal Judgment ſcatters the clouds that encompaſs the paths of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, clears up the myſteries that attend his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſhews the juſtice and equity, the beauty and regularity of his proceedings. For this aſſures us, that every ſecret iniquity ſhall be puniſh'd with an holy ſeverity, and every vertuous action ſhall meet with a juſt and ſuitable recompence. The perſecuted ſervants of Chriſt ſhall meet with a diſtinguiſhing reward, while their proud and inſolent oppreſſors ſhall be doom'd to a ſtate of the moſt aggravated miſery. — Why then ſhould the righteous complain of the ſufferings of this life, which are but for a moment, and ſhall be recompenced with a ſuperior and <hi>an eternal weight of Glory?</hi> — Why ſhould they repine at the proſperity of the fooliſh, whoſe enjoyments will vaniſh as a dream, and prepare them for more ſevere and intolerable torments? — This ſurely may well ſatisfy men of the Juſtice of divine Providence, even when the greateſt difficulties attend it, and his ways appear moſt intricate and myſterious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſhews us the reaſon of God's patience, why he bears ſo long with the provoking iniquities of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every wilful tranſgreſſion is an inſolent defiance of the eternal Majeſty of heaven, and a daring contempt of his ſacred authority; impenitent ſinners challenge almighty Juſtice, and provoke the Lord to jealouſy as if they were ſtronger than he.— And yet he bears
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004295_0029_1004110205136C58"/>with aſtoniſhing patience their continual affronts; he ſpares a guilty world that ungratefully deſpiſe his goodneſs, and abuſe his favours to wantonneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Notwithſtanding their innumerable provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſhowers down his favours upon them in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abundance, and fills their hearts with food and gladneſs:mdash; from hence they take encouragement in their wickedneſs, and flatter themſelves that they ſhall eſcape with impunity. They vainly imagine that God does not obſerve their actions, or at leaſt that he will not ſeverely puniſh them for their crimes. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily executed, therefore the hearts of the ſons of men are fully ſet in them to do evil</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eceleſ. <hi>8.2.</hi>
               </note>.— But how vaſt is their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! how unreaſonable is their concluſion! It is not becauſe God is unacquainted with their ways, that he forbears to puniſh their rebellions. For <hi>his Eyes run to and fro in the earth, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> The moſt forlorn corner of the world cannot conceal them from his view, nor the darkeſt privacy baniſh them from his preſence; his Eyes are as a flaming fire, and pierce through the thickeſt darkneſs; and his diffuſive influence extends to every part of the creation.</p>
            <p>It is not any defect of his Power, that can ſecure the ſinner from his avenging wrath; for he made the world by the Authority of a Command, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it in a moment by a frown of his countenance. Sinners are always in his hand, and he can at once eaſe himſelf of his adverſaries, and be avenged of his enemies. He can ſtrike dead the intemperate in the height of their jollity, and fill them with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd wine of his fury. He can ſeize the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſwearer in the midſt of his helliſh rage, and diſpatch him out of the world, with his oaths and curſes in his mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:004295_0030_1004110A81DF1870"/>
It is not becauſe divine Juſtice is aſleep, that he does not make bare his almighty arm, ſurpriſe the wicked in the very act of ſin, and hang them up in chains as ſtanding monuments of his righteous ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. — But he waits with patience that he may lead them to repentance, and delays the execution of his vengeance to the judgment of the great day. He now ſeems to wink at the ſins of men, to try their reverence for his authority, and obedience to his laws; and has appointed a day for the public triumph of his Juſtice, in the deſtruction of his implacable adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. He ſuffers them to remain undiſturb'd in their enjoyments, and to wallow in wealth and plenty in this world; but they are fatning for the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are reſerved for a more ſevere adn dreadful execution.</p>
            <p>He is now ſeated upon a throne of Grace, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures with much long-ſuffering, the veſſels of wrath that are fitted for deſtruction,</hi> but amazing judgments are denounced againſt them in his unalterable word, and will be executed upon them in his appointed time. <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſays he) <hi>haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence, thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thine eyes</hi>

               </note>. In the height of their ſecurity, when they flatter themſelves with peace and ſafety, <hi>ſudden deſtruction will come upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This ſhews the madneſs of unthinking Sinners, who put the evil day far from them, and neglect to prepare for a future judgment.</hi> Since the doctrine of eternal judgment is ſo evident to the principles of Reaſon, and ſo clearly revealed in the Goſpel of Chriſt, it is juſt matter of ſurpriſe and aſtoniſhment, to behold the children of men give a looſe to their vicious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and live in an allowed courſe of impiety and lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004295_0031_10040FE299BF3B78"/>as if they were made for no higher end than to eat and drink, to laugh and to die, —as if they had no apprehenſions of that great and terrible day of the Lord, in which they muſt be called to an account for their actions, and muſt appear at the bar of an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judge.</p>
            <p>It exceeds all belief, did not melancholy experience make it too plain to be denied, that multitudes of chriſtians, who profeſs to expect a day of judgment, ſhould be ſo ſlothful and unactive in their preparations for it; that thoſe who are convinced, that the wicked ſhall be condemned in that day, and expoſed to the vengeance of eternal fire, ſhould yet retain their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved luſts, and continue in as much eaſe and ſecurity as if theſe awful truths were the dreams of enthuſiaſm, and the wrath of God were no more to be dreaded than an inſignificant ſcarecrow.— To what ſhall we aſcribe this general ſtupidity and impiety of men? Whence ariſes, O Sinner! your inward peace and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, when wrath from heaven is revealed againſt you, and hell from beneath opens its mouth wide to receive you? Do you believe there is a juſt and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Being to whom you are accountable, that a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial is kept of your ſecret iniquities, and that he will make a ſtrict enquiry into your actions? And can you yet perſiſt in your ſinful courſes, and live in a careleſs neglect of God and your duty?— This is madneſs beyond a parallel; you are more inſenſible than the brutal world, who will not ruſh into a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are apprized of.— But alas! the unhappineſs of mankind is, that they baniſh theſe ſolemn truths out of their minds; otherwiſe they could not be ſo careleſs and ſecure, they would not dare to ſpend their days in mirth, and their years in pleaſure, without any ſerious regard to God, their almighty Judge, or to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls, which are upon the brink of eternal miſery.— Or if theſe melancholy thoughts ſometimes crowd into their minds, they ſhift them off as unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004295_0032_100411155C904180"/>gueſts, to a more convenient opportunity, and join with the ſcoffers of old, ſaying, <hi>The viſion is for many days.</hi> They are ſo captivated with the vanities and amuſements of life, ſo immers'd in its cares and employments, that they are averſe to exerciſe their thoughts upon ſuch harſh and ungrateful ſubjects, and flatter themſelves that they ſhall have time enough hereafter, when they are ſatiated with the pleaſures of life.— But what can be more ſtupid than to leave your moſt important concerns at a deſperate uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and ſpend your days in unproſitable triſles?— Indeed, could you prevent the approach of that day, by baniſhing the thoughts of it out of your minds; would the Judge wait upon your unreaſonable delays, and put off the time of his coming until you were prepared to go forth to meet him, you would have ſome excuſe for your negligence. But ſince the day is ſwiſtly approaching, whether you regard it or no, ſince the end of all things is at hand, and the Judge is even at the door, it is the height of diſtraction to drive the thoughts of his coming out of your minds, and put the evil day far from you; and eſpecially if we conſider, that the frequent fore-thoughts of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant event is a likely means to perſwade us to a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent preparation for it: and if this be the happy effect, we ſhall eſcape the terrors of that day, and be able to hold up our heads with joy, and ſtand with comfort before the Son of Man at the time of his illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious appearance; which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. and finally, <hi>The doctrine of a future Judgment adminiſters comfort to the people of God, under all the trials and perſicutions that they meet with in the world.</hi> Tho' at preſent they ſeem doom'd to a ſtate of ſufier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſgrace, and are made ſpectacles of miſery to Angels and Men, yet this may ſupport their ſinking ſpirits, and relieve their deſponding thoughts; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that all the hardſhips they meet with are recorded in the book of God's remembrance, and ſhall be

                  <p>And he commanded us to preach unto the People, and to teſtify, that it is He which was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</p>

            <p>THAT God will judge the World in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is a truth agreable to the light of nature, that candle of the Lord, which inlightens every man that comes into the world; and has obtain'd the conſent of all ages, not only among the nations who live in the valley of viſion and enjoy the ſupernatural revelation of the Goſpel, but alſo among thoſe who inhabit the regions of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are ſtrangers to the Covenant of promiſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>Gentile</hi> world had but dark and confuſed notions of a future Judgment; they diſguiſed this awful truth under the moſt abſurd and ridiculous ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet the belief of it was almoſt univerſal: We have frequent intimations of it in the fables of their Poets, the harangues of their Orators, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of their celebrated moraliſts. But tho' they expected a day of future recompence, in which the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004295_0035_100411249653F528"/>righteous would be ſignally rewarded, and the wicked remarkably puniſh'd, yet they were intirely ignorant of the <hi>Perſon</hi> by whom this Judgment ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and the ſurpriſing circumſtances that ſhould attend his approach. This was one of the ſecrets of the divine Counſel, which none of the Princes or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of the world were acquainted with, and which we could never have diſcovered by our moſt painful and laborious enquiries, had not God been pleas'd to reveal it unto us in his word; and here we have not only the nature of a future judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, but the awful ſolemnities that will attend it deſcribed, and are aſſured that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and the dead:</hi> which words afford us this important doctrine for the ſubject of our preſent meditation, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is appointed the ſupreme and univerſal Judge of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to which (by divine aſſiſtance) I ſhall,
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, Conſider how <hi>clearly</hi> this great truth is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> in the word of God.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Shew how <hi>excellently</hi> Chriſt is <hi>qualified</hi> for this exalted office.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Enquire into the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this Divine appointment.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. I am to conſider <hi>how clearly it is revealed in the word of God,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is appointed the great and univerſal Judge of the world.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme power of Judgment belongs to the Bleſſed God, whoſe creatures we are, by whoſe Laws we are govern'd, and to whom we are accountable for our moral actions: the exerciſe of this power is committed to Chriſt, the only mediator between God
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004295_0036_10040FF34DE47138"/>and man. This our Saviour himſelf expreſsly declares, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgment to the Son.</hi> He aſſures his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that <hi>the hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good, to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the reſurrection of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> verſ. 28, 29.— The Angels publiſh'd the fame doctrine at our Lord's aſcenſion, and inform'd his aſtoniſh'd Diſciples, that <hi>this ſame Jeſus whom they had ſeen taken up into heaven, ſhould ſo come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they had ſeen him go up into heaven.</hi> Act. 1.11. — This truth the Apoſtles were commanded to preach and teſtify to all People: therefore we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> declaring to the Philoſophers of <hi>Athens,</hi> that <hi>God would judge the world in righteouſneſs by that Man whom he had ordained,</hi> Act. 17.31.— And our Lord himſelf repeats the promiſe of his coming, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of St. <hi>John,</hi> the laſt of the inſpired writings, <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me.</hi> Rev. 22.12. From theſe, and innumerable other Texts that might be mentioned, we have the fulleſt evidence that our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is appointed the ſupreme Judge of the world.</p>
            <p>He is now ſeated at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, and dwells in inacceſſible Glory; the whole creation is ſubject to his authority, and he governs the inhabitants of heaven and earth according to his ſovereign pleaſure. He is indeed inviſible to mortal eyes, and the curtains of heaven conceal his glory from us. But theſe heavens ſhall ſhortly <hi>paſs away as a ſcroll, and flee from before his preſence;</hi> then ſhall he appear in the majeſty of an incarnate God, and all nations ſhall be ſummon'd before his awful tribunal. I paſs,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To ſhew how <hi>excellently he is qualified for this exalted office.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:004295_0037_1004112C132440D8"/>All human Judgments are ſubject to innumerable imperfections, and the cauſe of Juſtice is often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted through ignorance, partiality and prejudice. To judge the world in righteouſneſs, is a work too difficult to be performed by the moſt excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is in the Boſom of his Father, and is intimately acquainted with the divine ſecrets, he alone is capable of this important commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and he has all thoſe qualities which are neceſſary to the juſt and impartial diſcharge of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His Knowledge is infinite.</hi>— It is highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that the ſupreme Judge of the world ſhould have an exact and intimate acquaintance with all perſons that are brought before him, and a full knowledge of the nature and circumſtances of the actions for which they are to be judged.mdash; For want of this, inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties attend the adminiſtration of human juſtice: the innocent are oftentimes expoſed to an hard and unrighteous ſentence, and the guilty eſcape the puniſhment they have deſerved.mdash; But the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day will be perfectly free from any uncertainly or miſtake; the knowledge of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing univerſal and unerring. <hi>All things are naked and open to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4.13. He knows the perſons, and is acquainted with all the actions of the children of men. <hi>His Eyes are as flames of fire,</hi> and penetrate into the ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the ſoul; he <hi>diſcerns the thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart,</hi> the inward motives and deſigns of our actions. Thoſe abominations which are carefully concealed from the world, and committed in the darkeſt privacy, are as open to his critical inſpection, as if they had been perpetrated in the blaze of day, and expoſed to the public view of the world: for <hi>the darkneſs hideth not from him, but the night ſhineth as. the day,</hi> Pſal. 139.12. Tho' the wicked fly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited deſarts, and ſhelter themſelves in the dens and caverns of the earth, theſe diſmal ſolitudes will
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004295_0038_10041136E0F7ED18"/>not ſcreen them from the preſence of their Judge, nor conceal their crimes from his accurate obſervation. <hi>For be compaſſeth our paths, and is acquainted with all our ways.</hi> He cannot be abuſed with doubtful evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, deceived by any artful inſinuations, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by any flattering appearances; but has all that knowledge that is neceſſary to form an impartial Judgment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His Juſtice is inflexible.</hi>— Earthly Judges are ſubject to corruption, and a righteous cauſe oftentimes miſcarries, through the partiality and prejudice of thoſe who are plac'd in the ſeat of Judgment. They are ſometimes influenc'd by favour and affection, to extenuate the crimes of their friends, or perſwaded by bribes to pronounce an unrighteous ſentence. A ſlaviſh cowardiſe cauſes them to connive at the faults of men of power and eſtate, and a ſervile fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains them from an impartial execution of public Juſtice. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions it as one of the great evils he had ſeen under the Sun, That <hi>he beheld the place of judgment, and behold wickedneſs was there, and the place of righteouſneſs, that iniquity was there,</hi> Eccl. 3.16. But thoſe mean and carnal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will have no influence upon the unerring judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The ſupreme Governour of the world is infinitely above all ſuſpicion of corruption or prejudice, and he will weild the ſword of juſtice with a ſteady and impartial hand; he loveth righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity, and will make a ſuitable diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between his faithful obedient ſervants, and his perverſe and implacable enemies: the perfection of his nature ſecures him from the leaſt imputation of injuſtice, and his infinite kindneſs and compaſſion aſſures us, that he will conſider our frame, and put the moſt favourable conſtruction upon our actions: he cannot be brib'd by riches, nor aw'd by greatneſs and power; for <hi>he is the great and only potentate of heaven and earth, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:004295_0039_1004113DE181A6E8"/>from whom the Princes of this world derive their Power, and to whom they are accountable for their conduct. With him therefore there is <hi>no reſpect of perſons,</hi> but the meaneſt ſlave ſhall have as fair a trial as the proudeſt monarch; Princes ſhall be diveſted of their imperial diadems, and ſtand upon a level with their inferior ſubjects. Every one ſhall receive <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the things done in the body, whether good or evil.</hi> He will paſs an unalterable doom, not only upon his open and avowed enemies, but alſo upon his pretended friends and followers. Secret hypocrites ſhall be unmaſk'd to the view of the world, and be expoſed in all their guilt and deformity; tho' they call Chriſt Lord, and pretend that they are of the number of his diſciples, yet they will be rejected and condemned by their righteous Judge: with terror in his looks and thunder in his voice, he will <hi>ſsay unto them, Depart from me, for I know you not, ye that work iniquity.</hi> Matth. 7.23. Thus he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, and the people with equity; and therefore is admirably fitted for the great work aſſign'd him: eſpecially if we conſider.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His power is almighty,</hi> and none can reſiſt the execution of his will.mdash; How often do we find earthly criminals plac'd above the reach of any human judicature, and defended by wealth and intereſt from the puniſhment of their crimes? But the great Judge of the world is clothed with omnipotence, and able to execute his vengeance upon the greateſt offenders: for <hi>he hath all power in heaven and earth committed unto him,</hi> Matth. 28.18. When he tabernacled in fleſh, and was clothed with the infirmities of mankind, univerſal nature own'd his dominion, and even Devils were ſubject to his authority; the dead were raiſed by the word of his power, and the tempeſtuous ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſubmitted to his rebuke: and the power of Chriſt will be ſtill more illuſtriouſly diſplay'd, when all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and at
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004295_0040_1004113FD323F2B8"/>his command ſhall ſtart out of their duſty beds; when the righteous ſhall appear in the ſhining robes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory, but thoſe that deſpis'd him upon earth, be condemn'd at his awful barr, and doom'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable miſery. In vain will Sinners fly from his almighty arm, and endeavour to eſcape his avenging wrath: Who can contend with offended omnipotence? or ſubſiſt under the terrors of his indignation? The Anger of the moſt enraged Tyrant can only affect the body, and is confin'd within the narrow limits of this Life; but the wrath of our almighty Judge extends to the whole man, accompanies the ſinner beyond the grave, and endures through eternal Ages. And as he has power to puniſh the wicked according to their deſerts, ſo he is able to reward the righteous according to their works: He has manſions of glory prepar'd for their everlaſting reception, and will beſtow upon them an happineſs, vaſt as their capacities, and immortal as their ſouls.mdash; Thus you ſee how excellently the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is qualified to be the final Judge of the world: His knowledge is infinite, and extends to the ſecret actions of men; his power is almighty, and none can reſiſt the execution of his will; his Juſtice is inflexible, and will be ſeen in impartially diſpenſing Rewards and Puniſhments. I proceed,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To Enquire into the Reaſons of this Divine Appointment,</hi> why this important Office is devolved upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is in compaſſion to the weakneſs and frailty of mankind.</hi>— With GOD is <hi>terrible Majeſty;</hi> He dwells in unſufferable Glory, and the ſpotleſs Spirits above vail their faces before his dazling Throne; ſuch is his unſpotted purity, that <hi>the heavens are not clean in his ſight, and he chargeth his angels with folly: The mountains tremble at his preſence, and the pillars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are aſtoniſh'd at his reproof.</hi> How then could the children of men ſupport the majeſty of his appearance,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004295_0041_1004114656B2E9C0"/>ſhould he deſcend in the naked terrors of the Deity, the unvailed Glories of the Divine Nature! God hath therefore compaſſionately ordain'd, that the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be adminſtred by one in our nature, <hi>who is bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, made in all things like unto us, only without ſin.</hi> And what can be more deſireable, than to appear before him <hi>whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from eternity has been with the ſons of men,</hi> and who ſhed his invaluable blood to redeem us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction; who is not only the Judge of the world, but the Saviour of men; who is acquainted with the weakneſs of human nature, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which we are expoſed; who will make the moſt favourable allowances for the frailties of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! This may convince us with what kindneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention and equity, this great tranſaction will be managed, and aſſures us that he will condemn only thoſe, who have obſtinately deſpis'd his Goodneſs, and defeated the endearing methods of his Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Son of Man is appointed to be the Judge of the world, <hi>as a ſuitable reward for his obedience and ſufferings.</hi> This Reaſon is expreſsly given by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Who was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men; and being found in faſhion as a man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs: wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, and every tongue ſhould confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> It was an amazing ſtoop, for the Son of God to be made in the Likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, to deſcend from a throne to a manger, from the government of the world to the ſtate of a ſervant, and to ſubmit to ſuch humbling circumſtances of poverty and diſgrace, and at laſt to ſuffer the Death of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004295_0042_10040FFC8C8FCE18"/>the Croſs, that he might advance the Glory of God, and procure the Salvation and Happineſs of man.— And what can be more reaſonable, than that he ſhould once more appear, to diſplay his <hi>glory as the only begotten of the Father,</hi> and convince the world how great and illuſtrious a perſon he is, <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh?</hi> What more ſuitable than that he who was rejected and deſpiſed of men, ſhould have power to ſummon at his awful barr all thoſe that inſulted and abuſed him, and puniſh them for the indignities they put upon him?</p>
            <p>At his firſt coming, his dignity was vailed by the meanneſs of his condition, and he appear'd without form or comlineſs: But is it juſt, that the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouſneſs ſhould always be cover'd with a cloud? Surely at his ſecond advent, every Reproach of Chriſt ſhall be wiped away, and he will ſhine in all the glories of an incarnate God. He was falſly accuſed by his malicious adverſaries, and unjuſtly arraign'd and condemn'd by the powers of the world: But the ſcene will be aſtoniſhingly changed, when the Kings and Judges of the Earth ſhall ſtand quivering before his tribunal, and receive an irreverſible ſentence from his mouth. Then every eye ſhall ſee him, not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a croud of inſulting ſcoffers, but attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an innumerable hoſt of adoring Angels; not engag'd in a bloody conteſt with the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but with all his enemies ſubdued under his feet; not hanging upon a diſgraceful Croſs, but ſeated upon a triumphant Throne, and encircled with a ſhining train of heavenly courtiers. The thorns that pierced his ſacred head, will be chang'd into a ſparkling crown of glory; the ſpear that wounded his ſide, into a ſceptre of authority and government. <hi>Judas</hi> that betray'd him, <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemn'd him, and all thoſe who in all ages of the world have deſpiſed and rejected him, ſhall be confounded at his preſence, and <hi>call to the mountains to cover them, and the rocks to hide them</hi> from his avenging juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:004295_0043_1004114E2D95EC00"/>
3. This appointment is deſign'd to <hi>inereaſe the viſible pomp and ſplendour of the future judgment.</hi> This great affair is to be tranſacted in a public and viſible manner, in the view of the whole world, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of the divine glory, and the manifeſtation of his perfections, in the condemnation of a guilty world, and the final reward of his People: God hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſely determined, that the laſt judgment ſhall be executed by a viſible perſon, in the ſight and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men. God the Father is inviſible: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, becauſe he is the Son of man;</hi> that every eye may ſee him, when he appears on the Throne of Judgment, and every ear may hear that righteous Sentence he will pronounce.— And how will it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the glory of that day, to ſee the Son of Man deſcending in the clouds of heaven, attended by the innumerable company of Angels, the noble army of martyrs, and the general aſſembly of the Church of the firſt born? How vaſt will be the majeſty and ſplendor of his appearance, when <hi>he ſhall come in his own glory and the glory of his Father,</hi> and ſhall ſit upon a radiant Throne high above all, encircled with the heavenly hoſts, ſhouting forth perpetual Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs! When all the apoſtate Angels, and the univerſal progeny of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhall ſtand before his preſence, and wait to receive their unalterable doom! With what aſtoniſhment ſhall we behold the Heavens paſs away as a ſcroll, the elements melt with fervent heat, and the beautiful fabrick of the world conſum'd by devouring flames? Could we but paint the glories of that day in their awful colours, and repreſent to our minds the pomp and ſolemnity, in which our Judge will deſcend, it would diſgrace all the ſplendid vanities of the world, and ſhew us how unworthy they are of our regard and attention; it would inſpire us with the higheſt reverence for the authority of him who is now our rightful Sovereign, and will hereafter
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004295_0044_100414DCD28B44C8"/>be our final Judge; and would influence us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour an exact and univerſal obedience to his Laws. Which brings me to the IMPROVEMENT of my Subject, and</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This evidences the Divinity of Chriſt, the great Judge of the world.</hi> To judge the world, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the ſupreme God, a Right inſeperable from the Crown of Heaven. Who can challenge ſuch a ſovereign authority, but he that made the world at firſt by his power, and preſerves it by his gracious providence? To whom ſhall we give an account of our behaviour, but to him who has given us theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable natures, and made us moral and accountable creatures? Juſtly then does the Prophet ſay, <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King,</hi> Iſa. 33.22.— From him is all inferior authority derived; <hi>by him Kings rule, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree juſtice.</hi>— And as He is the ſupreme Judge of the world, ſo no creature is capable to diſcharge this important office; for it requires infinite wiſdom to know the nature and circumſtances of our actions, and almighty power to puniſh rebellious Sinners.— What but the voice of God can awaken the dead, bring them out of their ſilent graves, and ſummon the whole world before his tremendous Judgment-ſeat?— Who but a divine Perſon can ſearch the hearts of men, and unfold the ſecret ſprings of their actions, from whence their malignity or goodneſs does principally ariſe?— Since then the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ordain'd to this glorious work, we may juſtly conclude, that he muſt be the great God, as well as the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This takes away the ſcandal of the Croſs, and ſhews that we have no Reaſon to take offence at the meanneſs and ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> Among all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that have been rais'd againſt the Goſpel, none has had a more fatal influence upon the bulk of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than the mean and deſpicable appearance of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004295_0045_100414E02A8DF390"/>great Author of our holy Religion, and the bitter and ignominious ſufferings that he underwent. <hi>A cruciſied Chriſt was to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs.</hi> They thought it the higheſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that the Son of God ſhould be delivered into the hands of men, and expire upon a ſhameful Croſs.— But the firm belief of this truth, that Chriſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the Judge of the quick and the dead, takes away the reproach of the Croſs, and removes the darkneſs and contempt that attended his ſuffering ſtate.— For this informs us, that his humility and ſufferings made way for his advancement and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and that he who was ſo ungratefully abuſed, and ſo unjuſtly condemn'd by the Princes of the earth, is now exalted to the Government of the world, and will ſhortly appear in dignity and power, to the Joy of his friends, and the terror and confuſion of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. — Let then the Infidels of the Age deſpiſe his perſon, and deride his ſufferings, we are not aſham'd to own, that we are the Diſciples of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour. <hi>God forbid, that we ſhould not glory in the Croſs of Chriſt!</hi> For our Redeemer is great, and greatly to be praiſed: God hath rais'd him up from the dead, and given him a name above every name. We now by faith behold him ſeated at the right hand of power, and encompaſs'd with the triumphant accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Heaven: but he will ſhortly rend the Heavens that now conceal his Glory, and appear <hi>in flaming fire to take vengeance on thoſe that know not God and obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> then ſhall his enemies bow before him, and lick the duſt of his feet; and the dignity of his character and office ſhall be manifeſt to the whole world of Angels and men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence <hi>the deſtruction of Goſpel-impenitents will be inevitable and intolerable.</hi> Men are apt to ſhelter themſelves from the terrors of the Law, by the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful promiſes of the Goſpel: They ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, tho' <hi>God is a conſuming fire, and wrath from
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004295_0046_100414E8F00F4C88"/>heaven is declar'd againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men,</hi> yet that the merits of Chriſt will ſcreen them from the flames of hell, and ſecure them a title to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory. But theſe are wild miſtakes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the whole deſign of the Goſpel. The bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> indeed is a merciful and compaſſionate. Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but yet he has denounced the ſevereſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt incorrigible finners; his merits will be imputed only to thoſe that accept of his offers, and ſubmit to his reaſonable demands; he will be <hi>the author of eternal Salvation</hi> only <hi>to thoſe that obey him.</hi> Such as bear the name and character of Chriſtians, and yet by their wicked lives conſute their profeſſion, and openly declare that they <hi>will not have this man to reign over them,</hi> will be ſo far from receiving any advantage by the name of Chriſt, that it will be an aggravation of their guilt, and an increaſe of their ſuture condemnation. The <hi>blood of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> which they have trampled under foot, will cry aloud for vengeance; and the condeſcending mercies of heaven which they have prophan'd and deſpis'd, will be turn'd into reſentment and fury. They reject the only remedy which infinite grace hath provided for their recovery; and therefore will fall unpitied facrifices to his avenging juſtice. He that now offers to be their compaſſionate Saviour, will then appear their inexorable Judge. The meek and innocent Lamb of God will then be arm'd with the terrors of a devouring Lion: and thoſe that would not bow to the ſceptre of his Grace, ſhall be broke to pieces with the rod of his Anger. Their doom will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd by him who was once the meſſenger of divine Grace, and made them the moſt friendly offers of mercy. This will doubtleſs give the bittereſt accent to their miſery, and fill them with the utmoſt conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and horror. How highly therefore does it become us now to ſecure an Intereſt in his Favour, that ſo he who will be our Judge, may alſo be our Friend!
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004295_0047_100414EBAB558D38"/>How reaſonable is that advice of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed are they that put their truſt in him.</hi> Which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence we ſee <hi>the certainty of the believer's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and eternal Salvation.</hi>— When we confider the unſpotted holineſs of our Judge, before whom the Angels ſtand chargeable with folly, and the heavens with impurity; when we reflect upon the corruption of our natures, and the innumerable imperfections that attend us; the beſt of men may tremble at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a future Judgment, and ſtand amaz'd at the thought of having their eternal ſtate determin'd by ſo righteous and impartial a Judge: For if he ſhould be ſtrict to mark iniquity, who could ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him! Verily every mouth muſt be ſtop'd, every tongue muſt confeſs their guilt, and own themſelves worthy of eternal damnation.— But, bleſſed be God, the Goſpel affords the true believer a ſolid foundation of hope, under all theſe affrighting conſiderations; thoſe that have by faith ſecur'd an intereſt in Chriſt, and made it the ſincere endeavour of their lives to approve themſelves to his all-ſeeing eye, ſhall eſcape that dreadful Sentence that will be pronounc'd upon an impenitent world. For he whom they accepted as their Saviour, is appointed to be their Judge; they have reſign'd themſelves to his almighty and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate hands, and he has engag'd to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and eternal deliverer. He will therefore ſave them from the dark horrors of the grave, and the amazing terrors of the laſt day, and put them in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Kingdom he has prepar'd for them. He has bought them out of the hands of Judge by his atoning blood, and purchas'd for them a title to the manſions of Glory by his invaluable merits. Surely then he will not ſuffer the ends of his death to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, nor the ſacred purchaſe of his blood to miſcarry.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004295_0048_100414F0694D3630"/>We may be aſſur'd he has not forgot the diſtreſſing ſorrows of his life, nor the dreadful agonies of his Croſs.— That Love that nailed him to the curſed tree, and brought him down to the duſt of death, for the redemption of his People; will excite him to take care of their welfare, and finiſh the work he has begun.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Infidels</hi> tremble at the approach of their Judge, who have out-fin'd his infinite mercy, and denied their God and Saviour: <hi>Let fearfulneſs ſeize the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and horror ſurprize the ſinners in Zion,</hi> who are enemies to Chriſt, under the diſguiſe of a viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.— But let the <hi>Saints in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> liſt up their heads with Joy, and long for the coming of their Lord. When he ſays by the Spirit to his Churches, <hi>Behold I come quickly,</hi> let our Souls eccho back with the loudeſt tranſports of Joy, <hi>Even ſo come, Lord Jeſus!</hi>

                  <p>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels; and then he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every Man according to his Works.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE diſpenſation of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is admirably calculated to reclaim a ſinful world from the paths of error and deluſion; and to perſwade the children of men to conſult their duty and happineſs: Its <hi>doctrines</hi> are ſublime and excellent, worthy of their heavenly deſcent, and come recommended to our faith by the brighteſt evidences of a divine authority: Its <hi>precepts</hi> contain the nobleſt rules for our moral conduct, and are happily deſign'd to exalt and purify the nature of man, and advance the univerſal proſperity of the world.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are at preſent in a corrupt and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate, diſinclin'd to our duty, and indeed filled with prejudices againſt it; therefore the wiſe Author of our Beings hath ſeen fit to enforce his laws by ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>ſanctions,</hi> and engage us to obedience by the moſt powerful and perſwaſive <hi>arguments.</hi> Hence in the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004295_0050_100414FC84CE3980"/>Goſpel there every where appears the greateſt ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſſwade us from ſin, and the higheſt condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and goodneſs to allure us to holineſs.</p>
            <p>The Eternal Majeſty of heaven is ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the amazing terrors of his <hi>wrath,</hi> as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire to the workers of iniquity; at other times he appears in the bright diſplays of his <hi>mercy,</hi> as a tender and indulgent father to thoſe that ſerve and obey him: And the great <hi>Saviour</hi> of Souls is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as one who <hi>dy'd a ſacrifice</hi> for the ſins of the world, and compaſſionately invites the children of men to come to him that <hi>they may have life;</hi> but will ſhortly <hi>appear in flaming fire to take vengeance on thoſe that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe different repreſentations are wonderfully ſuited to influence the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of men, the two great ruling paſſions of our nature, and the ſecret ſprings of our actions; and have an happy tendency to deter us from all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs, which lead to deſtruction and miſery, and to engage us to a ſtedfaſt adherence to our duty, which is the way to immortality and glory. Our bleſſed Saviour having therefore urged upon his diſciples the neceſſity of <hi>denying themſelves, taking up their croſs, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him,</hi> their Lord and Maſter, in humility and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, enforces all with this awful conſideration, <hi>That the Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then be ſhall reward every man according to his works.</hi> In ſpeaking to which words (by divine aſſiſtance) I ſhall

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I am to conſider <hi>the Manner of Chriſt's ſecond Appearance.</hi>—When he firſt left the manſions of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004295_0051_100415008AE57590"/>glory, and deſcended into this lower world, he came in a ſtate of humility and meanneſs, and ſtoop'd to numberleſs hardſhips and difficulties, that he might anſwer the deſign of his manifeſtation in the fleſh, and accompliſh the great work of redemption. But his ſecond advent will be with ſurpriſing majeſty and glory, to execute vengeance upon the ungodly, and vindicate the cauſe of his deſpiſed Goſpel.</p>
            <p>When God came down upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the law to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the glory of the Lord appear'd like devouring fire, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was covered with darkneſs and ſmoke. So ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible was the ſight, that <hi>Moſes</hi> the friend of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fear'd and quak'd; the whole army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſtruck with amazement, and cry'd out in diſtreſs, <hi>Let not God ſpeak with us, leſt we die.</hi>—If ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing terrors attended the firſt promulgation of the law, with what awful ſolemnity will the Lawgiver appear, when he comes to <hi>avenge the quarrel of his covenant,</hi> and puniſh the profane contempt of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</p>
            <p>The Scriptures repreſent this awful event in the moſt lofty and magnificent language. Amazing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies will uſher in this illuſtrious day, and proclaim the deſcent of our almighty Judge; continual trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will be acted on the great ſtage of nature, and this lower world will be involved in univerſal confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſorder;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.7.</note> 
               <hi>the Sun ſhall be turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Moon into blood; the Stars of heaven</hi> ſhall ſtart from their exalted orbs, <hi>and the powers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall be ſhaken;</hi> perpetual thunders ſhall roar from the lower regions of the air, <hi>the earth ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake, and the foundations of the hills ſhall be removed.</hi>—Then ſhall appear <hi>the ſign of the Son of Man in the heavens</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30.</note>, and give the world a convincing evidence of the near approach of the great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004295_0052_10041506346AD6A8"/>day of the Lord. At which amazing ſight, the inhabitants of the earth ſhall mourn, and the ſinners in <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall be horribly afraid.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of their perplexity and diſtreſs, <hi>the Son of Man ſhall deſcend in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</hi> He will appear in the pomp and ſolemnity of an incarnate God, and aſſume a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and magnificence ſuitable to the dignity of his office.</p>
            <p>His <hi>perſonal</hi> glory will be inexpreſſibly great, his eyes will ſparkle like flames of fire, his countenance will ſhine with dazling beams of majeſty and beauty, and his whole body be bright and luminous beyond the Sun in its meridian ſplendor. Thus he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the Viſions of St. <hi>John, In the midſt of the ſeven candleſticks was one like the Son of Man, his head and his hair were white as wool, as white as ſnow, his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his countenance was as the Sun ſhining in its ſtrength</hi>

                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13, 14.</note>.</p>
            <p>He will alſo come in the glory of his heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> and be clothed with the authority of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Judge of the world. God has appointed him <hi>King upon his holy Zion,</hi> and proclaim'd an unalterable decree, that <hi>to him every knee ſhall how;</hi> not in ſcorn and deriſion, as in the days of his infirmity and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but with the deepeſt humility and reverence; and <hi>every tongue ſhall conſeſs</hi> his royal dignity and power, not with an inſulting ſcoff, but in ſubmiſſive poſtures of adoration.</p>
            <p>But to increaſe the glory of his appearance, he will be attended with a ſplendid and numerous <hi>equipage,</hi> becoming the dignity of his perſon, and the exalted character he ſuſtains. The innumerable hoſt of <hi>Angels</hi> ſhall leave the manſions of heaven, and attend their deſcending Lord, to obey his ſovereign orders, and adorn the triumphs of his juſtice. The general aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004295_0053_10041507C530C7F8"/>of the <hi>Saints,</hi> whom he hath redeem'd by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable blood, and ſanctified by his all-conquering grace, ſhall forſake the celeſtial paradiſe, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the great God our Saviour, in his illuſtrious progreſs through the ſkies. Thus the Patriarch <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied of old;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 14.15.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgment on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> aſſures us,<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10.</note> 
               <hi>that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands ſhall miniſter unto him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand ſhall ſtand before him.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>that he ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angles.</hi> Thoſe ſpotleſs Spirit ſhall be clothed in their brighteſt robes of glory, and appear in viſible ſplendor to the inhabitants of the earth. And how vaſt and ſurpriſing a figure will they make? How awful and majeſtic will be the appearance of our Judge, when he ſhall aſſume his own proper greatneſs, and be attended with the ſhining inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of heaven? Who may abide the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or be able to ſtand before his awful tribunal? How will all nations fall proſtrate at his footſtool, and tremble at his preſence, who can by a word of his mouth ſentence them to the depths of miſery, or advance them to the height of glory and happineſs? Which brings me to the other thing propoſed:</p>
            <p>Secondly, To conſider the <hi>Work</hi> that he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. <hi>Then ſhall he reward every Man according to his works:</hi> And this includes three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. All mankind ſhall be <hi>ſummon'd</hi> before him.</item>
               <item>2. They ſhall be called to a ſtrict <hi>account</hi> for their actions.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>righteous</hi> ſhall be adjudg'd to unalterable <hi>glory,</hi> but the <hi>wicked</hi> condemn'd to eternal <hi>miſery.</hi>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All mankind ſhall be ſummon'd before him.</hi> No ſooner ſhall the Judge deſcend to this lower world,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004295_0054_1004101A8E4B64B0"/>and erect his throne in the Air, but they that are in their graves ſhall be awakned out of the ſleep of death, and all the inhabitants of the world be cited to appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt. The voice of the Archangel, the chief of the heavenly hoſt ſhall eccho through the wide creation, and penetrate into the ſecret caverns of the earth; at which mighty found the <hi>dead</hi> ſhall ſtart out of their duſty beds, and all the deſcendants of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be compelled to obey the call; thoſe that are <hi>alive</hi> ſhall be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately chang'd, and prepar'd to make their perſonal appearance at the bar of their Judge. Thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſſure us: <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of Chriſt. Every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf unto God.</hi> The univerſal Father of men <hi>without reſpect of perſons judgeth every man according to his work.

            </p>
            <p>Civil diſtinctions make a mighty ſound among men, and perſons of ſuperior wealth and power are admired and applauded like ſo many Deities, by their ſervile flatterers: hence they are apt to ſwell with pride, upon the account of their elevated circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vainly hope that they ſhall be treated with deference and reſpect at the future judgment; they flatter themſelves that God will not be <hi>ſtrict to mark iniquity</hi> in men of their dignity and ſtation, but that he will make ſome favourable allowances for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and follies which are ſo common among men of figure and eſtate in the world.—But alas! theſe are vain imaginations: the ſovereign Ruler of the world pays no regard to earthly greatneſs, neither has he any value for thoſe diſtinctions, which are made by birth and eſtate. The great Potentates of the earth; who are cry'd up as gods by deluded mortals, are in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004295_0055_10041511BA0706B8"/>his ſight but contemptible worms of the duſt. In that day they will be diveſted of all their ſtately orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, depriv'd of the enſigns of their greatneſs and power, and ſtand upon a level with the meaneſt ſlave. Death, the univerſal Conqueror, pays no complements to their quality, but arreſts them without ceremony or reſpect: and their impartial Judge will irreſiſtibly ſummon them to his tremendous bar. The mighty <hi>Coeſars</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who have depopulated the earth by their deſtructive ſwords, and ſacrificed nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their unbounded luſts, ſhall tremble at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and curſe their ambition and madneſs. Thus this aſtoniſhing ſcene is repreſented by St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, hid themſelves in the dens and rocks of the mountains, and ſaid to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come: and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as none are too great and mighty to be called to an account, ſo none are too mean and contemptible to be taken notice of. They that have made no figure among men, but have ſpent their days in want and obſcurity, will not be overlook'd in this vaſt aſſembly, but ſtrictly examined, whether they have ſubmitted to the wiſe diſpoſals of providence, and improv'd the talents committed to their truſt. Thoſe that are in the morning of their Youth and in the ſtrength and vigour of their age, ſhall be brought into judgment for their unmindfulneſs of their great Creator, and their criminal indulgence of ſenſual pleaſures. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant uninſtructed heathens, who have inhabited the wild and deſolate corners of the earth, ſhall be called to an account, for their tranſgreſſion of the law of nature, and their abuſe of the divine goodneſs. The

Such as will not now approach the throne of divine mercy, muſt then appear at the bar of inflexible Juſtice. Thus all mankind of every nation and language, of every quality and condition, of every age and ſex, muſt be judg'd in the great day, What a grand and ſolemn ſight will this be! To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the ſucceſſive generations of men ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their reſpective orders, and wait for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive trial!

            </p>
            <p>I paſs now to the IMPROVEMENT of my Subject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we have heard ſhould be improv'd as <hi>a powerful reſtraint from the practice of ſecret ſins.</hi> For what can be an higher abſurdity, than for men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves in ſin when they have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of privacy and retirement, and to imagine that they are ſafe from puniſhment, if the curtains of night, or any artful diſguiſes hide their wicked actions from the view and obſervation of men? Alas! what will it avail you to conceal your wickedneſs from the eyes of men, when your moſt ſecret actions are viſible to the God with whom you have to do? What little advantage will you receive by avoiding worldly ſhame and puniſhment, when your ſecret enormities will ſhortly be brought upon the public ſtage, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in their moſt odious colours, to your eternal confuſion? Tho' now you cover your tranſgreſſions as <hi>Adam,</hi> and hide your iniquities in your boſom; yet there is nothing ſo ſecretly committed, but it ſhall then be brought to light, and expos'd before the vaſt and numerous aſſembly of Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>The firm belief of this awful truth would break the force of many temptations, and be an happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from defiling ſins; it would make us reject with abhorrence the inſinuating charms of vice, and ſay with holy <hi>Joſeph; How can I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and ſin againſt God!</hi>

2. This ſhew us <hi>the vanity of bypocriſy.</hi> For the eyes of our Judge are as flaming fire, and penetrate into the hidden corners of our ſouls. In the day of Judgment every maſk ſhall be pull'd off, every flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering diſguiſe ſhall be remov'd, and the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed. Why then will you put on a form of Godlineſs, and engage in external acts of devotion, only to be ſeen of men, and gain the empty applauſe of your fellow creatures; when your eternal ſtate will be decided, not by the charitable opinion of ſhort-ſighted mortals, but by the unerring Sentence of an all-ſeeing God! Be not deceived; Chriſt is not to be mock'd. He ſees the pride and hypocriſy of the painted phariſee, under the moſt amiable and goodly appearance. He beholds the ſordid flattery of falſe and noiſy profeſſors, who bow the knee before him with ſeeming humility and devotion, while their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are wedded to the world, and their lives are ſtain'd with abominable impurities. This therefore ſhould excite us all to the greateſt ſincerity in our profeſſion, to be faithful to our ſolemn vows and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, that we may be found the diſciples of Chriſt, not only in outward appearance, but in the inward temper and diſpoſition of our minds: ſo we ſhall have this for our rejoicing, even the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How much does it concern us to <hi>hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith, in the midſt of the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and diſcouragements?</hi> We live in a dark day of error and apoſtacy; in which the diſtinguiſhing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel are publickly reviled and inſulted, by men of corrupt principles and licentious morals. Weak and unſtable minds are in danger of being carried away, by the prevailing torrent of infidelity. It is therefore our indiſpenſable duty to maintain our ſacred profeſſion, in this dangerous hour of temptation, and vigorouſly to defend <hi>the faith once delivered to the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004295_0062_10041530A29725F8"/>Saints,</hi> even in the face of its boldeſt oppoſers. For our bleſſed Saviour has made thoſe declarations;<note n="*" place="bottom">

But whoſoever ſhall be aſham'd of me, or of my words, of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſham'd, when he comes in the glory of his Father, with his holy Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then we betray the ſacred depoſitum committed to our truſt, through covetouſneſs or cowardiſe; if we corrupt the purity of the Goſpel, through a ſinful compliance with the humours of the age: What can we expect, but that our Maſter and Judge will treat us with contempt and abhorrence, and herd us among his abandon'd enemies! This thought ſhould inſpire us with undaunted courage in the cauſe of Chriſt, and arm us with a noble reſolution to ſubmit to the greateſt hardſhips and difficulties, rather than make ſhipwreck of our faith and a good conſcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We ſhould conſtantly bear in mind the ſtrictneſs of our future account, and live as thoſe that expect to be judged.</hi> If the actions of our lives were tranſient, and there were no remembrance of them hereafter; if death put a final period to our being, and we were never to be called to an account for the things done in the body; we might then give a looſe to our ſenſual inclinations, and <hi>eat and drink</hi> without thought or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, <hi>for to morrow we die.</hi> But ſince we are candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for immortality, and our final ſtate will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to our preſent behaviour, it infinitely concerns us, if we have any true love to our ſelves, any regard to our great and everlaſting intereſt, to keep a future judgement perpetually in our view; to conſider, that every action of life will be ſcann'd with an impartial ſeverity, and an unalterable ſentence will paſs, according to our works.</p>

            <p>This indeed is an harſh and ungrateful ſubject, to the greateſt part of mankind; they are ſo involv'd in ſecular buſineſs, ſo ſolicitous to increaſe their eſtates and raiſe their families, that they have no time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the one thing needful, and prepare for an eternal judgment: therefore they baniſh the thought of it out of their minds, leſt it ſhould give a check to their ambitious views, and interrupt their worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But conſider, I beſeech you; thoſe things which you now ſo paſſionately doat on, and for which you ſacrifice your eternal All, will not profit you in the day of wrath; they will not appeaſe a ſtormy conſcience, nor bribe your impartial Judge.—What confort or ſatisfaction will it then afford you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that you have had a diſtinguiſh'd name among flattering mortals, that you have been rank'd among the great men of the earth, and have been honour'd
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004295_0064_1004153C0CD9A858"/>with a ſplendid paſſage to the grave?—Will any of theſe ſerve to procure you a favourable ſentence at the tribunal of heaven, or ſcreen you from the avenging wrath of an offended God, or even abate your puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſorrow in the day of <hi>perdition of ungodly men?</hi>—No verily! nothing will then ſupport and ſolace you, but the teſtimony of an unreproaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the ſmiles of your almighty Saviour, a title to his invaluable merits, and to the great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of his everlaſting Goſpel.</p>

            <p>OF all the affairs, that employ the time and captivate the affections of the children of men, none ſo juſtly deſerve our attention and concern, as a preparation for that awful day, when we muſt ſtand before the impartial bar of Chriſt, and give an account of the things done in the body. This ſhould be the work of our early Years, and engage the ſtrength and vigour of our manly age; but alas! it is commonly delay'd to the dark evening of life, 'till the melancholy decays of nature warn us of our approaching end.</p>
            <p>The ſpecious vanities and triſles of the world divert unthinking ſinners from a ſerious application to the one thing needful; they flatter themſelves, that <hi>the viſion is for many days,</hi> and they ſhall have time enough hereafter to ſecure the favour of their Judge.</p>
            <p>The deluge of waters broke in upon the old world in the height of their ſecurity, <hi>whilſt they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004295_0066_100415478F3D0428"/>diſpatch'd them in a moment into irrecoverable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: and this preſent earth, which is reſerv'd for the fire of the laſt day, ſhall be deſtroy'd in as ſudden and irreſiſtible a manner. <hi>As it was in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>ſo ſhall it be in the days of the Son of Man.</hi> When the world is drown'd in ſin and ſecurity, and dream of nothing but <hi>peace and ſafety, then ſhall ſudden deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come upon them, as travail upon a woman with child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore our bleſſed Saviour exhorts his diſciples to continual watchfulneſs and diligence. <hi>Take heed, left at any time your hearts be overcharg'd with ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares; for as a ſnare will it come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth</hi>

And every wiſe conſiderate man will receive the ſolemn caution, and avoid the danger of a ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: Now this can only be done by making it the great buſineſs of Life to prepare for the coming of our Lord.

Firſt. <hi>I ſhall conſider what is requir'd of us, that we may be accepted of the Lord in the day of Judgment.</hi> The caſe is practical, and deſerves our cloſe and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attention. I ſhall only inſiſt on a few general and comprehenſive articles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt by faith ſecure a title to the Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi> We are all by nature involv'd in the guilt of ſin, expos'd to the condemning ſentence of the law, and in danger of ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire; the holieſt of men are encompaſs'd with innumerable imperfections, and their beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are defiled with ſo many blemiſhes, that ſhould God be ſtrict to mark iniquity, who could ſtand the fiery trial, and appear with ſafety at the inlightned tribunal of heaven? Hence the humble Pſalmiſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently deprecates the ſtrict inquiry of juſtice; <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, O Lord! for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi> And the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tho' among the chief of Saints, and an eminent Apoſtle, renounces all confidence in himſelf, and <hi>counts all things but loſs, that he may be found in Chriſt, not having on his own righteouſneſs which is of the law, but that which is through faith in him</hi>

            <p>Now if ever we would be acquitted at the bar of God, and obtain the favour of our impartial Judge, we muſt plead, <hi>not any works of righteouſneſs that we have done,</hi> but the meritorious obedience and ſufferings of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>

And that we may have a title to his invaluable merits, we muſt by faith accept of him as our only Saviour, and acknowledge him as our ſovereign Lord and Owner, with an entire dependance on his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient ſacrifice, and an unfeigned deſire to obey his excellent precepts; <hi>for he is a Prieſt upon a throne, a Prince as well as a Saviour:</hi> And none will be ſav'd by the merits of his blood, but thoſe that ſubmit to the ſceptre of his government.— And happy are they who thus by faith receive him upon the terms of the Goſpel; for they are deliver'd from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſentence of the law, and may approach the ſacred tribunal of Juſtice with an humble confidence of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and acceptance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our natures muſt be ſanctified by the almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit, and renew'd after the image of the bleſſed God.</hi> Man by nature is not only involv'd in chains of guilt, but ſunk into the moſt deplorable ſtate of deformity and pollution; his underſtanding is darkned by clouds of error and ignorance, and filled with mighty prejudices againſt the divine and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural myſteries of the Goſpel: His will is ſtubborn and refractory, impatient of the yoke of God's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and inclin'd to continual rebellion againſt him: His affections are captivated to the dominion and tyranny of ſin, and plac'd upon the moſt degrading and inferiour objects: In ſhort, the whole man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly alienated from the life and ſervice of God, and ſtrongly diſpos'd to the moſt abominable evils.— This is the unhappy charcter of man in a ſtate of unregenerate Nature— Hence ariſes the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale neceſſity of an holy change, to qualify us for the acceptable ſevice of God upon earth, and prepare us for the ineffable glories of heaven.— The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſstanding muſt be illuminated by the Spirit of God, to believe the certainty and excellency of things unſeen and eternal, to perceive the beauty of holineſs, and the equity and reaſonableneſs of the divine command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004295_0069_10041555C049DE28"/>The native enmity of the ſinner's heart muſt be ſubdu'd, and every faculty of the ſoul brought under a conſection to the ſervice of God.— Till this mighty change is produc'd, the ſinner <hi>is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and his moſt perfect ſervices are a ſtench and abhorrence in the noſtrils of an holy God; and therefore he has nothing elſe to expect, but the awful frowns of his incenſed judge, and the diſtreſſing thunders of his avenging wrath.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity, the heavens are not clean in his ſight, and his angels he chargeth with folly.</hi> None will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and accepted by him, in the great day of Judgment, but ſuch as bear the impreſſion of the divine image, who cleanſe themſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and are perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord. Without this inward puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the moſt bright and diſtinguiſh'd profeſſion among men will be diſapprov'd and condemn'd by our all-ſeeing Judge. Others indeed may have a name in the church upon earth, and paſs for eminent Saints in the ſight of the world; but they will be excluded the Sanctuary above, and rank'd among the workers of iniquity, in the day of their deciſive trial.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſincere and impartial regard to the law of God is neceſſary to final acceptance with our judge.</hi> Many that boaſt of an high profeſſion, and vainly triumph in their Goſpel-privileges, are hypocritical in their pretences, and partial in their obedience to the laws of Chriſt.— With the ancient <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they are ſtrict in their attendance upon the divine worſhip, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly attach'd to the outward formalities of Religion; but unjuſt and oppreſſive in their dealings, carnal and covetous in their converſations.— While others build their hopes upon a moral and inoffenſive behaviour towards men, tho' they are ſadly negligent of their obligations to God, and live in an avow'd contempt
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004295_0070_1004155BFA46F5E8"/>of his worſhip and ordinances.— A third ſort calculate their Religion for the public view, and make a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſble appearance in the Temple, but are ſtrangers to the devotions of the Cloſet; they liberally diſpenſe their alms, when the found of a trumpet proclaims their charity, but are ſordidly ſparing when there is no proſpect of gratifying a vain-glorious humour; they are zealous for the Kingdom of Chriſt, when it will advance their honour and intereſt, but are cold and indifferent when the great doctrines of Goſpel are fallen under reproach, and boidly aſſaulted by men of figure and eſtate.</p>
            <p>By ſuch hypocritical pretences as theſe, multitudes lull themſelves into ſecurity, and vainly imagine to obtain the favour of God. But alas! his all-ſeeing eye pierces through every diſguiſe, and marks out the painted formaliſt, how cautiouſly ſsoever he may be concealed. A partial obedience to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands will not ſtand the trial of an enlightned conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon earth, nor be approv'd by the unerring verdict of heaven. <hi>If our hearts condemn us</hi> of any ſecret and indulg'd iniquity, <hi>God is greater than our hearts and knoweth all things: but if our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence towards God,</hi> and may hope for the divine acceptance. 1 Joh. 3.20, 21.</p>
            <p>If therefore we would enjoy the teſtimony of an unreproaching conſcience, and receive the euge of our Judge, we muſt have a ſacred reſpect to every duty, without exception or reſerve; and be the ſame in the ſecret cloſet, when no Eye but that of God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is upon us, as when we ſtand upon the open theatre of the world, and are encompaſs'd with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes. We muſt bear an univerſal hatred to ſin, tho' dear unto us as a right hand and a right eye; and particularly watch and ſtrive againſt thoſe darling ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, which the conſtitution of our bodies, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our minds, and our company and buſineſs moſt ſtrongly incline us to the commiſſion of. In fine,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004295_0071_1004155EF530F180"/>we muſt not only pay a ſtrict regard to the important duties of piety towards God, but inviolably obſerve the ſacred rules of juſtice and charity to men. This will afford us a divine ſupport in the darkeſt hours of diſtreſs, and enable us to ſay with the inſpir'd Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t;e, <hi>Our rehoicing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A frequent Review of our lives and actions, and a judging our ſelves for our ſins,</hi> is an happy preparative for the great day of trial. It is the wiſdom of perſons engag'd in worldly buſineſs, frequently to ſurvey their accounts, and enquire into the ſtate of their affairs: And it is equally incumbent on the children of light, to examine into the ſtate of their ſouls, that they may know what duties they have omitted, what ſins they have been guilty of, and what progreſs they have made in the chriſtian courſe.— While we tabernacle in fleſh, and are ſurrounded with ſo many inſnaring objects, the beſt of men will be ſometimes ſurpriſed into ſin through the remaining corruption of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or overborn by the ſtrength and violence of temptations.— It is therefore highly neceſſary that we frequently review our conduct, and compare it with the law of God, the unerring rule of our duty; that ſo we may be acquainted with our errors and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages. — This will awaken our repentance for our daily offences, and engage us to a fervent appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the blood of Chriſt for pardon, <hi>that fountain which is ſet open for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi>— This will inſpire us with unfeign'd reſolutions of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and excite our care and vigilance to avoid thoſe ſins for which we have ſo ſeverely judg'd and condemn'd our ſelves.— And this has a bleſſed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to deep our conſciences clear from indulg'd iniquities, and to prevent that awful ſurpriſe, that muſt ſeize the impenitent ſinner, when the midnight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004295_0072_100415623719AEB0"/>ſhall awaken him out of his ſecurity, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon him to the tremendous judgment-ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What an unſpeakable happineſs will it then be, to have our conſcience puriſied from defiling ſins, and all breaches made up between God and our ſouls!mdash; Such may hear the ſound of the laſt trumpet with calmneſs and ſerenity of mind, and ſtand ſecure amidſt the ſhocks of a diſſolving world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Continual Meditation upon the certainty and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a future Judgment,</hi> is an excellent means to engage us to a ſerious preparation for it. There's nothing more highly deſerves our ſerious and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive regards, and yet nothing that unthinking ſinners ſo induſtriouſly baniſh out of their minds. What ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of equal importance, can employ our thoughts and engage our attention, as this great and illuſtrious event? Which will unfold the myſteries of divine providence, clear up the difficulties of his government, and diſplay the perfections of the Deity in their brighteſt glories.—What are all the dazling tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of the mighty Princes and Generals of the Earth, but childiſh and deſpicable trifles, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the pompous deſcent of our almighty Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, attended with the ſhining equipage of heaven!— If now we are affected with the appearance of an earthly Judge, attended with the miniſters of juſtice, to enforce the execution of the law, is it not infinitely more reaſonable to employ our thoughts upon that vaſt and moſt affecting ſcene, in which all the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall ſtand before the throne of God, and receive an irrevocable ſentence of happineſs, or miſery, according to their works!—Eſpecially if we conſider, that we are all deeply concern'd in this great tranſaction, and muſt bear a part in the joys and triumphs, or in the fears and terrors of that awful day. The neglect of this great duty is one cauſe of the general impiety and wickedneſs of the world, and makes them preſumptuous and ſecure in the midſt of amazing dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:004295_0073_1004105537E4FD90"/>
We ſhould therefore call off our thoughts from the contemptible vanities of time and ſenſe, fix them upon a future Judgment, and conſider its important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that ſo we may be quickned to prepare for that great and terrible day of the Lord.—I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Why it ſhould be the great Study and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of every Chriſtian to prepare for the day of Judgment,</hi> and that he may then be accepted of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a work of the greateſt <hi>difficulty,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the utmoſt <hi>ſelf-denial, reſolution,</hi> and <hi>diligence.</hi> This our Maſter and Judge hath warn'd his followers of; that they might not pleaſe themſelves with vain dreams of carnal eaſe and pleaſure in the way to the Kingdom, but might be prepar'd to encounter the hardſhips that attend the chriſtian life. He hath aſſured us, that <hi>the kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force:</hi> He hath commanded us <hi>to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many will ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mattl. 11.22. Luk. 13.24.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Duties enjoyn'd upon us, are contrary to the corrupt inclinations of fleſh and blood, and require the deepeſt mortification and ſelf-denial. The carnal mind is enmity to God, impatient of reſtraint, and madly bent upon thoſe ways that lead to deſtruction and ruin.—And what can be a greater difficulty, than to offer violence to our depraved natures, to ſubdue our darling luits, and maintain a continual war againſt our ſelves?</p>
            <p>And the difficulty is greatly increaſed, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal impediments that attend us. Satan, the grand adverſary of ſouls, ſhoots his invenom'd arrows, on every ſide, to wound and deſtroy us, and uſes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand unobſerv'd and politic ſtratagems to entice us
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004295_0074_1004156DDF9E6410"/>from God and our Duty. The men of the world will revile and perſecute us for our fidelity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the diſcharge of our duty, and practiſe the moſt deſtructive Methods to corrupt and defile us. And is it not a laborious taſk to withſtand the rage of earth and hell, to reſiſt the infection of evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſtem the tide of a degenerate age?— Is it not difficult to oppoſe the ſoft enchantments of vice, and eſcape the corruption that is in the world thro' luſt? What manly courage and reſolution is required, to ſubdue the inveterate habits of vice, to conquer our native indiſpoſition to holineſs, and to bear up againſt the ſubtle inſinuations and violent aſſaults of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Now this muſt be done by every one that would be faithful to the cauſe of Chriſt, and obtain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his Judge. Therefore we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>not to be ſiothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 12.11</note>: and are exhorted <hi>to give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1.10.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Life</hi> is the <hi>only ſeaſon</hi> allotted for this great work. The foundation of our future happineſs muſt be laid in this world, if ever we expect to receive the reward of future glory. We muſt now ſow the feeds of righteouſneſs, if we would rejoice in a plentiful harveſt at the reſurrection of the juſt. The divine life muſt be begun upon earth, that ſo it may receive its laſt and finiſhing ſtroke of beauty and perfection in heaven. Now we muſt ariſe from the death of ſin, and follow Chriſt in the regeneration: and then we ſhall hereafter riſe unto Glory, <hi>and be accounted worthy to ſtand before the Son of Man, in the day of his appearance and kingdom.</hi> This is the time of trial, in which we muſt engage in the chriſtian warfare, <hi>fight the good fight, and continue faithful unto death,</hi> that in the day of Judgment we may give up our account with joy, and receive a crown of Life. For
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004295_0075_1004105B2214EA20"/>in that day the rewards and puniſhments will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed according to our preſent ſpirit and behaviour; and the ſentence that ſhall be paſs'd, will be final and irreverſible. No appeal can be made from this high tribunal; no review can be obtain'd in the court of heaven; the Judge will then be inexorable, and the ſtate of all mankind unalterable. Which leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If <hi>death</hi> ſurpriſe us in an <hi>unprepar'd</hi> eſtate, the day of <hi>Judgment</hi> will be a day of inconceivable <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>amazement.</hi> Unutterable anguiſh and diſtreſs will ſeize upon impenitent ſinners, when they ſhall <hi>ſee him whom they have pierced,</hi> and remember the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable indignities they have thrown upon him. They will no longer be able to drown the voice of conſcience in floods of wine, nor drive away their melancholy thoughts with muſick and dancing, with gaiety and entertainment. The Principles of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which are now ſo greedily imbib'd, againſt the repeated admonitions of conſcience and to the reproach of human nature, will then afford but a poor and feeble ſupport. Unbelievers will receive a terrible convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the great doctrines of the Goſpel are not the dreams of enthuſiaſm,, nor the ſubtle inventions of the deſigning Prieſt and the crafty Politician. They will find by ſad experience, that <hi>God is not to be mock'd,</hi> that his wrath is not to be trifled with, nor the methods of his grace to be inſulted and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phem'd.</p>
            <p>What excuſe will they plead for their inſolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of Heaven, their ſtupid neglect of the invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offers of a Saviour, their obſtinate continuance in ſin, in oppoſition to the convictions and ſtrivings of the holy Spirit?— What defence will they make for their contempt of their baptiſinal vows, and their preferring the pomps and vanities of this world, to the favour of God, and the ineffable joys of his prefence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:004295_0076_10041576701090C0"/>
How will their countenances be appal'd, and their ſouls filled with terror, when they ſhall ſee their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Judge, whoſe authority they have deſpiſed, whoſe laws they have diſobey'd, and whoſe merits they have blaſphem'd, deſcending in the clouds of heaven, attended with the dreadful artillery of his wrath, to vindicate the authority of his laws, and puniſh the contempt of his government!— What confuſion and horror will ſurprize them, when they meet with their ſinful and defiled bodies, the ancient partners of their wickedneſs, which have been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable inſtruments of their profaneneſs and impiety, their oppreſſion and cruelty, their riot and debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!— With what weeping eyes, aſtoniſh'd counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and trembling hearts, will they ſtand before the tribunal of Chriſt, when their ſecret impurities, their hypocritical diſguiſes, their lewd and wicked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhall be publickly detected and expoſed, to the contempt and abhorrence of the congregation of the righteous!—What diſtreſſing agonies and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt ſeize them, when they ſhall be condemn'd in the day of trial, and their incenſed Lord ſhall paſs that unalterable ſentence upon them, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels!</hi>— If the ſentence of an earthly judge is ſo much to be dreaded, and excites in a condemn'd criminal ſuch bitter lamentations, how inconceivably more terrible will be the final determination of our eternal Judge, which condemns the wicked to endleſs and intolerable miſery!— With what vehemence and importunity will they lift up their cries for that mercy, which now they affront and deſpiſe! But alas! their righteous Judge will then be deaf to their loudeſt intreaties. Once he compaſſionately called upon them to flee from the wrath to come, and ſent his embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to invite them to accept of eternal happineſs; but they inſolently rejected his invaluable offers, and ungratefully abuſed the methods of his grace, they
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004295_0077_1004105E9CD43FC0"/>deſpiſed his wiſe counſels, and diſregarded his awful reproofs: therefore <hi>he will mock at their calamity, and laugh when their fear cometh.</hi>— Not all the ſurpriſing miracles of his love, not all the bitter agonies and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of his death, not the ſacred ſtreams of his blood, which was ſhed for the redemption of a guilty world, could perſwade them to forſake their ſins, and devote themſelves to his ſervice; but they obſtinately retain'd their beloved luſts, and prefer'd their ſins before their Saviour: His abuſed goodneſs will therefore be converted into fury, and the door of mercy be bolted againſt them forever.— But I turn to a bright ſcene, and proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. To thoſe that are found in a ſtate of <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> with Chriſt, the day of Judgment will be a time of unſpeakable <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>refreſhment.</hi> With what ſatisfaction and pleaſure may they, who live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily in the world, <hi>look for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God their Saviour,</hi> who has loved them with an everlaſting Love, choſen them from among the degenerate maſs of mankind, waſh'd them from their ſins in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his blood, and is coming to receive them to his arms and embraces for ever!</p>
            <p>With what extaſies of joy and triumph will they ſalute the happy day, when their glorified Redeemer ſhall deſcend to this lower world, in the pomp and character of an incarnate God, clothed with majeſty and ſtrength, and attended with all the honours of his exalted ſtate!— How will they rejoice, with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, to behold Him, that for their ſakes <hi>made himſelf of no reputation, became poor,</hi> and paſs'd through an amazing ſcene of the moſt diſmal ſufferings, even the Man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeated upon a triumphant throne of glory, and ſurrounded with a ſhining croud of <hi>Angels, Archangels,</hi> and <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect!</hi>

How agreable a meeting will they have with their ancient <hi>Bodies;</hi> the companions of their meekneſs, humility and ſelf-denial, which have for ſo many years been confin'd to the dark and ſilent grave, and covered with deformity and corruption; but are now rais'd from the duſt of death, clothed with immortal youth and beauty, and fitted for a ſtate of perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and happineſs!— How tranſporting a ſight will it be, to behold the goodly Company of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and all thoſe brave and generous Souls, who in all ages of the church have ſacrificed their lives <hi>for the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> and have follow'd their Lord and Maſter in ſuffering and patience, in purity and heavenly-mindedneſs, all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one vaſt aſſembly, and ſhouting forth the praiſes of their exalted Redeemer!— How will it refreſh them to have their injured innocence publickly vindicated, their ſecret piety and charity applauded, and their holy thoughts and intentions proclaim'd, to their immortal honour!—But what heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what tongue can utter the mighty tranſports that will poſſeſs the Saints, when their God and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhall openly acknowledge them as his friends and favourites, and declare them heirs of eternal Glory!— With what raptures of Joy will they hear that happy ſentence pronounc'd upon them; <hi>Come, ye Bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world!</hi> after which they ſhall immediately enter into the heavenly paradiſe, and <hi>be for ever with the Lord.</hi>

            <p>THE doctrine of a future Judgment, tho' agreable to the principles of reaſon, and confirm'd by the teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the faithful and true witneſs; has nevertheleſs been oppoſed and blaſphem'd, in all ages, by men abandon'd to their luſts, and given over to a reprobate and impenitent mind. Such there aroſe in the chriſtian Church, even in the firſt and pureſt days of the Goſpel. In oppoſition to whom, St. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſerts the doctrine of Chriſt's coming to judge the world, and removes the objections that were made againſt it. The Ground of their infidelity was the uninterrupted proſperity, that the world enjoyed, notwithſtanding its approaching ruin had been ſo frequently foretold. <hi>Where</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> for <hi>ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</hi> In anſwer to this, the Apoſtle ſharply reproves them for their <hi>wilful
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004295_0082_1004106B732C99E8"/>Ignorance;</hi> and ſhows them that the world had <hi>already</hi> undergone ſuch remarkable Changes, as might juſtly. ſerve to ſtrengthen our belief in thoſe that were yet to come. He tells them, that the delay of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did not in the leaſt impeach the truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, but was an aſtoniſhing evidence of his Goodneſs and forbearance. <hi>God is not ſlack con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his promiſe, as ſome men count ſlackneſs; but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> Then he goes on to confirm our faith in this important Article of Religion, and in the words of our text, directs us a ſuitable Improvement of this ſolemn and affecting Subject.</p>

            <p>PROP. 1. <hi>At the ſecond coming of Chriſt this world ſhall be diſſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the world at preſent makes a beautiful and goodly appearance; and the face of nature ſeems to wear no marks of a declining age, nor to diſcover any melancholy ſymptoms of its approaching ruin: yet all things certainly are haſtning to their final period; when this earth ſhall be deſtroyed by fire, and all its magnificent Glories expire in flame and ſmoke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:004295_0083_10043FAD245869B0"/>
This has been the univerſal expectation of the wiſeſt among the <hi>beathen</hi> world, of all ſects and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in all ages and nations. Their ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers taught this doctrine in their publick Schools; their celebrated Poets made it the frequent theme of their harmonious ſongs; and ſcarce any notion has more generally prevailed in the world. But we are not left to collect this important truth from the dark hints of Antiquity, and the doubtful conjectures of the ancient ſages: We have <hi>a ſure word of prophecy</hi> to build our faith upon, even the infallible predictions of the word of God; where the general conflagration of the world is frequently foretold, and deſcribed in the moſt ſublime and affecting language.</p>
            <p>Under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>-diſpenſation we have clear intimations of this ſolemn truth.— <hi>Moſes,</hi> the firſt of the inſpir'd writers pathetically deſcribes it in his ſacred ſong: <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. <hi>A Fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt bell, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the earth with her increaſe; and ſet on fire the foundations of the mountains.— David,</hi> the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael, propheſies of this great event, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3. <hi>Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence: a fire ſhall devour before him, and it ſhall be very tempeſtuous round about him.</hi> So Pſal. 102.25, 26. <hi>Of old thou haſt laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy bands. They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure: yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a Garment, as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed, but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> declares the ſame doctrine. Chap. 51.6. <hi>Lift up your Eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath, for the heavens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke, and the earth ſhall wax old like a Garment, and they that dwell therein ſhall die in like manner; but my ſalvation ſhall be for ever, and my rightecuſneſs ſhall not be aboliſhed.</hi> — And <hi>Daniel</hi> had
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004295_0084_100410720C09FC48"/>a diſtinct view of this amazing ſcene in his prophetic Viſions.— <hi>And I beheld</hi> (ſays he) <hi>till the thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of days did ſit, whoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was white as Snow, and the hair of his bead like pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him: Thouſand Thouſands miniſtred unto him, ond ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him.</hi> Dan. 7.9, 10.— And <hi>Malachi,</hi> the laſt of the old teſtament prophets, in the Concluſion of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy denounces this awful threatning (Chap. 4. I.) <hi>Behold, the day cometh, that ſhall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the day that cometh, ſhall burn them, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall neither leave them root nor branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this great truth is more clearly revealed in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly aſſures us, (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8.) <hi>that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that <hi>the Heavens and Earth which are now, are kept in Store, reſerved unto fire, againſt the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perdition of ungodly men:</hi> And <hi>that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe; and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Thus we find, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, foretell the future deſtruction of the world: not by dark and figurative repreſentations, but by plain and poſitive teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing in the <hi>preſent ſtate</hi> and <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the earth, that militates againſt this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and renders the belief of it abſurd and irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. On the contrary, the corruptible materials of which this admirable frame is compos'd, the jarring
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004295_0085_10043FB6BA4A2268"/>elements contain'd in its capacious boſom, expoſe it to continual changes and convulſions. It has already paſt through mighty alterations, which have defac'd its Glory, and deſtroy'd multitudes of its inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Soon after this beautiful fabrick was raiſed out of darkneſs and confuſion, and the almighty Creator had pronounced of every thing which he had made. <hi>That it was very good;</hi> the whole earth was brought under a <hi>Curſe</hi> for the iniquity of man, and from a fruitful <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was turned into a deſolate wilderneſs, from the ſeat of innocence and joy it became the abode of guilt and ſorrow.</p>
            <p>When <hi>all fleſh had corrupted their ways,</hi> and <hi>the wickedneſs of man was great upon the Earth,</hi> God ſhower'd down a miraculous <hi>deluge of waters,</hi> and ſwept away the whole world of ſinners together.</p>
            <p>When the Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> had filled up the meaſure of their ſins, and attain'd to the moſt daring height of Impiety and Lewdneſs, they were ſuddenly deſtroy'd <hi>by fire and brimſtone,</hi> and their flouriſhing cities were turn'd into heaps of deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ruin.</p>
            <p>And in all ages of the world there have been terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples of the divine ſeverity. Whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Kingdoms have been laid waſte, by fire and ſword, — by famine and peſtilence, — by thunder and lightning, — by ſtorms and earthquakes. Theſe things are awful warnings to a guilty world, and ſtanding evidences of God's juſt diſpleaſure againſt the workers of Iniquity. The Judgments that he has executed from time to time, loudly declare the Greatneſs of his power, and the terrors of his wrath; and may abundantly convince us, that the threatnings of his word are not deſign'd barely to amuſe and terrify us, but will be exactly fulfilled in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time.</p>
            <p>And <hi>why ſhould it be thought incredible,</hi> that God who made the world at firſt, as a monument of his
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004295_0086_10043FC5304FD7F8"/>Power and Goodneſs, ſhould deſtroy it at laſt, to adorn the triumphs of his Juſtice and Holineſs? What can be more reaſonable than to ſuppoſe, that this Earth, which was deſign'd for the habitation of man, will be diſſolv'd when its Inhabitants are remov'd off the ſtage, and ſettled in their everlaſting abodes?</p>
            <p>By what means this aſtoniſhing change will be brought about, is utterly uncertain: but this we know, that there are innumerable fires impriſoned in the bowels of the earth, which frequently break forth with aſtoniſhing fury, and have produc'd ſurprizing alterations in the ſurface of this Globe; the Air alſo that ſurrounds us, is a continual magazine of thunder and lightning, and fiery Meteors; all which afford abundant proviſion for an univerſal Conflagration.</p>
            <p>We may therefore ſuppoſe, that at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the decrees of heaven, when the end for which this magnificent theatre was erected, ſhall be accompliſh'd, and the ſins of men cry aloud for divine juſtice, the great Lord of the Univerſe will iſſue out his ſovereign Orders: at which the mighty ſtores of fire that have hitherto been pent up in the heart of the earth, ſhall be broke open, flame out, and rage with irreſiſtible force and fury: all the combuſtible materials that are contain'd in theſe inferior heavens, ſhall be ſet on fire, and deſcend in hidious cataracts upon the diſſolving world. The beautiful order, that has hitherto ſubſiſted in the works of nature, will then ceaſe, and the whole ſublunary world be involv'd in tumult and diſorder: The foundations of the earth will be put out of courſe, and all the admired ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of nature and art ſhall periſh together.</p>
            <p>But it is not my deſign to attempt a deſcription of this great and terrible day of the Lord; it is beyond the capacity of man, to conceive, and the power of language to expreſs the horrors of this amazing Scene. I paſs therefore to the other thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:004295_0087_10043FC823E13610"/>
PROP. II. <hi>That the conſideration of this important truth is a powerful motive to univerſal Purity and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Which will appear, if we conſider the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars:</p>
            <p>It gives us an <hi>awful</hi> repreſentation of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſhews the <hi>malignant</hi> and <hi>deſtructive</hi> nature of <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It <hi>depreciates</hi> the enjoyments of <hi>this preſent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It evidences the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſecuring a <hi>more valuable</hi> and <hi>abiding</hi> inheritance.</p>
            <p>It <hi>heightens</hi> the terror and ſolemnity of a <hi>future judgment.</hi> And</p>
            <p>It affords a bright diſcovery of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>ſaving his people</hi> from the ruins of a diſſolving world.</p>
            <p>Of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>It gives us an awful repreſentation of the Greatneſs and Power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe attributes were wonderfully diſcover'd, when he firſt laid the foundations of the earth, ſtretched the heavens over us as a Curtain, and ſettled the courſe of nature with ſuch ſurprizing regularity and exactneſs; that its various parts mutually ſupport and aſſiſt each other, and all conſpire to miniſter to the convenience and happineſs of its numerous Inhabitants. But they will ſtill be more aſtoniſhingly diſplay'd, <hi>when the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat,</hi> and all the Glory of this goodly ſyſtem ſhall be made a prey to devouring flames, for to puniſh the contempt of his authority, and manifeſt the fierceneſs of his anger againſt a ſinful world.</p>
            <p>How irreſiſtible is the <hi>Power</hi> of that God, who made all things by the authority of a Command, and can deſtroy them in a moment by a frown of his countenance?—How terrible is his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> at whoſe rebuke <hi>the Earth ſhakes and trembles, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the hills are removed out of their place?</hi>—
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:004295_0088_1004107B8DA4B4D0"/>Who can ſtand before Him, when once he is angry? Who can ſupport the terrors of his almighty diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Is not the thought of theſe things ſufficient to ſurprize the boldeſt ſinners, to appale their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and make their knees ſtrike one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they are giving a looſe to their mirth and jollity, and waſting their days in intemperance and debauchery? What infinite madneſs, and worſe than brutal ſtupidity, are they guilty of, who affront and provoke the great Lord and Governor of the world, upon whom they intirely depend, who can deſtroy them with the breath of his mouth, and make them the flaming monuments of his righteous indignation? What more neceſſary for us, than to bow before the Lord our maker, and humble our ſelves for our innumerable provocations againſt him? How ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that advice (22 <hi>Job.</hi> 21.) <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at peace: thereby good ſhall come unto thee.</hi>— How much does it concern us, <hi>to ſerve the Lord with reverence and godly fear; ſeeing our God is a conſuming fire?</hi> who tho' he now ſeems to take no notice of the ſins of men, and bears with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable indignities, <hi>yet he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſtroy his implacable Enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The diſſolution of the world affords a convincing evidence of the malignant and deſtructive nature of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Sin is an infinite evil, odious to the bleſſed God, and attended with the moſt dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, is abundantly evident from the declarations of God's word, and is ſtill further verified by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of his wrath upon obſtinate and impenitent tranſgreſſors.— How clearly did the purity of his nature, and the ſeverity of his Juſtice, ſhine forth in the terrible puniſhment inflicted upon the fallen <hi>Angels?</hi> who for one ſin were dethron'd from their exalted ſeats in Heaven, were caſt down to the gloomy manſions of hell, and are <hi>reſerv'd in chains of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004295_0089_10043FD3F8A03F10"/>darkneſs to the judgment of the great day.</hi>— How awful does the divine diſpleaſure appear in the <hi>curſe</hi> pronounc'd upon our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> for their primitive apoſtacy; by which the Glory of the creation was ſtain'd, the harmony of nature diſturb'd, and Man (the Lord of all) was brought under a peremptory ſentence of death and miſery? — And who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the various and diſtreſſing <hi>Afflictions,</hi> that are ſince become the ſad inheritance of the ſinful children of men? — This may aſſure us, that <hi>God is angry with the Wicked,</hi> and that he will not ſuffer the wilful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his authority to paſs unpuniſh'd.</p>
            <p>But how illuſtriouſly will this truth be revealed by the fire of the <hi>laſt day;</hi> when this lower world ſhall be conſum'd by the heat of the divine diſpleaſure, and all its adored treaſures ſhall be ſacrificed to the jealous reſentments of an offended God? For it is ſin, that enkindles the fire of God's wrath, and provokes him to deſtroy the works of his hands. How juſtly then are they branded with the character of <hi>Fools, who make a mock of ſin,</hi> who hug this deteſtable evil in their boſoms; which has already been attended with ſuch deſtructive effects, and which will at laſt ſet on fire this frame of nature, and ſink a guilty world into the loweſt hell, <hi>where the ſmoke of their torments will aſcend for ever and ever?</hi> What Conſideration can more powerfully engage us to <hi>deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts?</hi> How much does it concern us, to <hi>have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with theſe unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi> but to flee from the <hi>tents of the wicked,</hi> leſt we be defiled with their ſins, and <hi>partake of their plagues?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The Conſideration of the approaching Ruin of this World, <hi>greatly depreciates all earthly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>ſhows the madneſs of placing our affections upon ſuch uncertain treaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The world is a ſtrong and prevailing temptation, which wonderfully captivates the hearts of men, and is the unhappy inſtrument of innumerable pollutions.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:004295_0090_100410824998DD08"/>Many are ſo enchanted with wealth and riches, ſo fond of the pomp and glitter of worldly greatneſs, ſo charm'd with the gay amuſements and pleaſures of Life, that they think of nothing but <hi>ſetting up their tabernacles here;</hi> and entirely neglect their great and immortal intereſt: but ſurely, if we conſider the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory nature of theſe enjoyments, it is enough to damp the force of worldly temptations, and put us out of conceit with ſuch periſhing vanities. Why ſhould we put our truſt, and place our happineſs, in things that are of ſo ſhort and momentany a duration; which in a few years at furtheſt, will vaniſh out of our ſight, and take their leave of us for ever? Our daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhows us, that all theſe beloved advantages are continually upon the wing, and frequently fly from our embraces: but beſides the common caſualties and adverſities of life, to which all things here below are expoſed, the world <hi>it ſelf,</hi> with all its grandeur and magnificence, with all its riches and pleaſures, is haſtning to its <hi>final period.</hi> The time is ſwiftly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, <hi>when the earth, and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Then all thoſe tempting objects, which now you ſo paſſionately dote upon, and for which you ſacrifice all Hope of the favour of God, and an heaven of immortal joys, ſhall be turn'd into darkneſs and flame. All the great empires, which have been rais'd by ambition or cruelty, and made ſuch a mighty noiſe in the earth, ſhall ſink at once into ruin and confuſion. All thoſe flouriſhing cities, which have been the pride and glory of their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſhall be laid waſte and deſolate. All the proud monuments of human vanity, which have been rear'd with ſuch infinite toil and expence, ſhall be levelled with the duſt, and <hi>the place thereof ſhall know them no more.</hi> What an undeniable evidence does this afford us of the little value of all earthly poſſeſſions? How ſhould it abate our affections to ſuch vaniſhing trifles, and give check to our immoderate purſuit of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:004295_0091_10043FDFF6FFC1F8"/>the world? This is the argument made uſe of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and carries with it the greateſt force and efficacy (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, — 31.) <hi>But this I ſay, Brethren, the time is ſhort; it remaineth, that they that rejoice, be as tho' they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as tho' they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This alſo ſhows us <hi>the neceſſity of ſecuring a more valuable and abiding Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the world is ſuch a tranſient ſcene, and its moſt agreable entertainments are like a morning-cloud, and as the early dew, which will quickly paſs away; it is a Matter of no conſiderable conſequence, whether our circumſtances be proſperous, or afflicting, whether we are carried through the ſtage of Life with an eaſy and pleaſant gale, or drove to our long home by ſtorm and diſtreſs. Our only concern is, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the duty of our ſtation, and fulfil the taſk aſſign'd us by heaven; that at laſt we may ſafely arrive at the peaceful harbour of happineſs and everlaſting reſt. We are here in a pilgrimage-ſtate, and are bound for the regions of immortality; nothing therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our anxiety and care, but that which will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive our funeral, and paſs over with us into a future world. And, bleſſed be God, an heavenly and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance is offered to our choice, and earneſtly recommended to our acceptance: This is the nobleſt object of our ambition, and ſhould engage the ſtrength and vigour of all our powers.</p>
            <p>Now by the Tenour of the Divine Promiſe, as well as the Nature of Things, this can be obtain'd only by thoſe that <hi>cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and perfect holineſs in the fear of God;</hi> who <hi>eſcape the pollutions of the world,</hi> and are <hi>renewed after the image</hi> of the inviſible God. <hi>What manner of perſons</hi> then <hi>ought we to be, in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſs;</hi> that ſo when all things here

            <p n="5">V. The deſtruction of the world by fire will <hi>heighten the terror and ſolemnity of a future judgment:</hi> and ſo the Conſideration of it is a powerful motive to univerſal purity and holineſs.</p>
            <p>The wiſe author of our beings hath implanted a principle of <hi>fear</hi> in the hearts of men, to keep them from ſecurity and preſumption, to quicken them in their flight from impending dangers. Now what can be more ſuited to raiſe this paſſion in the ſoul, than the conſideration of that awful time, when we muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, and have an irreverſible ſentence paſs'd upon us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature and quality of our actions? But how aſtoniſhingly will the terrors of that day be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the final deſtruction of this lower world? What confuſion and diſtreſs will ſeize the ſinner, when the heavens from above ſhall rain down fire and brimſtone, and the earth upon which he dwells, ſhall become one mighty Volcano, and diſcharge whole rivers of flaming ſulphur?</p>
            <p>Will it not terrify the hardieſt mortals, to ſee nature ſtruggling in the agonies of death, and themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd on all ſides with the flames of a diſſolving world: <hi>The Sun turn'd into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood,</hi> and whole cities and countries ſinking down in a moment into the fiery abyſs below! How will they ſupport theſe viſions of horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or whither will they fly for ſafety and defence? If they aſcend to the top of the loftieſt mountains, there they will be expoſed to the hot thunderbolts of divine fury: If they deſcend into the gloomy caverns of the earth, there they will be ſwallowed up in an Ocean of liquid fire. In ſhort, wherever they go, the vengeance of an incenſed God will purſue them,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004295_0093_1004108EAE4202B0"/>and make them the monuments of his almighty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And now what more powerful argument can be uſed with ſinful mortals to awaken them out of their impenitence and ſecurity? If infinite juſtice cannot affright them from their ſins; if the proſpect of a diſſolving world leave no abiding impreſſions upon them; they appear to be loſt, beyond all poſſibility of recovery: and it is to be fear'd, they belong to the number of thoſe hardned wretches, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſtorm hell, and take the kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by violence.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. This alſo has a prevailing influence upon the people of God, <hi>as it gives them a bright diſcovery of the love of Chriſt, who will ſave them from the terrors of this amazing day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this will be a day of tribulation and anguiſh to impenitent ſinners, yet it will be a time of joy and refreſhment to the Saints. <hi>For the Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly, and reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgment to be puniſhed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that the righteous ſhall be ſeparated from the wicked, and reſcued from the calamity, in which all things elſe ſhall be involv'd. <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel and the trump of God; and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: Then we which are alive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17.</note> What an endearing expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is this of the love of God our Saviour? What obligations are we under, to beſtow upon him our beſt and deareſt affection? In fine, what mighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement does it afford us now to diſentangle our affections from this enſnaring world, to be fruitful in every good work, to have our converſation in heaven;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004295_0094_10043FEC9DBC3E60"/>
               <hi>that ſo we may be accounted worthy to eſcape all thoſe things, which ſhall then come to paſs, and may be able to ſtand with confidence before the Son of Man at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The APPLICATION of my diſcourſe remains: which I ſhall diſpatch in a ſerious and earneſt Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſeveral ſorts of perſons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Let thoſe that are in</hi> Youth, <hi>be perſwaded by theſe powerful motives that have been ſet before them, to all holy Converſation and Godlineſs.</hi> — You are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding apt to baniſh all ſerious Thoughts out of your minds, and to imagine that it will be time enough hereafter, to attend to religious Concerns, when you have taken a ſurfeit of the Gaieties and Pleaſures of Life. Youth is naturally unthinking; and ſtrongly inclin'd to ſenſual enjoyments. Their conſtitutions are ordinarily firm and robuſt; not broken with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, impair'd by ſickneſs, or worn out with age. Their pulſe beats high, their blood circulates briſkly through their veins, and all the powers of nature are in their higheſt ſprightlineſs and vigour: Their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are eager, their paſſions are head-ſtrong, and ſo apt to hurry them into all manner of riot and exceſs, contrary to the ſacred rules of virtue and ſobriety. They eſteem Religion too dark and melancholy an entertainment for the flouriſhing bloom of life, and fit for none but thoſe whoſe temper is ſoured with loſſes and diſappointments in the world, and whoſe ſtrength is waſted with ſickneſs or age. Hence they give an unbounded looſe to their vicious inclinations, and wallow in the groſſeſt ſenſualities.</p>
            <p>But make a pauſe, I beſeech you, in the midſt of your mad career, and conſider what will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guence of your actions; <hi>Know it, that for theſe things God will bring you into judgment,</hi> and call you to a ſtrict account ſo: your youthful follies. You may
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004295_0095_10041091C788BDD0"/>now drink wine in bowls, and ſing away your cares, ſpend your days in mirth, and your years in vanity and pleaſure; but theſe are dying comforts, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd enjoyments, which will ſoon end in diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſorrow. The ſprightlineſs of Youth, the ſtrength of your conſtitutions, is no Protection againſt the ſudden arreſts of Death, and the inevitable ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of your almighty Judge. How many of your companions have been cut off in the flower of their days, and diſpatch'd into an eternal world, without any warning? And have you any ſecurity, that this ſhall not be your caſe? On the contrary, have you not the greateſt reaſon to fear, that whilſt you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in your intemperate pleaſures, and madly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing your guilty deſigns, while you are flattering your ſelves with the proſpect of long life and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and dream of nothing but peace and ſafety, the fatal Period will come upon you in a moment, and overwhelm you with ſwift and unavoidable ruin? <hi>Knowing then the terrors of the Lord, we perſwade you,</hi> to break off your Sins by unfeigned Repentance, and get reconciled to God, and prepar'd to die.— O fly to the great Saviour of the world, who alone can ſecure you from the flames of vindictive Juſtice: Cry to him moſt importunately for the powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Spirit, to cleanſe your polluted Souls; that you may be found of your Judge in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot and blameleſs.—But I paſs,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To apply this Exhortation to thoſe that are in the</hi> Evening of Life, <hi>and have hitherto neglected to prepare for the approaching diſſolution of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what confidence will you, under your heavy Loads of Guilt and Defilement, be able to hold up your heads at the bar of Chriſt? Can you hope to appear with Safety before his Judgment-Seat, who have hitherto ſpent your time in the neglect of his Authority, in diſobedience to his Goſpel, and profane
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004295_0096_10043FEE5FE275D8"/>contempt of his ineſtimable Blood? Alaſs, your days decline apace, your Sun is almoſt ſet, and <hi>the Night</hi> haſtens upon you, <hi>wherein no man can work.</hi> O then ſeize the flying moments, and trifle no longer with your eternal Concerns; humble your ſelves in the duſt for your aggravated Iniquities, and turn from all your Tranſgreſſions. <hi>Fly for Refuge to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>give glory to the Lord your God, before your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains,</hi> and before the terrors of a future judgment ſurprize you. O <hi>how will you eſcape, if you neglect ſo great Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Let what we have heard put the <hi>Children of God</hi> upon diligent endeavours to <hi>grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> to increaſe in univerſal holineſs, that they may be better prepar'd for the awful Events they are expecting, and which will ſurely come to paſs.</p>
            <p>To quicken our Zeal and Activity in the Chriſtian Life, let us frequently be looking forward to that important day, when our deſcending LORD ſhall make <hi>the clouds his chariot, and ſhall ride upon the wings of the wind;</hi> when the Heavens ſhall bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>and the rocks ſhall melt at his preſence, and a fire ſhall go before him to burn up his enemies on every ſide.</hi>—Conſider how vaſt will be the joy of thoſe holy Souls, who ſhall be ſaved from the ruins of a burning world, and be admitted <hi>into the new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the new earth, wherein dwells righteouſneſs.</hi> And let the proſpect of this happy ſtate engage us to unfainting induſtry in the ſervice of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to a conſtant ſeparation from the defiling cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the world, and unto a Care to have our Converſation in Heaven: then we may be aſſured, that the day of Chriſt's ſolemn appearance will be the day of our complete and eternal Redemption. While un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Sinners ſhall tremble at the Preſence of their righteous Judge, and at the ſight of a diſſolving
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004295_0097_10043FF458016E78"/>world, we that have ſerv'd God, and <hi>waited for his Son from Heaven,</hi> ſhall be able, amidſt this Scene of darkneſs and horror, to hold up our heads with Joy, and <hi>not be aſhamed before Him at his coming.</hi>— We ſhall ſhout unto God with the voice of Gladneſs, and join in that triumphant Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the LAMB: <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints!</hi>
