            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACCORDINGLY, our Lord, after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appeared in the clearer and more bright efful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Deity. In his eſtare of humiliation he did not lay aſide his divinity, but ſhrouded the glorious appearance of it with the weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fleſh.

            <p>BUT now, having finiſhed tranſgreſſion in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory ſacrifice, and riſen triumphant over death and hell; as the due reward of his ſufferings, He has <hi>power over all fleſh,</hi> and <hi>all power in Heaven and Earth given unto him.</hi> In his mediatorial commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he has the grant of unlimitted dominion and government, He only <hi>excepted who put all things under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE we have this moſt natural obſervation from the Text,
JESUS Chriſt is the head and fountain of all power.</p>

            <p n="3">III. Make Application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhew what may be here intended by power, or all power in heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>POWER is a word of large and extenſive ſenſe, eſpecially here, where our Lord declares it to be <hi>all power</hi> in Heaven and in Earth. So that we may well conceive that there is no kind of power, but it is, in ſome juſt ſenſe, his.</p>
            <p>POWER ſignifies both <hi>right</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing.</p>
            <p>THERE is the power of ſtrength, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of authority and dominion. And there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, and the power of creatures. Among men there is civil, military and eccleſiaſtical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but Jeſus Chriſt is the great head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all.</p>
            <p>DIVINE power is infinite, and bounded by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the abſolute will and pleaſure of the great ſupreme. Hence this title is aſſumed by God, and abundantly attributed to him with infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, The ALMIGHTY. <hi>I am the Almighty God.</hi>

How marvellous and ſurpriſing the all-enlivening agency of the divine power, in every ſucceſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in every of the infinite variety and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of exiſtencies in the wide extended creation? And thus ſays our Lord, <hi>My Father worketh</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and I work<note n="¶" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> 5.17</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT divine power is not only manifeſted in the creation, conſervation and gubernation of all things, but moſt gloriouſly, in the redemption and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays <hi>All power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> It was a work of almighty power, as well as of infinite grace, to make ſatisfaction for our ſins: and, at the ſame time, to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat conqueſt of the rebellious powers of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal darkneſs. On the croſs our great Lord ſpoiled principalities and powers.</p>
            <p>THE work of effectual calling is a work of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, when our Lord raiſes the dead ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from his long ſleep and death in ſin, to a new and divine life, and ſtrengthens him to faith and calling upon God.

            <p>MOREOVER, the guardianſhip and protection of the Church, amidſt all the wickedneſs of their own hearts, men and devils; and of every danger, through this world, to the heavenly kingdom, is a work of powerful grace.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016019_0007_0F9B25560F8A0ED0"/>BUT there is not only the power of almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God, but alſo of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Dominion. Dominion and fear are with him.</hi> He is the great Lord and law giver of the univerſe. Being God, creator and preſerver, he has a moſt juſt right to give law to, and govern all his creatures.</p>
            <p>IN infinite wiſdom, the creator fixed a law of nature to every ſpecies of Beings animate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate. And according to that law is the ſyſtem governed. Nature, or it's fixed laws, is nothing without him who is the God of nature. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages the ordinances of Heaven agreeably to his wiſe conſtitution. The wide field of nature in this lower world, obeys his ſovereign orders, and ſets a beautiful example of perfect ſubmiſſion to man, originally appointed it's ruler, made but a little lower than the Angels, and crowned with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour.</p>
            <p>LAW was given to man. The original law our Maker gave us, commonly called <hi>the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> was not a blind law of inſtinct, but the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rule of righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>moral law,</hi> agreeably to the nature of the divine perfections. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this law was written on the heart of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man, for <hi>in the image of God made he them</hi>; and the great Creator poſitively enjoined his punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obedience. Man is ſtill bound by the ſame authority; and Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner paſs away than one jot or tittle of the law ſhall fail, or be diſpenſed with. <hi>Jehovah</hi> will maintain his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over his reaſonable creatures, be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence what it will to them,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:016019_0008_0F9B25563933A958"/>HAD not man broken the law of his Creation, it would have been the ſecurity of his happineſs; but being broken, it's ſanction muſt take place without an equal reparation be made, for God is unchangeable. Bleſſed be his name for our divine ſurety Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>GREAT is the authority of God. He reigns in Heaven above and governs the myriads of ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hoſts and glorified ſaints at his pleaſure. And unſpeakably happy are they under his government. He reigns upon Earth, and nothing makes any ſubject unhappy or miſerable under his dominion, but rebellion and high treaſon againſt his majeſty.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>THERE is the power of creatures. Angels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in ſtrength, and they have principality and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Hence we read of thrones, dominions, principalities and powers in Heavenly places <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> iii, 10, <hi>Col.</hi> i, 16</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND there is power and authority among men. The ſtrength of man is ſmall and limitted, and ſo is his authority. But authority among mankind is abſolutely reaſonable and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>ALL men, indeed, are by nature equal: and all have, moſt certainly, an equal right to freedom and liberty by the great law of nature. No man or number of men, <hi>has</hi> or <hi>can</hi> have a right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the natural rights, liberties or privileges of others: or to dominion or government over any one, but by his free conſent perſonally, or by his legal repreſentative, God having created the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies upon a level.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:016019_0009_0F9B25A5EC48C6D8"/>BUT then, we are to conſider that the alwiſe Creator has laid a foundation for ſociety in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man. It was not good for man to be alone. God therefore made, and inſtituted the ſociety of man and wife, which laid the foundation for larger ſocieties from one degree and riſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until it came to nations, kingdoms or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths. Therefore when men, after their apoſtacy, multiplied upon the face of the earth, it was neceſſary to form into political and civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to have rules and laws for their protection and ſafety; and to appoint guardians of the ſame, elſe the lives and properties of men could not be ſafe from the outrages of the wicked, who paid no regard to any law, but of ſin and corrupt nature. So that the true original end of civil government was, the ſafety and happineſs of the people; that every man, ſo far as poſſible, might enjoy his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and privileges in peaceable and quiet poſſeſſion.</p>

            <p>WHATEVER different forms of government have been ſet up, among all nations ſince the flood, they have been, profeſſedly, ſet up with theſe views.

And the moſt barbarous heathen nations have found it neceſſary to have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed rules and cuſtomary laws ſtrictly obſerved for the puniſhment of vice, and for the ſafety of life, and preſervation of property.</p>
            <p>THE people, under God, are the fountain of all authority among men. Even in the land of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine, where their government was a Theocracy, and their God was their King, and raiſed up their Judges and Kings by an extraordinary call, yet they did not enter upon government without the people's conſent and appointment. Saul and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid were particularly pointed out by God, and anointed by ſpecial direction to Samuel the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Yet, without, and until the people's accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they meddled not with any affair of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note n="§" place="bottom">

            <p>THE people of any nation, country or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, have an undoubted right to ſet up ſuch form of government as they judge will moſt effectually ſecure their ſafety, proſperity and happineſs: and to change and alter it, as they ſhall find requiſite for the good ends of government.

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016019_0011_0F9B25A739527428"/>EVERY ruler is, or ought to be, appointed by the people, and accountable to them. And for any officer to make his own private emolument, or perſonal honor his aim, is at once to deviate from the deſign of his inſtitution, and to enter upon the firſt ſtages of tyranny. The public good ſhould ever be the higheſt aim, next to God and his own ſoul, of every one conſtituted to any office in the State. But then,</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that the conſtitution be well fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and ſuitably adapted, not only to the genius of the people, but agreeably to the great law of nature. And divine revelation, which gives us the moſt perfect rules for the conduct of mankind, in every ſtation and condition of civil and religious life, ſhould be received, as a perfect ſtandard, in the framing of all human laws. <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect.</hi> Yet as we are never to look for another theocracy ſince the Jewiſh is ceaſed, and their laws were fitted to ſuch a ſtate, it is neceſſary that laws be made in every civil State, to anſwer the neceſſities and conveniences of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>AND not only is it neceſſary to the well-being and happineſs of every State, that there be a good conſtitution, and good laws agreeably thereto, but good rulers, appointed by the people, for the due execution of them. In this caſe Jethro's counſel to Moſes is worthy our obſervation. <hi>Moreover thou ſhalt chuſe out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them.</hi>

and whenever they abuſe it, the people have right to a redreſs of their grievances; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them from their offices.</p>
            <p>OFFICERS ſhould be faithful, and be ſupported by the people, for this is the mind of God. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.

            <p>EVERY one ſhould be content with his place, and labor to fill his ſtation with honor to himſelf and conſtituents. When once men are uneaſy to act within their own ſpheres, and covet to riſe to higher preferments of honor or profit; when they are proud, haughty and haſty; when they treat their inferiors with ſcorn and contempt; when they wink and connive at vice, or are vicious themſelves, they ſhew plainly that they are unfit to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the freemen of the State, and unworthy of their good regards. If ſuch men are promoted, the conſtitution is injured, and the laws violated with impunity. Oppreſſion, deſpotiſm and tyranny will ſoon get off their ſhackles, and preſently begin to lift up their <hi>Hydra heads,</hi> and, with wide ſtrides, ſtalk, like hideous monſters, over the extended country. Surely the people cannot well be too cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious who they promote to offices. As good rulers are a great bleſſing to people, and highly deſerving
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016019_0013_0F9B25A8B97EB830"/>
of their reſpects; ſo, on the other hand, bad rulers are a ſore judgment, and deſerve the frowns of the public.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, military power is alſo of God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the defence of the civil, and muſt ever be ſubject to it, and regulated by it. But this I muſt paſs over.</p>
            <p>ONCE more here, eccleſiaſtical power is wholly of a ſpiritual nature, and no ways connected with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civil or military power. Chriſt's <hi>kingdom is not of this world,</hi> not of a worldly nature. The conſtitution is ſpiritual, <hi>the covenant of grace.</hi> The laws are ſpiritual, and the ordinances of a ſpiritual nature, given us in the word of truth, the great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of heaven; and the puniſhments are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, being the ſentences of Chriſt's mouth, who is the only king, Lord and law-giver of his church, and pronounced againſt offenders in his name, by his miniſters. Therefore the civil magiſtrate has nothing to do with this government. Only the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rights, priviledges and properties of the church are to be ſecured and defended by the civil powers.</p>

            <p>O what an Almighty arm is lifted up over the impious hardened rebels againſt Heaven! <hi>And can thine heart endure, and can thy hands be ſtrong in the day that God ſhall deal with thee?</hi> You may go on a little while, perhaps, in your mad defiance of your maker and your judge, and ſpurn at all the grace tendered you, moſt freely and plentifully, in the bleſſed goſpel, and take your courſe, but <hi>in due time your foot ſhall ſlide.</hi> Me thinks I ſee crowns and ſcepters thrown away as vile refuſe; and all the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering glory of titles, honors, riches and Earthly profits contemned as the mire in the ſtreets. <hi>The kings of the Earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every bond man, and every free man biding themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mounntains, ſaying to the mountains and rocks, fall on us and bide us from the face of him that ſittteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> Can we now refrain thinking of thoſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>what ſhall it profit a man if he ſhall gain the whole world, and looſe his own ſoul?</hi> A portion in Chriſt is worth more than all the world,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016019_0021_0F9B25AEB97EA4A8"/>
O that great men, and rich men would not look upon themſelves above religion! <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God? or canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi> How very abſurd for a glittering worm to vaunt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as above it's fellow worms when it's nature is the ſame, and as liable and as eaſy to be cruſhed to death?</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, from what has been offered on the divine authority, we infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT it is moſt reaſonable and juſt. It is the authority of God our maker, of Chriſt our God and Redeemer. And authority over all is a natural and neceſſary prerogative of the Deity. Nothing can be more reſonable than that the creator ſhould be abſolute proprietor of his creatures; and that he ſhould give them laws and govern them to the greateſt and beſt end, his own glory. And impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is for him to err. His will muſt be good in perſection. And his laws muſt be wiſe and good, for his will is not only good, but his underſtanding infinite. Therefore his authority is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE infer that ſubmiſſion to the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is our duty. And an imperfect ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obedience is far from the thing required. An imperfect obedience to the laws of the ſtate, would rather be termed rebellion, or diſobedience, by the rulers. Though a man ſhould keep the laws of the ſtate in a thouſand inſtances, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them wilfully in one, he would be deemed guilty, and dealt with as a law-breaker. And ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration argues, <hi>Whoſeover ſhall keep the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016019_0022_0F9B25AF7843F610"/>
whole law, end yet offend in one point is guilty of all; for he that ſaid do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the law.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>James</hi> ii, 10.11</note>
            </p>
            <p>SURELY, if God be infinite and his law perfect and we read expreſsly that <hi>the law of the Lord is perfect,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſ.</hi> xix.7.</note> then a perfect ſubmiſſion and obedience is our duty; and alſo a continuance therein, for it is written, <hi>curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> iii.10.</note> Oh, if Chriſt had not moſt perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed for us, the curſe would have been our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever: But bleſſed be God, he has become obedient unto death for us, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him ſhould receive remiſſion of ſins, and be freely juſtified and ſaved. Yet the believer in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus muſt be careful to maintain good works. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the law is not a covenant of works for the believer, but a perfect rule of all holy living unto God. But I paſs on to ſay,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, from what we have heard of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among men, we learn,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT that authority which is founded on the law of nature, and agreeably to divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the authority of God, and the only autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be obeyed, all other power and authority being tyranny. True, many nations have ſet up a conſtitution of government, which has, in many things, been excellent, and many of their laws have been well adapted to the neceſſities of the ſtate. The Romans ſeemed to have excelled moſt others, while they remained a Common Wealth,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016019_0023_0F9B25B038DC36A0"/>
But many encroachments were made upon the rights of the ſubject among them; and finally that empire has undergone ſeven or eight different forms of government. We indeed find that under one of the worſt of thoſe forms, namely, their Emperors, Saint Paul directs chriſtians to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii.1.</note> But we are not to ſuppoſe any are bound to be ſubject to any law or government, in any article againſt the rights of conſcience. The holy martyrs of Jeſus have ever ſubmitted to the civil laws of the government they lived under, acknowledging their bodies and eſtates belonged to the king, or emperor, but their conſciences they held free.</p>
            <p>IT is obſervable, that toleration to thofe of a different religion from the ſtate-religion, was but little conſidered as a matter of right, in but few countries; ſo that ſpiritual tyranny and intolerance generally prevailed in the world from age to age,; And even in England, after they became profeſſed proteſtants, they were no leſs ſevere againſt diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than the old pagans and papiſts. And, as to civil liberty in the beſt regulated ſtates, kingdoms and common wealths, there ever was a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of tyranny practiced againſt the ſubject.</p>
            <p>ENGLAND has been one of the moſt famous countries for civil liberty. The people, in almoſt every age, ſeemed to have an abhorrence of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potilm, and have ſhewn an uncommon zeal to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and eſtabliſh their privileges. Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great <hi>Charter,</hi> and the eſtabliſhed laws of the nation, almoſt every reign has been ſtained with more or leſs acts of tyranny. And, in many reigns, what ſcenes of the moſt ſavage barbarities
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016019_0024_0F9B25B0F8D03850"/>
have been carried on, to the eternal infamy of the Henry and Stuart lines? In the mean time how have the pulpite rung with the ſtupid doctrines of <hi>The Lord's anointed,</hi> and <hi>poſſive obedience</hi> and <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance?</hi> The nation groaned under the weight of oppreſſion and arbitrary domination. Nothing could content the more than brutiſh tyrants but the abſolute deſtruction and waſte of law, every privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the lives and fortunes of the ſubject. Happy revolution in 1688. But how has the old tyranny riſen out of it's grave, and made a moſt formidable attack apon the ſubject in the preſent arbitrary reign? This country, ſenſible of the vaſt importance of it's priviledges, has thrown off the, yoke, and nobly taken up arms in it's own defence, determined to be free, or die in the virtuous cauſe, the great cauſe of Heaven and Earth. In depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the almighty Jehovah, we may expect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat deliverance, and ſee this infant country a ſeat of juſtice, religion and Liberty.</p>
            <p>UNHAPPY it would be, if the bad government we have been under ſhould be a means of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's neglecting a good government. Rather let it engage them the more carefully to eſtabliſh, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſubmit to good government. But in this ſinful world, we cannot expect a permanent ſtate of peace, Liberty and proſperity. Such is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, pride and avarice of fallen mans that it makes him like the <hi>troubled Sea when it cannot reſt.</hi> And the firſt temptation, <hi>ye ſhall be as Gods,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to prevail, eſpecially in unſanctified men. Internal diſputes may embroil the whole land in a ſcene of diſorder, confuſion and miſery. Or ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality luxury and diſſipation ſwallow up all our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016019_0025_0F9B25B1B8622C70"/>
enervate all our fortitude, and bring on a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſervility of ſpirit, ſo that we ſhould eaſily become the dupes and abject ſlaves of deſpotiſm and tyranny. Indeed every ſort of vice leads the way to both temporal and eternal ſlavery. But of all things ignorance opens the wideſt door to it; this paves the way to every vice, and diſables a people from knowing the things of their temporal, as well as ſpiritual peace. How neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to exert ourſeleves againſt all wickdneſs, and to promote all uſeful knowledge? But e're I am aware I am carried too far here, and muſt return.</p>
            <p>THIS Queſtion may require an anſwer,</p>
            <p>WHAT authority may be reſiſted?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Unlawful authority, and all lawful officers acting unlawfully. There have been many officers, lawfully and well appointed, who have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unlawfully in their office: and when this is the caſe, they ſhould not be obeyed, but rather reſiſted in a due manner.</p>
            <p>OFFICERS are no better by nature than other men, and often have been worſe by practice than thoſe in a private ſphere. I need not call in a Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a Stuart, a George or a North to witneſs in the preſent caſe: we may find enough in this country ſince a Sir Edmund Androſſ, to prove the point. Such authority ſhould be univerſally oppoſed with a manly firmneſ, and an heroic virtue, until it be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and good and lawful authority eſtabliſhed. But ſuch wicked men are the firſt to plead <hi>law</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and to cry out <hi>rebellion</hi> and <hi>treaſon,</hi> even when they are ſubverting the conſtitution, violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſolemn oaths, and depriving the people,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016019_0026_0F9B25B2788694C0"/>
both of their civil and religious right. And if ſuch men are not reſiſted we muſt obey man rather than God. We muſt ſuffer all that is dear and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable for ſoul and body, for time and eternity, to be unjuſtly taken from us: We muſt give up to lawleſs luſt, ambition and tyranny; yea to deſpots and devils both. And can we endure the thought? Let it rouſe up every man, and excite a noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to blot the name of tyranny out of the land, and to keep up a ſteady firmneſs and unſhaken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to defend and ſupport true Liberty, and hand it down to poſterity as the beſt legacy we can beſtow on them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE infer the neceſſity of good rulers. <hi>If the foundations be deſtroyed, what can the righteous do?</hi> A good conſtitution, good laws and good magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates are very neceſſary to the well-being of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A ſtate of anarchy is ever a ſtate of diſorder and confution. Injuſtice and every vice flouriſnes with impunity, and no man's life or property is ſafe. How ſad were the times in Iſrael when they were without government? When the Levite's concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine was forced 'till ſhe was dead, we read <hi>In thoſe days there was no king in Iſrael; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Jud.</hi> xxi.25.</note> There was no Judge, or ſupreme magiſtrate to put the laws in execution, and the people were lawleſs. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident that good rulers are ncceſſary. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy is an ordinance of God, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the people.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, is it as we have heard, that Jeſus Chriſt is the head and fountain of all authority? Hence we infer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:016019_0027_0F9B25B33B692EC8"/>1. WHAT a glorious and wonderful head of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we have. Jeſus Chriſt is the prince of the kings of the Earth. When rulers have hearts after his own heart; when they are ſenſible they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their all from him; when they heartily own him for their head and ſovereign, pattern after him in their lives, and copy his example in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their offices, they are bleſſings in their high ſtations, greatly uſeful to the State, and of vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the people. But when they forget the Lord's anointed, Chriſt their king, and ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his feat, and uſurp his throne, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come oppreſſors and lawlefs tyrants, O, but we, of all people in the world, have cauſe to own and acknowledge the prince of peace to be our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. We have renounced the tyrant of Britain, and declaimed loudly againſt monarchical power; and have fet up to be a free people. We own no other prince or ſovereign but the prince oft Heaven, the great ſovereign of the univerſe. To him we ſwear allegiance, and promiſe, through his abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant grace, to keep his laws.</p>
            <p>THE ten moral precepts are a brief ſummary of the whole moral law, the great law of nature. And the bleſſed bible gives us a perfect comment upon it. Hence the ſcripture is ſo frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the law of the Lord.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and the commentator. And hence, as he is our maker, our king and our redeemer, we are bound to love, honor and obey him; to be ſubject to his law and government. We ſhould receive his law as out rule and guide both in law-making and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting.</p>

Jeſus Chriſt is an example of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice, and all his adminiſtrations are wiſe, good and gracious. He never took any bribe, nor turned away the poor from his right.

            <p n="2">II. A uſe of address to this venerable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon this pleaſing and joyful occaſion.</p>
            <p>OUR eyes now ſee the foundation of a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican ſtate, laid on the nobleſt principles of true patriotiſm, religion and liberty, conſpiring the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal weal of preſent and future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And may heaven ſmile upon it appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation for it's walls and buſwarks!</p>
            <p>IN ſome reſpects we have ſuffered difficulties which no part of the United States of America have. We may therefore prize liberty the higher, and taſte is the ſweeter.</p>
            <p>FROM the beginning of our ſettling in this late howling wilderneſs, we have groaned under Britiſh tyranny. How dark and gloomy that diſmal day when theſe infant plantations fell under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of New-York, whoſe officers being the tools of the crown, were no leſs arbitrary and cruel, in their unrighteous oppreſſions of poor people, in the midſt of all the natural and neceſſary hardſhips of a new ſettlement, than the ſavage tyrant of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland their patron?</p>
            <p>OUR legal Charters have been demanded of us, whereby our lawful poſſeſſions have fallen into their unjuſt hands: and enormous ſums demanded for their patents. Honeſt and virtuous people ſued out of their proper inheritance; others driven to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016019_0030_0F9B25B6022BFFF0"/>
the laſt extremities by the force of their murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arms, The moſt infamous men, who neither <hi>feared God,</hi> or <hi>regarded man,</hi> have been placed over us in the moſt important offices, from whom we could not expect mercy or juſtice.</p>
            <p>As to religion, it ſeems to have been a thing the leaſt known or regarded in their courts and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. And through the State the Lord's day has been, by a great part of rich and poor, a day of ſports and recreations. No proviſion was made for the ſupport of religion, but miniſters have been left to all the hardſhips of a miſſion among Savages, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the charities of a ſmall number of more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good people whoſe lot fell among them. And truly ſuch things muſt be very diſagreeable to a virtuous people, brought up in the religious States of New-England, as the preſent inhabitants of this new State were. Such, and much more, have been our troubles under the crown officers of that State, And the conſtitution and laws, ſince adopted by them, give the ſtrongeſt evidence of the ſame arbitrary principles yet remaining. Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be God who has looked upon our affiction, and given us a happy deliverance from that iron yoke.</p>

            <p>Truly worthy, and much honored Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>You have a moſt weighty and important part of government aſſigned you, by the freemen at the State. Legiſlation requires great wiſdom and ſkill. Laws ſhould be framed and ſuitably adapted to the conſtitution, the neceſſities and conveniencies of the people; very plain and explicit to prevent, as much as poſſible, diſputes, and that juſtice may be done in giving judgement.</p>

            <p>AND as Chriſt is your Lord and King, you will pay a due regard to his laws. You will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to ſeek the true ſenſe and ſpirit of them, heartily to believe and obey them, and to ſet them always before you as an excellent guide in the framing of every law tor the State.</p>

            <p>WE heartily commend you, Sirs, to him that is able to keep you, and to guide you by his unerring counſel in the great work before you; ſo that it may hereafter be ſaid of this State, in ſome good ſenſe, as the inſpired law-giver of lſrael, <hi>What na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ements ſo righteous as all their law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY I would with all due deference ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the Executive authority of the State.</p>
            <p>Worthy and honored Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>You are God's miniſters. Dread title! The ſword you wear is the ſword of the Lord; the ſword of juſtice to keep the peace of the State, and of each part within your province. The eyes of all, within the State, look up to you for juſtice. And may the ſupreme Executive power, and all our judges and juſtices of the peace keep in view the infinitely great and ſupreme Judge <hi>by whom all the judges of the Earth do rule,</hi> and ever ſhake their hands from holding bribes.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me, Sirs, to ſay we expect, and, what is inconceivably greater, Chriſt our ſovereign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that each of you be terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well.</p>
            <p>WE truſt the honorable Legiſlature will furniſh you with good and wholeſome laws, without which we cannot expect you can do much. And may we hope, Gentlemen, that the general complaint, which haſ been long in England, and in all parts of this,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016019_0034_0F9B25B878C1F7E0"/>
country, more or leſs, may never be heard among us, The want of juſtice.</p>
            <p>No man can number all the good and wholſome laws that have been made in England and this country, againſt all ſorts of vice, and that juſtice might be done for the public, and between man and man; and yet how has vice appeared with it's brazen face, in open effrontery of all law and juſtice? And what multitudes have ſuffered for want of a ſpeedy execution of juſtice? And the public has ſuffered through a careleſs negligence, bribes, vicious rulers, or the artifices of bribed and perjured attornies.</p>
            <p>MAY Heaven prevent ſuch abuſes among us! And may you, Gentlemen, and your ſucceſſors, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exert youſelves to do juſtice and judgment How worthy the practical obſervation of all rulers is the charge of good Jehoſhaphat? <hi>And he ſaid to the judges, Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord who is with you in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you: take heed and do it; for there is no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, not taking of gifts.—Thus ſhall ye do in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xix. 6—1O.</note> We wiſh you much wiſdom and fortitude, and heartily pray you may go on and proſper in the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice and judgment, and that you may <hi>have boldneſs in the day of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY, I would, in the next place, addreſs the freemen of the State.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, you are as free citizens, and the whole power of the State falls yearly into your hands. Remember the ſolemn oath you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016019_0035_0F9B25B938EFDDE0"/>
in the great name of the ever living God, and be not ſwayed by intereſt, party or prejudice, in giving your ſuffrages.</p>
            <p>IF you have a proper ſenſe of the great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and worth of our priviledges, you will look for men of God, <hi>men of truth, able men, ſuch as fear God and hate covetouſneſs,</hi> and give your votes for ſuch from time to time.</p>
            <p>A good conſtitution, all Liberty worth the name, and every thing dear and ſacred may ſoon be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by wicked deſigning men, who are ever gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for places of preferment and profit.</p>
            <p>IT is a great deal you put into the hands of your repreſentatives. And men of no virtue, no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or conſcience cannot be truſted, but with the greateſt peril.</p>
            <p>AND be intreated, Sirs, to ſeek the peace and proſperity of your towns, and of the whole State: and labor to promote and encourage every virtue among yourſelves, and the ſuppreſſion of every vice. And, of what importance is it to yourſelves and poſterity, that your houſes be nurſeries of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and devotion? As alſo, that you ſpare not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducate your children in uſeful learning and the principles of our holy religion? Like faithful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, command your children and your houſholds after you to keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> xviii.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND how neceſſary is it, dear Sirs, that you ſettle able and faithful miniſters of Chriſt in your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral towns; that you and your children may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a preached goſpel, and all it's ordinances and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016019_0036_0F9B25B9F8FE4948"/>
inſtitutions according to the mind of Chriſt. And remember for your encouragement, that <hi>Bleſſed are the people that know the joyful ſound.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>ONCE more, and above all. I beſeech you to bow to our glorious ſovereign prince. And may Chriſt our King reign in our hearts, in his ſweet and benign influence! May he be crowned King upon the throne of your ſouls, and ſway his ſweet and peaceful ſcepter there forever! Happy it would be to ſee his kingdom of grace flouriſhing in this State; and many flocking round his ſtandard. Chriſt reigns in providence, and in grace: and he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he is lovely in both. How glorious is that kingdom which conſiſts in righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt? How tranſcendently ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and lovely the King of glory, by whom kings reign, having all power in Heaven and in Earth! <hi>Thy kingdom come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, I would offer a word to my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend brethren in the miniſtry.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> xvii. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend and dear Sirs,</p>
            <p>IT is a peculiarly ſweet conſideration to us, that our divine lord and maſter has <hi>all power in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> and for this very purpoſe <hi>that be ſhould give eternal life to us many as the Father has given him.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The Addreſs to the Miniſters, omitted in the Delivery, by reaſon that none of the Miniſters of the State were preſent, takes it's place in the Publication.</hi>
               </note> This is the great end of his providential government. And as he is able, ſo he will moſt certainly accompliſh it. He will govern all things, all nations and all occurrences in providence of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name and nature, ſo as to conduce to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home his people in a thorough converſion, and their final and compleat glorification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:016019_0037_0F9B25BAB89D2A00"/>WE have but little encouragement from viſibility at preſent. All things outward look dark. It is a dark day on account of the unnatural war: a darker on account of the great wickedneſs of the country, Alaſs! the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, profanity, uncleanneſs and Sabbath breaking through the land. O, what a lamentable decay of vital piety, family religion and government! How ſeldom do we find any enquiring the way to Zion! The ſpirit of conviction and converſion ſeems apparently to have left the country almoſt univerſally. The wiſe virgins are ſlumbering and ſleeping with the fooliſh. Such an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable hardneſs of heart prevails, that no judgments of Heaven ſeem to make any impreſſion on the wicked; but everyday they grow more obdurate and inſenſible. The moſt awakening, melting and alarming diſcourſes from the ſacred deſk are rather derided than regarded. Surely theſe things are heavy on the hearts of Chriſt's miniſters, But although Satan rages, <hi>the Lord reigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now my brethren how are we? What ſenſe have we of theſe things? Have we let down our watch with others? Can we content ourſelves without the ſpirit and energy of religion in our own ſouls, and to ſee it prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the people? O, why are we not up in good earneſt? Why are we not importunate in our prayers? Pungent and preſſing in our applications? Unwearied in our labors night and day? Surely there is enough in Chriſt, enough in his ſweet promiſes to encourage and ſtrengthen our faith, <hi>Lo I am with you always, even to the end of the world. I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come unto you. I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and way bleſſing upon thine offspring.</hi> We may therefore look for great things from our Lord. And in due time we ſhall reap if we faint not.</p>
            <p>ONE thing more I would obſerve, <hi>The laborers are few,</hi> very few in this infant State, and at preſent but little proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of many additions. Let us pray the Lord of the harveſt to ſend forth laborers into his harveſt. And while there is ſuch a paucity of miniſters in the State, are we not called in providence, to double our labors among the people ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the wilderneſs as ſheep without a ſhepherd?</p>
            <p>IT is indeed ſadly true that many appear to have but
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:016019_0038_0F9B25BB7A118638"/>
little regard to the miniſtry, having imbibed groſs errors and corrupt opinions, contrary to the doctrine which is according to Godlineſs. Yet in dependance upon our great Lord and maſter, we may be inſtrumental of winning ſome to Chriſt, and of preventing many more from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their perniciuos ways.</p>
            <p>WE cannot prevent, diverſity of opinions, or the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt errors; neit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> can the State. Our part is faithfully to deliver all the counſel of God in public and in private, and to commit all to our ſovereign Lord, in quiet reſignation to his will. He governs all things civil and religion.</p>
            <p>We cannot reaſonably deſire but that every one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> joy the free liberty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conſcience. It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> evident that many abuſe it. Yea they abuſe both that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious liberty; yet we ſhould rejoice that thre is ſuch a precious priviledge granted us. And after uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our beſt endeavours they muſt be left to their own maſters, to whom they ſtand or fall. God is the judge.</p>
            <p>IT is a very plain caſe that many people in the preſent day, have very abſurd notions of Liberty, as if it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ed in a right for every one to believe, do, or act as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in all things civil, and religious. This is a <hi>Libertime</hi> principle. No man has any ſight, before God, to believe or practice contrary to ſcripture. And Liberty conſiſts in a freedom to do that which is right. The great law of nature, the moral law, is the rule of right action. This is the rule of moral and civil Liberty. Man's fall has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away his freedom of right action; for <hi>whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> In the kingdom of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Chriſt gives a civil freedom: in the kingdom of grace he gives a ſpiritual freedom. The Goſpel is <hi>the perfect Law of Liberty</hi>; and this lays the foundation for a perfect moral freedom. It is the ſpiritual freedom we are eſpecially concerned to ſeek among the people. And for this we ſhould labor with the greateſt painfulneſs.</p>
            <p>How ſorrowful, that a free people, in a civil ſenſe ſhould be the ſervants and ſlaves of ſin and ſatan? O that he who was anointed to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the priſon to them, that are bound would ſpeedily accompliſh this happy deliverance, and moſt glorious freedom! Let us pray for the peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. And may the bleſſing of many that are ready to periſh come upon us.</p>
