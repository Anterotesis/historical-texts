         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I view the original right, power and <hi>Charter,</hi> confirm'd, ſealed, and ratified to the Province, or Inhabitants of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and its ſtanding in full force, and unrepealed for more than an hundred years; which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:—
<q>Be it enacted, that no freeman, ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or deprived of his freehold, or liberty, or free cuſtom, or be out-law'd, or exil'd, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſtroy'd, nor ſhall be oppreſſed, judged or condemned, but by the Law of this Colony.—And that no man of what ſtate or condition ſoever, ſhall be put out of his lands or Tenements, nor taken, nor impriſoned, nor diſinherited, nor BANISHED, (obſerve this my Lord,) nor any ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, or MOLESTED, without being, for it, brought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by a due courſe of Law of this COLONY:</q>
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, that even your Lordſhip, will not blame them if they ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherein they were made free.</p>
            <p>As a fly, or a worm, by the law of nature, has as great a right to Liberty, and Freedom, (according to their little
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013015_0004_0F8FB06A8E915AD8"/>
ſphere in life,) as the moſt potent monarch upon the earth: And as there can be no other difference between your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and myſelf, but what is political, I therefore, without any further apology, take leave to aſk your Lordſhip, whether any one that fears GOD, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> as himſelf, (which is the true Scripture-mark of a chriſtian,) will OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESS his fellow-creatures? if they will, where are the beauties of Chriſtianity? Not to be ſeen in this life, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be ſeen in the next.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſeen what is ſaid to be an authenticated copy of your Lordſhip's Letter to the Govenor of Rhode-Iſland, in which there are ſuch DICTATIONS. DIRECTIONS, and poſſitive COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDS, to oppreſs, with tyranny, a <hi>free People,</hi> which is inconſiſtent with a good man, or a Chriſtian to have any concern or agency therein. The law of GOD directs us to do unto others, as we would they ſhould do unto us. And knowing that your Lordſhip is well acquainted with the Divine Oracles, having had the honour to dine at your Lordſhip's Seat, in Staffordſhire, and was, when in England, perſonally acquainted with Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> your Lordſhip's Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and with the good and pious Character your Lordſhip bears. I therefore take this leave (as fellow-chriſtian, as one that loves, as the higheſt happineſs of his exiſtence, the <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Spirit,</hi> and LIFE of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>) to aſk your Lordſhip, how your Lordſhip would like to have his Birth-right, Liberty and freedom, as an Engliſhman, taken away by his King, or by the Miniſtry, or both? Would not your Lordſhip im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſay, it was Tyranny, Oppreſſion and Diſtruction, by a diſpotic power? Would not your Lordſhip be ready to alarm the Nation; and point out the STATE upon the brink of diſtruction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My LORD,</hi> ARE not the Liberties of the Americans as dear to them as thoſe of Britons? Suppoſe your Lordſhip had broke the Laws of his King, and Country; would not your Lordſhip be willing to be try'd by a Jury of your peers, according to the Laws of the land? How would your Lordſhip like to be fetter'd with irons, and drag'd three thouſand miles, in a hell upon earth? No! but in a HELL upon water <note n="*" place="bottom">Through a Man of War's crew.</note>, to take your trial? is not this contrary to the ſpirit of the law, and the rights
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:013015_0005_0F8FB06B49479C40"/>
of an Engliſhman? Yet thus you have given direction, as the King's Agent, or the agent of the Miniſtry, to deſtroy the rights and laws of the Americans. How your Lordſhip can anſwer for this agency of injuſtice before GOD, and Man, will be very difficult: However, if great men, and good men, and Chriſtians can dare to do ſuch things as theſe (when in power,) Heaven grant that I may have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> acquaintance with them in this world; or if they have any power in Heaven, not in the world to come; for I think, my Lord, that ſuch men, who will take away the Rights of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are neither fit for Heaven, nor Earth, either fit for the Land or the Dunghil.</p>
            <p>YOUR Lordſhip lets us know that the caſe of the burning the Gaſpee Schooner has been laid before the law ſervants of the Crown, and that they make the crime of a deeper die than piracy, namely, an act of high treaſon, and levying a war againſt the King.</p>
            <p>WELL my Lord, and ſuppoſing this to be the caſe, are not the Rhode-Iſlanders ſubjects to the King of Great-Britain? Has not the King his attorney, his courts of judicatory to decide matters between the King and the ſubjects? Why then muſt there be New Courts of admiralty erected to appoint and order the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to be confin'd, and drag'd away three thouſand miles, from their families, laws, rights and liberties, to be tried by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Do you think my Lord, this is right in the ſight of God and Man? I think if the Rhode Iſlanders ſuffer this infringement of their liberties, granted them by their Charter, from the King of England, any place out of Hell is good enough for them, for was there ever ſuch cruelty, injuſtice and barbarity ever united againſt a free people before, and my Lord Dartmouth to have an hand in it, from whom we might rather have expected mildneſs, mercy, and the rights of the people ſupported.</p>
            <p>YOUR Lordſhip's letter frequently reminds us that this deſtructive authority, (to deſtroy the lives and liberties of the people) is his Majeſty's will and pleaſure.—How far his Majeſty may be influenc'd and dictated by his Miniſtry I will not take upon me to ſay, but that it is his Majeſty's will and pleaſure of his own mind and conſent, I will not believe a word of it, for his Majeſty is a perſon of more tenderneſs and underſtanding, than to attempt ſuch tyranny, beſides, his attempt to deſtroy the Rights of the People—deſtroys his Right as King to reign over them, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:013015_0006_0F8FB06BF61F54D8"/>
to his Coronation oath, he has no longer a Right to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Crown or Throne, than he maintains inviolable firm the Laws and Rights of the People. For violating the people's rights, Charles Steward, King of England loſt his Head, and if another King, who is more ſolemnly bound than ever Charles Steward was, ſhould tread in the ſame ſteps, what can he expect? I reverence and love my King, but I rever the rights of an Engliſhman before the authority of any King upon the Earth. I diſtinguiſh greatly between a King and a Tyrant, a King is the guardian and truſtee of the rights and laws of the people, but a Tyrant deſtroys them.</p>
            <p>BESIDES my Lord, the inhabitants of America know as well
<q>as the people of England, that the people are the right and fountain of power and authority, the original ſeat of Majeſty— the Author of laws, and the creators of officers to execute them. And if at any time they ſhall find the power they have conferred abuſed by their TRUSTEES, their MAJESTY violated by tyranny, or by uſurpation, their authority proſtituted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>violence,</hi> or ſkreen <hi>corruption,</hi> the laws grown pernicious through accidents unforeſeen, or rendered ineffectual through the infidelity of the executors of them. Then it is their RIGHT and what is their right, is undoubtedly their priviledge and duty, (as their eſſential power and Majeſty) to reſume that delegated power and authority they intruſted them with, and call their truſtees to an ACCOUNT; to reſiſt the uſurpation, and extirpate the tyranny; to reſtore their ſullied MAJESTY and their proſtituted AUTHORITY; to ſuſpend, alter or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate thoſe laws, and puniſh the unfaithful and corrupt officers. Nor is it the duty only of the united body but EVERY member of it ought, according to his reſpective rank, power and weight in the community, to CONCUR in advancing thoſe glorious deſigns.</q>—<q>This is my Lord the happy conſtitution of England, the power, right and Majeſty of the people which has been frequently recognized and eſtabliſhed. By which Majeſty, right and power, Kings are made, and UNMADE by the choice of the people; and laws enacted, and <hi>annulled</hi> only by their own conſent, in which none can be deprived of their property, abridged of their <hi>freedom,</hi> or <hi>forfeit</hi> their lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an appeal to the laws, and the verdict of their Peers or equals.</q>
—My Lord, as this is according to the laws of England, the liberty, priviledge and power of his Majeſty's ſubjects in Great-Britain, why not then the priviledge of his Majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:013015_0007_0F8FB06D2EBA6700"/>
in America? has his Majeſty (as it ſeems to be all laid upon him) two kind of laws, one for England and the other for <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> a power to reign as King and guardian of his people's rights at home, and a power to deſtroy the rights of the Colonies abroad? I really don't underſtand it my Lord, if he has no right to do it, why does he do it? If you ſay the king does not do it, why do you ſay he does? This is uſing his Majeſty cruel. However ſomebody does it, your Lordſhip ſays it is his Majeſty with his Privy Counſel, the latter I rather think. However be it who it will, whether the <hi>King, Miniſtry</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> they have no more right to do it, than they have to cut your Lordſhip's throat. Has not your Lordſhip a right to oppoſe any power that may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault your Lordſhip's Perſon, right or privilege, without its been deem'd rebellion againſt the King and ſtate?—Yes, ſure you have! Then ſurely my Lord an American has the ſame right to oppoſe every uſurping power (let it be from whom it will) that aſſaults his perſon, or deprives him of his own law or liberty as an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican. Has he <hi>offended,</hi> yes! Is he willing to be tried by his own laws? yes! Then that man, that King, that miniſter of ſtate, be who he will, is worſe than a Nero TYRANT that ſhall aſſume to drag him three thouſand miles to be tried by his ENEMIES.</p>
            <p>BESIDES my Lord, what is <hi>rebellion,</hi> if I underſtand it right, they are perſons riſing up with an aſſumed authority and power to act, dictate and rule in direct violation to the laws of the land—I believe my Lord, I am right here for this reaſon, your General FANNING, and your Governor TRYON when in North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, thought ſo, and like cruel blood thirſty <hi>ſavages,</hi> murdered mankind for thinking that they had a right to oppoſe any power that attempted to deſtroy their LIBERTIES. This was my Lord a cruel barbarous ſlaughter of mankind—However, if it was deemed rebellion in them, and they were treated as <hi>rebels,</hi> bacauſe they (as the miniſtry ſaid) broke the laws of the government of the Province; then ſurely it follows, that the King's Miniſtry and Parliament muſt be REBELS, to God and mankind, in attempting to overthrow, (by guns, by ſwords, by the power of war) the laws, and government of Rhode-Iſland. Have not the Rhode-Iſlanders as much right to the privileges of their own laws, as the King of England has to his Crown? ſure they have! Then ſurely, that man muſt be a tyrant in his ſoul, that ſhall deem it rebellion in the Rhode-Iſlanders, ſuppoſing they ſhould kill every man, that ſhall attempt to deſtroy their laws, rights and liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:013015_0008_0F8FB06D8E759578"/>IT is true my Lord, the Gaſpee Schooner is deſtroyed, and thereby the Laws of England are violated, (as you apprehend,) by Indians out of the woods, or by Rhode-Iſlanders, I cannot ſay who; but it is a query with me my Lord, whether there is any Law broke in burning the Gaſpee Schooner; if it was done by the INDIANS (which is the current report) then there is no Law broke; for the Scripture ſays, "<hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> And it is well known, that the Indians were never under any Law to the Engliſh; did I ſay, they were never under any Law to the Engliſh, Heaven forgive me! I mean my Lord no other Law, than the Sword and Bayonet; the ſame law that ſome would fain bring the Americans under now. But ſuppoſe my Lord, that this deed was done by the Rhode-Iſlanders, the query is ſtill with me—whether there is any tranſgreſſion committed? the Scripture ſays, where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion: Now, the queſtion is, do the Rhode-Iſlanders receive their Laws from England? if ſo, there is a tranſgreſſion committed againſt thoſe Laws, but if not, there is no tranſgreſſion, for where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion, ſays St. James. For my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how any Man in America, can properly break the Laws of England. The whole lies here, the laws of America only are broke, let the offender then be try'd by the law he has broke, what can juſtice, I had almoſt ſaid <hi>tyrany</hi> deſire more. However my Lord, there is another idea ariſes in my mind, (and it is no wonder, for the Boſtonians are very notional) which is, if there is any law broke, it is the King and the miniſtry who have broke it; for I would be glad to know my Lord, what right the King and miniſtry has to ſend an armed Schooner to Rhode-Iſland, to take away the property of the people, any more than they have to ſend an armed Schooner into <hi>Breſt,</hi> and demand the property of France. Know this, that the King of England has no more right, according to the laws of God and nature, to claim the lands of America, than he has the lands of France—America, my Lord, in the native rights of the Americans, it is the blood bought treaſure of their forefathers; and they have the ſame eſſential right to their <hi>native laws,</hi> as they have to the air they breath in, or to the light of the morning, when the ſun riſes; and therefore they who oppreſs the Americans muſt be as great enemies to the rights of the laws of nature, as they who would (if it were in their power) vail the light of the ſun from the univerſe. Remember my Lord, the Americans have
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:013015_0009_0F8FB06E39476038"/>
a privilege to boaſt of above all the world. They never were in bondage to any man, and therefore it is more for them to give up their RIGHTS, than it is for all Europe to give up their RIGHTS into the hands of the TURKS; conſider what Engliſh tyranny their forefathers fled from, what ſeas of diſtreſs they met with? what ſavages they fought with? what blood-bought treaſures, as the dear inheritance of their lives, they have left to their children. Without any aid from the King of England; and yet after this, theſe free-born people muſt be counted REBELS, if they will not looſe every right of Liberty, which their forefathers bought with their blood, and ſubmit again to engliſh miniſterial <hi>tyranny</hi>—O America! O America!</p>
            <p>MY Lord, I hope I need not remind your Lordſhip of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry that the divine Meſſiah made to PETER, when they required a tax, or tribute, from him. Of whom, ſays CHRSIT, to PETER, do they gather tax, or tribute, of the children, or of ſtrangers? And PETER ſaid, of ſtrangers: Then, ſays CHRIST, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are FREE. Now, the Gaſpee Schooner, my Lord, was a ſtranger; and they ſhould, if it was in their commiſſion, have gathered tax from ſtrangers: But inſtead of which, they would gather it from the children. They forgot that the <hi>children were free</hi>: Therefore, my Lord, it muſt certainly be, that the Gaſpee Schooner has committed the tranſgreſſion, and broke the Laws, of the freedom of this country. No doubt, my Lord, but they have a right to tax the ſtrangers, that come to dwell in their country; but to tax the children, which are free in their own native country, this will not do! Nature forbids it; the law of GOD condemns it. And no law, but that of tyranny, can deſire it.</p>
            <p>And therefore it was, my Lord, that the children, (who are by the law of GOD, and the law of nature FREE) looked upon the Gaſpee Schooner as a ſtranger, as ſuch they treated her; but when the ſtranger attempted to gather tax of the children who are free, then they looked upon her, as a <hi>Pirate,</hi> who took away their property without their conſent, by violence, by arms, by <hi>guns,</hi> by <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>damnations</hi>: This they thought looked ſo like <hi>Piracy,</hi> that the children did not like it; and they thought their behavior as ſtrangers was very <hi>unpolite,</hi> that they could not ſo much as paſs by theſe ſtrangers, but the children muſt bow to them, and come to them; this the children, being free, did not like, and they thought it was beſt for the children, and the ſtrangers, all to be free: And therefore, one night, my Lord, they went and ſet the ſtrangers, (who, by the way, where all priſoners) free—free
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:013015_0010_0F8FB06F0678F3B0"/>
upon the face of the whole earth; and then to preſerve them free, they burnt their priſon. Now, my Lord, would it not be hard to hang theſe poor men for it? However,</p>
            <p>If there is any law broke, it is this, that the Gaſpee Schooner, by the power of the Engliſh miniſtry and admiralty have broke the laws, and taken away the rights of the Americans. And yet the Americans muſt be puniſh'd for it, contrary to their own laws. O! Amazing! I would be glad to know my Lord, what right the King of England has to America, it cannot be an hereditary right that lies in <hi>Hanover,</hi> it cannot be a parliamentary right that lies in Britain, not a victorious right, for the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land never conquered America. Then he can have no more right to America, than what the people have, by compact, inveſted him with, which is only a power to protect them, and defend their rights civil and religious; and to ſign, ſeal, and confirm as their ſteward ſuch laws as the people of America ſhall conſent to. If this be the caſe, my Lord, then judge whether the King of England and the miniſtry are not the tranſgreſſors in this affair, in ſending <hi>armed Schooners</hi> to America, to ſteal by power and ſword the people's property. And if any are to be try'd for law-break<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers, it ſurely ought, in juſtice, to be them. But the people of AMERICA act my Lord very honeſt in the affair, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to GIVE and TAKE, to give the Engliſh offenders the liberty to be try'd by their own laws, and to take the ſame liberty wherein they have offended to be tried by their own laws, they ſurely have as much right to the privileges of their own laws, as the King of England has to his Crown, or that the natives of Britain has to the rights of an Engliſhman.—Conſider then, my Lord, how <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ul, how UNJUST, how unanſwerable before God and Man it muſt be, by any violence and power to deſtroy the rights of the Americans.</p>
            <p>MY Lord, the cloſe of your Lordſhip's letter, is ſuch that is enough to make the blood of every vein ſtand <hi>ſtagnated</hi> as a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt miniſterial bloody power.

the people's rights? Stop a little my Lord, give a little breathing time—for it is a ſolemn thing to die. I wonder your Lordſhip's knees did not ſmite together when as the King's, or miniſterial agent, you wrote this authority, how a good man, a chriſtian, and one that fears God, can be an agent not only to deſtroy the rights of a people, but to oppreſs them, with the military power of blood and death, is enough to make the Earth to reel, and all Heaven to ſtand aghaſt! Be aſtoniſh'd O ye Heavens at this! I hope, my Lord, you do not intend to renew that bloody, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſſaſſination in <hi>America</hi> which I ſaw the <hi>Scotch barbarian troops</hi> thro' the orders of Lord B—n and Lord W—h ſpread in St. George's helds, remember the blood of young Allen cries to Heaven for vengeance in their face, and a louder voice than Abel's blood, which cry'd to Heav'n for vengeance, is ſtill heard in Boſton ſtreets, againſt a bloody military power, and tho' the murderers eſcaped by a ſcene well known to ſome, but too dark to explain—Yet the God of truth &amp; juſtice ſtands at the door. Suppoſing my Lord, that the Rhode-Iſlanders, for the ſake of the blood bought liberties of their forefathers, for the ſake of the birthrights of their children, ſhould ſhew a ſpirit of reſentment againſt a tyrannical arbitrary power that attempts to deſtroy their lives, liberties and property, would it not be unſufferable, cruel, for this (which the law of nature and nations teaches them to do) to be butchered, aſſaſſinated and ſlaughtered in their own ſtreets by their own King? Conſider, my Lord, that we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, and that it would be a <hi>cold cordial</hi> for your Lordſhip at the bar of God, to have thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Americans riſe up in judgment againſt you. Yet I would rather this was the caſe, tho' I ſuffer'd death with them, than they ſhould loſe their eſſential rights as Americans.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be meet to let your Lordſhip know, that if the Americans unite (as there ſeems a good proſpect of it) to ſtand as a <hi>band of brethren</hi> for their liberties, they have aright, by the law of GOD, of nature, and of nations, to reluctant, and even to reſiſt any military &amp; marine force, ſurely they muſt be intended in readineſs for the <hi>French</hi> not for Americans, for can it ever enter into the heart of a mother to murder her children? of a King to kill his ſubjects? of an agent to deſtroy the rights of the <hi>Colonies</hi> he repreſents? But, ſuppoſe my Lord, that this ſhould be the bloody intent of the miniſtry, to make the Americans ſubject to their <hi>ſlavery,</hi> then let <hi>blood</hi> for <hi>blood, life</hi> for <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>death</hi>

for <hi>death</hi> decide the contention. This bloody ſcene can never be executed but at the expence of the deſtruction of England, and you will find my Lord, that the Americans will not ſubmit <hi>to be</hi> SLAVES, they know the uſe of the gun and the military art as well as any of his Majeſty's troops at St. James's, and where his Majeſty has one ſoldier, who art in general the refuſe of the earth, America can produce fifty, free men, and all volunteers, and raiſe a more potent army of men in three weeks, than England can in three years. But God forbid that I ſhould be thought to aim at rouzing the Americans to arms, without their rights, liberties and oppreſſion call for it. For they are unwilling to beat to Arms, they are loyal ſubjects; they love their King; they love their Mother-Country; they call it their HOME; and wiſh nothing more than the proſperity of Britain, and the glory of their King: But they will not give up their rights; they will not be ſlaves to any power upon Earth. Therefore, my Lord, as a peace-maker; as their agent; as their friend, lay their grievance before their King.— Let the Americans enjoy their birthright, bleſſings, and Britain her proſperity, let there be a mutual union between the mother and her children, in all the bleſſings of life, trade and happineſs; then, my Lord, both Britons, and Americans, will call you bleſſed.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE faithfulneſs of the prophet <hi>Micah</hi>; the fidelity of his heart, and the zeal of his ſoul for the liberties of the people, was remarkable. His faithfulneſs when <hi>tyranny</hi> reigned by authority;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013015_0014_0F8FB072F8D869F8"/>
when the laws, rights and liberties of the people were at the diſpoſe of the arbitary power of the wicked king AHAZ, as it is written 2 Chron. 28.1.
<q>And Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and be reigned ſixteen years in Jeruſalem, but he did not that which was right in the ſight of the Lord; like David his father. Ver. <hi>19.</hi> For the Lord brought Judah low, becauſe of Ahaz king of Iſrael, for he made Judah naked and tranſgreſſed ſore againſt the Lord, ver. <hi>22.</hi> And in the time of this diſtreſs did he treſpaſs yet more and more againſt the Lord—this is that king <hi>AHAZ.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore this faithful prophet lays the matter to heart, as one that rever'd the liberties and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people above the authority of the king, and the power of his <hi>ſenates.</hi> And therefore ſays in the verſe preceding the text,
<q>The good man is periſhed out of the earth, and there is none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right among men, they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with a net,</q>
and is not the caſe at <hi>this</hi> day? for what is the miniſtry hunting after now, is not every one hunting for their brother, with the NET of admiralty courts and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny? if they can but once get their American brethren in this <hi>net,</hi> they may kick and flirt as long as they will, they'll never get out no more. It is indeed ſaid "In vain is the net ſpread in the ſight of the bird" and that he has made us wiſer than the fowls of the air, but wherein will the Americans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be wiſer than the fowls of the air, if they ſuffer themſelves to be taken in this miniſterial <hi>net?</hi>

<q>The beſt of them is a brier, and the moſt upright of them ſharper than a thorn hedge—the day of the watchmen, and thy viſitation cometh, now ſhall be their perplexity.</q>
And is not this the caſe? Is not the day of the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of America come, who watch for the rights of the people, as the centinels of the land, to defend them from every invaſion of power and deſtruction? Now their viſitation in Providence is come—to try the watchmen whether they will ſtand for God, and the people, or not Now ſhall be their perplexity of the miniſtry, who lie in wait for blood and hunt every man his brother with a net, who utter their miſchievous deſire, and ſo <hi>they wrap it up.</hi>—For this faithfulneſs, in king Ahaz, and Hezekiah's days, the prophet Micah's name has a ſingular honor in the annals of Heaven above the reſt of the prophets in Iſrael—Jer. 17, 18, 19. becauſe he ſaid—"hear this I pray you ye heads of the houſe of Jacob, and <hi>Princes</hi> of the houſe of Iſrael, that abhor judgment and pervert all equity.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, thoſe ſayings of that pious prelate of the church of England, biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his hiſtory of his own time, are noble, valuable and great, eſpecially were he ſays,
<q>that there is not any thing more certain than this: That kings are <hi>made</hi> for
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013015_0016_0F8FB07448E9A978"/>
the <hi>people,</hi> and not the people for them.</q>
Was not <hi>David</hi> made a king for the people? Was not <hi>Saul?</hi> Was not <hi>Solomon?</hi> Then let not kings think too highly of themſelves; for the GOD of heaven never intended they ſhould be any more than the <hi>ſervants</hi> of the <hi>people</hi>; therefore the biſhop adds,
<q>that, perhaps, there is no nation under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more ſenſible of this than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation; ſo that, if the <hi>prince</hi> does not govern, by this maxim, the <hi>people</hi> will ſoon grow very unkind to him.</q>
If this be the caſe, the king of England may imediately ſee the reaſon of all his peoples hard ſpeeches, and unkindneſs to him: It is becauſe he has departed, either by inclination, or perſuaſion, from this royal STANDARD. Therefore he adds,
<q>the intereſt, and eſſential RULE for a king, is to <hi>ſtudy</hi> the intereſt of the nation; to be ever in it; to be always purſuing it:</q>
This will lay ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of confidence in HIM, that he will ever be ſafe in the PEOPLE, while they <hi>feel</hi> they are ſafe in him; and not a moment longer. So that if the king of England is not happy, let him thank himſelf for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not his people's <hi>fault</hi>—it is his OWN For that king is not worthy to reign, that does not make the RIGHTS of his people the rule of all his actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowing this, that HE receives all his <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>majeſty,</hi> from them; and how can he think that he has any right to <hi>rule</hi> over them, unleſs he rules in their <hi>hearts</hi> by inviolable maintaining their RIGHTS? For as the miniſters of the goſpel (when in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place) are no otherwiſe than the people's <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> ſo the king is no more than the ſervant of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013015_0017_0F8FB075858E16B0"/>
the people: And when, at any time, he is unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the people <hi>Servant,</hi> they have a right to ſay to him, "give an account of thy <hi>ſtewardſhip,</hi> that thou mayeſt be no longer <hi>ſteward.</hi> For what can he judge, when a free, and an affectionate people, lay their <hi>grievances,</hi> with <hi>tears,</hi> at his feet, praying, for years paſt, for redreſs? and yet he will not hear them!!! Or if he does, he anſwers them, like <hi>Rehoboham</hi>—ROUGHLY: What can he expect, but <hi>Rehoboham</hi>'s revolution?
<q>what part have we in <hi>David</hi>? Or what portion have we in the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe</hi>? Every man to thy tent, O Iſrael.</q>
And therefore, the pious biſhop further obſerves,
<q>that a <hi>Prince</hi> that would command the affections, and praiſe of the nation, ſhould not ſtudy to <hi>stretch</hi> his prerogative;</q> here I think the pious biſhop miſſed it, for it is not his prerogative, but the people's; and this is what makes it ſo <hi>unſufferable,</hi> and <hi>unbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> that the king ſhould make uſe of their <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>prerogative,</hi> to deſtroy their <hi>rights:</hi>
This <hi>Charles Steward</hi> did, and he fell into the hands of wicked men, and they cut of his head for it.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the words of the Text.
<q>That they may do evil with both hands earneſtly; the Prince aſketh, and the Judge aſketh, for a reward, and the great man he uttereth his miſchievovs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:</q> So they wrap it up.</p>
            <p>Obſervation the firſt.</p>
            <p>IT is then plain that a craving, abſolute <hi>Prince,</hi> is a great diſtreſs to a people.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:013015_0018_0F8FB075C258C8C8"/>THE Prince <hi>aſketh</hi>! What does he aſk for? Why the tall pine trees, for maſts for his great ſhips; well, let him have them, not as his right, no, but as your gift to him Well, but the prince aſketh? Well, what does he aſk now? Why, that the britiſh ſtreets may be paved with american gold; well do not make a word about that? let him have it, but let it be in the fair way of trade, and commerce, not by taxation, and oppreſſion. The eſſence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, lies, in what money buys. This, England can furniſh you with.</p>
            <p>BUT the Prince <hi>asketh?</hi> Well what is it? will he never have done aſking? What does he <hi>ask</hi> now? Have patience, and you ſhall hear, well what is it? Why it is the favour of the government of Rhode-Iſland, to hold a court of <hi>admiralty</hi> to authorize them to confine ſuſpected perſons, (guilty or not guilty) and drag them away three thouſand miles, to take their trial by a jury of ſtrangers, if not enemies. But the granting of this in ſome meaſure depends upon the conſent of the governor. But all governors (who are worthy the name) are ſuch as the ſcripture deſcribes Judges 5.9. "My heart, ſays one, nay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry American will ſay the ſame, is towards the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours who offer themſelves willingly among the people," to rule by their laws, to defend the rights of the people, to protect their perſons, to ſecure their liberties. And this is (we hear) the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, power and bulwark of Rhode-Iſland govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For its ſafety lies in this, that the <hi>Governor</hi> of the province, and the judges of the ſuperior court, the repreſentatives of the people, and general <hi>aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:013015_0019_0F8FB076866D91A0"/>
are ſolemnly bound by oath, to rule, govern and decide, and determine ONLY by their own laws; if ſo, they have a right to tell the <hi>prince,</hi> that though he <hi>asketh</hi> yet he will aſk in vain. Once more,</p>
            <p>BUT the prince <hi>aſketh,</hi> what now does he aſk? Will he never have done aſking? Well, but what does he aſk? Why he <hi>asketh,</hi> the women, the <hi>wives</hi> upon the goverment of Rhode-Iſland, to ſpare their huſbands from their <hi>beds</hi> from their <hi>boſoms,</hi> from their <hi>arms,</hi> and from their children; to be confin'd in the horrid kingdom of a Man-of-War's crew; to be tranſported back again to the <hi>tyranny</hi> their forfathers fled from, to a land of <hi>ſnares, and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death.</hi> This may be thought to be harſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and by the miniſtry, a HARD <hi>ſaying who can bear it</hi>? But it is not a hair's breadth more in mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the intended power and tyranny of this new court of admiralty. And will you not ſubmit to it? No! that is right; I am glad of it, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it may be thought rather hard, when a prince asketh, not to grant ſo ſmall a favour.</p>
            <p>BUT the text likewiſe ſays—The <hi>Judge asketh for a reward.</hi> The judges have the key of the laws, the hearts of the <hi>lawyers,</hi> and the power of <hi>juries,</hi> too much in their own hands. The lives of the people, the rights of the ſubject, and the diſpoſal of their property, was originally intended to be determined by <hi>juries</hi> only. But as the Judges have aſſumed by cuſtom, a power of dictating to lawyers even at the <hi>bar,</hi> and a direction to the <hi>jury</hi>; it highly becomes them more than ever, to be <hi>men fearing God and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013015_0020_0F8FB0773277D878"/>
hating covetouſneſs.</hi> Therefore it is an ill ſound to hear that the <hi>Judge aſketh for a reward,</hi> what can it be for? ſure it cannot be fot freeing the <hi>King-ſtreet murderers,</hi> or pleading that it was only manſlaughter, if he k—w that it was wilful murder. No doubt but this act of kindneſs will be rewarded, if not at the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, which ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe; yet at the bar of God, when he ſhall ſay, ariſe ye dead and come to judgment: Then there will be no ſetting aſide a witneſs in Mr. P—ms caſe, nor no other. Again the text ſaith,</p>
            <p>THE Judge <hi>asketh for a reward</hi>! Well, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is it, a reward from the crown of Britain? if ſo, not to let him have it, by no means: For if once the judges of the courts of <hi>judicatory</hi> of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince become dependent for their ſupport, or ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, upon the favour of the crown, or miniſtry at Home, you become a nation of ſlaves to miniſterial power; for thereby you ſubmit the key of all your eſſential rights as Americans, to be in the hands of your enemies: For if you ſuffer the judges to become dependent for their pay upon the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, of England, what are they but the <hi>miniſtry</hi>'s ſervants. If ſo, you may naturally ſuppoſe, they muſt do as the miniſtry directs them; if not, they will be unfaithful ſervants, and if faithful to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, where then are your rights? Where is the ſecurity of your lives, or your property. For a more bolder, daring innovation upon your right of power, diciſion and determination by your own laws, reſpecting your right and property between man and man, between the crown of England, and the rights of America, cannot poſſibly be made, or
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013015_0021_0F8FB0781F79FBC0"/>
attempted to be made, than to make your judges dependent upon the britiſh miniſtry; it is in effect, giving up your <hi>right</hi> to all you have, to all that you, or your children can ever poſſeſs. As the poſſeſſion of a perſon's right, whether heriditary, or by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, depends much upon the determination of the judges. And if the judges are wholly to be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the crown of England, for nomination and ſupport, then you may eaſily judge whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſlaves you are to be. For it is well known, that the judges, or general courts, or ſome-body, has for theſe hundred years, and more, diſtreſſed their brethren in their eſtates, and in their conſciences, by impoſing payment for miniſters, and for a worſhip of GOD contrary to the people's conſciences; and if they have done theſe things in the green tree, what may you not expect in the dry.</p>
            <p>BUT as the text ſays, The <hi>Judge asketh for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> If it be for his fidelity in his high office, for his honourable ſupport, according to the dignity of his character. You are bound in duty, in affection, and in obedience to let him have it. Shew your affection, readineſs and gratitude, to reward your judges, as the guardians of your rights; as thoſe who from their hearts, ſhould protect and hand forth the liberties of their brethren to them. This is the way to become a <hi>band of brethren,</hi> from the governor, to the meaneſt ſubject. Perhaps the whole of your complaint in this reſpect, is owing for want of your taking an earlier opportunity, to ſettle ſuch ſalaries, as their merit, labour, and expence deſerves.</p>
            <p>YET let not this lead us from the obſervation, which was, that, an aſking, craving, abſolute prince,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013015_0022_0F8FB07AA496BAD0"/>
is a great diſtreſs to a people. Was not this the caſe of the people in King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and in King <hi>Ahab</hi>'s day, when he crav'd Naboth's vineyard? Likewiſe in Jereboham's days, who deprived the people of their religious liberties, in worſhipping the God of Iſrael, in his temple at Jeruſalem? who ſet up his <hi>golden calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>this</hi> is <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who <hi>taught Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Was not this the caſe in Zedekiah's days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he was warned by the word of the Lord, and by the prophet of the GOD of Iſrael? Yet he was, notwithſtanding, abſolute and craving, though he was told, it would end in the deſtruction of himſelf, and his people. Was not this the cauſe of almoſt all the diſtreſs, deaths, and bloodſhed, that have ever happened in England ſince the conqueſt of <hi>Julian Caeſar</hi>? their King's ruling, and reigning, by a diſpotic power, which they aſſum'd, contrary to the laws, and rights of the people. Were not the Britons obliged by the love of liberty, to obtain their royal <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſword in hand, from King John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Was not this the caſe in the reign of Charles the firſt, when the people and parliament took up arms, to maintain the rights and laws of the people; and when it required either the head of the King, or the loſs of their liberties? they ſoon decided the matter; they ſoon let the king know that they rever'd their rights, and liberties above his life, power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. In Charles the ſecond's reign, there was much the ſame abſolute power over the rights of the people, both civil and religious: But he had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar politeneſs of temper in pleaſing even his very enemies. In James the third's reign, diſpotic power
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013015_0023_0F8FB07B34E2BDF8"/>
was too evident, and diſtreſſing for the people to bear; therefore a revolution, both of king, and ſtate, by the ſpirit, power, and arms, of the people, was ſoon accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond obſervation is,</p>
            <p>THAT when the king, judges, and ſenates, unite to deſtroy the rights of the people by a diſpotic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or, as the text expreſſes it, <hi>that they may do evil with both hands,</hi> then the proſperity of the nation <hi>totters</hi>; the Crown ſhakes; and the deſtruction of the people's rights is near at hand. For the rights of the people, which is the ſupreme glory of the crown and kingdom of Britain, is the Magna <hi>Charta</hi> of the king as well as the people; it is as much his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, as it is his glory, to maintain their rights; and he is as much under a law, (I mean the law of the rights of the people.) as the people are under the oath of allegiance to him. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever power deſtroys their <hi>rights,</hi> deſtroys at the ſame time, his right to reign, or any right to his kingdom, crown, or glory; nay, his right to the name of a king among the people. Was not this the caſe in <hi>Rehoboham</hi>'s days, when the people were diſtreſſed with large and heavy taxations, and oppreſſions? they petitioned the king to relieve them from ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but would he hearken to them, according to the advice of his father's counſellors? No! but according to the advice of his young Counſel, he anſwered them like an arbritrary prince in the ſpeech of his diſpotic miniſtry, roughly, <hi>My father chaſtiſed you with whips, but I will chaſtiſe you with ſcorpions</hi>: But, would the people bear this oppreſſion? No! <hi>What part,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>have we in David? Or what
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013015_0024_0F8FB07BC1014360"/>
portion in the ſon of Jeſſe? To thy tents, Oh Iſrael.</hi> Was not this the caſe in <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s reign? And was not this lately the caſe in <hi>Sweeden,</hi> when the King with a few of his Senates, and miniſtry, about him, deſtroyed the rights of the people, by the power of the ſword, and eſtabliſhed his deſpotic will as the law of the land, by the tyranny of death?</p>
            <p>Obſervation the third.</p>
            <p>THIS ſhews, that an arbitrary diſpotic power in a prince, is the ruin of a nation, of the King, of the crown, and of the ſubjects; therefore it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>abhorred,</hi> deteſted and deſtroyed, becauſe the happineſs of the King, and the proſperity of the people are thereby, not only in danger, but upon the brink of deſtruction. Every age and every hiſtory, furniſhes us with proofs, as clear as the light of the morning of the truth of this.</p>
            <p>BUT it is the ſingular happineſs of the Americans, according to their own laws, not to be in bondage to any power upon the earth. The King of England, has no power to enact, or put in force any law that may oppreſs them, his very attempting to do it, at once deſtroys his right to reign over them For the brighteſt Gem which the king of England wears, in the britiſh crown, is that majeſty, truſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which the Americans inveſt him with as the king and guardian of their rights, and liberties.</p>
            <p>THE Parliament of England cannot juſtly make any laws to oppreſs, or defend the Americans, for they are not the repreſentatives of America and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have no legiſlative power either for them, or againſt them.</p>
            <p>THE houſe of Lords cannot do it, for they are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013015_0025_0F8FB07C84186A88"/>
Peers of England, not of America; and, if neither king, lords, nor commons, have any right to oppreſs, or deſtroy, the liberties of the Americans, why is it then, that the americans do not ſtand upon their own ſtrength, and ſhew their power, and importance, when the life of life, and every liberty that is dear to them and their children is in danger.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let me addreſs you with all the power of affection, with all the pathos of ſoul, as one who eſteems the full poſſeſſion of the rights of the Americans, as the higheſt bleſſing of this life—to ſtand alarm'd! See your danger,—death is near,—deſtruction is at the door—Need I ſpeak? Are not your harbours blockaded from you? Your caſtle ſecured by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives—your lives deſtroyed—revenues impoſed upon you—taxation laid—military power oppreſſing—your CHARTER <hi>violated</hi>—your G—'s heart not right— your conſtitution is declining—your liberties depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not content with this, they now attack the <hi>life,</hi> the ſoul and <hi>capitol</hi> of all your liberties—to chuſe your judges, and make them independent upon you for office or ſupport, and erect new courts of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty to take away by violence, the huſband from his family, his wife, his home, his friends, and his all, through a ſcene, leſs joyful than <hi>Pluto</hi>'s horrid king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. To be confin'd, and tried for his life, by the accuſation of a negro.</p>
            <p>HAS not the voice of your father's blood cry'd yet loud enough in your ears, in your hearts? "ye ſons of America ſcorn to be ſlaves" Have you not heard the voice of blood in your own ſtreets, louder than that which reached to Heaven, that cry'd for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that was, ſaith the Lord to Cain, the voice
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013015_0026_0F8FB07DC2CCCC00"/>
of thy brother's blood, of only one, but this of many brethren. Therefore, if there be any vein, any nerve, any ſoul, any life or ſpirit of liberty in the ſons of <hi>America,</hi> ſhew your love for it; guard your freedom, prevent your chains ; ſtand up as one man for your liberty; for none but thoſe, who ſet a juſt value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this bleſſing, are worthy the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the fifth obſervation, which is,</p>
            <p>THAT it is not rebellion. I declare it before GOD, the congregation and all the world, and I would be glad if it reach'd the ears of every Briton, and every American; That it is no rebellion to oppoſe any King, miniſtry, or governor, that deſtroys by any violence or authority whatever, the rights of the people. Shall a man be deem'd a rebel that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports his own rights? it is the firſt law of nature, and he muſt be a rebel to GOD, to the laws of nature, and his own conſcience, who will not do it. A right to the bleſſing of freedom, we do not receive from Kings, but from Heaven, as the breath of life, and eſſence of our exiſtence; and ſhall we not preſerve it, as the beauty of our being. Do not the birds of the air expand their wings? the fiſh of the ſea their ſins? and the worm of the earth turn again when it is trod upon? And it be deem'd rebellion? Heaven forbid it! Shall <hi>Naboth</hi>'s diſputing with King <hi>Abab,</hi> reſpecting his vineyard, be deem'd rebellion? Or the people ſending home their governor in irons ſome years ago, be deemed rebellion? It is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, than it is to breathe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, to obſerve,</p>
            <p>THAT when the rights and liberties of the people are deſtroyed, it is commonly by the miſchievous
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013015_0027_0F8FB07E0AF0D7A0"/>
               <hi>deſign</hi> of ſome great man. The text ſays, <hi>the great man uttereth his miſchievous deſire</hi>: But who this great man is, we do not certainly know, but may ſhrewdly gueſs; but whether Lord Bute, Duke of Grafton, or Lord Hilſborough, is not ſo material, but the <hi>miſchievous deſign,</hi> is what we fear, is what we feel, if they inſtill in the King's mind a divine right of authority to command his ſubjects; this is <hi>miſchievous.</hi> King Charles found it ſo; Rehoboham found it ſo, and ſo will our preſent King, if he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to ſuch advice.</p>
            <p>IF they make the name of the King ſacred, I hope they mean a political ſacredneſs: If ſo, he is no more ſacred than the people have made him, by inveſting him with the ſacred truſt of their rights. If any great man, or the whole miniſtry makes uſe of the king's Name, or his authority, to enforce their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will, as a law to the ſubjects, that the ſubjects muſt obey, and paſſively ſubmit? becauſe, ſay they, it is his majeſty's will and pleaſure: This is <hi>a miſchievous deſign</hi>—miſchievous to the dignity of the crown— to his majeſty's perſon—to his ſecurity—to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—and their ſafety. It is likewiſe miſchievous to his majeſty's ſubjects, as it ſpreads diſcord, diſunion and diſaffection to the king, to his authority, and power, which is a mournful conſideration, and is the bane of all our national diſtreſs. The people in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the people in America, would fain love their King, and obey him with reverence, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make him the moſt happy prince upon the earth, if he would but prevent this <hi>miſchievous deſign</hi> of the ruin of their <hi>eſſential rights,</hi> and <hi>liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the text ſays,
<q>The great man be uttereth his
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013015_0028_0F8FB07EC2E38C38"/>
miſchievous deſire,</q>
—and indeed we believe he does, in the <hi>cloſet,</hi> in the <hi>cabinet,</hi> and in the ears of the King. Oh! it is a miſchievous deſign; too deep for us to fathom, or come to the bottom of, it carries in it the plain aſpect of diſtreſs to the king, and diſtruction to the people Oh! kind heaven, prevent what king and people have too much cauſe to fear; however, at the beſt, it is a miſchievous <hi>deſign</hi> to alienate (by any direction, or dictation) the affections of his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's good ſubjects; as it deſtroys the bonds, and ties, of national bleſſings; their rights; their liberties; their lives; their properties: And if this is not a miſchievous deſign there can ſcarce be one found out of the deeps of the dark manſions.</p>
            <p>BUT to return to you, my dear Americans, you think hard to pay duties for <hi>teas,</hi> imports, clearances, <hi>entries,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c But what will you farmers and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders think, of paying a fixed tax for every acre of land you enjoy, for every apple tree you rear, for every barrel of cyder you make, for every pound of candles you burn, for every pound of ſoap you uſe, for every pair of ſhoes you wear, for the light of the morning, and the ſun, that a kind heaven gives you, what do you think of paying a continual tax for all theſe, this is contain'd in the miſchievous deſign, ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd, O ye Americans—But I cloſe with the laſt remark from the text. <hi>So they wrap it up.</hi> It will do, it will do ſay they. The King, ſay they, has a right to appoint judges, courts of admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, impoſe revenues, lay taxes, ſerd military forces, block up their harbours, command them—compel them by arms—pay their judges— get the key of their laws, rights and liberties into
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013015_0029_0F8FB07F73769750"/>
our hands, this will do! <hi>and ſo they wrap it up,</hi> as fine and ſmooth as can be: But I think it is better to <hi>unwrap</hi> it again. What do you think, my dear Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans? But I add no more—but adviſe you, as it is a day of public thankſgiving, to bleſs GOD for the liberties and mercies you do enjoy; not for thoſe you are deprived of—my ſecond advice is, love your king, pray for him, pray for your governor, pray for your judges, that all their reign may be eaſy to themſelves, and happy for the people.</p>
