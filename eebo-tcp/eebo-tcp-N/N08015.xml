            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And he ſaid, draw not nigh hither. Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet, for the Place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy Ground.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE ſupreme KING of Heaven and Earth, being reſolved to deliver his choſen People the Jews then in Bondage, was pleaſed to employ his meek Servant Moſes, as a proper Inſtrument to procure their Enlargement: In Conſequence of this Determination, he condeſcended to appear before him, in a miraculous and auguſt Manner, ON THE <hi>Mountain</hi> OF GOD.</p>
            <p>MOSES was alarmed at ſo aſtoniſhing an Appearance: And well he might, when he beheld a Buſh on fire, and yet not deſtroyed by that conſuming Element, which has no Reſpect of Perſons, or Places, but with mercileſs Fury, too often reduces the proudeſt Palaces to Aſhes, and lays the Work of Ages, as it were, in a Moment, level with the Ground.</p>
            <p>WHEN the ſovereign LORD beheld the Anxiety with which his choſen Servant was ſeized, out of Compaſſion to him, he was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Draw not nigh hither.</hi> Conſider before whom thou appeareſt, and preſerve a proper and an awful Diſtance. <hi>Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet.</hi> The
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:010231_0005_0F7DB5BDDE8589A0"/>
Majeſty of Heaven is now the Subject of thy Obedience and Reverence; therefore, revere him that covers thee with the radiant Beams of his Glory; and in Token of Reſpect, <hi>Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet, for the Place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ALMIGHTY conſecrated this Mountain by his eſpecial Preſence. The Ground which before was no more holy than common, is now, from being viſited by the LORD OF LORDS, become holy Ground.</p>
            <p>IT is very obvious to all preſent, that the Intention of our preſent Meeting is, to dedicate this beautiful <note n="*" place="bottom">St. Paul's Chapel.</note> Edifice, to the Service of THE SUPREME BEING. It cannot therefore be deemed an improper Undertaking to ſhew;</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, THAT ALMIGHTY GOD is eminently preſent in one Place, more than in another; and therefore, that ſuch Place, with great Propriety, may be called holy.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, THAT CHURCHES dedicated to the ALMIGHTY's Service, may be juſtly looked upon as ſuch Places.</p>
            <p>FROM whence will appear,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, THE Obligations which we are under, while in ſuch a Situation, and in the more immediate Preſence of ſo holy a GOD, of behaving with Reſpect, Reverence, and Devotion.</p>
            <p>FIRST, then, I am to ſhew you, That ALMIGHTY GOD is eminently preſent in one Place, more than in another; and therefore that ſuch Place, with great Propriety, may be called HOLY.</p>
            <p>TO Mankind, in their preſent lapſed Condition, the divine Preſence is inviſible. We can form no adequate Idea of the Likeneſs of GOD. The moſt ſoaring Imagination muſt fall infinitely ſhort of SUPREME EXCELLENCE, ſhould it be vain enough to attempt to deſcribe it. <hi>No Man,</hi> ſaith the great Apoſtle to the Gentiles, <hi>hath ſeen, or can ſee</hi> GOD <hi>at any Time.</hi>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>THE JEWS, his choſen People, tho' bleſſed with the SHEKINAH, or Glory of GOD, never ſaw any Similitude <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Shekinah</hi> was the moſt ſenſible Mark of the Preſence of GOD, which was to be obſerved amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and which reſted upon the Propitiatory, or over the golden Cherubims, which adhered to the Propitiatory, or the Covering of the Ark: There the <hi>Shekinah</hi> abode in the Shape of a Cloud. It was from thence that GOD gave forth his Oracles with an articulate Voice, when he was conſulted by the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> in Favour of the People. Thence it is, that it is often ſaid in Scripture, that GOD <hi>ſits</hi> upon the Cherubims, or between the Cherubims; <hi>that is to ſay</hi>; That he gives the moſt evident Tokens of his <hi>Divine Preſence,</hi> by anſwering from hence the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that conſulted him. The <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Shekinah</hi> firſt reſided in the Tabernacle prepared by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and that it deſcended thereon on the Day of its Conſecration, in the Figure of a Cloud. It paſſed from thence into the Sanctuary of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Temple,</hi> on the Day of its Dedication by that Prince, where it continued 'til the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the Temple, by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; and was not afterwards to be ſeen there. <hi>Calmet</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dictionary of the Holy Bible. Vol.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi>
               </note>; nay, the <hi>divine Eſſence</hi> is undiſcernable even to the holy Angels above. Thoſe bleſſed Spirits, tho' they inhabit celeſtial Abodes, poſſeſs a Space; their Nature, therefore, muſt greatly differ from that immenſe BEING, the pure Fountain from whence flows every Perfection, the GOD that pervadeth univerſal nature.</p>
            <p>THAT ALMIGHTY BEING, then, that reared the mighty Fabrick of the Univerſe, <hi>dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands:</hi> The <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> the ſpacious Concave above, <hi>is not able to contain Him, for he filleth Heaven and Earth.</hi> His Limits are not to be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>BUT, though ALMIGHTY POWER is not to be fully aſcertained, yet certainly it may be exerted in a viſible and extraordinary Manner, on particular Occaſions.</p>
            <p>TRANSCENDENT MAJESTY, arrayed in Glory, can certainly diſplay himſelf in a more conſpicuous Manner in one Place, than in another. This is evident from Facts.</p>
            <p>IN our preſent imperfect State, much of our Knowledge is received by our Senſes. To inveſtigate the moſt abſtracted Ideas, we call to our Aſſiſtance the moſt ſenſible Helps. The benevolent CREATOR of the human Race, intimately acquainted with the fallen Nature of Man, has, upon particular Occaſions, condeſcended to exhibit to the World, a kind of viſible Preſence, of his tremendous MAJESTY. His wiſe and gracious

Intention in thus acting, is to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Thoughts in our Minds, as may plant the Principles of our moſt holy Religion deep and laſting in our Souls.</p>
            <p>WE muſt be ſenſible, that a Being endued with <hi>omnipotent Power,</hi> can upon a particular Occaſion, actuate a Quantity of Matter, in ſuch a Manner, as muſt fill the Mind of Man, with great and aſtoniſhing Ideas of his <hi>Mejeſty.</hi> His Power being infinite; <hi>He is able to do among the Inhabitants of the Earth, as well as in the Armies of Heaven, whatever he wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN former Ages, the <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, for wiſe and good Purpoſes, condeſcended to exhibit aſtoniſhing Repreſentations to particular Men, in particular Places. Theſe glorious and magnificent Signs were generally diſcovered by a remarkable luminous Appearance, burſting forth from dark and thick Clouds.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Appearance of the Glory of the <hi>Lord</hi> that we have recorded, was to <hi>Adam,</hi> in Paradiſe. After our firſt Parent had ſtained his Soul with Guilt, his juſtly offended GOD, appeared to him, arrayed with awful Majeſty; and with a commanding Voice, that pierced through his guilty Breaſt, he called the unhappy and ſelf-convicted Criminal.</p>
            <p>THUS arraigned by his <hi>Sovereign Lord,</hi> he was ſeized with Fear and Dread. In vain he attempted to hide himſelf from the Preſence of injured MAJESYT.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Flood, the SHEKINAH was often viſible to the HOLY SEED; particularly to the venerable Father of the Faithful; for it is ſaid, that GOD <hi>went up</hi> from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN JACOB returned from BEERSHEBA, towards HARAN, to mitigate incenſed ESAU's Reſentment, he was bleſſed with the <hi>Divine Preſence. He beheld the Angels of God aſcending, and deſcending, and viewed the Lord of Glory,</hi> who promiſed that his wakeful Providence ſhould watch over him for good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010231_0008_0F7DB5C0D3D40CC0"/>WELL might the pious PATRIARCH break forth, and in a religious Rapture ſay, <hi>ſurely the Lord is in this Place. How dreadful is this Place. This is no other than the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven.</hi> And on his Return to his Native Country, <hi>he</hi> (ſay the ſacred Scriptures) <hi>wreſtled with God and prevailed</hi>; and in Honor of ſo ſignal an Event, called the Place where he obtained the bleſſing, PENIEL; that is, <hi>the Face of God</hi>; becauſe he was there favoured with the <hi>Divine Preſence.</hi> After this the ſame auguſt <hi>Being</hi> was pleaſed to diſplay his Glory to his faithful Servant MOSES; and <hi>God called unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND leſt the Vain, the proud Sceptic, ſhould ſay, that theſe particular Men were deluded, and diſturbed with Melancholy and Whim; the Spirit of Divine Wiſdom has alſo recorded the <hi>Almighty</hi>'s appearing to Multitudes infamous for the hardneſs of their Heart. Hear MOSES's ſolemn and awful Account of it, dictated by the holy <hi>Spirit of God. On the third Day in the Morning there were Thunders and Lightnings, and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and Moſes brought forth the People out of the Camp to meet with God; and Mount Sinai was altogether in a Smoke, becauſe the Lord deſcended upon it; and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the Top of the Mount.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS it is very evident that <hi>Almighty God</hi> aſſiſted the Imaginations of Men, by his miraculous Preſence; not that the <hi>Godhead</hi> was repreſented to them, for that is inviſible; but he condeſcended to exhibit to his choſen People, ſuch glorious, and amazing appearances, and ſuch viſible Signs, as convinced them of his inviſible Preſence, and readineſs to help and aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>BY illuſtrating the Manner in which <hi>Almighty God</hi> eminently appeared in one Place, more than another, we ſhall be able to put the Truth now advanced in a proper Point of Light. And,</p>
            <p>FIRST, thoſe Perſons to whom <hi>the Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord appeared,</hi> were themſelves fully perſuaded of the Reality of the <hi>Divine Preſence.</hi> If Men are endued with ſuch valuable Faculties as to know GOD, to ſerve Him,

and to be directed by Him; they then are alſo capable of knowing when <hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> condeſcends in a particular Manner to reveal himſelf to them. The Fountain from whence all Knowledge is derived, ſo enlightened their Underſtandings to whom the <hi>Shekinah</hi> appeared, as convinced them by a Demonſtration from the Spirit of GOD, that it was no leſs than <hi>the Glory of the Lord</hi> that appeared. Nor is ſuch a <hi>Divine Illumination</hi> either inconſiſtent with the Perfections of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, or thoſe noble Faculties with which he has bleſſed the Sons of MEN.</p>
            <p>ABRAHAM, the Father of the Faithful, was fully convinced that the GOD who had often appeared to him, was the ſame BEING that commanded him to ſacrifice his only beloved Son ISAAC. We cannot ſuppoſe that ſo good and wiſe a Man, ſo fond and indulgent a Parent, could be tempted to commit an Action, that had ſo much the Appearance of being barbarous, unnatural and Irreligious, had he not received the moſt ample Conviction, that it was the expreſs Command of his GOD, to whom he owed intire Obedience.</p>
            <p>JACOB entertained not the leaſt Suſpicion but that it was GOD, that appeared to him at BETHEL. The <hi>Divine Preſence</hi> amply ſupplied thoſe Cnveniencies which he wanted, and rendered his Couch of Earth and Stones vaſtly preferable to the Down and Tiſſue of Princes.</p>
            <p>MOSES, that eminent Servant of GOD, would not have <hi>hid his Face,</hi> and been ſeized with Fear, not daring to look up, if he had not been fully perſuaded, that the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> appeared to him in Glory at that preciſe Time.</p>
            <p>AND, to mention but one Inſtance more; the ſtiff-necked ISRAELITES, remarkable for Infidelity and Perverſeneſs, would never have moved, and ſtood afar off, and condeſcended to requeſt MOSES to <hi>ſpeak unto them leſt they ſhould die</hi>; would not have <hi>worſhiped every Man at his Tent-Door,</hi> when they beheld the cloudy Pillar ſtanding at the Door of the Tabernacle, if

they had not received inconteſtable Evidence that the <hi>Divine Preſence</hi> was in a ſpecial Manner <hi>there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, The Supreme Majeſty of Heaven and Earth always appeared with aſtoniſhing Splendor, and amazing Glory, on particular Occaſions.</p>
            <p>AT thoſe times, to make uſe of the ſublime and grand Deſcription, which the ſacred Oracles give us, <hi>There went up a Smoke out of his Noſtrils; Fire came out of his Mouth: He bowed the Heavens, and came down; Darkneſs was under his Feet; He rode upon a Cherub, and did fly; He came flying upon the Wings of the Wind. At the Brightneſs that was before him, thick Clouds paſſed away. The Sight of the Glory of the Lord was like devouring Fire, in the Eyes of the Children of</hi> Iſrael. And, it is recorded that, <hi>when</hi> GOD <hi>came up from</hi> Teman, <hi>and the Holy One from</hi> Mount Paran, <hi>that his Glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his Praiſe. His Brightneſs was as the Light.</hi> Nay, ſo tranſcendently glorious was the Splendor of the Divine <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that it even dazzled the Eyes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though permitted to talk with his GOD, <hi>Face to Face.</hi> Again;</p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>Almighty</hi> might command the greateſt Reverence, when he graciouſly condeſcended to leave the beautiful Manſions of Glory, and to viſit the Sons of Men, (amazing Condeſcenſion indeed:) He was attended by a ſplendid Company of active Angels. <hi>The Ancient of Days,</hi> ſays the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> in a noble and lofty Stile, <hi>has Thouſands to miniſter to him, and Ten Thouſand Times Ten Thouſand ſtanding before him. The Chariots of</hi> GOD <hi>are Twenty Thouſand, even Thouſands of Angels, and the Lord is among them in his holy Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> when bleſſed with the <hi>Divine Preſence,</hi> ſaw the Angels of GOD, attending on the Majeſty of Heaven, <hi>aſcending and deſcending:</hi> And when the <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD appeared to his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Angel was in the Buſh</hi>; and GOD upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was received by <hi>the Diſpoſition of Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010231_0011_0F7DB5C513C4CA80"/>LASTLY, The Place where <hi>the Shekinah, or Glory of the Lord</hi> appeared, was eſteemed holy. For if the Tabernacle, the Temple, nay, the meaneſt Utenſil appropriated for Divine Service, was eſteemed as holy, ſurely the Place honoured with the eſpecial Preſence of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, was eminently ſo.</p>
            <p>FOR this Reaſon <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was fully convinced that GOD appeared to him in <hi>Bethel,</hi> cryed out, <hi>that the Place was dreadful, and that it was the Houſe of</hi> GOD: And GOD declareth to his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Mount on which he appeared to him in Glory, was <hi>holy Ground.</hi> And whenever <hi>the Glory of the Lord</hi> filled the Tabernacle, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> worſhipped and did Obeyſance. The Speciality of the <hi>Divine Preſence</hi> conſecrating or making thoſe Places holy, in which <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD was pleaſed to appear.</p>
            <p>THUS it is very evident that the <hi>Supreme Being</hi> is eminently preſent in one Place more than another; therefore that ſuch Place may, with great Propriety, be ſtiled holy.</p>
            <p>I proceed, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prove both from Scripture and Antiquity, that <hi>Churches</hi> dedicated to GOD's Service, may be juſtly looked upon as ſuch <hi>holy Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE do not at this Day preſume to aſſert, that the <hi>eſpecial Divine Preſence</hi> is now viſible in our Churches.</p>
            <p>THE ancient Fathers juſtly ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Shekinah, or the Glory of the</hi> LORD was effected by the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> in the ſacred <hi>Trinity:</hi> It was therefore highly reaſonable that, when the <hi>Brightneſs of</hi> GOD's <hi>Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, became manifeſt in our Fleſh</hi>; all thoſe extraordinary Appearances ſhould ceaſe; and accordingly they have long ſince been withdrawn.</p>
            <p>BUT though the <hi>Glory of the Lord</hi> is not now viſible, yet we may reaſonably conclude, that the <hi>Sovereign Inſpector</hi> of Men, and their Actions,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010231_0012_0F7DB5C58278A508"/>
has a peculiar Regard for thoſe Places dedicated, and ſet apart, for his <hi>particular Service,</hi> by his religious, and faithful Servants. And, though our Senſes are not ſtruck with thoſe radiant Beams of Light, which holy Men, before the Appearance of the <hi>Lord of Light and Glory,</hi> were bleſſed with; yet the <hi>Great</hi> GOD, though imperceptible to us, is more eminently preſent in Places dedicated to his Name and Worſhip, than in common Buildings.</p>
            <p>IN all Ages, and among all Nations, we find that particular Places have been appropriated, and ſet apart for religious Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>JACOB <hi>vowed a Vow, that the Place</hi> where GOD appeared to him, <hi>ſhould be</hi> GOD's Houſe. And whenever this was done with Piety and Sincerity, the <hi>Supreme</hi> GOD, as an Encouragement to his faithful Servants, was pleaſed to declare his Approbation by manifeſt Signs.</p>
            <p>THUS <hi>when</hi> Moſes <hi>finiſhed the Work of the Tabernacle, a Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle:</hi> And when the magnificent <hi>Temple of Solomon</hi> was finiſhed, which for Grandeur, and Refinement of Taſte, exceeded every Thing of the Kind before or ſince, <hi>the Cloud,</hi> as a Sign of Approbation, <hi>filled the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH our Senſes are not, in theſe Days of Degeneracy, ſtruck with extraordinary Appearances for the Reaſon already given; yet <hi>we may,</hi> with great Truth, I am confident, preſume, that <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD will equally delight in every Place, or Church, which the Piety of his obedient Servants, with a View to his Glory, and the preſent and eternal Welfare of the human Race, has dedicated to Him under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as He delighted in thoſe dedicated to him under the <hi>Law; He</hi> being the <hi>ſame Yeſterday, To-day, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW indeed, neither <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor <hi>Mount Gerazim,</hi> are more holy to GOD than other Places; but from <hi>the Riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame,</hi> GOD<hi>'s Name ſhall be great in every Place. Incenſe ſhall be offered in his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010231_0013_0F7DB5C5F5A0E990"/>THE Goodneſs of GOD is not now confined to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> neither is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Place that <hi>his Holineſs delighted to dwell in</hi>; but in every Country his faithful Worſhipers may erect Buildings, and dedicate them to the Service of their GOD and <hi>Redeemer:</hi> And, when ever the <hi>Almighty</hi> is properly invoked in ſuch Places, or Churches, in Spirit and in Truth, we are aſſured that his Votaries perform as acceptable a Service, as was anciently performed in thoſe Places called by GOD's ſacred Name.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to ſay, that our Churches have any intrinſic Holineſs in them; but, by being ſolemnly dedicated to the ſole Service of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> they certainly have an immediate Relation to Him, and are <hi>derivatively Holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BOTH the Laws of GOD and Man require, that the ſtated Times for the public Worſhip of the GOD that made us, ſupports and protects us, be obſerved in a different Manner from other Times. Why therefore, by a Parity of Reaſoning, ſhould not hallowed Places, which are appropriated, and dedicated entirely to the Service of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, be treated with greater Regard than ordinary Houſes?</p>
            <p>THE ſuperb Palace of a <hi>Monarch</hi> is approached and entered with Reſpect and Deference; ſhould not then noble and majeſtic Edifices erected for, and dedicated to the Service of that <hi>Sovereign Being,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> be treated with the greateſt Awe, and moſt profound Veneration?</p>
            <p>IF outward Marks of Reverence be not paid to Things belonging unto GOD, in a very ſhort Time, (ſuch is our Propenſity to forget our Duty,) we may become ſo loſt to Decency, and our moſt reaſonable Service, that we ſhall fail in that inward Veneration we yet pretend to have for the <hi>Divine Majeſty Himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a juſt Obſervation of an eminent Prelate, (long ſince with his Maker)
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010231_0014_0F7DB5C77A1AAA10"/>
that the <hi>inward</hi> Worſhip of the <hi>Heart</hi> is
<q>the great Service of GOD, and that no Service can be acceptable without it: But, (he proceeds) <hi>the external Worſhip of</hi> GOD in his <hi>Church</hi> is the great Witneſs to the World, that our Hearts ſtand right in his Service.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>THE Church or Temple (ſay our Homilies) is counted or called holy, yet not of itſelf; but, becauſe GOD's People reſorting thereunto are holy, and exerciſe themſelves in holy and heavenly Things.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Book Hom. Page <hi>162.</hi>
               </note> But permit me to dwell a little longer on this Subject.</p>
            <p>PERSONS and Things when ſet apart to the peculiar Service of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, claim a Right to external, and relative Holineſs; and this Right is founded on their being thus appropriated.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was called <hi>Holy,</hi> as it was the Day fixed for public Worſhip: Thus the Oil under the Law was called holy, being appropriated to Divine Uſes: Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> were called an <hi>holy People,</hi> being ſeparated from the idolatrous Nations by <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD. And our Churches by ſolemn Dedication become the Houſes of GOD, and ſo are made holy.</p>
            <p>I might now mention many Dedications under the Law, to elucidate what has been ſaid on this Subject, were it needful; but I rather proceed to obſerve, that after the Aſcenſion of the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> his diſconſolate Spouſe, the Church, was, for ſome Time, clad in Mourning, weeping, and afflicted; and his poor perſecuted Servants were ſo watched by their cruel Enemies, that they were obliged to make Uſe, not of the moſt decent, but moſt ſolitary and ſafe Places, for their Religious Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>STATELY Fabricks, noble and magnificent Edifices, were not then erected. But as mean and ſolitary as thoſe Places were, which were ſet apart for Divine Worſhip; yet they were treated by the Primitive Chriſtians with the greateſt Reſpect; and the Profanation of them was univerſally deteſted and condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010231_0015_0F7DB5C833A01850"/>SOME Ages after, the Rage of Perſecution abated, the dark and diſmal Cloud, replete with Miſchief and Vengeance, was, by the Interpoſition of Heaven, diſperſed and diſſipated, and a radiant and glorious Light ſhone forth. <hi>Kings</hi> gloried in being <hi>nurſing Fathers to the true Church of</hi> GOD. The ſtrong Attachment, the ſacred Veneration, which the firſt Chriſtians had for the Houſes of their GOD, now openly appeared.</p>
            <p>THE great and celebrated <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt <hi>Chriſtian Emperor,</hi> immediately ſet about finiſhing the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> built (as profane Hiſtorians inform us) over our <hi>Saviour's Sepulchre:</hi> And ſuch was his Senſe of the Propriety and Decency of ſolemly dedicating it to the ſole Service of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 335.</note> that he ordered the greateſt Part of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to aſſemble themſelves together for that Purpoſe. This they very readily complied with; and ſome with Orations, others with Sermons, others with Prayers for the Peace of the World, for the Safety of the Church, and for the Proſperity of the Emperor and his Children, ſolemnized the Dedication to the beſt of their Power. This pious Emperor alſo laid the Foundation of a famous Temple, called <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> and <hi>Magna,</hi> which was finiſhed, and dedicated Thirty-four Years after, by his Son <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vid <hi>Bingham,</hi> Page <hi>286.</hi>
               </note> who joined the <hi>Temple of Peace</hi> to it, including them both in one.</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS was followed in his Piety by the ſucceeding Emperors, but eſpecially by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who, among other Works of this Nature, rebuilt the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> which had been burnt down in the Time of <hi>Anaſtaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Church was juſtly eſteemed the Glory of the World, for its Greatneſs, curious Architecture, Richneſs and Beauty; inſomuch that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf having finiſhed it, was heard to ſay, <hi>I have outdone thee,</hi> Solomon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010231_0016_0F7DB5CBA3E1C698"/>SOCRATES <note n="‡" place="bottom">SOCRAT. iii.8.</note> obſerves, that in like Manner the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi>

                  <hi>An.</hi> 541.</note> was ſummoned on Purpoſe to dedicate the famous Church there, called <hi>Dominicum Aureum,</hi> which was begun by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and finiſhed by <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> Many Examples of the ſame Nature are to be met with in profane Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe Inſtances therefore, of SOLOMON, under the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſpenſation, it plainly appears in what Senſe the CHURCH is ſaid to be HOLY.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; it is called holy, from the ſacred and ſolemn Offices that are performed in it. The bleſſed JESUS himſelf, who always ſpoke the Words of unerring Truth, aſſures us, that <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his Name,</hi> HE <hi>will be in the midſt of them</hi>; and we cannot doubt but that the <hi>Father of all Mercies,</hi> will alſo be preſent with us in <hi>this Houſe,</hi> now devoted to his Service, by the Influence of his bleſſed SPIRIT; who is to renew us in the inner Man, to incline us to will and to do what is acceptable to GOD.</p>
            <p>WITHIN theſe ſacred Walls, publick Audience is to be given to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST, who preach <hi>the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things;—to the Stewards of the Myſteries of Chriſt;—to the Ambaſſadors of</hi> GOD; who, with repeated Solicitations, <hi>beſeech you in</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s Stead, to be reconciled unto</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>IN this elegant <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD, the Laws of the great JEHOVAH will be promulged;—Obedience demanded;—the Rewards that attend the Obſervance of them, and the great Danger of a contrary Behaviour, laid before you. <hi>Here,</hi> the benevolent CREATOR offers to heal the <hi>broken Spirit, and the contrite Heart</hi>;—to meet with open Arms the poor, humble, dejected Penitent;—to receive the ſincere Petitions of his obedient Servants, and to hearken to their earneſt Prayers. Here, at the ſacred ALTAR, we are to commemorate the Death and Paſſion <hi>of that immaculate Lamb, who was
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010231_0017_0F7DB5CC132FCDE0"/>
ſlain for the Sins of an ungrateful World. Here,</hi> we ſhall feaſt upon the Banquet of redeeming Love; and receive the Elements of Bread and Wine, to our great and endleſs Comfort. In a Word, <hi>Here,</hi> every Ordinance of our religious Worſhip, for the Advancement of GOD's Glory, and the Honor of his beloved <hi>Son</hi>;—for the Edification of the <hi>People</hi> of GOD, and promoting the eternal Intereſt of our immortal Souls, is required to be piouſly diſcharged by the Congregation of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>WE readily allow that the ſacred Offices of our moſt holy Religion, may be performed in private Houſes; but it is evident from the Prayer at the Dedication of <hi>Solomon's Temple,</hi> that religious Services performed in the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD are more effectual in removing Judgments, and procuring Mercies, than thoſe offered in private Places. The Goodneſs of the LORD never ſhines with a greater Luſtre, than when the united Devotions of his faithful Servants, wreſtle as it were with the ALMIGHTY in his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>WE find that our bleſſed SAVIOUR paid particular Reſpect to Places dedicated to the Service of GOD. The ſacred JESUS coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was filled with a pious Indignation at ſeeing his <hi>Father's Houſe</hi> vilely proſtituted. When his <hi>Perſon</hi> was treated in the moſt cruel and ungrateful Manner, he bore it with wonderful Patience; but when the <hi>Temple of</hi> GOD was prophaned, an holy Zeal inſtantly kindled in his Breaſt. The meek Lamb of GOD, thus provoked, had Recourſe to holy Violence, and whipped the impious Merchants out of the Temple. But,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, If particular Edifices or Places are thus made holy, then many are the Obligations that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are under of behaving, while in ſuch a Situation, and in the more immediate Preſence of ALMIGHTY GOD, with the greateſt Reſpect, Reverence and Devotion.</p>
            <p>WHETHER we reflect on the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or our Relation to GOD, our Judgments muſt be fully convinced, that it is our reaſonable Service,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010231_0018_0F7DB5CD415CA9D0"/>
and our undoubted Intereſt, to rejoice to enter into the <hi>Houſe of the</hi> LORD, and there ſerve him in the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs.</hi> GOD's Service is now perfect Freedom; the <hi>Yoke of</hi> CHRIST <hi>is eaſy, and his Burden light.</hi> It is not now required of us <hi>to come before</hi> GOD <hi>with Calves of a Year old; to preſent Thouſands of Rams, or Ten Thouſand Rivers of Oil; much leſs to give our firſt born for our Tranſgreſſions, the Fruit of our Bodies, for the Sin af our Souls</hi>; but we are required to ſacrifice our Luſts and Paſſions, <hi>to ſerve the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, <hi>with all our Hearts, and with all our Souls,</hi> &amp;c. and to become <hi>new Creatures</hi> in CHRIST JESUS. Can we poſſibly attain this bleſſed and deſirable End by any Means ſo likely, as a conſtant Attendance at the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD;—the <hi>Place where his Honour dwelleth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Royal Pſalmiſt, with the moſt ardent Affection, <hi>longed to enter into the Courts of the</hi> LORD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He wiſely eſteemed them completely bleſſed, who dwelt in the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD. <hi>One Day in his Courts he eſteemed better than a Thouſand:</hi> Therefore, the <hi>one Thing he deſired</hi> was, <hi>that he might dwell in the Temple of the</hi> LORD <hi>all the Days of his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Law,</hi> which made nothing perfect, thus ſtrongly influenced that holy Man, how inexcuſeable then muſt <hi>Chriſtians be,</hi> if they now neglect the invaluable Means of Salvation offered them in the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> Unpardonable muſt they be, if they now refuſe daily to walk with GOD, and <hi>reverence his Sanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, barely to frequent the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD, will not ſanctify our Natures, and render us amiable in the Sight of ſo pure a <hi>Being,</hi> unleſs we behave while in his Courts, with the moſt intenſe Fervency and Devotion.</p>
            <p>"BEFORE we enter the Church, ſays <hi>St. Chryſoſtom,</hi> we muſt diveſt ourſelves of the Care of this World. Let no Man (he goes on) enter with a troubled and diſtracted Mind; let him lay all theſe down at the Doors, and ſo let him come. For coming thither, we come to Heaven, not in reſpect of the Place indeed, but of the Temper and Diſpoſition of our
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010231_0019_0F7DB5CD7478E838"/>
Minds; for a Man while he lives on Earth, may aſcend to Heaven, and take a View of the Things that are there: Let no Man therefore, in the Church, think of his domeſtic Affairs; but on the contrary, while he is yet at Home, let him begin thoſe Things he is to do in the Church."</p>
            <p>THE like was obſerved among the very <hi>Heathens.</hi> They had their <hi>Nudipedalia Sacra</hi>; and they put off their Shoes when they entered the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> And Hiſtory informs us, that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Ethiopian Chriſtians</hi> do not go into their ſacred Aſſemblies, but with their Feet naked. This was the ancient Way of expreſſing Reverence and Reſpect, as uncovering the Head is, at preſent.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR CAVE, in his primitive Chriſtianity, ſays, "that the pious Chriſtians came into the Church as into the Palace of the GREAT KING, with Fear and Trembling. Nay, the Emperors themſelves, when they went into the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD, left their Guards behind them, and took off their Crowns, in Token of that high Reſpect they paid to Houſes dedicated to the Service of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD."</p>
            <p>LET modern Chriſtians then follow theſe Examples. Let us <hi>worſhip the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, <hi>fall down and kneel before him.</hi> When we reflect where we are, we muſt be loſt to all Senſe of Goodneſs, if we neglect to ſerve our <hi>Creator</hi> with Reverence and goldy Fear. Let us endeavour to form juſt Ideas of the awful <hi>Majeſty,</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> KING. Let us be properly impreſſed with a Senſe of our own Unworthineſs, and then we ſhall be induced to approach the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> with Lowlineſs, Reverence and Devotion. Can we reflect that the <hi>Lord</hi> is certainly in this Place, and be wanting in our Endeavours to order our Affections, and regulate our Actions, in ſuch a becoming Manner, as that no Thought of the Mind, or Geſture of the Body, may render us unfit to appear before ſo great and powerful an <hi>Inſpector?</hi>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010231_0020_0F7DB5CECD8DAA60"/>EXTERNAL Reverence greatly promotes the Intereſt of Religion, and muſt convince all but the Abandon'd and Obſtinate, that our GOD <hi>is among us of a Truth.</hi> GOD <hi>is greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of his Saints, and to be had in Reverence of all them that are round about him. Let us therefore keep our Feet when we come into the Houſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>and be more ready to hear, than to give the ſacrifice of Fools.</hi> Let our Hearts glow with Love to the beſt and greateſt of <hi>Beings,</hi> and then we ſhall worſhip him in the Beauty of Holineſs. But a formal Attendance on the Houſe of GOD will be inſufficient, unleſs,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, by the Divine Bleſſing we order our whole Converſation ſuitable to all thoſe Means of Grace that we now enjoy. We may draw nigh to GOD with an outſide Piety, when at the ſame Time, it is poſſible, our Hearts may be far from Him. If the Servant, for not improving the Talent committed to his Charge, was deprived of it;—if the Abuſe of Knowledge will be attended with Puniſhment;—if a Neglect in the one Thing needful will be productive of everlaſting Miſery;—muſt not Chriſtians dread that eternal Vengeance will be their Portion, if through unpardonable Carleſſneſs and Preſumption, they render abortive the moſt likely Means of making themſelves holy and excellent, in all Manner of Converſation and Godlineſs?</p>
            <p>WE muſt be ſenſible that GOD <hi>heareth not Sinners</hi>; that <hi>if our Hearts incline to Wickedneſs, the</hi> LORD <hi>will not hear; for the Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomination to Him:</hi> But if, during the whole Courſe of our Lives, we ſteadily act upon religious Principles;—if we bring our Wills to a ſtrict Conformity to the Divine Will;—if we order our Converſation as becomes the Goſpel of CHRIST;—if our Devotions are, as they ought to be, active, ſervent, and lively;—if we give unto the LORD the Glory due unto his Name;—if we worſhip Him in his Sanctuary with an holy Worſhip; if it be the principal Buſineſs of our Lives to walk in the Courts of the

LORD,—we may then with Comfort hope, that we ſhall hereafter be admitted, through the Merits of a glorious Redeemer, into the Divine Preſence, where there is Fullneſs of Joy; and into thoſe beatific Manſions, where there are PLEASURES FOR EVERMORE.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus finiſhed what I propoſed to offer, from the Words of my Text, all that now remains, is ſincerely to congratulate you, <hi>Worthy Sirs,</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Church-wardens and Veſtry who had the ordering and directing of the Building.</note> under whoſe wiſe Management, and prudent Direction, this beautiful and convenient Edifice is now ſo far finiſhed, as to be opened, and dedicated to the Service of ALMIGHTY GOD.</p>
            <p>YOU this Day have the unſpeakable Pleaſure, of ſeeing within theſe Walls, a very reſpectable, numerous and devout Audience;—And if we caſt our Eyes around us, and carefully view this elegant Building, which is an Honour to our Church and City, we cannot help expreſſing our Admiration, at beholding it nearly compleated, with ſuch great Judgment, and uncommon Diſpatch.</p>
            <p>A GLOWING Ardor for the Service of GOD, and a humane and benevolent Regard for the preſent, and eternal Welfare of your Fellow-Citizens, are the only Inducements (noble ones indeed they are!) that have influenced you, <hi>Sirs,</hi> of the Corporation of the Church of England, in this City, as by Law Eſtabliſhed, to devote your Time and Service, to the Erection of this noble Edifice; which will ever redound to your Honour, and be gratefully remembred by the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>TO conclude; May that benevolent and moſt amiable Being, the great JEHOVAH, who is a conſtant Obſerver of the Actions of Men, and who always delights in thoſe faithful and obedient Servants, that have exerted themſelves in promoting his Honour, pour the choiceſt of his Bleſſings upon you in this Life; and be graciouſly pleaſed to crown you with immortal

Happineſs in the next. May he permit this beautiful Building to be employed in his Service from Generation to Generation.—May all thoſe that are here to aſſemble, and worſhip, be ſincere in their Devotions, and punctual in their Attendance, at this <hi>Houſe of God.</hi>—May they come with Hearts properly diſpoſed to hear and receive the glad Tidings of the glorious Goſpel of Peace.—May they be greatly edified, and judiciouſly inſtructed by the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in that eſſential Knowledge which alone is able <hi>to make them wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND, finally, May the whole Aſſemby of the Faithful, after duly honoring, and devoutly ſerving GOD in Houſes made with Hands, be ſo completely bleſſed, as for ever to praiſe, adore, and magnify, the benevolent Author of their Being, and their Happineſs, in you glorious and celeſtial Manſions, whoſe Builder and Maker is the SUPREME GOD.</p>
            <closer>To whom, with his bleſſed Son CHRIST JESUS, and the HOLY SPIRIT, be aſcribed, as is moſt juſtly due, all Honor, Praiſe, Thankſgiving, and Adoration, both now, and evermore. AMEN.</closer>
