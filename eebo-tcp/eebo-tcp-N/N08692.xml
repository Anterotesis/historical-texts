            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO THE Reverend Dr. DURELL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEING a Maſter of Iſrael, and placed at the head of one of the moſt renowned ſeats of Learning in the world, you need not be informed that the Miſſion of the HOLY GHOST is the one grand promiſe of the New, at the coming of JESUS CHRIST was the great promiſe of the Old Teſtament diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.—"I will pray the Father, ſays our bleſſed LORD to his almoſt diſconſolate Diſciples, and he ſhall give you another Comforter." And again, "It is expedient for you, that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart (it being the purchaſe of his all-atoning blood, and deſigned to be the immediate fruit and proof of the reality of his reſurrection, and ſubſequent aſcenſion into Heaven) I will ſend Him unto you." And that they might know that this Comforter was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> confined to or mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized by them, but was to be of ſtanding general uſe, He immediately gives them intimations of the deſign and nature of his office: and therefore adds, "and when he is come, he will convince the world of ſin, and of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of judgment."</p>
            <p>Strange and till then unheard-of, promiſe this! Such as a Confucius, Zoroaſter, or any other fictitious uninſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prophet or Lawgiver never dreamt of. A promiſe, which none but One, who was GOD over all, could dare
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011117_0003_0F8537E7824F3790"/>
to make; a promiſe which none but One, who was GOD over all, could poſſibly fulfil.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this promiſe, having aſcended up on high, led captivity captive, and received this gift for men, this divine Paraclete, this Holy Ghoſt, on the day of Pentecoſt, came down from heaven like a ruſhing mighty wind; and there appeared cloven tongues, like as of fire, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> upon each of the Apoſtles."—The effects were immediate and viſible—Poor, illiterate Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, inſtantaneouſly commenced Scholars, Preachers, Orators. And well they might; for, being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, as the Spirit gave them utterance, they began to ſpeak with other tongues the wonderful things of God.</p>
            <p>But what was all this divine apparatus, this divine preaching, this divine oratory intended for? The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes inform us: The hearers of thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, the ſpectators of this tranſcendently amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene, "were pricked to the heart, and were made to cry out, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do? And the ſame day were added to this infant church about three thouſand ſouls." Here were proofs, ſubſtantial, inconteſtible proofs, of the reality of the Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and likewiſe of the Efficacy of the all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Interceſſion of their once crucified, but now exalted LORD; not only ſubſtantial and inconteſtible, but at the ſame time entirely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuitable to the nature of his Miſſion, who in the days of his fleſh by his doctrines and miracles declared, that his only deſign in coming into the world, was to ſave ſinners.</p>
            <p>Upon this rock, namely, an experimental manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application of his Divinity to the renewed heart (which fleſh and blood, human Reaſon, vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, moral Suaſion, or any, or all barely external evidence whatſoever cannot reveal) hath he built, doth he now build, and will continue to build his church;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011117_0004_0F8537E849B96CF8"/>
and therefore it is that the gates, neither the power or policy of hell, ſhall ever prevail againſt it. By the influence of this almighty Agent hath he promiſed to be with his miniſters and people, even to the end of the world. And agreeable to this, hath taught us daily to pray that his Kingdom may come; which being to be begun, carried on and completed, by one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued emanation of divine influence communicated to believers in the uſe of all appointed means, can alone enable us to do GOD's will on earth, with any degree of that unanimity, chearfulneſs, univerſality and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as it is done by the holy angels above. And as this is the daily united prayer of the whole catholic Church, however diſtreſſed or diſperſed, and however varying as to circumſtantials and non-eſſentials, over the whole earth; it followeth, that every addition of any individual monument of divine mercy, out of every nation, language or tongue, muſt be looked upon in part as an anſwer to the daily prayer of every individual believer under Heaven.</p>
            <p>Hence, no doubt, it is, that as the Angels are ſent forth to be miniſtring ſpirits, to miniſter to thoſe who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation, that there is ſaid to be joy in Heaven over every ſinner that repenteth. And as there is joy in Heaven, ſo in proportion as they riſe into the nature of Angels, will there be joy alſo upon the ſame account amongſt good men on earth. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, the lively Oracles inform us, that "when the Apoſtles and Brethren which were in Judea heard that the Gentiles alſo had received the word of GOD, they glorified Him, ſaying, Then hath GOD alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."</p>
            <p>And conformably to this, we are told, that "when Barnabas came to Antioch, and ſaw the grace of GOD, he was glad." And why? Becauſe he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghoſt and of faith. And as the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011117_0005_0F8537EB0C8E14B0"/>
ſame cauſe will always be productive of the ſame effect, perſons endued with the ſame benign and godlike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with this good man, will always be glad when they ſee or hear of any ſcriptural marks or practical evidences of true and undefiled Religion, wrought in, or appearing upon any ſubject of divine grace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And this joy muſt neceſſarily riſe, in proportion as ſuch ſubjects, either by their abilities or circumſtances, and ſituation in life, promiſe more important and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive uſefulneſs in the world and church of GOD.</p>
            <p>No wonder therefore, Reverend SIR, that it hath gladdened the hearts of many, and afforded matter of uncommon joy and thankſgiving to the Father of mercies and GOD of all conſolation, to hear, that for ſome time paſt there hath been a more than common religious concern and zeal for promoting their own and others ſalvation among ſome of the Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. What a pleaſing proſpect hath hereby been opened of a future bleſſing to the riſing generation! A bleſſing, which we well hoped, would be not leſs ſalutary and beneficial to the moral, than the new cruſe of ſalt, which the prophet Eliſha, when complaint was made that the water was naught and the ground barren, caſt into the ſpring of waters, with a Thus ſaith the LORD, I have healed theſe waters, was to part of the natural world. "There ſhall not be from thence, ſays the prophet, any more death or barren land: So the waters were healed unto this day."</p>
            <p>But alas! how is this general joy damped, and the pleaſing proſpect almoſt totally eclipſed, by a late me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſcene exhibited in that very place from whence, as from a fountain, many of their preachers frequently and expreſly pray, that pure ſtreams may forever flow to water the city of the living GOD? You need not be told, Reverend SIR, what place I mean. It was the famous Univerſity of Oxford. Nor need I mention
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011117_0006_0F8537EC0DB5B460"/>
the ſcene exhibited; it was a tribunal, a viſitatorial tribunal, erected in Edmund Hall—ſix pious ſtudents, who promiſed to be the ſalt of the earth, and lights of the world, entire friends to the Doctrines and Liturgy of our Church, by a Citation previouſly fixed upon the College door, were ſummoned to appear before this tribunal. They did appear; and, as ſome were pleaſed to term it, were tried, convicted, and to cloſe the ſcene, in the chapel of the ſame Hall, conſecrated and ſet apart for nobler purpoſes, had the ſentence of Expulſion publickly read and pronounced againſt them.</p>
            <p>So ſevere a ſentence, in an age when almoſt every kind of proper diſcipline is held with ſo lax a rein, hath naturally excited a curioſity in all that have heard of it, to inquire what notable crime theſe delinquents may have been guilty of to deſerve ſuch uncommonly rigorous treatment. But how will their curioſity be turned into indignation, when they are told, that they were thus rigorouſly handled for doing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o evil at all, and that no fault could be found in them, ſave in the law of their GOD?</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, one article of impeachment was, "that ſome of them were of Trades before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Univerſity." But what evil or crime worthy of expulſion can there be in that? To be called from any, though the meaneſt mechanic employ, to the ſtudy of the liberal arts, where a natural Genius hath been given, was never yet looked upon as a reproach to, or diminution of, any great and public character whatſoever. Profane Hiſtory affords us a variety of examples of the greateſt Heroes who have been fetched even from the plough, to command armies, and perform the greateſt exploits for their Country's good. And if we examine ſacred Hiſtory, we ſhall find, that even David, after he was anointed King, looked back with ſweet complacence to the rock from whence he was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011117_0007_0F8537ECC62F5BD8"/>
hewn, and is not aſhamed to leave it upon record, that GOD took him away from the ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>folds, as he was following the ewes great with young ones; (as though he loved to repeat it) he took him, ſays he, that he might feed Jacob his people, and Iſrael his inheritance.</p>
            <p>But why ſpeak I of David? When JESUS of Nazareth, David's LORD, and David's KING, had for his reputed father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Carpenter, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (as it was a common proverb among the Jews, that "he that did not teach his ſon a Trade, taught "him to be a Thief;") worked at the trade of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter himſelf? For this indeed he was reproached and maligned; "Is not this, ſaid they, the Carpenter's ſon? Nay, Is not this the Carpenter?" But who were thoſe maligners? The greateſt enemies to the power of godlineſs the world ever ſaw; the Scribes and Phariſees; that generation of vipers, as John the Baptiſt calls them, who upon every occaſion were ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>om, and ſhooting forth their arrows, even bitter words, againſt that ſon of man, even that ſon of GOD, who, to diſplay his ſovereignty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſdom of the worldly wiſe, choſe poor Fiſhermen to be his Apoſtles; and whoſe chiefeſt of the Apoſtles, though bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, both before and after his call to the Apoſtleſhip, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with his own hands, and worked at the trade of a Tent-maker.</p>
            <p>If from ſuch exalted and more diſtant, we deſcend to more modern and inferior characters, we ſhall find, that very late, not to ſay our preſent times, furniſh us with inſtances of ſome, even of our Dignitaries, who have been called from Trades that tended to help and feed the body, not only to higher employs of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nature, but even to preſide over thoſe that are entruſted with the cure of ſouls. And who knows but ſome of theſe young Students, though originally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011117_0008_0F8537F216AF3488"/>
if they had been ſuffered to have purſued their ſtudies, might have either climbed after them to ſome preferment in the Church, or been advanced to ſome office in that Univerſity from which they are now expelled? One of the preſent reverend and worthy Proctors, we are told, was formerly a Lieutenant in the Army; and as ſuch a military employ was no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his being a Miniſter or Proctor, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that being formerly of Trades could have been no juſt impediment to theſe young mens becoming in proceſs of time true Goſpel-Miniſters and good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Their being accuſtomed to prayer, whether with or without a form, I humbly apprehend, would by no means diſqualify them for the private or public diſcharge of any part of their miniſterial function. "In that day, that Goſpel-day, (theſe laſt days wherein we live) ſaith the great GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will pour cut a Spirit of grace and a Spirit of ſupplication upon the houſe of David and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem." And the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaks of it as the common privilege of all Believers, that the Holy Spirit helps their infirmities, and maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them with groanings which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Forms of prayer, certainly, have their uſe; and take it altogether, our Engliſh Liturgy is, without doubt, one of the moſt excellent eſtabliſhed forms of public prayer in the world: but then, as no form in the very nature of the thing, can poſſibly ſuit every particular caſe, it is to be feared that many muſt never pray, at leaſt for the particular things they moſt ſtand in need of, if they are ſo to be tied up to their forms, that they cannot vary from them, or uſe free prayer at all.</p>
            <p>The great Biſhop Wilkins hath therefore wisely wrote an excellent Treatiſe on the benefit and importance of this kind of prayer; and could our Univerſity-youth be trained up to uſe proper extempore prayer, both before
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011117_0009_0F8537F3D45E5718"/>
and after ſermon, in the opinion of all good judges, it would be as commendable, as that ſtrange cuſtom of putting off our auditories with what is called the <hi>bidding prayer;</hi> in which there is not one petition for a bleſſing upon the following Sermon, and ſcarce any thing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but what hath been prayed for over and over again in the preceding common ſervice of our church.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing ſuch liberty ſhould be denied in public, as bleſſed be GOD it is not, ſurely we may be allowed, at leaſt it cannot be deemed ſinful, to uſe free prayer in our ſecret or private ſocial exerciſes of dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion. If ſo, what ſinners, what great ſinners muſt they have been, who prayed, and that too out of neceſſity, in an extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore way, before any forms of prayer were or could be printed or heard of? The prayers we read of in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the prayers which opened and ſhut heaven, the effectual, fervent, energetic prayers of thoſe righteous and holy men of old, which availed ſo much with GOD, were all of an extempore nature. And I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if not only our Students and Miniſters, but private Chriſtians, were born from above, and taught of GOD, as thoſe wreſtlers with GOD were, they would want Forms of Prayer, though we have ſuch a variety of them, no more than they did.</p>
            <p>The Sick, the Lame, the Blind, the Lepers that came to our Lord for healing, wanted no book to teach them how to expreſs their wants. Though ſome were only poor Beggars, and others, as the ſelf-righteous Scribes and Phariſees ſuperciliouſly choſe to term them, Gentile dogs, yet conſcious of their wants, and having a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt ſenſe of their diſtreſs, "out of the abundance of their hearts their mouths ſpake; and the compaſſionate IMMANUEL, who came to heal our ſickneſſes and bear our infirmities, ſent them away with a "Go in peace, thy faith hath made thee whole: Be it unto thee even as thou wilt."</p>

How unlike, yea how very unlike ſuch a bleſſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is the treatment theſe young Students have lately met with at Edmund Hall, who, amongſt other crimes of a like nature, were expelled for uſing extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore prayer. A crime not ſo much as mentioned in any of our Law-Books; a crime for which, in this laſt century at leaſt, no one hath ever been called to the bar of any public court of judicature; and a crime for which it is to be hoped, no Student will ever hereafter be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear and hear himſelf expelled for, at the bar of any of the reverend Doctors of Divinity or Heads of Houſes in the Univerſity of Oxford. But ſhould any be ſo infatuated as to determine, Jehu-like, to drive on thus furiouſly, as judgment hath unhappily begun, as it were, at the very houſe of GOD, it is to be hoped, that as ſome have been expelled for extempore praying, we ſhall hear of ſome few others of a contrary ſtamp, being expelled for extempore ſwearing, which by all impartial judges muſt undoubtedly be acknowledge to be the greater crime of the two.</p>
            <p>Singing, compoſing, or reading Hymns compoſed by others, and doing this in company, ſeems to be as little criminal as praying extempore. When the laſt words of David are about to be recorded, he is not only ſtiled, "the ſon of Jeſſe, the man who was raiſed up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob," but the grand title of being "the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael" brings up the rear. And "to teach and admoniſh one another in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs," is as truly a ſcriptural command, as "Thou ſhalt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and thy neighbour as thyſelf."</p>
            <p>When Eliſha the Prophet was about to propheſy before two kings, he called for a minſtrel, on which he played, to ſooth his ruffled paſſions, and prepare his heart the better for the reception of the Holy Spirit
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011117_0011_0F8537F506CCC0D0"/>
And were the Sons of the Prophets more frequently to entertain themſelves thus, I believe it would be as ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the miniſterial character, and recommend them as much, perhaps more, to all ſerious Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than their tripping up their heels, ſkipping and dancing at the muſic of a Ball-room, or playing even a firſt Fiddle at a concert. And was the voice of ſpiritual melody more frequently heard by thoſe who come occaſionally to viſit our Colleges, it might be as much to the honour of the Univerſity, as the more common and too, too frequent noiſe of Box and Dice, at the unlawful games of Hazard and Back-gammon.</p>
            <p>Popiſh countries, Popiſh ſeminaries, think it no ſhame, no diſgrace to be heard ſinging the high praiſes of their GOD in their Convents, their Houſes, or even in their Streets; and why Proteſtants in general, and Proteſtants Students in particular, ſhould be any more aſhamed of, or reſtrained from the free exerciſe of ſuch acts of devotion, either in ſecret or in private ſocieties, no good reaſon can be given; unleſs it be proved to be good reaſoning to aſſert, that Proteſtants ought to be leſs devout than Papiſts. We muſt confeſs that Papiſts, though they take this liberty of ſinging and chanting privately and publicly themſelves, yet deny this liberty of conſcience to our Proteſtant aſſemblies, thoſe attending divine worſhip at our Ambaſſador's chapels not excepted. But for Proteſtants to diſuſe it themſelves, and at the ſame time lay as it were a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual embargo upon their fellow Proteſtants, nay puniſh and expel them for ſo doing, is very unaccountable.</p>
            <p>What ſpirit then muſt thoſe be of, Reverend SIR, who have lately joined in pronouncing the ſentence of expulſion againſt ſix religious Students, not only for having been of Trades, and praying extempore, but for reading, and ſinging Hymns alſo? His Royal Highneſs the late Duke of Cumberland, was of a very
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011117_0012_0F8537F5C352D098"/>
different diſpoſition, for when abroad in Germany, in one of our late wars, (as I was informed by a perſon then on guard) hearing one evening as he was paſſing by, a company of ſoldiers ſinging at ſome diſtance in a cave, he aſked the centinel what noiſe that was; and being anſwered that ſome devout ſoldiers were ſinging Hymns; inſtead of citing them to appear before their Officers, ordering them to the whipping poſt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to be drummed out of the regiment; acting like himſelf, he only pleaſingly replied, "Are they ſo? Let them go on then, and be as merry as they can." In this he acted wiſely; for he knew, and found by repeated experience, as did other commanding officers, that ſinging, nay, and praying extempore too, in theſe private ſocieties, did not hinder, but rather ſitted and animated theſe devout ſoldiers to engage, and to fight their country's battles in the field. And it may be preſumed, that if theſe Students had not been expelled for ſinging Hymns, and praying extempore they certainly would not have been leſs, but in all probability much better prepared for handling the ſword of the Spirit, the Word of GOD, and fighting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, either from the Preſs or the Pulpit, the battles of the LORD of hoſts.</p>
            <p>To ſee or hear ſuch divine exerciſes treated with reproach, and ſpoken of with contempt by common and open blaſphemers, is bad, but that any who came on purpoſe to be trained up for the ſacred work of the Miniſtry, ſhould be looked on as criminal, and expelled a Univerſity for being ſometimes employed in them, is too ſad a proof not only that "our gold is become dim, and our fine gold changed, but that our very foundations are out of courſe." What then muſt the righteous do?</p>
            <p>What indeed, but weep and lament. And weep and lament indeed they muſt, eſpecially when they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011117_0013_0F8537F6888ACC50"/>
hear further, that meeting in a religious ſociety, giving a word of exhortation, or expounding and commenting a little now and then upon ſome portion of ſcripture, are not the leaſt of theſe accuſations for which ſome of theſe young worthies had the ſentence of expulſion pronounced againſt them.</p>
            <p>It is recorded in the Old Teſtament, that in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate age, "thoſe that feared the LORD ſpake often one to another; that the LORD hearkened and heard, and that a book of remembrance was written before him for thoſe that feared the LORD, and thought on his name: and they ſhall be mine in that day, ſaith the LORD, when I make up my jewels; and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him." Thus it was in the Old Teſtament times. Nor are ſuch meetings mentioned with leſs approbation in the New: for therein, in order that we may hold the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, we are commanded to "conſider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works; not forſaking the aſſembling ourſelves together, but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as we ſee the day approaching." Nay, one immediate conſequence of that grand effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt on the day of Pentecoſt, we are told, was this, namely, that "they who gladly received the word, and were baptized, continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine, in fellowſhip, in breaking of bread, and in prayer." This is a ſhort, but withal a full and bleſſed account of the firſt truly apoſtolic primitive Church; and we may venture to affirm, that as we are more or leſs partakers of a true apoſtolic primitive ſpirit, ſuch kind of religious or fellowſhip-meetings, will in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion increaſe or decreaſe among us. To talk therefore, or write, or preach againſt, or either by private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion or open violence to oppoſe or endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or diſcountenance ſuch kind of religious ſocieties,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011117_0014_0F8537F743FCFF00"/>
is flying, as it were, in the very face of the ſcriptures of truth, and of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>In all our charters granted by the crown, wherein authority is given to bodies corporate to enact laws, it is always with this limitation, namely, that no laws ſhall be enacted by ſuch bodies corporate contrary to the laws of the realm. And as the Scriptures are our grand <hi>Codex Legum</hi> and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in reſpect to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles and practices, what affront muſt we put upon our country in general, and the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in particular, even by barely imagining that any law now exiſts that prohibits any of her members from frequenting ſuch ſocieties as have the divine authority and ſuperſcription ſo apparently ſtamped upon them?</p>
            <p>The private meetings that are in any wiſe deemed and denounced illegal, are ſuch, and only ſuch, as are ſeditious, and compoſed of ſeditious perſons, who aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, indeed under a pretence of religion, but indeed to plot againſt the ſtate. The ſooner any that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of this are made to forſake the aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, the better: and though compoſed of a threefold, three hundred fold, nay a three thouſand fold cord, no matter if, like the cords wherewith the Philiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines bound Samſon, they were immediately broken. But as nothing of this nature can with the leaſt ſhadow of truth be objected againſt the meetings and ſocieties fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by theſe Students, but quite the contrary urged in their favor, if ſcripture and the practice of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians are to be our guides, they ought not only to be permitted, but countenanced and encouraged by every true lover of our church and nation.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſing in any ſuch religious ſociety one of them ſhould venture now and then to drop a word of exhortation, or even attempt in a ſmall degree to open, expound, or enlarge upon ſome practical text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how can even this be looked upon as illegal, much
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011117_0015_0F8537F8034595E0"/>
leſs ſinful or worthy of expulſion, when, I could almoſt ſay, it is a neceſſary preparation for the future ſervice of the ſanctuary? To be apt to teach, is one indiſpenſible qualification required by Scripture either in a Biſhop or Preſbyter. But how can this aptneſs or an habit of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be acquired without the exerciſe of previous acts? Or what buſineſs is there in the world, even from the loweſt mechanic, to the higheſt profeſſion amongſt us, (except that of divinity) wherein Pupils, Clerks, nay common Apprentices, are not by previous exerciſes trained up for a complete proficiency in their reſpective callings and occupations?</p>
            <p>Our all-wiſe Maſter, we know, ſent his Diſciples on ſhort excurſions, before He gave them the more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive commiſſion to go into all the world: and were our Students in general, under proper limitations, to be thus exerciſed and employed, while they are keeping Terms at the Univerſity, or among their poor neighbours in the country, when they return home in time of vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would not turn out ſuch meer novices, or make ſuch awkward figures, as too many raw creatures do when they make their firſt appearance in the pulpit. I remember, above thirty years ago, after ſome young Students had been viſiting the ſick and impriſoned, and had been giving a word of exhortation in a private houſe, that upon meeting the Ordinary and Miniſter of the pariſh in their return to College, they frankly told him what they had been doing; upon which, he turned to them, and ſaid, "GOD bleſs you: I wiſh we had more ſuch young curates." A milder, and therefore a more chriſtian ſentence this, than that of a late expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the very ſame ſuppoſed crimes and miſdemeanors.</p>
            <p>As for the reports of theſe young Students being accuſed or condemned for barely being acquainted with, or occaſional viſitors of ſome of the moſt laborious pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking worthy pariſh-miniſters in England, it is almoſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011117_0016_0F8537F8CFF7FF58"/>
altogether incredible. And yet the ſtanders-by, as well as the ſuppoſed Culprits themſelves, as we are informed, aver this to be real matter of fact: attended with this melancholly aggravation, that they were hiſſed at, puſhed about, and treated in a manner that the vileſt criminal is not allowed to be treated, either at the Old-Baily, or any Court of juſtice in the kingdom. We are likewiſe told, that a copy of their indictment was aſked for, but denied them. And not only ſo, but that one, from whoſe politebehaviour in the worldly walk, better things might have been expected, was heard to ſay, as he came out of Chapel, to their grand Accuſer, after ſentence of expulſion was pronounced, that he would have the thanks of the whole Univerſity for that day's work.

               </q>
What thanks, Reverend SIR, he may meet with from the whole Univerſity, I know not: but one thing I know, namely, that he will receive no thanks for that day's work from the "innumerable company of Angels, the general aſſembly of the Firſt-born, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven, or from GOD the judge of all, in that day when JESUS, the Mediator of the New Covenant ſhall come in his own glory, in the glory of the Father, and his holy angels, and gather in his elect from all the four corners of the world."</p>
            <p>But, Reverend SIR, may we not preſume to hope that this voluntary ſpeaker for the whole Univerſity, whoever he be, it maketh no matter to me, was ſomewhat out and miſtaken in his calculation. For it ſeems not above three or four Doctors, if ſo many, were preſent at, at leaſt ſat as judges at this extraordinary tribunal. The worthy Provoſt of Queen's, (and undoubtedly many other worthy Heads of Houſes, were, and are like minded) was for preſcribing more lenient methods: and all are glad to hear that theſe young Students worthy

Principal, who muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to be the beſt judge of their principles, practices, and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, boldly ſtood up in their defence, aſſerted their innocence, confronted their accuſers, and brought in books to vindicate both their principles and conduct. But how this worthy Principal, as well as pupils, were treated, is beſt known to thoſe who had an active hand in all.</p>
            <p>However, as the Holy Ghoſt hath left upon record, to the honour of Nicodemus, that he ſtood up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our LORD before the whole Jewiſh Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, and was not conſenting to his death, ſo wherever this act of expulſion is recorded (and recorded it will be, even to lateſt poſterity) it will be mentioned to the honour of Doctor DIXON, (and for acting thus he will have the thanks of all moderate, ſerious, ſober-minded Chriſtians in the three kingdoms) that he had no hand in, but did all he poſſibly could to prevent theſe young mens expulſion. An expulſion for Articles of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which indeed the accuſed pleaded guilty; but for Articles which (wherever they may be called to miniſter in holy things) will be their teſtimonial; and their expulſion for holding and confeſſing thoſe Articles, the ſtrongeſt letters of recommendation.</p>
            <p>How theſe young worthies are now to be diſpoſed of, or how they will diſpoſe of themſelves, as it was not ſo much as hinted that they had the leaſt connection with me, is not my buſineſs to inquire. But ſurely ſuch an expulſion as this cannot deter them from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their preparations for their miniſterial calling: friends they cannot want, becauſe "he is faithful who hath promiſed that whoſoever forſaketh father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, houſes or lands, for his ſake or the goſpel's, he ſhall have an hundred fold in this life with perſecution, and in the world to come life everlaſting." But if any act ſo daſtardly as to make unſcriptural conceſſions, or

            <p>But what a mercy is it, Reverend SIR, that we live under a free government, under a King whoſe Royal Grandfather repeatedly declared (and he was as good as his word through a long and glorious reign) that there ſhould be no Perſecution in his time; and under a King who in his firſt moſt gracious and never-to-be-forgotten Speech from the throne, gave his people the ſtrongeſt aſſurances "that it was his fixt purpoſe, as the beſt means to draw down the divine favour on his reign, to countenance and encourage the practice of true Religion and Virtue, and maintain the Toleration inviolable."</p>
            <p>That both Students and common People will be in danger of being tempted by ſuch violent proceedings to put themſelves under the act of Toleration, may eaſily be foreſeen: and it may as eaſily be gueſſed how ſuch treatment will neceſſarily diſcourage ſerious people from ſending their ſons to the Univerſity of Oxford; and at the ſame time furniſh them with a new argument for entering their youth in ſome of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Academies, where they will be in no danger, it is preſumed, of being expelled for ſinging Hymns, ſpeaking a little now and then in a religious Society, or uſing extempore Prayer.</p>
            <p>Alas! alas! what a diſadvantageous point of light muſt all concerned in ſuch an extraordinary ſtretch of Univerſity-diſcipline ſtand in among all foreign Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities whatſoever?

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011117_0019_0F8537FB1E10AF90"/>
little time will diſcover. Nay, it is to be feared, the diſcovery is made already: for by a letter dated ſo lately as March 29, it appears that a certain venerable Society "on account of ſome circumſtances that have lately happened (probably the circumſtances of a late expulſion) are under a neceſſity of coming to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to accept of no recommendation for perſons to go abroad as Miſſionaries, but ſuch as have had a literary Education, and have been bred up with a deſign to dedicate themſelves to the Miniſtry." This reſolution ſeems to be taken in order the better to prevent any of theſe caſt-outs or any other laymen, however otherwiſe well qualified and recommended, from applying to the Society for Holy Orders, that they may be employed and ſent abroad as Miſſionaries. But to what a ſad dilemma will many ſerious perſons be hereby reduced? They muſt not, by ſuch reſolutions it ſeems, be allowed to be Lay-Preachers, and yet if ſent by their friends to the Univerſity to purſue their ſtudies, in order that they may be regularly and epiſcopally ordained, if they ſing Hymns, pray extempore, or give a word of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in a religious Society, though entirely made up of the members of the Eſtabliſhed church, they muſt be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> expelled for ſo doing. O <hi>tempora! O mores!</hi> If matters proceed in this channel, what ſtamp, Reverend SIR, may we ſuppoſe our future Miſſionaries to the Iſlands and Continent will be of? To my cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge all of them are not looked upon as very burning and ſhining lights already.—But if what little light of true Religion ſome may have, is to be thus damped by acts of expulſion before they leave the Univerſity, and even this little light, as far as lies in the power of man, is to be thus turned into total dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how great muſt that darkneſs be! Surely it muſt be worſe than Egyptian darkneſs; a darkneſs that will be moſt deplorably felt by all true lovers of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalvation both at home and abroad.</p>

You need not be apprized, Reverend SIR, that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for the eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy in our Iſlands and Plantations, hath been long upon the tapis; and that it hath been, in part at leaſt, the ſubject of annual Sermons for ſeveral years laſt paſt. No longer ago than in the year 1766, the preſent Biſhop of Landaff inſiſted upon the neceſſity and expediency of it in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit manner; nay, his Lordſhip carries the matter ſo far as to aſſure us, that this point, namely, the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Epiſcopacy, being obtained, "the American church will go out of its infant ſtate; be able to ſtand upon its own legs, and without foreign help ſupport and ſpread itſelf: and then, adds his Lordſhip, this ſociety will have been brought to the happy iſſue intended." Whether theſe aſſertions of his Lordſhip, when weighed in a proper ballance, will not in ſome degree be found wanting, is not for me to determine. But ſuppoſing the reaſoning to be juſt, and his Lordſhip's aſſertions true, then I fear it will follow, that a Society, which ſince its firſt inſtitution hath been looked upon as a Society for propagating the Goſpel, hath been all the while ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Society for propagating Epiſcopacy in foreign parts: and if ſo, and if it ever ſhould appear that our Right Reverend Archbiſhops and Biſhops do in the leaſt countenance and encourage the unſcriptural proceedings at Edmund-Hall, how muſt it increaſe the prejudices of our Coloniſts, both in the Iſlands and on the Continent, againſt the eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy; that perſons of all ranks, from Quebec down to the two Floridas, are at this time prejudiced and more than prejudiced againſt it, is very notorious; but how will the very thought of the introduction of Lords Biſhops even make them ſhudder, if their Lordſhips ſhould think proper to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the expulſion of ſuch worthy and truly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Students, whilſt thoſe who have no religion at all perhaps, may not only meet with countenance, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and applauſe?</p>

               </gap> Methodiſts, whoever or whatever they be, ſince ſcarce any now-a-days can pray extempore, ſing Hymns, go to Church or Meeting, and abound in other acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but they muſt be immediately dubb'd Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts—I ſay, dubb'd Methodiſts; for it is not a name given to them by themſelves, but was impoſed on them by ſome of their fellow Students and Cotemporaries in the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted, Reverend SIR, that you need not be apprized that I am one of theſe Methodiſts; and bleſſed be GOD I have had the honor of being one of them for about thirty-five years. If this is to be vile, may I be more vile! If this be my ſhame, upon the moſt mature and ſerious reflection I really glory in it. But then leſt any more innocent Youths ſhould hereafter ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer barely for the imputation of a nick-name, give me leave ſimply and honeſtly to inform you, Reverend SIR, and through you the whole Univerſity, what not barely a reputed, but a real Methodiſt is: "He is one of thoſe whom GOD hath choſen in CHRIST out of mankind to bring them by CHRIST to everlaſting ſalvation, as veſſels made to honour. Wherefore they, which be endued with ſo excellent a benefit of GOD, be called according to GOD's purpoſe by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon: they, through grace, obey the calling; they be juſtified freely: they be made the ſons of GOD by adoption: they be made like the image of his only begotten ſon JESUS CHRIST: they walk religiouſly in good works; and at length, by GOD's mercy, they attain everlaſting felicity." This is the true portraiture of a Methodiſt, drawn at full length, drawn to the very life, and that too not by an ignorant dauber, but by thoſe good old ſkilful ſcriptural limners,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011117_0023_0F8537FE02C91E98"/>
CRANMER, LATIMER, RIDLEY, in the xviith Article of our Church; an Article that deſerves to be written in letters of gold; and yet, for holding this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in its litteral grammatical ſenſe, agreeable to his ſubſcription at the time of matriculation, one of theſe young Students, as we have been informed, was expelled. If our information be wrong in this or any other reſpect, the nation may ſoon be ſet right by an authentic publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the whole judicial proceedings.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould deſire, Reverend SIR, a definition of Methodiſm itſelf, as well as of a Methodiſt, you may eaſily be gratified—It is no more nor leſs than Faith working by love—A holy method of living and dying, to the glory of GOD—It is an univerſal morality, founded upon the love of GOD ſhed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghoſt: or, to keep to the exact terms made uſe of in the laſt Collect of our excellent Liturgy, it is the grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the love of GOD, and the fellowſhip of the HOLY GHOST; which we cannot go to church or chapel on Sundays, Holidays, or other common days, without praying, not that it may be driven from, but <hi>be with</hi> us all evermore.</p>
            <p>If this be Enthuſiaſm, the true Methodiſts confeſs themſelves to be Enthuſiaſts. But then, they humbly apprehend, that they cannot with any juſt propriety of ſpeech be termed modern Enthuſiaſts; for it is an Enthuſiaſm which our bleſſed LORD, in that prayer which he put up when he was about to take his farewel of his Diſciples, and which is a pattern of that all-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing interceſſion which He is now making at the right hand of GOD, moſt earneſtly inſiſts upon, and demands that all his diſciples may be poſſeſſed of: "Father, ſaid he, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, may be with me where I am; that they may be one with me, even as thou, O Father, and I are one: I in them,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011117_0024_0F8537FEC6089DE0"/>
and they in me, that they all may be made perfect in one." An Enthuſiaſm with which Peter and John were fired, when Annas the high-prieſt, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high-prieſt, ſeeing their boldneſs, and perceiving that they were unlearned and ignorant men, marvelled, and took knowledge of them that they had been with JESUS. An Enthuſiaſm with which the Proto-Martyr Stephen was filled, when he cried, "Ye ſtiff-necked and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt." An Enthuſiaſm which Ignatius, ſuppoſed by ſome to be one of thoſe little children whom the Lord JESUS took up in his arms, was abſorbed in, when he ſtiles himſelf a Bearer of GOD; and for witneſſing of which good confeſſion, in order to cure him of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, was ordered by Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, the Roman Emperor, to be thrown to the Lions. An Enthuſiaſm for which Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, thoſe glorious lights of the Reformation, thoſe excellent compilers of our Liturgy, Articles, and Homilies, were burnt alive for, near Baliol college. And, to mention but one more too too recent an example, an Enthuſiaſm, for being only a little tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with which Six Students, on March 11th, in the Year of our Lord 1768, were publicly expelled in Edmund Hall chapel.</p>
            <p>But think you, Reverend SIR, that this is the way to ſtop the progreſs of this Enthuſiaſm? Or rather, may we not imagine that this very act of expulſion will be a means of furthering and promoting its progreſs far and near? To ſpeak my own thoughts, I am fully perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if ſuch unſcriptural methods of ſtopping this Enthuſiaſm be purſued further, it will be only like cutting off the Lyrnean head; inſtead of one, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred will ſpring up.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if the Picture of modern Enthuſiaſts, drawn up and preſented to the public by your Right Reverend
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011117_0025_0F8537FF8F280CF8"/>
Dioceſan, be a juſt and proper one, ſuppoſing at the ſame time the Methodiſts are thereby referred to, no matter how ſoon they are baniſhed out of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and out of the Church alſo: for his Lordſhip is pleaſed to tell us "that they act in direct oppoſition to the perverſe Phariſees of old; theſe aſcribed the works of the Holy Ghoſt to Beelzebub; and it is no uncommon thing for theſe modern Enthuſiaſts, adds his Lordſhip, to aſcribe the works of Beelzebub to the Holy Spirit." Surely his Lordſhip, by theſe modern Enthuſiaſts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean any who apply for Holy Orders, and profeſs before men and angels, that "they are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to take upon them the office and adminiſtration of the church:" when the ſearcher of hearts knows that they are moved only by ſecular views and worldly hopes of preferment; this is indeed aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works of Beelzebub to the Spirit of GOD with a witneſs: or, to uſe the words of a no leſs learned, tho' leſs cenſorious Prelate, I mean the moderate Biſhop Burnett, "it is a committing the horrid crime of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias and Saphira over again; it is lying, not only unto man, but unto GOD."</p>
            <p>This is a modern kind of Enthuſiaſm, Reverend SIR, which the true old Methodiſts always did, and I truſt always will abjure, deteſt and abhor. If worldly church p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ferments had been their aim, ſome of them at leaſt might have had worldly ladders enough let down to them to climb up by: but having received a kind of Apoſtolical commiſſion at their Ordination, when thoſe who profeſs themſelves lineal ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto you by the impoſition of our hands:" they would fain keep up and maintain ſomething of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an apoſtolic character; and therefore without ever ſo much as deſigning to enter into any political ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, or civil or church factions whatſoever, without
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011117_0026_0F85380397905940"/>
turning to the right hand or the left, or troubling the world with ſo much as one ſingle ſermon or pamphlet on the bare externals of Religion; they have endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have but one thing in view, namely, to determine to think of nothing, to know nothing, and to preach of nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified; to ſpend and be ſpent for the good of ſouls, and to glory in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſave in the croſs of CHRIST, by whom the world is crucified unto them and they unto the world. It is true, by thinking and acting thus, the Methodiſts have been, &amp; it is preſumed always will be, charged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by men of corrupt minds, as thinking and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irregularly and diſorderly: But as ſuch a charge, in the very nature of the thing, ſuppoſes a deviation from ſome ſettled ſtanding rule, they would humbly aſk where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the irregularity and diſorderlineſs of this way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thinking doth ſpecifically conſiſt? Is it irregular and diſorderly to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon? Is it irregular and diſorderly to do what every Biſhop at the very time of our being ordained Prieſts poſitively tells us pertaineth to their office, namely, "to ſeek after the children of GOD, ſcattered abroad in this naughty world?" Is it irregular and diſorderly after we have eſtabliſhed the truth of what we deliver in our ſermons by ſcripture proofs further to confirm and illuſtrate them by repeated and particular quotations, taken from the Liturgy, Articles, and Homilies of our Eſtabliſhed Church? Is it irregular and diſorderly to fill her Pews, to crowd her Communion Tables, and to recommend a frequent and conſtant devout attendance upon her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Offices and Services? Or, ſuppoſing they ſhould, merely by caprice or prejudice, be denied the privilege of preaching within the Church, can it be juſtly termed irregular or diſorderly, at leaſt can it poſſibly be looked upon as criminal, to preach the ſame truths, to make uſe of the ſame kind of illuſtrations, to repeat the ſelf-ſame
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011117_0027_0F853804A63E40B0"/>
recommendations without the church walls, in the fields, or any other place whatſoever?</p>
            <p>The late candid Biſhop of Lincoln, I am poſitive, did not think ſuch a way of acting altogether ſo very crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; for in the charge given to his Clergy ſome years before his tranſlation to the See of Saliſbury, he told them to this effect, "that they were not to look upon themſelves as Miniſters of a Plato, a Pythagoras, or any other heathen Philoſopher, conſequently they were not to entertain their auditories with mere moral harangues, but that they were to conſider themſelves as Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST; and therefore if they would not preach the goſpel in the Church, they could not be juſtly angry if the poor people went out to hear it in a field." A charge this truly worthy of a ſober minded, moderate, wiſe Biſhop of the church of England. For even in acting ſeemingly thus irregularly and diſorderly, theſe modern Enthuſiaſts only copy after the greateſt and brighteſt examples the world ever ſaw, and whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples it is more than criminal not to follow or copy after. Our bleſſed LORD, when denied the uſe of the Synagogues, ſeeing the multitude, went up and choſe a mountain for his pulpit, and the heavens for his found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-board. At other times he ſat by the ſea-ſide, nay, went into a ſhip and preached, whilſt the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſtood on the ſhore. When Peter and John, that this kind of Enthuſiaſm might ſpread no further among the people, were ſtraitly threatned and commanded that they ſhould thenceforth ſpeak at all to no man in CHRIST's name, they calmly yet boldly replied unto their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and commanders, "Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you, more than unto God, judge ye: For we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard." A certain woman, named Lydia, a ſeller of purple, had her heart opened when the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles was preaching and praying by a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011117_0028_0F85380561AAE198"/>
river-ſide; and Dionyſius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others, believed, and clave unto the ſame Apoſtle, from the time they heard him preach in the midſt of Areopagus, or Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hill. And we may ſuppoſe he was not leſs ſucceſsful when he was obliged by the angry Jews to preach in the ſchool of one Tyrannus.</p>
            <p>I believe you will agree, Reverend SIR, that the venerable Fox and Bradford did not appear leſs vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for preaching at Paul's croſs; neither did I ever hear that Biſhop Latimer was looked upon as degrading his epiſcopal character, when he uſed to preach out in Cotten Garden Weſtminſter, and King Edward the ſixth, that Joſiah of his age, with ſome of his court, leaning on velvet cuſhions, looked out at the palace window to hear him. And I hereby appeal to the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, whether the Reverend Doctors of Divinity, Heads of Houſes, Graduates or Under-Graduates, ever looked upon it as criminal, or beneath the dignity of their place and ſtation, to ſit out in the open air on St. John Baptiſt's day, to hear a Maſter of Arts preach from the ſtone pulpit in Maudlin College yard; though for fear it may be they ſhould give further ſanction to field-preaching, they have lately thought proper to adjourn into the Chapel?</p>
            <p>You know, Reverend SIR, who it was that, when thoſe who were bidden in a regular way refuſed to come to the wedding-ſupper, without aſking any one's leave for ſo doing, ſent forth ſome irregulars into the lanes and ſtreets of the city, into the highways and hedges, with that glorious encouraging commiſſion, not by fines and impriſonments, not by threats and expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not by killing the body for the good of the ſoul, but by filling their mouths with Goſpel arguments, backed with the all-powerful energy of the Holy Ghoſt, to <hi>compel</hi> poor, wandering, weary, heavy-laden ſinners to come in. Armed with this panoply divine,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011117_0029_0F85380586AAD150"/>
and, as they think, authoriſed by the ſame LORD, ſome few of us continue to this day, amongſt ſmall and great, high and low, rich and poor, in Church or Chapel, in commons, ſtreets, fields, whenſoever or whereſoever divine Providence opens a door, to teſtify repentance towards GOD and faith in our Lord JESUS CHRIST: and this not out of contempt of, or in oppoſition to the godly admonitions of our eccleſiaſtical ſuperiors, but becauſe "the love of CHRIST conſtraineth us," and we think that a wo, a dreadful wo, awaits us if we preach not the Goſpel. Not that we are enemies to a decent or even epiſcopal conſecration, or ſetting apart Churches and Chapels for divine and holy worſhip: but we are more indifferent about the reputed outward ſanctity of places, becauſe our LORD, with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, ſaid unto the woman of Samaria, "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem, worſhip the Father: but the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth. Hence we infer, that every place is then, and only then, properly called holy, when, like the ground around the burning buſh, it is made holy by the divine preſence of Him who ſpake to Moſes out of the buſh; or like mount Tabor, which by the Apoſtle Peter is called by way of emphaſis, the Holy Mount, becauſe himſelf and James and John, not only had upon that mount a viſible outward manifeſtation, but alſo a bleſſed inward heart-felt ſenſe of the Redeemer's excellent glory. It was undoubtedly this that made Peter break out into that exclamation: "Maſter, it is good for us to be here." And it was this that warmed, and not only warmed, but conſtrained the enraptured Patriarch Jacob, when he had only the ground for his bed, the ſtones for his pillow, and the open firmament for his curtains and furniture, to break forth into that extatic language
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011117_0030_0F8DF58204CA68F0"/>
"How dreadful is this place! this is no other than the houſe of GOD; this is the gate of heaven."</p>
            <p>If then, Reverend SIR, for this and ſuch like things we are accounted irregular and diſorderly, we are truly ſorry for it:—Sorry, but not upon our own accounts, having the teſtimony of a good conſcience that we act with a ſingle eye, and in direct conformity to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the word of GOD: but we are ſorry barely on account of our impeachers and condemners, eſpecially thoſe who being ſet apart for the miniſterial Office, and loaded with eccleſiaſtical preferments, preach very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or not at all; or, if they do preach now and then, preach only as though they were barely reading wall-lectures, and ſeldom or ever ſo much as mention or quote the Homilies of our Church, though they have ſubſcribed to an Article which ſays, that "they contain a godly and wholeſom doctrine, and which judges them to be read in Churches by the miniſters diligently and diſtinctly, that they may be underſtood of the people." It is to be feared, that it is owing to ſuch irregularity and diſorder as this, that when our people hear of our Articles or Homilies quoted by ſome few in the pulpit, that they are ready to cry out, "What new doctrine is this? Thou bringeſt certain ſtrange things to our ears:" At leaſt if it is not ſo at home, I am ſure it is ſo abroad. Hence it was that about three years ago, after I had been preaching to a very large auditory in one of the moſt polite places on the Continent of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and in preaching, as is my uſual cuſtom, had ſtrongly been recommending the book of Homilies, numbers were ſtirred up to go to the ſtores to purchaſe them: But upon inquiring after the book of Homilies, the Storekeeper, ſurprized at the novelty of the word Homilies, begged leave to know what Muſlins they meant, and whether they were not Hummims.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:011117_0031_0F85380B8F648188"/>
What a pity therefore is it, Reverend SIR, that the book of Homilies, which ought to be in every hand, and as common as our Common Prayer Books, ſhould never yet have found a place in the large catalogue of books given away by the truly laudable Society for promoting Chriſtian Knowledge, though founded ſoon after the glorious Revolution. If this be not remedied ſome way or another, we ſhall very ſoon become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly indeed: our Pulpits will ſtill continue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our Reading-deſks, and we ſhall never have the honour of being ſtiled regular and orderly, till, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Subſcriptions, Oaths, Rubrics, and Ordination-Offices themſelves, our practices give the lie to our profeſſions, and we ſeek the fleece and not the flock, and "preach ourſelves, and not CHRIST JESUS our LORD."</p>
            <p>Dead Formaliſts, and proud ſelf-righteous Bigots, may loudly exclaim and cry out, "the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we!" They may not only cry out, but alſo caſt out; and thinking they thereby do GOD ſervice, though moſt notoriouſly deficient in their own moral conduct, may plead conſcience, and ſay, "Let the Lord be glorified." But to ſuch as theſe our LORD once ſaid, "Ye are they that juſtify yourſelves before men, but GOD knoweth your hearts." Like the chief Prieſts, the Scribes and Phariſees of old they may plead their Law; for the breach of which theſe irregulars, as they imagine, ought to be condemned and ſuffer; nay, time may come when they may be permitted to enforce their clamarous accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations by urging, as their godly predeceſſors once did againſt our Maſter, that "we found theſe fellows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute unto Caeſar; but Pilate knew that for envy they delivered Him." And though they could plead their Loyalty, and ſay, "If thou let this man go thou art not Caeſar's
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011117_0032_0F85380D610B4A20"/>
friend, we have no king but Caeſar;" yet both our LORD and his Apoſtles rendered themſelves, and ſtrictly taught all that heard them, to "render unto Caesar the things that are Caeſar's, and unto GOD the things that are GOD's." Fain would the Methodiſts copy after ſuch gloriouſly divine examples: and, bleſſed be GOD, after a trial of near forty years, upon the moſt ſevere ſcrutiny, their LOYALTY cannot be juſtly ſo much as once called in queſtion; for, as they fear GOD, ſo they dearly love and honor their King, their rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign King GEORGE; and have been, and continue to be, ſteady invariable friends to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion in the illuſtrious Houſe of Hanover. And if ſo, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing theſe Methodiſts ſhould be convicted of acting ſomewhat irregular, ſince it is only the irregularity of preaching and recommending unfeigned Love to GOD, and, for his great name ſake, undiſſembled, diſintereſted Loyalty to their King; is it not the intereſt as well as duty of civil government, if not to encourage, yet not to oppoſe them? For it is certainly a moſt inconteſtable truth, that every additional proſelyte to true Methodiſm, is an additional loyal ſubject to King GEORGE the Third, whom, with his Royal moſt amiable Conſort, our gracious Queen CHARLOTTE, the Methodiſts with one united voice earneſtly pray GOD long to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be a nurſing Father and nurſing Mother to our Church and People of every denomination whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Every body is loudly complaining of the badneſs of our Times, and the degeneracy of our Morals. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners now proclaim their ſin like Sodom, and the nation hath ſuffered more than a ſecond deluge by an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of every ſin, and every kind of corruption that was ever committed or practiſed under Heaven: "The whole head is ſick, the whole heart faint; from the crown of the head to the ſole of our feet, we are full of wounds and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores."

there no man be found then to ſtand in the gap? None dare to attempt at leaſt to ſtem the impetuous torrent? None venture to go out with their lives in their hand, and cry to a profane, careleſs, buſy world, "Oh! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters?" Can any conſiderate, much more any real good man, be ſo cruel, as even to wiſh that the Goſpel ſhould be confined either to Church or Meeting, when there are ſo many thouſands and ten thouſands who, as to ſpiritual things, know not their right hand from their lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If ſome are called to be ſettled Miniſters (and may the great Head of the Church fill all our Pariſh Churches and Meeting Houſes with true evangelical Paſtors!) may not others be called out to be Itinerants? Have there not been Preſbyters at large, even from the earlieſt times of Chriſtianity? And if ſome of a more inferior rank and order ſhould be qualified, and thruſt forth by the great LORD of the harveſt, when the harveſt is ſo great, and the labourers ſo few, who ſhall dare to ſay to Him, "What doſt thou?" Shall our eye be evil becauſe He is good? If Iſaiah was a Courtier, was not the Prophet Amos a Herdſman? In the days of Moſes, when the Iſraelites were under a more immediate divine theocracy, news was brought him, and that too even by a Joſhua, that Eldad and Medad were propheſying in the camp, without his Licence or his Ordination; what doth this meek man of GOD ſay? "Envieſt thou for my ſake? Would to GOD all the LORD's people were prophets." And in the days of our LORD himſelf, when He was perſonally preſent, his beloved diſciple John, before his heart was more enlarged by divine love, ſaid unto him, "Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not with us, and we forbad him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he followeth not with us." But what ſaid JESUS, that good Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls? "Forbid him not."</p>

Such inſtances, ſuch ſtriking inſtances as theſe, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, ſhould make even good men careful not to give way to a narrow, ſelfiſh, bigotted ſpirit; and caution them againſt joining with the world in ſmiting their Fellow-ſervants, by crying down or ſpeaking ſlightingly and reproachfully of a method of preaching and acting, which, maugre all oppoſition, for theſe thirty yeaars laſt paſt hath been bleſſed and owned of GOD, to the converting of thouſands; not to a bare name, ſect or party, or merely to head or notional knowledge, but "from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD;" from holding the mere form, to the true abiding poſſeſſion and practice of true ſcriptural godlineſs, in heart, lip, and life. But if good or bad men now diſlike, and therefore oppoſe ſuch an irregular way of acting, they may be told to their comfort, that their uneaſineſs on this account, in all probability, will not be of long continuance; for few will chooſe to bid, or offer themſelves candidates for ſuch airy PLURALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES: to go thus without the camp, bearing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reproach; to become in this manner, "Spectacles to GOD, to angels, and to men;" to ſacrifice not only our natural, but ſpiritual affections and connections, and to part from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

greatly miſtaken if, in the Redeemer's own good time and way, ſome ſpiritual phoenix will not hereafter ariſe, ſome bleſſed goſpel-inſtrument be raiſed, that ſhall make the devil and his threefold army, "The luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the pride of Life," to fly before the ſound of the goſpel trumpet.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this particular, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend SIR, becauſe the preſent learned Biſhop of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, in his late volumes, intitled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Doctrines of Grace, is pleaſed to obſerve, more than once, that he finds fault not ſo much with the matter, as the manner of the Methodiſts preaching. But if by the manner, his Lordſhip would have us to underſtand, not their manner of preaching in the field, but their manner of delivery, whether in the church or field, I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſk his Lordſhip, if he ever heard any of them preach? If not, doth our law condemn any man, or ſet of men, unheard? And I would humbly enquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Lordſhip, and all others whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, how they would have them or any others preach?</p>
            <p>I remember the great Doctor Delauny, when I had the honour of being with him, many years ago, at the Right Reverend Doctor Boulter's, then Lord Primate of Ireland, among other hints, proper for a young Preacher, gave me to underſtand, that whenever he went up into a pulpit, he deſired to look upon it as the laſt time he ſhould ever preach, or the laſt time that the people ſhould ever hear him. O that all Preachers, whether within or without doors, however dignified or diſtinguiſhed, went always up into their reſpective pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits thus impreſſed! They would then preach as Apelles once ſaid he painted, namely, for Eternity: They would then act the part of true goſpel Chriſtian Orators, and not only calmly and cooly inform the underſtanding, but by perſuaſive pathetic addreſs endeavor to move the affections, and warm the heart. To act otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad ignorance of human nature, and ſuch an inexcuſable indolence and indifference in the preacher, as muſt conſtrain the hearers, whether they will or not, to ſuſpect that the Preacher, let him be who he will, only deals in the falſe commerce of unfelt truths.</p>
            <p>Were our Lawyers, our Counſellors, or our Players to act thus, both the Bar and the Stage would ſoon be deſerted; and therefore that anſwer of Mr. Betterton, to a worthy Prelate, when he aſked him "how it came to paſs that the Clergy, who ſpoke of things real, affected the people ſo little, and the Players, who ſpoke of things barely imaginary, affected them ſo much," is worthy of laſting regard. "My Lord, ſays Mr. Betterton, I can aſſign but one reaſon, which is, We Players ſpeak of things imaginary as though they were real, and too many of the Clergy ſpeak of things real as though they were imaginary." Thus it was in his, and all know it is too much the caſe in our time. Hence it is, that even on our moſt important occaſions, the worthy gentlemen concerned in our public charities, generally find themſelves more obliged to the Muſicians than the Preachers, for the largeneſs of their collections: and hence, no doubt it is, that upon our moſt ſolemn Anniverſaries, after long previous notice hath been given, when ſome even of our Lords Spiritual preach themſelves, perhaps not two Lords temporal come to hear them.</p>
            <p>Sorry, am I therefore, Reverend SIR, to inform you, that a celebrated Orator, in one of his Lectures deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if I am not miſtaken, in the Univerſity of Oxford, takes the liberty of ſaying, "That it is to be feared this is too much the ſtate of the Pulpit-elocution in general, in the church of England: On which account, adds he, there never was perhaps a religious ſect upon earth whoſe hearts were ſo little engaged in the act of public worſhip as the members of that Church. To be

pleaſed, we muſt feel, and we are pleaſed with feeling. The Preſbyterians are moved; the Methodiſts are moved; they go to their meetings and tabernacles with delight; the very Quakers are moved; fantaſtical and extravagant as the language of their emotions is, yet ſtill they are moved by it, amd they love their form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for that reaſon: Whilſt much the greater part of the members of the Church of England, are either ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it through diſguſt, or reluctantly attend the ſervice as a diſagreeable duty."—Thus far Mr. Sheridan.</p>

               </gap> why go I to the Bar or Stage to fetch vouchers in defence of earneſtneſs in heart and action, when ſpeaking for the moſt high GOD, and offering ſalvation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and immortal ſouls, for whom the ever-adorable Mediator ſhed his precious blood? You know, Reverend SIR, the character given of Bucolſpherus one of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, <hi>Vividus vultus, vividi oculi, vivida manus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique omnia vivida.</hi> You have alſo heard of a Prophet who was commanded by the Lord God himſelf to ſmite with his hand, and ſtamp with his foot; and goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in general are commanded to "cry aloud, and ſpare not, and lift up their voices like trumpets." But why refer I even to Reformers or Prophets? Rather let me mention the GOD and Savior of all, even our Lord JESUS CHRIST, on whoſe manner of preaching the multitudes that followed him, when he came down from the mount made this juſt obſervation, that "he ſpake as one having authority, and not as the Scribes." And after his reſurrection when "beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf," the two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at Emmaus ſaid one to another, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the ſcriptures?" And I believe we may venture to affirm, that if preachers in general ſpake and opened the ſcriptures more under the

influence and energy of his bleſſed Spirit, whether in conſecrated or unconſecrated ground, within or without doors, they would find that their hearers hearts in a degree would burn within them too.</p>
            <p>But I have done.—You will be ſo good, Reverend SIR, as to pardon not only the freedom but prolixity of this. I have already mentioned the motives for writing, and therefore ſhall now cloſe with the advice given upon a ſimilar occaſion to an eccleſiaſtical council by Gamaliel, a Doctor of Law, and had in reputation among all the people: "And now I ſay unto you, refrain from theſe men, and let them alone: for if this council or work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it: leſt haply ye be found to fight againſt God." To this God, and the word of his <hi>grace.</hi> I moſt humbly recommend both yourſelf and the whole Univerſity, and earneſtly pray, that all at all times may have a right judgment given them in all things; I beg leave to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>
