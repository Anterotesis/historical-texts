            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF SIR GEORGE ELLISON.</head>
            <p>SIR George Elliſon's father was the younger ſon of an ancient and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent family, and as ſuch received only a ſmall proportion of his father's wealth, but by his profeſſion was enabled to live genteely. He dedicated all his leiſure hours to the care of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:042696_0004_101C880C0E699B10"/>his children's education: Their learning he left to proper maſters; the object of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was their hearts. He inſtructed them fully in the Chriſtian religion, and ſhewed them that it was the beſt foundation, as well as ſureſt ſupport of moral virtue.</p>
            <p>Before his ſon George had completed his one and twentieth year, his family, by the death of his wife and two children, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two ſons and one daughter. James his ſecond ſon, was then but twelve, and his daughter fourteen years old. This difference in their ages determined Mr. Elliſon to truſt in his ſon George's hands two thirds of the ſum of 4000l. of which he was poſſeſſed. By ſo good a capital he hoped to ſecure the ſucceſs of his eldeſt ſon, whoſe diſpoſition gave him reaſon to believe he ſhould thereby do the beſt ſervice to his other children. He knew the young man to be perfectly ſober, humane, and generous, and at the ſame time an exceeding good oeconomiſt extremely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and well inclined to that care of, and attention to his affairs, ſo neceſſary for thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042696_0005_101C88565CD10F58"/>who undertake merchandiſe. And indeed, George, as he entered into merchandiſe, he wiſhed to purſue it in the moſt profitable manner, indifferent as to any inconveniencies which might attend it. He therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſettle correſpondences with ſome of the leſs adventurous merchants, by whoſe means he might negotiate a quick trade from Jamaica, where he intended to fix; and the character he had eſtabliſhed in the city, by his excellent behaviour during his apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Mr. Lamont, an eminent merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, rendered him ſucceſsful in both theſe articles; and with warm hopes, though ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concern, he took leave of his father and this kingdom, well provided with correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents here, and recommendations to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal people in Jamaica.</p>
            <p>Five years after his firſt ſettling at Jamaica, he acquainted his father with his reſolution of returning the whole capital he ſet out with, obſerving the hazard his brother and ſiſter ran by his being intruſted with the whole; but, that his father might not apprehend he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:042696_0006_101C88101EF212C8"/>was diſtreſſing himſelf, he further informed him that he had now raiſed a capital of 6000l. to which he ſhould always think he had as good a title as himſelf.</p>
            <p>If Mr. Elliſon's good conduct gained him the eſteem of his own ſex, we may eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the other was not inſenſible of his merit; eſpecially as it was accompanied by a very fine perſon, a face handſome from great ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of features, but ſtill more from vivacity, ſenſibility, and ſweetneſs of countenance; a manner and addreſs polite and engaging, and a turn for converſation peculiarly agreeable. As the manners of Jamaica are not peculiarly reſerved, many intimations were given to him of the favourable diſpoſition of the Ladies; but his attention was ſo totally engaged by his buſineſs, that the ſtrongeſt hints were loſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; Yet the politeneſs of his behaviour, and the chearfulneſs of his temper, ſo well concealed the coldneſs of his heart, that to warm it ſeemed no impracticable attempt; and prudence, as well as inclination, might diſpoſe many to endeavour to gain the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:042696_0007_101C8859613E6040"/>of ſo worthy and ſo ſucceſsful a young man. No woman had the mortification of thinking ſhe had a rival, till a widow Lady entered the liſts.</p>
            <p>This Lady was ſeven years older than Mr. Elliſon, having completed her three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year. Though the bloom of youth was paſt, ſhe was ſtill handſome, and behaved very prudently in the different ſtates of life in which ſhe had appeared; was poſſeſſed of ten thouſand pounds in money, and a plantation of no leſs value. Mr. Elliſon's friends per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him not to let ſlip ſo good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of improving his fortune; ſince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe advantages, her character and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rendered it an eligible match. He liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without reluctance, to the advice of his friends, but, being ſenſible he ſhould feel double ſatisfaction if he had his father's ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would not make any direct addreſs to the Lady, till he had received that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſent. His father took the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of removing this impediment, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only his conſent but his approbation,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:042696_0008_101C8812F6ACE708"/>accompanied with the warmeſt wiſhes for his happineſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon, whoſe inclination for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had increaſed with acquaintance, received his father's letter with joy; and, now mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an expreſs declaration of his attachment, the widow, without affected reluctance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his propoſal, and the marriage was ſoon completed.</p>
            <p>By the alteration of his fortune, Mr. Elli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon found his ſphere of action extended; but (as is frequently the caſe) this gave him great uneaſineſs. The thing which had chiefly hurt him during his abode in Jamaica, was the cruelty uſed on one part of mankind, as if the difference of complexion excluded them from the human race. He had not been married above a week before he gave great offence to his wife and ſteward, by putting a ſtop to a moſt ſevere puniſhment, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be inflicted on a great number of them, who, intoxicated with the pleaſures of a holy-day, had not returned home at the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:042696_0009_101C885AE7C76538"/>time commanded. 'I am, ſaid he, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, henceforward, to eaſe your ſteward of this part of his buſineſs; the produce of the land he may ſtill attend, but thoſe who cultivate it ſhall be my care; he is not fit to be truſted with any thing but what is inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. And that you may not think I pay too high a price for this indulgence of my compaſſion, or rather this compliance with my conſcience, I will endeavour to find a means of rendering our ſlaves obedient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the laws of juſtice and humanity.'</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elliſon was mortified to find her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band incorrigible in ſo material an article, fearing leaſt her fortune ſhould ſuffer thro' his ſimplicity; but humanity, when ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warm and ſteady, ſeldom waits long for the power and opportunity of exertion. He ſoon formed a plan, and ſet about the execution of it with the utmoſt diligence. Afterwards haranguing his ſlaves, 'While you perform your duty, ſaid he, I ſhall look upon you as free ſervants, or rather like my children, for whoſe well-being I am ever anxious and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:042696_0010_101C8815BA34C990"/>watchful. I have provided you with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient habitations; given you a plentiful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all neceſſaries; aſſigned to each a ſmall ſhare of peculiar property; taken care of you in ſickneſs; and conſidered your eaſe in health; I have increaſed your liberty; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted your amuſements; and much lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your puniſhments. But ſtill theſe are too heavy; I cannot feel myſelf ſo ſuperior to any of my fellow-creatures, as to have a right of correcting them ſeverely. I am determined therefore, for the future, to aboliſh all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments. I ſhall require nothing of you that can be properly thought a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but, if gratitude and prudence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bind you to good behaviour, the firſt offence ſhall be puniſhed by excluding you from partaking of the next weekly holy-days; for the ſecond fault you ſhall not only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of your diverſion, but of a day's food; and, if theſe gentle corrections do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, on the third offence you ſhall be ſold to the firſt purchaſer, however low the price offered; and this ſentence is irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; no prayers, no intreaties, ſhall move me.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:042696_0011_101C885EF86FD488"/>The man who, after ſo happy a change to his condition, can repeatedly offend, is not worthy to be the object of my care; and ſhall become the property of ſome maſter, whoſe chaſtiſements may keep within the bounds of duty the actions of that man, whoſe heart cannot be influenced by grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or his own true intereſt.'</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon's humanity had already gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the affections of his ſlaves, but on this declaration they almoſt adored him, and in the ſtrongeſt terms promiſed him, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves likewiſe, never to offend ſo good a maſter, in ſuch a manner as to bring them under the heavy ſentence he had pronounced againſt thoſe who perſevered in diſobedience. This was at that time the real ſentiments of their hearts, but human frailty had left ſcarcely the reſolution of one unbroken; yet few of them were ſo ſenſeleſs as to incur the third puniſhment. The firſt who was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, when he found that the ſentence was going to be put in execution, was almoſt diſtracted, and was with difficulty reſtrained
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:042696_0012_101C881743DA1198"/>from doing violence on himſelf. His impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate intreaties for pardon extremely diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Elliſon. To deny the poor wretch a farther trial grieved him to the ſoul; and yet he ſaw that a ſtrict adherence to his firſt declaration was abſolutely neceſſary; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to endure the conflict, though not unmoved, yet with unaltered purpoſe; and to ſhew them that, in deſpight of his compaſſion, which was too great to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, he was ſtill inflexible.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elliſon, who met him as he returned from this unhappy wretch, was amazed at his uneaſineſs. 'Surely, ſaid ſhe, you have no ſpirit, if you can pity ſuch an ungrateful creature. I hope you are ſenſible it is a great weakneſs to be ſo tamely forgiving.' 'How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I think ſo, replied Mr. Elliſon, when I ſee ſuch various proofs that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whom there is no weakneſs, who is all perfection, is far more forgiving than any of his creatures? He is love and mercy itſelf; can then any portion of the divine nature, that part of his image which he ſtamped on
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:042696_0013_101C8861C91D6F60"/>man, be eſteemed a failing! How much more diſobedient are the beſt of us to him, than our ſlaves are to us? Yet he does not cruſh us with his power; he neither ſends the lightnings to blaſt the offender, nor peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to conſume a ſinful country; he bears with us year after year, gives us frequent calls and admonitions to repentance, and leaves us a long ſeaſon for amendment.'</p>
            <p>As Mrs. Elliſon was not deficient in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhe ſaw there was ſome truth in what her huſband had ſaid; but it was a truth her reaſon could more eaſily perceive, than her heart feel, for it was ſteeled by habit.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon, ſoon after his marriage, had deſired his father to ſend him over a proper perſon to teach reading, writing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; leaving him at liberty as to the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, only deſiring that the man might be ſober and virtuous. As ſoon as this perſon arrived, he gave him a neat houſe and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed him ſchoolmaſter, ſending all the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:042696_0014_101C881B76656A40"/>children of his Negroe ſlaves to be under his tuition. He cauſed them to be inſtructed in the principles of the Chriſtian religion, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to civiliſe their manners, and rectify their diſpoſitions. This office he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf to thoſe more advanced in years, believing inſtruction would come with more authority and perſuaſion from him, as they reſpected him as their maſter, and loved him for the happineſs they enjoyed in his ſervice; and certainly ſuch doctrine can ſcarcely fail of proving perſuaſive, when the preacher's actions are ſo eminently conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his precepts.</p>
            <p>By plentiful food and a comfortable life, Mr. Elliſon's Negroes became ſtronger than any in the iſland; the natural ſtrength of thoſe who belonged to other maſters being conſumed by hardſhips and hunger. His were therefore able, with eaſe, to do ſo much more work, that he might have diminiſhed their number, if compaſſion had not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing his conduct ſucceed to his utmoſt wiſh. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:042696_0015_101C88649359A4D0"/>are naturally faithful and affectionate, though, on great provocation, their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is unbounded, and they will indulge their revenge, though to their own certain deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Above a year paſſed away without his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to ſell another ſlave; which gave him hopes he ſhould never again be expoſed to ſo painful an exertion of his power. And the poor wretch, whoſe example had ſo good an effect on his companions, had all that time ſuffered the uſual ſeverities under a hard maſter. His ſelf-reproaches made him dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wretched, and, as he lived in a plantation adjacent to Mr. Elliſon's, he was a conſtant object of compaſſion to his former compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who frequently lamented his fate, and repreſented his diſtreſs with ſuch pathetic ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, as touched Mr. Elliſon's compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heart to ſo great a degree, that he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to re-purchaſe him at any price. This he effected on more reaſonable terms than he hoped, for the poor fellow's dejection of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits was ſuch, that it undermined his health,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:042696_0016_101C881E9926A8E0"/>and rendered him ſo weak, that his maſter was very glad to get the price he had given for him. When he was acquainted with his being again become Mr. Elliſon's property, his joy was near proving fatal, having entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overpowered his ſpirits. A holy-day was given to all the ſlaves to welcome his return, and never was the reſtoration of a Monarch celebrated with ſo much heart-felt, diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted joy.</p>
            <p>But, although the gratitude and aſſiduity of this poor fellow's future behaviour greatly rewarded his maſter, yet it produced a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable event; another ſlave was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by it to flatter himſelf that Mr. Elliſon would never again exerciſe the ſame ſeverity, ſince it had proved ſo painful to him; but above all, not on one, who was particularly intelligent and uſeful, as this ſlave knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be. On this ſuppoſition, he extended his offence to a third time, but was dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed to find himſelf, notwithſtanding his moſt earneſt intreaties, doomed to be ſold. Before the day appointed for the ſale
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:042696_0017_101C88661A01CA88"/>of the offender arrived, he was ſeized with a violent fever, and his malady ſo increaſed as to render his recovery doubtful, and he was deſirous not to recover. Preferring death to ſlavery under another maſter, he refuſed to take the remedies preſcribed, and earneſtly begged he might be ſuffered to die. Mr. Elliſon thought his condition would ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently excuſe the reverſing of his ſentence; ſo that the poor man now became as anxious to preſerve, as he had been before deſirous of loſing his life; and, his mind being at eaſe, he recovered from his fever and his perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs together.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elliſon, before the expiration of the firſt year of their marriage, brought him a very fine boy. Her fortune enabled him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his trade; and his ſucceſs therein always anſwered his wiſhes. But he was not free from vexations; Mrs. Elliſon, though a good ſort of a woman, was one of thoſe who make bad companions in intimate ſociety. She was ſo very fond of her huſband, that ſhe was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable if he was out of her ſight. If, when
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:042696_0018_101C88215ED1C158"/>abroad on buſineſs, he did not return juſt at the hour ſhe expected, he found her in ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, leſt ſome misfortune had befallen him; and, with floods of tears, ſhe reproached him with inſenſibility of the pain ſhe ſuffered, from his want of punctuality. If he expreſſed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſpend an evening with a friend, ſhe was inconſolable, and lamented his indifference If he paid the common attentions which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs required for any other woman, ſhe was fired with jealouſy. When any generous action of his reached her ears, which could not but happen frequently, ſhe would moſt pathetically lament that, 'notwithſtanding the fine fortune ſhe brought, her dear boy would be a beggar,' and upon all emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhe would ſay, that her firſt huſband would not have uſed her ſo. Had Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon openly ſhewed an intention of enſlaving her huſband, ſhe would have found him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the relative duties of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, than to have ſubmitted to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful and unnatural yoke. But, when they were firſt married, ſhe reſtrained only with ſilken threads; the fetters were forged
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:042696_0019_101C886A34412E98"/>by degrees. By the little endearments of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive fondneſs, ſhe would bring him to compliance, when he raiſed objections from convenience, or politeneſs; and unwilling to appear inſenſible of ſo much tenderneſs, he would ſometimes delay buſineſs, and break appointments. Every compliance of this ſort rendered her applications more frequent, and if he ſhewed much reluctance, plaintive, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate reproaches of want of love, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the requeſt. Every conqueſt more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced her of his weakneſs; ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his greateſt fear was to give pain; that he could not bear without ſevere pangs, to be the cauſe of uneaſineſs to any perſon; but, above all, to one who was rendered ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of it, chiefly by her love for him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon, however, at length ſaw reaſon to ſuſpect there was more of policy than love in her behaviour; but, before he conceived this ſuſpicion, ſhe had brought him to a habit of compliance, which he could not ſhake oft without a ſtronger effort than the gentleneſs of his nature would ſuffer him to exert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:042696_0020_101C8824208228A8"/>But, if he ſtood juſtified to himſelf, his friends paſſed a leſs favourable ſentence. They found themſelves deprived of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſociety the place afforded, and were not a little angry with the occaſion of it. Some, ſeriouſly and ſenſibly, adviſed him to free himſelf from his bondage: Others laughed at him for his puſillanimity. A ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs that the advice was good, and the ridicule juſt, made him receive both with great good humour, but they were equally ineffectual; he eluded them in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he could, telling the firſt, that 'to throw off the reſtraint would give him more trouble than he found in ſubmitting to it;' and to the jeſters he only ſaid 'they muſt not wonder if his long application to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize had taught him to ſee every thing in the light of traffic; and his wife had bought him at ſo great a price, that he tho't ſhe had a right to make the beſt of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.' Her power over him could not be a ſecret, but he had pride enough to wiſh to conceal the uneaſineſs it gave him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:042696_0021_101C8826EC508F08"/>Mr. Elliſon had other vexations, which increaſed with the age of his little boy: He was equally the darling of both his parents, but they differed much in their opinions as to the proofs of that affection. The child was naturally of a paſſionate and ſtubborn temper, which his father ſaw with concern, and thought it his duty to keep him within reaſonable controul; and, if poſſible, to conquer faults, which, when ſtrengthened by time and habit, muſt prove incorrigible. Mrs. Elliſon, on the contrary, called his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſpirit, and his ſtubbornneſs conſtancy and ſteadineſs, and could not bear he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leaſt contradiction. She was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually puffing him up with the notion of his conſequence, repreſenting all the people about him as his ſlaves, and making them ſeek to pleaſe him by the moſt abject means. She taught him to look on them in the ſame light as ſhe herſelf did, as creatures deſtitute of all natural rights, of ſenſe and feeling. She was pleaſed to ſee him vent his childiſh paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon them, and was always ready to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his reſentments beyond his wiſh; and ſo
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:042696_0022_101C8829C0F9AA10"/>ſucceſsful were her endeavours, that, by the time he arrived at the age of five years, he was a little fury, burſting with pride, paſſion, inſolence, and obſtinacy. Mr. Elliſon ſaw all this with a very ſenſible concern; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to teach his wife the duty of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and to convince her that her indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence rendered her the child's moſt pernicious enemy; but, having never reaſoned in her life, the faculty was too feeble to enter into the force of his arguments; ſhe was too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to attend, and too weak to be convinced.</p>
            <p>He then aſſumed an air to which ſhe had hitherto been a ſtranger, and told her, 'though he had ſacrificed his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her, ſhe muſt not expect to find the ſame eaſy temper in him when the welfare of his ſon was at ſtake;' and in the moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manner declared, he would not ſuffer him to be made a brute. Tears were now called to her aid; ſhe wept for his cruelty, and lamented the hatred he bore both to her and her child. But all theſe arts proved now unavailing; Mr. Elliſon's heart was too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:042696_0023_101C886CFA8429E0"/>engaged in the importance of the cauſe of their contention, to be moved by any thing ſhe could ſay; and he kept ſo firmly to his point, that ſhe began to think it adviſable to calm him by a ſeeming compliance, and that ſhe, or her dear darling might not incur Mr. Elliſon's anger, ſhe taught the boy to conceal his thoughts and inclinations, and to aſſume ſuch a manner in his father's preſence, as for a little time gave that affectionate parent great pleaſure; but it was not long before he found, that to his other faults his ſon had now added a degree of deceit and hypocriſy, beyond what he imagined poſſible at ſo early an age; and that, while he loved his mother for laying the foundation of his future miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he beheld him only as an object of terror and hatred. To be ſuperiorly beloved was ſo great a gratification to Mrs. Elliſon's nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ungenerous mind, that ſhe rejoiced in every ſymptom of his diſlike to his father, though beloved by her as much as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſuch ſelfiſh principles as her's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:042696_0024_101C882C88B412B8"/>How truly unhappy is it for mankind that this difference in parents, in regard to the education of their children, ſo generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails—the mother fond of her child to exceſs, yet, blinded by her fondneſs, indulges it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon—and the father, tenderly dreading ing the ruin of his child, counteracting the mother in its preſence, while yet unable to judge of right or wrong.—Mr. Elliſon's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in this reſpect, was quite different; he was poſſeſſed of ſuch a forethought, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſtancy in the wrong he reſolved to rectify, as what is ſeldom (but which it could be wiſhed were oftner) to be met with. When he reproved Mrs. Elliſon it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the abſence of his child, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in ſuch a ſweet and perſuaſive manner, that had the child been preſent and capable of reaſon, it muſt have been won over to its duty, and the fondeſt affection for its father.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon was convinced of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and great importance to its future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and welfare depended on the education of his child. He was ſo convinced of the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:042696_0025_101C88700A424FF0"/>pernicious principles that his ſon was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing, and of the unhappy conſequence of them, that rather than have ſubmitted to it he would have given up his own immediate and domeſtic quiet. He knew that the evil habits imbibed at his ſon's age, took too deep a root, and if not checked in time, were ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be conquered, either by religion, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſuaſion. He had too fatal an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it in Mrs. Elliſon; educated in the iſlands, ſhe was familiariſed to cruelty and hardened to any idea of ſenſibility—ſhe could laugh at the ſufferings of the poor blacks, and would frequently reproach Mr. Elliſon for his humanity towards them. Such alſo, were the principles ſhe would have inſtilled into her child. But Mr. Elliſon's forecaſt of the natural conſequences of this, and how unhappy it muſt in future render, not only his child, but all thoſe with whom he might be connected, and more particularly thoſe under his immediate protection and care, put him on his guard to prevent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:042696_0026_101C882F4BC14318"/>When Mr. Elliſon found, that all the care he could take towards rectifying his ſon's temper was only made the occaſion of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing more evil into his diſpoſition, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, as the laſt reſource, to ſend him into England with a friend who was going thither; and there to have him placed at a ſchool, under the eye of his grandfather, who he knew would watch over him with the moſt affectionate attention. To execute this reſolution was a moſt painful talk. Mrs. Elliſon, at firſt, abſolutely refuſed conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; and to force on her the grief of parting with her ſon, who was then but ſix years old, gave him more poignant affliction than her heart was capable of feeling for any misfortune whatſoever.</p>
            <p>To remove her objections, he therefore propoſed their following the child into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as ſoon as they could ſettle their affairs in ſuch a manner, as might enable them to bid a long adieu to Jamaica, without great detriment; but this adminiſtered little conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Mrs. Elliſon, as ſhe had conceived
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:042696_0027_101C8871905AE3C0"/>a diſlike to England, which even her ſon's being there could not conquer; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to declare this, imagining it would make her fondneſs for the child appear leſs than ſhe choſe it ſhould be thought, Mr. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon, after ſending away his boy, was very aſſiduous in haſtening the means of their leaving the iſland; ſuppoſing he therein gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his wife as much as himſelf.</p>
            <p>The moſt difficult part of his buſineſs was to get a ſteward, who would treat his ſlaves with the ſame gentleneſs to which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed them; and he had nearly ſettled his commercial affairs, before he ſaw any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of finding a perſon fit for that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant office.</p>
            <p>The firſt rumour of his intended departure cauſed the utmoſt conſternation among theſe poor creatures; they gathered round him, and falling on their knees, in their imperfect Engliſh, cried out, 'Oh! maſſa, no go, no go; if go, ſteward whip, beat, kill poor ſlave; no go, no go; you go we die.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:042696_0028_101C88320B364128"/>He aſſured them, that he looked upon them all as his children, and promiſed no one ſhould ſupply his place, that did not conſider himſelf as their father. Inſtead of being ſatisfied with this promiſe, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, 'all fathers not good; no father like you;' and ſuch torrents of tears would accompany their words, as frequently ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered his reſolution. Notwithſtanding the moſt affectionate aſſurances he could give them, melancholy conſtantly ſat on their, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happy, countenances; at their holy-day meetings, inſtead of indulging the jollity of which they uſed to be ſo fond, their hours were ſpent in lamenting their approaching misfortune, and laughter was now exchanged for tears.</p>
            <p>Buſineſs having called Mr. Elliſon to Port-Royal, he there heard lamented, the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Mr. Hammond, an Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had been eſtabliſhed there above two years as a merchant in good credit. Mr. Hammond had juſt received a 1000 l. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for ſome commodities he had exported;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:042696_0029_101C8875B9E6E040"/>and this ſum he inſiſted on an unſucceſsful friend's taking for a time, in hopes it might enable him to ſave his credit, and carry on his trade till affairs took a more favourable turn.</p>
            <p>By this well-timed loan, the poor man and his family were ſaved from deſtruction; but loſſes by ſhipwreck, and other accidents, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſively fallen on Mr. Hammond, he ſaw himſelf reduced into the ſituation from which he had relieved his friend; with only this difference, that his was a ſingle diſtreſs; whereas a wife, and nine children, would have been ſharers in the misfortunes of the other. All Mr. Hammond's effects were ſeized, but proved inſufficient to diſcharge his debts. The creditors knew he had lent ſome money, but were ignorant as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſum: This they preſſed him to call in; promiſing, on the receipt of it, to diſcharge him from priſon, even if it did not quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to what was due to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:042696_0030_101C8834DE778F80"/>Mr. Hammond could not ſupport the thought of purchaſing his liberty by reducing ſo large a family to beggary; but, as he was ſenſible his creditors had a juſt right to all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, he offered to enter into the moſt bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engagements to give up the ſum to them, as ſoon as his friend could refund it without ruin; and to make him pay them the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed intereſt till that time; but, enraged at this delay, they refuſed to accept his offer, and declared he ſhould remain their priſoner.</p>
            <p>This ſtory very much affected Mr. Elliſon's compaſſionate heart; and in hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome method of relieving the diſtreſs of ſo worthy a man, he went the next day to the priſon to viſit him; and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to do his utmoſt, to bring the credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to agree to what he had offered, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociated the affair with great aſſiduity, but little ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>During the courſe of this tranſaction, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had many proofs of Mr. Hammond's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and humanity, he acquainted him
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:042696_0031_101C887751DF3DB8"/>with his reſolution of advancing the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds lent to his friend, and becoming himſelf that Gentleman's creditor; aſſuring Mr. Hammond that he ſhould never aſk for the payment, but ſuffer his friend to ſuit his own convenience in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>He then told Mr. Hammond, that he was ſenſible, though by this ſtep he might deliver him from priſon, yet he ſhould not ſecure him from diſtreſs; he therefore begged leave to aſſiſt him in any courſe of life wherein he thought proper to engage; adding, that he could not but wiſh he might accept the offer he now made him of taking upon himſelf the direction of his plantation and ſlaves, as he delayed his removal into England only till he could find a fit perſon for his ſteward.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hammond's heart overflowed with gratitude, as well for the transfer of the debt of the thouſand pounds, as for the kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer he made him. The care of the land, he ſaid, would give him pleaſure, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he might acquit himſelf tolerably well
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:042696_0032_101C8837A0BCFB40"/>in it, but he knew himſelf totally unfit for the government of ſlaves, the ſeverities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to keep them in order being ſuch, as he was not only incapable of decreeing, but even of beholding.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon, delighted with the ſentiments he had expreſſed, as they confirmed him in that opinion of his diſpoſition, which had firſt inſpired him with the deſire of leaving him his deputy when he ſhould depart the iſland, told him, that the difficulties he had been under in finding a ſteward, were occaſioned by the fears of having his ſlaves ill treated, who had always been uſed by him more like children than ſervants, and had convinced him by their behaviour, that ſeverity was not only unneceſſary, but hurtful. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Mr. Hammond therefore, if he had no other objection to the ſtewardſhip, to go home with him, and after ſufficient obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give him his anſwer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hammond readily acquieſced. When he ſaw Mr. Elliſon's conduct to his ſlaves,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:042696_0033_101C887C9400AE88"/>and how great the difference thereby made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and all others whom he had ſeen in that condition how much leſs abject their way of thinking; how chearful and aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous they were in performing their duty; the quickneſs of their apprehenſion; and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the nobleneſs of mind, and rectitude of principle, which kind encouragement and fatherly inſtruction had given them, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe who are ſtupified by ill uſage and oppreſſion; he no longer beheld the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he was invited to accept in a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light; but on the contrary, his heart ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with joy and tranſport at the happineſs of the poor ſlaves around him, he broke into the following ſoliloquy, which afforded Mr. Elliſon the higheſt ſatisfaction and delight.</p>
            <p>"O Humanity!—Heaven-born principle! —true and never ceaſing ſource of bliſs—hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thoſe, whoſe hearts are warmed with thy ſweet and benign influence! Bleſſed with the divine principle of thee, we forget ourſelves, and ſeek our deareſt joys in beſtowing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon others. By thy divine influence
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:042696_0034_101C883A612703C8"/>we tread the paths of peace,—and are led in the dear and bleſſed footſteps of Him, of whom thou art an all-glorious attribute. By thee we are led to the true and delightful ways or piety and religion—to the ways of pleaſantneſs—and to the paths of peace."</p>
            <p>Thrice happy that man, whoſe ſoul, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the true principles of real and pious ſenſibility, looks up to Heaven for an example for his conduct and behaviour in life. If bleſſed with affluence, his chief bliſs is to make others happy, and every time he relieves an object from diſtreſs, he feels a joy unutterable;—words want the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and language the expreſſion, to declare the delightful ſatisfaction he feels: Or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſuppoſing poverty his lot, and, that he has but little, yet, of that will he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter relief, and find more comfort and real ſatisfaction, than the miſer in his hoard or the ſpend thrift in his pleaſures.</p>
            <p>With all his affluence, is it likely that Mr. Elliſon, without that ſweet and heavenly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:042696_0035_101C887E1A8B8070"/>that fired his ſoul, would have enjoyed any degree of the happineſs he did? Is it not through all his actions the chief inſtrument of his bliſs, leading him, as it were, ſtep by ſtep, to the ſummit of human perfection?</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon now ſaw the liberty of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Jamaica approach. His mercantile affairs were the more eaſily ſettled by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's arrival in the iſland; for, as ſoon as he had determined on his return to England, he wrote to his father to ſend over his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther James, who had been likewiſe bred to merchandize, as it would be in his power to ſettle him very advantageouſly, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh him immediately in an extenſive trade, by making over his correſpondents to him. He found the young man ſenſible, honeſt, and diligent; and well deſerving the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he deſigned to give him.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elliſon was indeed leſs pleaſed with her brother in-law, fearing her huſband might favour him too generouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:042696_0036_101C883D651A5A20"/>The young man was ſhocked to ſee the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power ſhe exerciſed over her huſband, not immediately diſcerning, that there was one thing his brother feared even more than his wife, the reproaches of his own conſcience, and though he ſacrificed moſt worldly things to her caprices, yet there was a Being whom he more carefully endeavoured to pleaſe than her.</p>
            <p>Affairs were in this ſituation when Mrs. Elliſon was ſeized with a fever, at that time almoſt epidemical. The attack was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as from the firſt gave little hopes of a recovery, and, notwithſtanding the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical aſſiſtance, ſhe died in a few days.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon was ſincerely afflicted at her death; her faults he had long pitied and now forgot; while her virtues, or ſuch as he imagined ſhe poſſeſſed, were engraven on his memory.</p>
            <p>But his friends, while they endeavoured to conſole him, comforted themſelves in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:042696_0037_101C887FA2DC60A0"/>that though habit and gentleneſs of temper may teach a priſoner to hug his chains, yet when taken off, he will ſoon grow ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he is relieved from a burden, and find the removal of conſtant conſtraint makes him amends for the loſs of many pleaſures which accompanied it.</p>
            <p>But they had not an opportunity of ſeeing this ſuppoſition verified, as Mr. Elliſon did not ſtay long enough in the iſland after his wife's death, to wear off the grief he felt on the occaſion.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time, however, he became ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently himſelf to proſecute his plan for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling every thing there to the beſt advantage. He found Mr. Hammond even exceed his hopes; he ſoon gained the affection of the ſlaves; an open, humane, and chearful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance giving them a prejudice in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which his conduct improved into a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:042696_0038_101C8840272001A8"/>He alſo beheld with delight, the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the children had received in the ſchool he had eſtabliſhed. The maſter's ſalary was raiſed, and a young lad left with him of a remarkable good diſpoſition and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as an aſſiſtant, but with a ſecret view of qualifying him to ſucceed, in caſe the maſter ſhould die, or grow weary of the charge.</p>
            <p>The ſchoolmaſter's ſiſter, upon invitation, being come over from England, was made miſtreſs of a ſchool of Negroe girls, a charge wherein ſhe acquitted herſelf extremely well. The effect of their inſtructions was evident in the conduct of the Negroes; for the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity of their tempers, their obſtinacy, and that reſentful turn of mind, ſeemingly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to them, were ſo ſoftened by religion, that it very ſeldom happened that any ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of them appeared.</p>
            <p>By this time Mr. Elliſon's brother James had entered into a very tender attachment. The youth no ſooner became acquainted with
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:042696_0039_101C8884100C0C28"/>Miſs Reynolds, a young lady in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, than he felt the influence of her charms; ſhe was not inſenſible of the merits of her lover, and they were ſo well agreed before Mr. Elliſon's departure, that James thought it proper to inform his brother of his inclination.</p>
            <p>A long acquaintance with Miſs Reynolds had afforded him a good opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her merit; his brother could not have choſen a woman he ſo much eſteemed; her fortune, though not conſiderable, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be of ſome aſſiſtance in trade, and her prudence and oeconomy were well ſuited to his ſituation. He therefore very ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave his approbation, had the marriage celebrated with great elegance in his own houſe, and made a preſent to the bride of all the jewels that belonged to his deceaſed wife. To his brother he gave a houſe he had at Kingſtown, with all his plate and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and the free uſe of all his furniture; and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Hammond he allowed 200 l. per
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:042696_0040_101C8842F3F861E0"/>annum, with the liberty of living in his houſe, and many other privileges.</p>
            <p>Having thus intirely ſettled, his affairs, he ſet ſail for England, leaving his friends and dependants moſt ſenſibly afflicted, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their grief, though the deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his native country, of ſeeing his father and his child, and of repairing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution much hurt by the heat of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, made the change on the whole very deſirable to him.</p>
            <p>His voyage was ſwift and proſperous; and no dangers called off his thoughts from the pleaſure he felt in anticipating, in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the joys he expected from his return to his native land; but diſappointments too often follow the hopes which have riſen to the higheſt point, and when we think we are juſt ready to graſp our pleaſures, they elude our touch, and leave us nothing but regret.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon had in his imagination formed many delightful ſcenes, between himſelf and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:042696_0041_101C8886E4DF58A8"/>his father; the evening of whoſe days he hoped would be greatly brightened by ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his proſperity, and by his aſſiduous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to amuſe, if he could not relieve, the infirmities of age. But all theſe flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes are put to flight on his arrival in port; a letter being delivered him there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him that his father was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ill, not from ſudden ſickneſs, but a gradual decline.</p>
            <p>Old Mr. Elliſon had taken care he ſhould receive this intimation, to prepare him for their firſt meeting, and render it leſs ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, to make it ſtill leſs affecting, he had ſent for his grandſon home, in hopes that the joy of the parent would mitigate fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial ſorrow. Nor was he totally diſappointed; Mr. Elliſon could not be inſenſible of the pleaſure of ſeeing his only child in health, and in appearance improved, of which the dying man gave him all the comfortable proofs he could recollect. But this, though it in ſome meaſure alleviated his grief, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficed to render it ſupportable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:042696_0042_101C88447ACB6058"/>The indulgence he had given his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made the approaching death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more grievious. He was greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the calm reſignation of his mind; the patience with which he ſupported his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſtemper; and the chearful and lively hopes of a bleſſed eternity, which in his eyes diſarmed death of all its terrors, and made him look on his laſt hour with the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, as on any one that preceded it; and ſo well ſupported him at the fatal inſtant, as to render him ſcarcely ſenſible of the pains which uſually attend the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon determined, as ſoon as he had ſettled his affairs, to fix in the country. Sir William Elliſon his couſin-german, invited him to his ſeat in Dorſetſhire, promiſing to ſhew him ſeveral good houſes, any of which were to be hired or purchaſed; and Mr. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon was particularly inclined to fix his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in that country, as it had been the place of his family's former reſidence. He had ſent over, before he left Jamaica, 45000l.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:042696_0043_101C88886AF67960"/>and, beſide the intereſt of that ſum, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 1200l. a year from his plantation, clear of all deductions.</p>
            <p>On his arrival at his couſin's ſeat in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, he was received very affectionately. Sir William had not ſeen him from the time he firſt left England, but retained a great regard for him, founded on an early ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his virtues. Though nearly related in blood, there was little reſemblance in the diſpoſitions of theſe two gentlemen. Sir William was a man of ſenſe and integrity, but a humouriſt. He was now, at fifty years old, a batchelor; for having been in his youth jilted by a woman he ardently loved, who, after all preliminaries to their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was ſettled, left him for a man of larger fortune, and more gaudy appearance, he had made a vow never more to addreſs any of the ſex; and kept that vow better than is uſually done by thoſe who make it in a fit of reſentful rage and diſappointment. His father died ſoon after, and left him in the poſſeſſion of 3000l. per annum, free
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:042696_0044_101C884878067BC8"/>from any incumbrances whatſoever; the eſtate in good order, and the manſion houſe well furniſhed, and above a year's income in caſh.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon, though well pleaſed with Sir William's reception and conversation, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he laid him under ſome reſtraint, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to make his viſit very long; and, therefore ſoon called upon the Baronet to fulfil his promiſe, of ſhewing him the houſes which were to be purchaſed in that country.</p>
            <p>After ſeeing them all, he fixed on one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt adjoining to Sir William's, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it with the eſtate belonging thereto, conſiſting of two farms of about 150l. a year each.</p>
            <p>The houſe was a large and good old man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in tolerable repair; but, having ſtood empty near ten years, during the minority of the owner, was inwardly in very bad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the gardens entirely gone to ruin. This circumſtance much leſſened the price,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:042696_0045_101C888B40592838"/>but was no diſagreeable thing to Mr. Elliſon, who rather choſe to lay out the place to his own taſte, than to pay for what the ſeller might call improvements.</p>
            <p>He immediately purchaſed it, and, being provided with a houſe-keeper who had am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple recommendations to him, he informed her, that a decent and regular oeconomy in his houſe was what he expected, as far from extravagance and waſtefulneſs as from parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. He would have his ſervants enjoy ſoberly all the comforts of life, as he thought that to make them happy, was his firſt duty; but this he knew was beſt done by order, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and decent frugality. He would have ſuch a number of ſervants as could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the buſineſs of his houſe with eaſe, and therefore deſired her to conſider how many ſervants would be requiſite.</p>
            <p>As for the ſtate of the adjacent poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet but little acquainted with it, he could give no particular directions, but wiſhed ſhe would inform him of what ſhe heard on that
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:042696_0046_101C884B49694958"/>point, and likewiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ntion to him the ſort of relief ſhe judged more proper.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to ſhew how Mr. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon was circumſtanced, as to a more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>On the contrary ſide to Sir William's houſe lived Mr. Grantham, lawful heir to the Duke of—, if that Nobleman died without child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; which was now highly probable, as he was above 60 years old, and his Ducheſs but little younger. Mr. Grantham was indeed a very diſtant relation, yet was heir both to the eſtate and title; but, this branch of that great family having fallen to decay, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited from his father only 50l. a year. This he farmed himſelf, and lived in the only houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> had, which was little better than a common cottage. His education had been on a level with his fortune, and his manners were thoſe of a plain honeſt farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; yet regard for his birth, and compaſſion for his narrow circumſtances, procured him a due portion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:042696_0047_101C888F6C6328C0"/>gentlemen. His notions of family pride had an influence over him in the choice of a wife. He thought he ſhould diſgrace his blood by marrying a farmer's daughter, though with ſuch a one he might have got a few hundred pounds, which would have ſet him much at his eaſe; and, a Lieutenant dying in an adjacent town where he was quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and leaving a daughter intirely unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and greatly diſtreſſed, he thought her a wife much more ſuitable to the dignity of his family. Captivated by her gentility ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by her perſon, for ſhe was no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he took a pride in addreſſing the Captain's daughter (for the courteſy of a country town kindly beſtows the title of Captain on every officer) and ſhe was glad to accept of any proviſion.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Grantham was more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than he had reaſon to expect; his wife proved very notable and induſtrious, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too prolific, having perpetuated the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Granthams, of which the Duke and he were the laſt, by bringing him five
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:042696_0048_101C889AC75580A0"/>ſons and three daughters; a number attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great difficulties in their narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; but the thought that they might one day be ſo many Lords and Ladies, was a ſufficient conſolation, and made them behold ſo numerous a progeny with exultation.</p>
            <p>At the diſtance of about two miles from Mr. Elliſon's lived Mr. Allin; a gentleman who inherited a good eſtate from his father, but, being extravagant in his youth, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it within very narrow bounds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved himſelf in difficulties that had a good deal ſoured his temper, converting his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance into parſimony. His ſociety would not have been very eligible, had it not been for an only daughter who kept his houſe, whoſe beauty, accompliſhments, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities, rendered her the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed young woman in the whole country.</p>
            <p>A little father off dwelt Mr. Blackburn, an old gentleman of great merit; who by a due mixture of ſtudy and converſation, had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embelliſhed an admirable underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:042696_0049_101C5CE1F6F84BD0"/>On the other ſide of Mr. Elliſon's houſe, and about five miles from it, lived young Mr. Blackburn, ſon to the gentleman juſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; his father having given him an eſtate with a good houſe upon it, on his marriage with a young woman of family, but no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, whoſe beauty had captivated the young man; his father being glad to encourage any rational inclination, in hopes the ſociety of a woman he loved might reform him from his vices. But ſucceſs had not anſwered his wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; young Mr. Blackburn ſoon grew tired of his wife, and returned to his bottle, to hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaming, and women; and behaved with ſuch inſolence to his father, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him for his diſſolute courſe of life, that he baniſhed him his preſence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a reſolution to diſinherit him. This breach had ſubſiſted three years, when Mr. Elliſon came into the country; and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill as much offended, and the ſon as far from reformation, as ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe were Mr. Elliſon's neareſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and firſt viſitors, paying him their
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:042696_0050_101C889D8F4AD350"/>compliments before he had got a room fit to receive them. But, as he aimed at nothing farther than neatneſs and convenience, it was not long before his houſe was as well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he deſired.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon had two very particular attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his neighbourhood; Mr. Blackburn delighted his underſtanding; Miſs Allin cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated his heart. But it is probable, that even all Miſs Allin's attractions might have proved ineffectual, had they not found him in a ſtate of leiſure.</p>
            <p>Buſineſs firſt, and then duty, had hitherto defended his heart; theſe ſhields were now removed, and it lay open to Cupid's arrows; in ſuch a defenceleſs ſtate it might have fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a prey to half her perfections, and could not make the leaſt reſiſtance. Nor indeed did he wiſh it; he yielded himſelf a willing captive; for, as he had no deſire to remain ſingle, he with pleaſure encouraged an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for a woman he thought ſo well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to make him happy, and whoſe narrow
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:042696_0051_101C5CE38745B990"/>circumſtances gave him reaſon to hope for a favourable reception.</p>
            <p>An inclination we chuſe rather to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than repreſs is very quick in its growth. Mr. Elliſon had been ſettled but two months in Dorſetſhire, when he came to a reſolution of aſking Mr. Allin's permiſſion to addreſs his daughter, giving him to underſtand that his fortune ſet him above all pecuniary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>The great advantages his daughter would find in ſuch an union, would have made Mr. Allin ſufficiently eager to compleat it, had he not been ſpurred on by the laſt article, which however was a ſtronger incentive; for the miſer in Moliere was not more ſenſible of the charms of that part of a lover's addreſs ſans dot, than Mr. Allin; Mr. Elliſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not only his conſent, but his good wiſhes, and ſecretly all the influence of his authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:042696_0052_101C88A052F47678"/>Unfortunately the father's was not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will of conſequence in this caſe. The joy Mr. Elliſon felt on receiving the permiſſion he aſked was ſoon damped; for, on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining himſelf to Miſs Allin, ſhe burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears (having foreſeen from the manner in which ſhe was left alone with him, what was to be the ſubject of his converſation) and the more generouſly and nobly he expreſſed his affection, the faſter her tears flowed. Alarmed by the tendereſt fears, he begged to know the cauſe of her diſtreſs; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could aſſume ſufficient power over herſelf to comply, they heard Mr. Allin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them; Dreading his preſence, ſhe requeſted her lover to conceal her unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and, promiſing to lay her whole heart open to him the next time they met, ſhe made her eſcape by one door, as her father entered at another.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon was not much better able than his miſtreſs to ſupport an interview with the father; ſo that eluding his queſtions, in ſuch a manner as gave him no ſuſpicions of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:042696_0053_101C88BC5B831358"/>what had paſſed, he pretended buſineſs that obliged him to return home directly.</p>
            <p>He ſhut himſelf up in his room, in a ſtate of mind which the heart may gueſs, but words cannot deſcribe. He paſſed the night in an agitation and anxiety he had before no conception of; the hope which ſelf-flattery would ſometimes ſuggeſt, only ſerved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his exerting his reaſon to ſupport what his fears anticipated. He roſe before the ſun, with a reſolution to know his fate ere the day was over, but wiſhed to learn it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mr. Allin's knowledge.</p>
            <p>Unable to contrive any means of effecting this deſire, the reſtleſſneſs of his mind led him abroad; and the impulſe of his heart directed him towards Mr. Allin's houſe. He wandered in the adjacent fields a long time, uncertain what methods to purſue, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to create uneaſineſs to the woman for whom he ſuffered ſo much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:042696_0054_101C88A1D9F94AC0"/>At length Miſs Allin, who had not reſted much better than her lover, going to the window in hopes new objects might divert her thoughts, ſaw him in a field adjoining to the garden. The delicacy of her mind bore ſo great a reſemblance to his, that ſhe imagined the cauſe which brought him thither, and, deſirous to conclude the interview before her father roſe from his bed, ſhe haſtened to him with as much ſpeed as a perſon can uſe, who feels a very ſenſible affliction for the pain ſhe is going to give one, whom ſhe ſincerely eſteems.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw her approach, he had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage to meet her, dreading the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he had ſo impatiently longed for. Maiden baſhfulneſs, with ſome mixture of concern on one ſide, and extreme agitation of ſpirits on the other, rendered them equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable to ſpeak; but with common, though tacit conſent, they ſat down together on a green bank at the foot of a tree; a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enſued; and it is difficult to ſay when it would have ended, if Miſs Allin had not
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:042696_0055_101C87E595E20D00"/>ſooner recovered her ſpirits than her lover. She tempered the diſagreeable intelligence ſhe was going to impart with very ſincere expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of concern, at the neceſſity ſhe ſaw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under of giving him pain; profeſſed a due ſenſe of his merit, and lamented that, when they firſt met, her heart was not ſo free as his, ſince then, in all probability, they might have conſtituted each other's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, inſtead of mutually deſtroying each other's peace.</p>
            <p>She then told him that ſhe had, with her father's conſent, been engaged above a year to Dr. Tunſtall, a young phyſician in the neighbourhood; and their marriage had been ſo long deferred, only by the difficulties her father found, or that his parſimonious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per made him imagine, in raiſing 2000l. the ſum he had promiſed to give with her: That ſhe received the Doctor as her intended huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band at her father's command, when her heart was ſo little prejudiced in his favour, that ſhe could, without any ſevere pang, have been equally obedient, had be ordered her
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:042696_0056_101C88A618DF3000"/>never to ſee him any more; but, ſince ſhe had conſidered it as her duty and happineſs to increaſe the little prepoſſeſſion ſhe had conceived, the caſe was much altered, and ſhe was now as ſtrongly engaged to him in affection, as in honour; An engagement ſhe was determined not to violate, though ſhe deſpaired of ſeeing it fulfilled; for ſhe had received an expreſs command from her father never to entertain the leaſt acquaintance or correſpondence with Dr. Tunſtall, but to look on Mr. Elliſon as her huſband, and ſhe feared he would never revoke the decree; ſince, beſide the many reaſons, which ſhe was ſenſible there was for preferring him to the Doctor, his generoſity had added one, that with her father was inſurmountable, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the acceptance of a fortune.</p>
            <p>She proceeded to ſay, that ſhe had nothing to expect but her father's anger, which was impetuous and dreadful; all, therefore, ſhe had to aſk of Mr. Elliſon, who, ſhe hoped would rather think her unfortunate than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, was, that he would, as far as lay in
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:042696_0057_101C87E720513D38"/>his power, mitigate her father's rage, and prevail with him to let her live peaceably in her preſent condition; for ſhe relinquiſhed all hopes of changing it; and did it with the leſs concern, as ſhe imagined his partiality for her might render it more vexatious to him to ſee her married to another, than merely to be diſappointed of her himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is unneceſſary to deſcribe the effect Miſs Allin's words had upon Mr. Elliſon. She felt ſo lively a compaſſion for him, that ſhe forgot her own grief, and ſaid every thing ſhe thought might contribute to his conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except what alone could prove effectual; but, as ſhe was fully determined to adhere ſtrictly to her engagement, ſhe carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided giving him the leaſt room to hope a change in her ſentiments.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as his mind was a little compoſed, he took his leave; aſſuring her that he would try every means to ſecure her peace, though he was not yet ſufficiently maſter of his thoughts, to ſee the manner in which it
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:042696_0058_101C88A8DB4CBD30"/>would be moſt adviſeable for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Each returned to their reſpective houſes, but with different ſenſations; ſhe found her heart much lightened, ſince ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her generous lover with the ſtate of it; but he carried back deſpair inſtead of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>However, after ſome time ſpent in reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he grew reſigned and patient, and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his diſappointment, he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſirous to reſtore Miſs Allin to the happineſs, of which he had for a time depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her; and reſolved to perform his promiſe more effectually than ſhe could expect.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, three days after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his ſentence from her, he ſent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to Mr. Allin to dine with him; and took that opportunity of acquainting him, that, ſince he was laſt at his houſe, he had learnt that Miſs Allin had long been engaged, with his conſent, to Dr. Tunſtall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:042696_0059_101C87E8AB0584F0"/>had reſolved to deſiſt from his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as he ſhould think himſelf very crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if, taking the advantage of a ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fortune, he ſhould attempt to deprive another of a bleſſing which muſt be ſo dear to him; and indeed, he ſhould have ſo bad an opinion of a woman who could be merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and inconſtant enough to break her word, though in his favour, as would render it impoſſible for him to be happy with her.</p>
            <p>Mr. Allin was much diſconcerted at this declaration, and anſwered: He might do as he pleaſed; but that as for Dr. Tunſtall, if he intended to marry his daughter, he muſt wait till buſineſs increaſed, or death put her in poſſeſſion of his little eſtate, for he found it impoſſible to raiſe a fortune for her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtreſſing himſelf.</p>
            <p>From the account Mr. Elliſon had heard of his circumſtances, he eaſily believed there was ſome truth in what he ſaid; and told him he would remove that objection, only deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to confirm his former conſent with
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:042696_0060_101C88ABB43F4268"/>a good grace, and not diminiſh the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his daughter by an apparent reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or even the coldneſs of his compliance.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon was not ſlow in executing his purpoſe. He wrote Miſs Allin a letter the next morning, wherein he incloſed a draught on his banker for 2000l. His generoſity went ſtill farther; he feared her father would not acquit himſelf properly in regard to her cloaths; and conſidered that, as the income of the man ſhe married was very ſmall, to be well equipped might prove hereafter much to her convenience; he therefore ſent his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper to the next great town, to buy ſilks, lace, cambrick, muſlins, hollands, in ſuch abundance, as would not only enable her to make a very genteel appearance on her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but ſuffice for ſome years; and he choſe to do it in this manner, rather than to make her a preſent of the money, as the ſureſt means of ſecuring her convenience, to which, moderation and generoſity might have made her leſs attentive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:042696_0061_101C87EE4CF70010"/>The pleaſure he felt in this diſintereſted conduct, almoſt extinguiſhed for the time the ſenſe of ſorrow; but the heart will have its due; when the gratification began to deaden, vexation returned, and he could gladly have excuſed a viſit Dr. Tunſtall made him, in order to return thanks for his generoſity; which Mr. Elliſon learnt from him, was with great pain accepted by Miſs Allin; nor could any thing, but her father's expreſs and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command, have conquered her reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this particular. The ſight of a man, ſo much happier than himſelf, brought ſo painful a compariſon to Mr. Elliſon's mind, that the effect was viſible to the Doctor, who could not blame the ſenſation, though Mr. Elliſon could ſcarcely forgive it in himſelf; and was hurt to find, by this firſt inſtance, that he was capable of envy, a paſſion he had never felt before.</p>
            <p>His politeneſs, however, did not forſake him on ſo ſevere a trial; he commanded both his countenance and words ſo well, as to give his happy rival a kind, though melancholy
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:042696_0062_101C88AE7AF3ACC0"/>reception; and, determined to conquer the ſenſation he ſo much diſapproved, he expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an inclination to be ſometimes favoured with his viſits, though he muſt requeſt him to excuſe his returning them.</p>
            <p>While Mr. Elliſon flattered himſelf with the hopes of marrying Miſs Allin, he delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſettling his family in the order he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking it more adviſeable to regulate the whole at once; but, when that proſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed, there no longer ſubſiſted any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for poſtponing it.</p>
            <p>The knowledge he had of his ſon's impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous temper, and bad qualities, determined him to educate him at home. Whether he would there acquire an equal ſhare of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as at ſchool, he much queſtioned, but the rectifying his heart appeared to him the moſt eſſential article towards his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, of all knowledge that he moſt wiſhed him to acquire, was the knowledge of himſelf, and the means of governing his paſſions; in theſe points he thought he might
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:042696_0063_101C87F1220D6458"/>be better inſtructed under his own eye than at ſchool; and, if thereby he could render him an honeſt and amiable man, he ſhould have good reaſon to be contented, though he did not prove a learned one.</p>
            <p>He had already begun to make proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after a well qualified tutor; and was likely to ſucceed, as he had ſet no bounds to the ſalary. A gentleman of excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, great learning, and amiable manners, having met with ſome diſappointments in the profeſſion of phyſic, to which he was bred, was very glad of ſo eligible a retirement, on a promiſed ſalary of 400l. a year; and as Mr. Elliſon was ſo great a maſter in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of benevolence, that he performed few actions that did not bear more than one good fruit, he had in view the ſerving Mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham by the home education of his ſon, and therefore made it a condition, that the tutor ſhould teach as many boys as he pleaſed, with the ſame care as his own.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:042696_0064_101C88B142920908"/>The little Granthams ſpent few beſide their ſleeping hours at home; for, as their father's houſe almoſt joined to Mr. Elliſon's, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither without inconvenience every night, coming early the next morning; and having at Mr. Elliſon's both their corporal and mental food; the firſt of which was ſome eaſe to the narrow circumſtances of thoſe good people, and the latter gave their father the moſt ſincere joy, as he now ſaw them in a way of being educated equal to their birth, and future fortune, of which he had before utterly deſpaired. Indeed he found his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence much lightened; for Mr. Elliſon care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided them apparel, in every reſpect equal to that worn by his own ſon; and was very watchful that the latter aſſumed no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over them, to whom he ſhewed him he was in reality greatly inferior; but this was explained to him in the abſence of the Grantham's; for Mr. Elliſon wiſhed for their ſakes the thought might not occur to them; and exhorted their father and mother not to deſtroy one benefit ariſing from their preſent low eſtate, which might greatly add to the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:042696_0065_101C87F2A80C4220"/>happineſs of their lives, by inſtilling into their minds a pride that muſt be the ſource both of private chagrin, and public contempt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon was not ſo wholly engaged ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by private vexation, or domeſtic buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as not to extend his attention to all his neighbours. The little eſtate he had bought lay in three pariſhes, which gave him a knowledge of the ſtate of each.</p>
            <p>He found the poor tax ran very high, and yet the poor were but ill taken care of; the farmer was much burdened, the poor but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle relieved.</p>
            <p>All theſe inconveniencies he endeavoured to apply remedies to, which he did effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and, beſides relieving the wants of the poor, he promoted a ſpirit of induſtry among them.</p>
            <p>On other occurrences his benevolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſcarce knew any bounds; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all differences in his neighbourhood,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:042696_0066_101C88B405F74860"/>was the father of the orphan, a true friend to the diſtreſſed and helpleſs, a viſitor of the ſick and thoſe who were in priſon, and many a debtor, that had not been ſo out of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, he delivered from the unrelenting purſuits of his creditors.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſcenes were indeed the great feaſts of his ſoul; but all his hours yielded him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined pleaſures, becauſe they were all ſpent in the exerciſe of benevolence; a deſire to do good to others, was ſo intirely his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning principle, that, however engaged in buſineſs or pleaſure, he never loſt ſight of it, endeavouring to promote it by every action of his life.</p>
            <p>Though temperance and virtue are the beſt preſervatives of health, yet they cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to any one an uninterrupted ſtate. Mr. Elliſon, while employed in aſſiduous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to alleviate the ſufferings of others, became himſelf the object of compaſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:042696_0067_101C87F58894EE10"/>He was ſeized with a violent fever, which ſo far baffled the ſkill and care of Dr. Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, for whom he had ſent on being firſt taken ill, that in three days he was entirely delirious, and his life judged to be in great danger. The grief of his friends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants is eaſier to be imagined than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; but none felt more ſincerely on the occaſion than Mrs. Tunſtall, whoſe gratitude attached her very ſtrongly to him, though ſhe had never been in his company ſince the morning that determined him to give up all pretenſions to her.</p>
            <p>She always waited the Doctor's return with impatient anxiety, and was greatly affected by the account her huſband gave her, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond week of Mr. Elliſon's illneſs, of the accident which had happened to his houſe-keeper; who, by a fall down ſtairs, had put out her ankle, and muſt be totally confined to her chamber; whereby Mr. Elliſon was deprived of a very careful, tender, and ſenſible nurſe, which his ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rendered extremely neceſſary, and yet the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:042696_0068_101C88B58B756D08"/>Doctor ſaw no means of procuring him one; any of the ſervants, or people in the pariſh would have attended him with care and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but their ignorance diſqualified them for the truſt.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tunſtall was ſhocked to think of the danger he muſt run in ſuch hands, and, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that in his inſane ſtate of mind he would not know her, propoſed attending him herſelf, though it might prove very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in her preſent ſtate, ſhe being then in the eighth month of her pregnancy. The Doctor's tenderneſs for his amiable wife, made him very unwilling to conſent, but ſhe urged him with ſuch perſuaſive importunity, that he at length, though reluctantly, agreed to carry her to Mr. Elliſon's that very day.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to imagine that Mrs. Tunſtall muſt perform with the greateſt aſſiduity, an office ſhe undertook out of gratitude. The only reſt ſhe allowed herſelf was on a couch, in Mr. Elliſon's chamber; ſhe mixed all his medicines, and gave him every thing he took,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:042696_0069_101C87F9B282D4F8"/>but was careful not to approach his bed-ſide on his firſt waking, leſt ſleep might calm his delirium, and expoſe her to his knowledge.</p>
            <p>She was ſeldom out of his chamber, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept during one or two ſhort viſits ſhe daily made his houſe-keeper, for a whole week that he continued in the ſame melancholy ſtate; he then began to recover his ſenſes, but was ſo weak and ſpent, he took little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing that paſſed; ſhe therefore prolonged her attendance for ſome days, keeping out of his ſight, but directing the nurſe, and watching that all proper care was taken; and ſhe had the ſatisfaction, before Mr. Elliſon was well enough to diſcover there was any other perſon than his nurſe in the room, to ſee the houſe-keeper able to be brought in, and take the ſame care ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had done for ſome days; whereupon with great joy ſhe reſigned her office, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home.</p>
            <p>Every day confirmed her in this eaſy ſtate of mind; for his recovery, though ſlow was
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:042696_0070_101C88B998336388"/>uninterrupted; and the many hearts which his extreme danger had oppreſſed with grief and anxiety were relieved from their heavy burden; more ſenſible than ever of the value of the man on whom their happineſs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as all their ſenſibility had been awakened by his illneſs.</p>
            <p>Caution had been given to Sir. William and the houſe-keeper, not to diſcloſe Mrs. Tunſtall's attendance; but the appearance of ſo ſtrong an attachment, the hazard ſhe had run, and the uncommonneſs of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had made ſuch an impreſſion on Sir William, that the utmoſt his prudence could effect, was to be ſilent on the ſubject, till his couſin was pretty well recovered; and then news being brought them, as they were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, that Mrs. Tunſtall was brought to bed, he could not forbear obſerving, that ſhe had but juſt had time to recover her fatigue.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon uſually avoided entering into any converſation on a ſubject wherein he felt
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:042696_0071_101C87FC79AA5828"/>himſelf too tenderly intereſted, but his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility on the preſent occaſion put him off his guard; and he enquired to what fatigue Sir William alluded.</p>
            <p>The Baronet could no longer reſiſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he felt of acquainting his couſin with Mrs. Tunſtall's extraordinary care of him, to which, Mr. Elliſon liſtened with equal ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and pleaſure. Her conduct on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion had the effect ſhe feared from it, if it came to his knowledge, for it awakened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender ſenſation; but theſe were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the pain ſhe thought might attend them. He had brought himſelf to ſuch a patient acquieſcence in the decrees of Providence, that, while he cheriſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her with tenderneſs, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret for his diſappointment was calm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. He attributed her care to the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a noble mind, and felt ineffable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſo ſtrong a proof, that his eſteem was juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:042696_0072_101C5CE06D0B72C8"/>Mr. Elliſon, as the moſt likely means of perfecting his recovery, made ſome excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into different parts of the country, and it was for a conſiderable time before he again ſettled at home.</p>
            <p>At his return, he was ſhocked at the evils election-drunkenneſs had cauſed in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; and Dr. Tunſtall particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violent in politics, and having exerted himſelf much during the conteſt, acquired ſuch a habit of drinking, and entered into intimacies with ſo many people who made it their chief pleaſure, that the love of it did not ceaſe with the firſt inducement.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tunſtall's ſituation was hereupon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry melancholy. She daily beheld the man ſhe loved in the moſt diſguſtful condition; and, when not abſolutely intoxicated, the effects of the former night's debauch, ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified and diſordered him, that he was not capable of converſation, nor ſuſceptible of affection. Add to this, that the ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of their circumſtances, from ſuch a
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:042696_0073_101C87FF4F115878"/>perpetual round of rioting, made her dread the conſequences that muſt attend it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon's humanity was of ſo quick and lively a kind, that it did not wait to be informed of a perſon's particular ſufferings; from comparing their income with their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expences, he knew when they were under any difficulties in point of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and this induced him to prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mrs. Tunſtall's father to receive from him a proper ſupply for her uſe, as coming from himſelf.</p>
            <p>However, Dr. Tunſtall was not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and he at laſt fell a victim to his paſſion, being ſeized with a high fever, which, in a few days, put a period to his life.</p>
            <p>Had Mr. Elliſon obeyed the impulſe of his heart, he would have flown to the diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late widow, and endeavoured, by all the tender ſenſibilities that can ſpring from friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to have ſoothed her grief; but he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a conduct might appear ſcarcely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:042696_0074_101C88BF2AAB4760"/>in one, whoſe ſentiments were ſo well known; and, while he acted only as a friend, her reputation might be wounded, by being ſuppoſed ſo ſoon to receive the aſſiduities of a lover, and her delicacy offended by any marks of regard, which might bear the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſo early a renewal of his former addreſſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations made him forbear viſiting her for the preſent; and, when he thought he might viſit her with decency, the preference he often gave his duties to the pleaſures ariſing from her ſociety, made her fancy his having no views beyond the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her friendſhip, till the expiration of the firſt year of her widowhood, during which he had condemned himſelf to abſolute ſilence, concerning the ſituation of his heart; but, having given ſo much time to worldly form, he was determined no longer to delay what was due to himſelf, after having fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, that decorum could poſſibly expect; he, therefore declared frankly to her, how little alteration time had made in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:042696_0075_101C8800E024F548"/>and intreated ſhe would give him leave to hope, that ſhe would liſten to his addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with more complacency than when he firſt made them.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tunſtall was ſomewhat ſurpriſed at Mr. Elliſon's conſtancy, and not a little puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled in what manner to anſwer him; but, as he inſiſted on a reply, ſhe ſtammered out ſome expreſſions of the honour he did her, the greatneſs of the advantages he thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her, and her high ſenſe of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe lay under, which muſt incline her to wiſh to comply with any requeſt of his.</p>
            <p>This ſort of cold reception was ill ſuited to the ardor of Mr. Elliſon's paſſion; he therefore begged that politeneſs, gratitude, and, above all, intereſt, might be out of the queſtion; for, though amiable virtues, yet his heart was too delicate, or too capricious, to be contented with receiving them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for his warmeſt affections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:042696_0076_101C88C1EFB21928"/>Mrs. Tunſtall's ſituation was rendered the more perplexing, by being really ignorant of the ſtate of her own heart. She had only conſidered him as a moſt amiable and worthy friend, and knew not whether ſhe could with pleaſure conſent to be united to him by a tenderer tie; however, ſhe could ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe all his delicacy required, not to marry him except he became the free diſintereſted choice of her heart. Mr. Elliſon had no ſooner received this aſſurance, than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented his requeſt; but his, apprehenſions were groundleſs.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tunſtall was not quite ſo indifferent as ſhe imagined; love ſeldom riſes to a blaze, till it is fanned with hope; and in a few other viſits ſhe declared to him that ſhe could no longer reſiſt any inclination of his; on the contrary, found her affection for him grow ſo intire, that ſhe wiſhed to have it made her duty to love him with a warm and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:042696_0077_101C8804EE6355F0"/>Every circumſtance now ſeemed to concur to make Mr. Elliſon completely happy, when, three days before that fixed on for his nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, he received a letter from Mrs. Blackburn, informing him, that her huſband was in the hands of the ſheriff's officers, and, if he did not take compaſſion upon him, he muſt be immediately removed to priſon, as they were not able to diſcharge the debt, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor refuſed to take Mr. Blackburn's bond, knowing his whole fortune was mortgaged.</p>
            <p>Fewer intreaties would have ſufficed to bring Mr. Elliſon to their relief. He ſet out in all haſte on horſeback, but had not gone three miles, when his horſe threw him. He was at firſt intirely ſtunned by the fall; but pain in a ſhort time brought him to himſelf, and convinced him that his thigh was broke. His ſervant ſent off a meſſenger to a ſurgeon to meet him at his own houſe, and with great difficulty got him home.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tunſtall was ſhocked to the greateſt degree at this melancholy news, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:042696_0078_101C88C4C15199C8"/>determined that the want of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ceremony ſhould not prevent her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on him, during his confinement. She had once acted this part from gratitude; and truſted ſhe might now, without cenſure, be allowed to perform it through affection. Her tender attentions greatly alleviated Mr. Elliſon's pains, but could not effect his cure; the third day after the fracture, a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began, which gave the ſurgeons the moſt alarming apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Melancholy as his ſituation was, no dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared in his countenance, and, as ſoon as he apprehended his life was in dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he conſidered of the beſt methods of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting others from ſuffering by his death. He charged on his fortune the ſupport of all the charities and benevolences he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. He diſcharged Mr. Blackburn's debt, and bequeathed ten thouſand pounds to Mrs. Tunſtall; and, as his ſon's fortune could not fail of being great, ſince Sir William's eſtate would come to him, he charged it with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities for all his dependants; he had not a
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:042696_0079_101C8807C31BC2D8"/>ſervant to whom he did not leave ſome token of his bounty, and, not confining his thoughts to England, obliged his ſon to leave his Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica eſtate in the hands of his ſteward, as long as he ſhould live, providing for all the Negroes that ſhould remain on the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the time of his ſteward's death.</p>
            <p>His hardeſt trial was yet to come, the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave of his ſon and intended ſpouſe. For the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He recapitulated the ſubſtance of all the inſtructions he had for ſo many years been inculcating, and beſeeched him with tears, and the tendereſt careſſes, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print them deeply on his heart.</p>
            <p>But his ſevereſt taſk was taking leave of Mrs. Tunſtall, who approached his bed more dead than alive. He bade her not grieve for him, ſince he truſted he was going to the only place where he could find a happineſs
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:042696_0080_101C88C66CC9AAF0"/>ſuperior to what he ſhould have enjoyed in her ſociety. Mrs. Tunſtall had no power to anſwer but with tears, which flowed plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully over the hand ſhe preſſed between hers, while kneeling by his bed ſide.</p>
            <p>At night, when the ſurgeons examined his leg, they found the mortification, to their ſurpriſe, had not advanced. The next day the ſymptoms appeared ſtill a little more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, and in a few days, beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he was declared out of danger; and he now found that the life he could ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly have parted with, was ſtill extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dear to him. But, had it indeed loſt its charms, it muſt have obtained new ones from the joy that was diffuſed over the whole neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tunſtall was ever rejoicing over his reſtored life, or on her knees giving thanks for ſo great a bleſſing, till Mr. Elliſon was ſufficiently recovered to confirm at church the union of their hearts, which love had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore completed; an union which every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:042696_0081_101C889241549768"/>day rendered more delightful, as a fuller knowledge of each other's virtues, by increaſing their eſteem and rational affection, more than compenſated for ſome abatement of paſſion, which muſt unavoidably be the conſequence of poſſeſſion, and that certainty of each other's affections, which baniſhes all the fears and anxieties that fan the fire of love, and increaſe the paſſion by viciſſitude, mingling pains with its pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliſon had now no wiſh ungratified. Mrs. Elliſon returned his affection in the tendereſt manner, and completed his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by entering into all his views, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in every work of humanity, wherein her heart was as deeply engaged as his.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time after Mr. Elliſon's marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Sir William died, and left him heir to his eſtate and title.</p>
            <p>His children, as they grew up, were all honourably married, and well ſettled in the world; and, among the reſt, the eldeſt of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:042696_0082_101C88CBB7569488"/>his daughters was married to the eldeſt of the Grantham's ſons, the old gentleman having for ſome time paſt, enjoyed the title of Duke, with the eſtate, on the deceaſe of his relation.</p>
            <p>Thus lived Mr. Elliſon, enjoying in ſweet and contented retirement, the higheſt bliſs and ſelf-ſatisfaction that human nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and which can only be obtained by a truly well ſpent and virtuous life: Deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a pious and humane ſenſibility, that happy and conſtant ſerenity of conſcience, that is only the attendant on good actions. Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, he was early led to indefatigable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and a ſteady and prudent attention to buſineſs. This he knew was not only the ſureſt and moſt rational way to proſper in life—but alſo the moſt pleaſing and ſelf-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory—that it was not only the way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he could expect to place himſelf above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency—but that it was likewiſe the only means which could enable him to gratify the utmoſt wiſh of his heart—the being able to relieve his fellow creatures.</p>

               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:042696_0083_101C8893C7EF5388"/>His induſtry, as it was guided by a a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous prudence, and a conſtant and ſteady adherence to the dictates of conſcience and humanity, could not fail of the greateſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;—but although it raiſed him to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affluence, it did not raiſe him above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—he ſtill retained the ſentiments he at firſt ſet out with, bleſſing and crowning with the moſt delightful happineſs, all around him— He ſought not the favours of the great, or the reſpect of the affluent—but the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own conſcience.—He delighted not in the buſtle of courts or of the world—but, while he thought it his duty, he gave himſelf to buſineſs, and purſued it with unwearied attention; and, being favoured by Heaven to the utmoſt of his wiſhes, he choſe a retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt ſuitable to his inclination; where, ſequeſtered from the noiſe and buſtle of life, he could gratify, unmoleſted, the pureſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of his ſoul, and enjoy himſelf in peace and ſatisfaction—where, envied by none— but adored by all—he might be a father to the fatherleſs—and a protector to the widow —a comforter to the afflicted—and a friend to the whole human race.</p>
