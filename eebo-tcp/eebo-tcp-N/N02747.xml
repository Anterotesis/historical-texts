            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THE following Letter was wrote and publiſh'd more than eight Years agoe, when the Town was in great Diſtreſs by the ſpreading of the Small Pox, which had not viſited it for nineteen Years before; and when the new Method of receiving the Diſtemper by Inoculation firſt began to be put in Practice among us. It ſoon appear'd that the Hazard of Inoculation was much leſs than of common Infection, yet it met with much Oppoſition. Not a few of thoſe who expected to undergo the Diſtemper, had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Scruples</hi> in their Minds againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it in this Way; and ſuch would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ask my Tho'ts about the Lawfulneſs of it, with all the Signs of conſcientious Doubters. It was certainly my Duty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them according to the beſt Light I had, leaving them then to judge for themſelves. And having often done this in a private Way, to ſave Time and Trouble to my ſelf and others, I publiſhed the following Reply to all or moſt of the Objections I then met with. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make the Anſwers ſhort and plain, and ſo to fit them for common Uſe. The
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003270_0004_0FF02F9F91C554E8"/>Reoder will eaſily perceive that ſome of the Objections relate to the peculiar Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Boſton</hi> at that Time; and he may, perhaps, think many of them weak and trifling; yet they were ſuch as were commonly offer'd, and in ſuch Caſes the weakeſt muſt be conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to.</p>
            <p>And now that the Diſtemper has again viſited the Town, and <hi>Inoculation</hi> is ſtill in ſome meaſure the Subject of Diſpute, I have been applied to for my Conſent to another Impreſſion. I know of no Reaſon to be againſt it, my Tho'ts continuing ſtill the ſame, and my Opinion in favour of the Practice being more confirmed; And I think I have ſaid nothing that can offend any, but ſuch as will aſſume to themſelves the Government of others Conſciences, or will be diſpleas'd with any thing that does not agree with their eſpouſed Sentiments.</p>
            <p>By the beſt Information I can get, the learned and pious, both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> do more and more give into the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>here</hi> and in <hi>England.</hi> Soon after the following Letter was printed here in <hi>Boſton,</hi> it was reprinted in <hi>London,</hi> together with the Reverend Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Account of the Method and Succeſs of this Practice; to which was prefix'd an hiſtorical Introduction by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Neal.</hi> I have the Satisfaction
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003270_0005_0FF02FA241BD7AF8"/>to ſee that <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſay of the Anſwers, that He thinks they are <hi>clear and ſolid; but whether they are ſufficient to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage conſcientious and tender Parents, to provide for the ſafety of their Children in this Way, muſt be left</hi> (He ſays) <hi>to the Judgment of every Reader.</hi> This indeed is a Caſe I have not directly anſwered; nor did I think there was much Occaſion for it. It has always been allow'd that Parents have a Power to act for their Children, in Things wherein their Lives, as well as other Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, are concern'd, till they are capable to judge and act for themſelves. And I believe few Parents who are clear in it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will neglect it for their Children.</p>
            <p>I would take this Opportunity, now that the Practice is leſs formidable than it was, and conſiderable Numbers are like to go into it, to caution Perſons againſt acting raſhly and precipitantly in ſo tender and important an Affair. I would adviſe none to go into it without a due regard to their Conſtitution, and ſuch a Preparation of their Bodies as the Phyſician whom they conſult may adviſe to. Much leſs ſhould any dare to venture upon it till they have ſeriouſly endeavour'd by the Help of divine Grace, to get the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of their Souls well ſecur'd; and till they have ſuch a Satisfaction in their own Minds, as that they can in this way as well as the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003270_0006_0FF02F8D16F0AA58"/>other, reſign themſelves and theirs, to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Diſpoſal of Heaven. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and unqueſtionable Advantage on the ſide of Inoculation, <hi>You may miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under it</hi>; and I can't but expect ſome wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE new Method of receiving the Small Pox by <hi>Inciſion</hi> (or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation</hi> as 'tis commonly call'd) has been, you know, the Subject not only of plentiful Diſcourſe, but of angry Debate, and fierce Contention among us in this Town. And it is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumſtance attending us here, that almoſt every thing that is now done or doing among us, if it be at all of a publick Nature, creates Heats and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. I am in hopes our good People will by and by be ſenſible of the Folly and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003270_0008_0FF02FA6D353C4E8"/>Miſchief of this, and come to ſuch a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as will ſuffer them to <hi>differ</hi> from one another, without being <hi>angry</hi> with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. In the mean Time, I hope that the People in other Towns where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper has made its Entrance, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a better Temper, if any among them ſhould put this Method into Practice.</p>
            <p>However ſome among us may appear againſt it out of Party and Prejudice, yet there are many who are <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly</hi> averſe to it, I believe; and, if theſe preſerve the <hi>Meekneſs of Wiſdom,</hi> they are (as a <hi>very Reverend Perſon</hi> has lately ſaid of them) greatly to be commended and honoured, in that they will not act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a doubting Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I perceive that the Scruples and Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions commonly offer'd by People here, have ſuch a Force upon your Mind, as keeps you from going into this Method, which may, by the Bleſſing of Heaven, be your Safety and Preſervation. Now <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> (the Offices of which ſhould be ſacredly regarded by us) obliges me to attempt to relieve and help you, in a Matter wherein your <hi>Life,</hi> ſo precious in it ſelf, and deſervedly dear to me, is ſo much concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003270_0009_0FF02FAAD309D338"/>For Satisfaction about the Method and Succeſs of this Practice, I refer you to the <hi>Obſervations</hi> on it made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been my ſelf a Witneſs to moſt of the Inſtances he mentions.</p>
            <p>But that which you want Satisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout is, the <hi>Scruples</hi> and Objections of a <hi>conſcientious</hi> or religious Nature, which are commonly offer'd by People againſt this Method. Theſe I ſhall endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and reſolve, as I am able, in a few Words; and if they afford you any Light or Satisfaction reſpecting the ſame, you may communicate them to whom you pleaſe; and if it ſhould be thought worth while to make them publick, I think none can cenſure me for ſtarting out of my Line, or medling with what is none of my Buſineſs, ſince the Thing I am now upon relates to <hi>Religion and Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. One great Thing urg'd againſt this Practice is, <hi>That it is not lawful for me to make my ſelf ſick when I am well. Or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to bring a Diſtemper upon my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To bring Sickneſs upon one's ſelf for its own ſake, is what no Man in his right Wits would do. But to make my ſelf ſick in <hi>ſuch a Way,</hi> as may prabably ſerve my Health, and ſave my Life, and with
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003270_0010_0FF02FAE85505A00"/>ſuch a <hi>Deſign,</hi> is certainly fitting and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and therefore lawful. This is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day practis'd among People without any Scruple, in Purges and Vomits, and other Things in medical Uſe. Now, if I may lawfully make my ſelf ſick by taking ſomething in at my Mouth, why not by putting ſomething in at my <hi>Arm</hi>? Or, if I may lawfully make my ſelf ſick for <hi>one Day,</hi> why not for <hi>two Days,</hi> or more, as the Caſe may require? Aye, but this is to bring a <hi>Diſtemper</hi> upon my ſelf. I think it can <hi>hardly be call'd</hi> bringing it upon my ſelf, when the Caſe is ſo with me, (not having had the Diſtemper, and living in an infected Air) that I can't but expect to undergo it in a very little time. I know indeed God can preſerve me from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but when my Neighbours all round me are viſited, I know of no <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> that any particular Perſon has to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an <hi>extraordinary Preſervation.</hi> He that has no Reaſon to think, but that he is as liable to the <hi>Small Pox</hi> as other People are, and yet keeps in the Way of it, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that God will preſerve him untouch'd,</hi> however ſome may give it the Name of Truſt, and Faith, and the like, I cannot but look upon it and call it <hi>Preſumption.</hi> In ſhort, I can't but think, when I am in ſuch Circumſtances, that I can neither <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> not <hi>warrantably</hi> expect to eſcape

The <hi>Air</hi> I breath in is full of theſe Sparks; and I may expect <hi>every Breath I fetch</hi> to draw ſome of them in: If now it appears upon daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that by making an Inciſion in my <hi>Arm,</hi> and letting the Spark in that Way, the Fuel will burn with leſs Fierceneſs, and conſequently Danger, why may'nt I take it in that Way? Why muſt I needs ſtay till it comes in at my <hi>Mouth</hi> or <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> or thro' ſome of the <hi>porous Parts</hi> of my Body? For my Part, I think the Law of <hi>Self-Preſervation,</hi> which is God's <hi>Law,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires me to take this Method of Safety, whereby (to uſe the apt Words of another) the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is, thro' God's common Bleſſing, happily converted into a <hi>Remedy.</hi>

And for my own part, as much as I am now for Inoculation, I am not at all ſhy to ſay, that a Perſon may miſcarry under it: For <hi>God is Sovereign,</hi> and will keep us in a Dependence upon him, in the Uſe of all Means. But if it appear from Matter of Fact, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence truly repreſented, that the Hazard in this Way is far leſs than that of accidental Contagion, this I conceive is ſufficient to legitimate the Practice, and juſtify any one's going into it, when there is Occaſion.</p>

No: But he is <hi>a Murderer from the Beginning.</hi> Every Age of the World produces ſome <hi>new</hi> and uſeful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, in one Profeſſion, Art and Science or another: And if this Diſcovery be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for our Day, why ſhould it not be accepted <hi>in all Places with all Thankfulneſs</hi>? In a Word, I cannot but think its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal derived elſewhere, becauſe my <hi>Bible</hi> teaches me, that <hi>every good and perfect Gift comes down from the Father of Lights.</hi>

            <p>As to that Objection, of <hi>the Danger of others catching the Diſtemper from the Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,</hi> there needs only this to be ſaid; That as tis to be ſuppoſ'd, the Practice will not be gone into till the Danger of Infection becomes common in a Place, ſo there may be Methods eaſily taken, to prevent its hazarding of others that can't yet come into it. And I think there ought to be a prudent Care in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have freely given you my Thoughts about this Practice, ſo <hi>much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt.</hi> I muſt now leave you to judge for your ſelf, praying God to <hi>ſhew</hi> you <hi>his Way.</hi> If you come into the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I know you will not do it in <hi>carnal Security</hi>; for that may provoke God to deny the Bleſſing.
