            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT Tidings from the Grave! Why haſt thou left the peaceful Manſions of the Tomb, to viſit again this troubled Earth! Art thou the welcome Meſſenger of Peace! Art thou riſen again to exhibit thy glorious Wounds, and thro' them proclaim Salvation to thy Country! Or art thou come to demand that laſt Debt of Humanity, to which your Rank and Merit have ſo juſtly entitled you—but which has been ſo long ungenerouſly withheld! And art thou angry at the barbarous uſage? Be appeaſed, ſweet Ghoſt! For tho' thy Body has long laid undiſtinguiſhed among the vulgar Dead, ſcarce prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014892_0005_0F973FABABEF7F60"/>
with Earth enough to hide it from the Birds of Prey; tho' not a kindred Tear was dropt, tho' not a friendly Sigh was uttered, o'er thy Grave; and tho' the Execrations of an impious Foe, were all thy Funeral Knells; yet matchleſs Patriot! thy Memory has been embalmed in the Affections of thy grateful Countrymen; who in their Breaſt have raiſed eternal Monuments to thy Bravery!</p>
            <p>BUT let us leave the beloved Remains, and contemplate for a Moment, thoſe Virtues of the Man, the Exerciſe of which have ſo deſervedly endeared him to the honeſt among the Great, and the Good among the humble.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>private</hi> Walks of Life, he was a Pattern for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—The Tears of her, to whom the World's indebted for ſo much Virtue, are ſilent Heralds of his <hi>filial Piety</hi>: While his tender Offspring, in liſping out their Father's Care, proclaim his <hi>parential Affection:</hi> And an ADAMS can witneſs with how much Zeal he loved, where he had formed the ſacred Connection of a <hi>Friend;</hi>— their kindred Souls were ſo cloſely twined, that both felt one Joy, both one Affliction. In Converſation he had the happy Talent of addreſſing his Subject both to the Underſtanding and the Paſſions; from the one he forced Conviction, from the other he ſtole Aſſent.</p>
            <p>HE was bleſſed with a Complacency of Diſpoſition, and Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of Temper, which peculiarly endeared him to his Friends;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014892_0006_0F973FAD09294E70"/>
and which, added to the Deportment of the Gentleman, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reverence and Eſteem even from his Enemies.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the tender Senſibility of his Soul, that he need but ſee Diſtreſs to feel it, and contribute to its Relief.—He was deaf to the Calls of Intereſt even in the Courſe of his Profeſſion; and wherever he beheld an indigent Object, which claimed his healing Skill, he adminiſtred it, without even the Hope of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than that which reſulted from the Reflection of having ſo far promoted the Happineſs of his Fellow Men.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>ſocial</hi> Departments of Life, practiſing upon the Strength of that Doctrine, he uſed ſo earneſtly to inculcate himſelf, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much conduced to enlighten Mankind, and advance the great End of Society at large, as the frequent Interchange of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, in friendly Meetings; we find him conſtantly engaged in this eligible Labour; but on none did he place ſo high a Value, as on that <hi>moſt honorable</hi> of all detached Societies, THE FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS: Into this Fraternity he was early initiated; and after having given repeated Proofs of a rapid Proficiency in the Arts, and after evidencing by his Life, the Profeſſions of his Lips— finally, as the Reward of his Merit, he was commiſſioned <hi>the moſt worſhipful</hi> GRAND MASTER of all the ancient Maſons, thro' <hi>North-America.</hi>—And you, Brethren, are living Teſtimonies, with how much Honor to himſelf, and Benefit to the Craft univerſal, he diſcharged the Duties of his elevated Truſt; with what ſweetned
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014892_0007_0F973FAD4CC9E148"/>
Accents he courted your Attention, while with <hi>Wiſdom, Strength and Beauty,</hi> he inſtructed his Lodges in the ſecret Arts of <hi>Free-maſonry;</hi> what perfect Order and Decorum he preſerved in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them; and in all his Conduct, what a bright Example he ſet us, <hi>to live within Compaſs, and act upon the Square.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH what Pleaſure did he ſilence the Wants of poor and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyleſs Brethren; yea the Neceſſitous every where, tho' ignorant of the Myſteries of the Craft, from his Benefactions, felt the happy Effects of that Inſtitution which is founded on <hi>Faith, Hope and Charity.</hi> And the World may ceaſe to wonder, that he ſo readily offered up his Life, on the Altar of his Country, when they are told, that the main Pillar of <hi>Maſonry,</hi> is the LOVE OF MANKIND.</p>
            <p>THE Fates, as tho' they would reveal, in the Perſon of our GRAND MASTER, thoſe Myſteries, which have ſo long lain hid from the World, have ſuffered him, like the great Maſter-builder in the Temple of old, to fall by the Hands of Ruffians, and be again raiſed in Honor and Authority: We ſearched in the Field for the murdered Son of a Widow, and we found him, <hi>by the Turf and the Twig,</hi> buried on the Brow of a Hill, tho' not in a decent Grave.—And tho' we muſt again commit his Body to the Tomb, yet our Breaſts ſhall be the Burying Spot of his <hi>Maſonic Virtues,</hi> and there—</p>
            <l>"An adamantine Monument we'll rear,"</l>
            <l>"With this Inſcription," <hi>Maſonry</hi> "lies here."—</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:014892_0008_0F973FAE0707A308"/>IN <hi>public</hi> Life, the ſole Object of his Ambition was to acquire the Conſcience of virtuous Enterprizes; <hi>Amor Patriae</hi> was the Spring of his Actions, and <hi>Mens Conſcia Recti</hi> was his Guide.— And on this Security he was, on every Occaſion, ready to ſacrifice his Health, his Intereſt and his Eaſe, to the ſacred Calls of his Country. When the Liberties of America were attacked, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared an early Champion in the Conteſt; and tho' his Knowledge and Abilities would have inſured Riches and Preferment (could he have ſtoop'd to Proſtitution) yet he nobly withſtood the faſcinating Charm, toſſed Fortune back her Plume, and perſued the inflexible Purpoſe of his Soul, in guiltleſs Competence.</p>
            <p>HE ſought not the airy Honors of a Name, elſe, many of thoſe Publications, which in the early Period of our Controverſy ſerved to open the Minds of the People, had not appeared anonymous. In every time of eminent Danger, his Fellow-Citizens flew to him for Advice; like the Orator of Athens, he gave it, and diſpell'd their Fears:—Twice did they call him to the Roſtrum, to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the Maſſacre of their Brethren; and from that Inſtance, in perſuaſive Language he taught them, not only the dangerous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, but the actual Miſchief, of ſtationing a Military Force, in a free City, in a Time of Peace.—They learnt the profitable Leſſon, and pen'd it among their Grievances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014892_0009_0F973FAEA59F64B8"/>BUT his Abilities were too great, his Deliberations too much wanted, to be confined to the Limits of a ſingle City, and at a Time when our Liberties were moſt critically in Danger from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Machinations and open Aſſaults of our Enemies, this Town, to their laſting Honor, elected him to take a Part in the Councils of the State.—And with what Faithfulneſs he diſcharged the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Delegation, the Neglect of his private Concerns, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Attendance on that Betruſtment, will ſufficiently teſtify: and the Records of that virtuous Aſſembly will remain the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of his Accompliſhments as a Stateſman, and his Integrity and Services as a Patriot, thro' all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The Congreſs of our Colony could not obſerve ſo much Virtue and Greatneſs without honoring it with the higheſt Mark of their Favour; and by the free Suffrages of that uncorrupted Body of Freemen, he was ſoon called to preſide in the Senate.—Where by his daily Councils and Exertions, he was conſtantly promoting the great Cauſe of <hi>General Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when he found the Tools of Oppreſſion were obſtinately bent on Violence; when he found the Vengeance of the Britiſh Court muſt he glutted with Blood; he determined, that what he could not effect by his Eloquence or his Pen, he would bring to Purpoſe by his Sword. And on the memorable 19th of April, he appeared in the Field, under the united Characters of the General, the Soldier and the Phyſician.—Here he was ſeen animating his

Countrymen to Battle, and fighting by their Side, and there he was found adminiſtering healing Comforts to the wounded. And when he had repelled the unprovoked Aſſaults of the Enemy, and had driven them back into their Strong-holds, like the virtuous Chief of Rome, he returned to the Senate, and preſided again at the Councils of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>WHEN the vanquiſhed Foe had rallied their diſordered Army, and by the Acquiſition of freſh Strength, again preſumed to fight againſt Freemen; our Patriot, ever anxious to be, where he could do the moſt good, again put off the Senator, and in Contempt of Danger flew to the Field of Battle, where, after a ſtern, and <hi>almoſt</hi> victorious Reſiſtance, ah! too ſoon for his Country! he ſealed his Principles with his Blood—then—</p>
            <l>"Freedom wept, that <hi>MERIT</hi> could not ſave,"</l>
            <l>But <hi>WARREN's</hi> Manes "muſt enrich the Grave."</l>
            <p>Enriched indeed! And the Heights of <hi>Charleſtown</hi> ſhall be more memorable for thy Fall, than the <hi>Plains of Abraham</hi> are for that of the Hero of <hi>Britain.</hi> For while <hi>he</hi> died contending for a ſingle Country, <hi>You</hi> fell in the Cauſe of Virtue and Mankind.</p>
            <p>THE Greatneſs of his Soul ſhone even in the Moment of Death; for if Fame ſpeaks true, in his laſt Agonies he met the Inſults of his barbarous Foe, with his wonted Magnanimity, and with the true Spirit of a Soldier, frowned at their Impotence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:014892_0011_0F973FB025F32620"/>IN Fine, to compleat the great Character—like HARRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON he wrote, like CICERO he ſpoke, like HAMPDEN he lived, and like WOLFE he died.</p>
            <p>AND can we, my Countrymen, with Indifference behold ſo much Worth and Valour laid proſtrate by the Hand of <hi>Britiſh Tyranny!</hi> And can we ever graſp that Hand in Affection again? —Are we not yet convinced "that he who hunts the Woods for Prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is leſs a Savage than the <hi>King of Britain"!</hi> Have we not Proofs, wrote in Blood, that the corrupted Nation, from whence we ſprang (tho' there may be ſome Traces of their ancient Virtue left) are ſtubbornly fixed on our Deſtruction! And ſhall we ſtill court a <hi>Dependance</hi> on ſuch a State? Still contend for a Connection with thoſe, who have forfeited not only every kindred Claim, but even their Title to Humanity! Forbid it the Spirit of the brave MONTGOMORY! Forbid it the Spirit of immortal WARREN! Forbid it the Spirits of all our valiant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen! Who fought, bled and died for far different Purpoſes; and who would have thought the Purchaſe <hi>dear indeed!</hi> to have paid their Lives for the paltry Boon, of diſplacing one Set of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains in Power, to make Way for another. No. They contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Eſtabliſhment of Peace, Liberty and Safety to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and we are unworthy to be called their Countrymen, if we ſtop at any Acpuiſition ſhort of this.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014892_0012_0F973FB114761538"/>Now is the happy Seaſon, to ſeize again thoſe Rights, which as Men we are by Nature entitled to, and which by Contract we never have and never could have ſurrendered:—But which have been repeatedly and violently attacked by the <hi>King, Lords and Commons of Britain.</hi> Ought we not then to diſclaim forever the forfeited Affinity; and by a timely Amputation of that rotten Limb of the Empire, prevent the Mortification of the whole?

            <l>'Tis where the Chains that cruſh you into Duſt,</l>
            <l>Are forg'd by Hands, from which you hop'd for Freedom.</l>
            <p>Yes, we ought and will—We will aſſert the Blood of our mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Hero againſt thy hoſtile Oppreſſions, O ſhameleſs Britain! and when "thy Cloud-cap'd Towers, thy gorgeous Palaces" ſhall by the Teeth of Pride and Folly be levell'd with the Duſt—and when thy Glory ſhall have faded like the Weſtern Sunbeam—the <hi>Name and the Virtues of</hi> WARREN ſhall remain immortal.</p>
