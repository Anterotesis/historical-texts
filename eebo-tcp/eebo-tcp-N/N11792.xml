            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Art thou ri≈øen again to exhibit thy glorious Wounds, and thro' them proclaim Salvation to thy Country!

And art thou angry at the barbarous u≈øage? Be appea≈øed, ≈øweet Gho≈øt! For tho' thy Body has long laid undi≈øtingui≈øhed among the vulgar Dead, ≈øcarce prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged

with Earth enough to hide it from the Birds of Prey; tho' not a kindred Tear was dropt, tho' not a friendly Sigh was uttered, o'er thy Grave; and tho' the Execrations of an impious Foe, were all thy Funeral Knells; yet matchle≈øs Patriot! thy Memory has been embalmed in the Affections of thy grateful Countrymen; who in their Brea≈øt have rai≈øed eternal Monuments to thy Bravery!</p>
            <p>BUT let us leave the beloved Remains, and contemplate for a Moment, tho≈øe Virtues of the Man, the Exerci≈øe of which have ≈øo de≈øervedly endeared him to the hone≈øt among the Great, and the Good among the humble.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>private</hi> Walks of Life, he was a Pattern for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.‚ÄîThe Tears of her, to whom the World's indebted for ≈øo much Virtue, are ≈øilent Heralds of his <hi>filial Piety</hi>: While his tender Offspring, in li≈øping out their Father's Care, proclaim his <hi>parential Affection:</hi> And an ADAMS can witne≈øs with how much Zeal he loved, where he had formed the ≈øacred Connection of a <hi>Friend;</hi>‚Äî their kindred Souls were ≈øo clo≈øely twined, that both felt one Joy, both one Affliction. In Conver≈øation he had the happy Talent of addre≈ø≈øing his Subject both to the Under≈øtanding and the Pa≈ø≈øions; from the one he forced Conviction, from the other he ≈øtole A≈ø≈øent.</p>
            <p>HE was ble≈ø≈øed with a Complacency of Di≈øpo≈øition, and Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of Temper, which peculiarly endeared him to his Friends;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014892_0006_0F973FAD09294E70"/>
and which, added to the Deportment of the Gentleman, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reverence and E≈øteem even from his Enemies.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the tender Sen≈øibility of his Soul, that he need but ≈øee Di≈øtre≈øs to feel it, and contribute to its Relief.‚ÄîHe was deaf to the Calls of Intere≈øt even in the Cour≈øe of his Profe≈ø≈øion; and wherever he beheld an indigent Object, which claimed his healing Skill, he admini≈øtred it, without even the Hope of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than that which re≈øulted from the Reflection of having ≈øo far promoted the Happine≈øs of his Fellow Men.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>≈øocial</hi> Departments of Life, practi≈øing upon the Strength of that Doctrine, he u≈øed ≈øo earne≈øtly to inculcate him≈øelf, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ≈øo much conduced to enlighten Mankind, and advance the great End of Society at large, as the frequent Interchange of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, in friendly Meetings; we find him con≈øtantly engaged in this eligible Labour; but on none did he place ≈øo high a Value, as on that <hi>mo≈øt honorable</hi> of all detached Societies, THE FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS: Into this Fraternity he was early initiated; and after having given repeated Proofs of a rapid Proficiency in the Arts, and after evidencing by his Life, the Profe≈ø≈øions of his Lips‚Äî finally, as the Reward of his Merit, he was commi≈ø≈øioned <hi>the mo≈øt wor≈øhipful</hi> GRAND MASTER of all the ancient Ma≈øons, thro' <hi>North-America.</hi>‚ÄîAnd you, Brethren, are living Te≈øtimonies, with how much Honor to him≈øelf, and Benefit to the Craft univer≈øal, he di≈øcharged the Duties of his elevated Tru≈øt; with what ≈øweetned

            </p>
            <p>WITH what Plea≈øure did he ≈øilence the Wants of poor and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyle≈øs Brethren; yea the Nece≈ø≈øitous every where, tho' ignorant of the My≈øteries of the Craft, from his Benefactions, felt the happy Effects of that In≈øtitution which is founded on <hi>Faith, Hope and Charity.</hi> And the World may cea≈øe to wonder, that he ≈øo readily offered up his Life, on the Altar of his Country, when they are told, that the main Pillar of <hi>Ma≈øonry,</hi> is the LOVE OF MANKIND.</p>
            <p>THE Fates, as tho' they would reveal, in the Per≈øon of our GRAND MASTER, tho≈øe My≈øteries, which have ≈øo long lain hid from the World, have ≈øuffered him, like the great Ma≈øter-builder in the Temple of old, to fall by the Hands of Ruffians, and be again rai≈øed in Honor and Authority: We ≈øearched in the Field for the murdered Son of a Widow, and we found him, <hi>by the Turf and the Twig,</hi> buried on the Brow of a Hill, tho' not in a decent Grave.‚ÄîAnd tho' we mu≈øt again commit his Body to the Tomb, yet our Brea≈øts ≈øhall be the Burying Spot of his <hi>Ma≈øonic Virtues,</hi> and there‚Äî</p>

When the Liberties of America were attacked, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared an early Champion in the Conte≈øt; and tho' his Knowledge and Abilities would have in≈øured Riches and Preferment (could he have ≈øtoop'd to Pro≈øtitution) yet he nobly with≈øtood the fa≈øcinating Charm, to≈ø≈øed Fortune back her Plume, and per≈øued the inflexible Purpo≈øe of his Soul, in guiltle≈øs Competence.</p>
            <p>HE ≈øought not the airy Honors of a Name, el≈øe, many of tho≈øe Publications, which in the early Period of our Controver≈øy ≈øerved to open the Minds of the People, had not appeared anonymous. In every time of eminent Danger, his Fellow-Citizens flew to him for Advice; like the Orator of Athens, he gave it, and di≈øpell'd their Fears:‚ÄîTwice did they call him to the Ro≈øtrum, to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the Ma≈ø≈øacre of their Brethren; and from that In≈øtance, in per≈øua≈øive Language he taught them, not only the dangerous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, but the actual Mi≈øchief, of ≈øtationing a Military Force, in a free City, in a Time of Peace.‚ÄîThey learnt the profitable Le≈ø≈øon, and pen'd it among their Grievances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014892_0009_0F973FAEA59F64B8"/>BUT his Abilities were too great, his Deliberations too much wanted, to be confined to the Limits of a ≈øingle City, and at a Time when our Liberties were mo≈øt critically in Danger from the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Machinations and open A≈ø≈øaults of our Enemies, this Town, to their la≈øting Honor, elected him to take a Part in the Councils of the State.‚ÄîAnd with what Faithfulne≈øs he di≈øcharged the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Delegation, the Neglect of his private Concerns, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Attendance on that Betru≈øtment, will ≈øufficiently te≈øtify: and the Records of that virtuous A≈ø≈øembly will remain the Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of his Accompli≈øhments as a State≈øman, and his Integrity and Services as a Patriot, thro' all Po≈øterity.</p>
            <p>The Congre≈øs of our Colony could not ob≈øerve ≈øo much Virtue and Greatne≈øs without honoring it with the highe≈øt Mark of their Favour; and by the free Suffrages of that uncorrupted Body of Freemen, he was ≈øoon called to pre≈øide in the Senate.‚ÄîWhere by his daily Councils and Exertions, he was con≈øtantly promoting the great Cau≈øe of <hi>General Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when he found the Tools of Oppre≈ø≈øion were ob≈øtinately bent on Violence; when he found the Vengeance of the Briti≈øh Court mu≈øt he glutted with Blood; he determined, that what he could not effect by his Eloquence or his Pen, he would bring to Purpo≈øe by his Sword. And on the memorable 19th of April, he appeared in the Field, under the united Characters of the General, the Soldier and the Phy≈øician.‚ÄîHere he was ≈øeen animating his

Countrymen to Battle, and fighting by their Side, and there he was found admini≈øtering healing Comforts to the wounded. And when he had repelled the unprovoked A≈ø≈øaults of the Enemy, and had driven them back into their Strong-holds, like the virtuous Chief of Rome, he returned to the Senate, and pre≈øided again at the Councils of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>WHEN the vanqui≈øhed Foe had rallied their di≈øordered Army, and by the Acqui≈øition of fre≈øh Strength, again pre≈øumed to fight again≈øt Freemen; our Patriot, ever anxious to be, where he could do the mo≈øt good, again put off the Senator, and in Contempt of Danger flew to the Field of Battle, where, after a ≈øtern, and <hi>almo≈øt</hi> victorious Re≈øi≈øtance, ah! too ≈øoon for his Country! he ≈øealed his Principles with his Blood‚Äîthen‚Äî</p>
            <l>"Freedom wept, that <hi>MERIT</hi> could not ≈øave,"</l>
            <l>But <hi>WARREN's</hi> Manes "mu≈øt enrich the Grave."</l>
            <p>Enriched indeed! And the Heights of <hi>Charle≈øtown</hi> ≈øhall be more memorable for thy Fall, than the <hi>Plains of Abraham</hi> are for that of the Hero of <hi>Britain.</hi> For while <hi>he</hi> died contending for a ≈øingle Country, <hi>You</hi> fell in the Cau≈øe of Virtue and Mankind.</p>
            <p>THE Greatne≈øs of his Soul ≈øhone even in the Moment of Death; for if Fame ≈øpeaks true, in his la≈øt Agonies he met the In≈øults of his barbarous Foe, with his wonted Magnanimity, and with the true Spirit of a Soldier, frowned at their Impotence.</p>

            <p>AND can we, my Countrymen, with Indifference behold ≈øo much Worth and Valour laid pro≈øtrate by the Hand of <hi>Briti≈øh Tyranny!</hi> And can we ever gra≈øp that Hand in Affection again? ‚ÄîAre we not yet convinced "that he who hunts the Woods for Prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is le≈øs a Savage than the <hi>King of Britain"!</hi> Have we not Proofs, wrote in Blood, that the corrupted Nation, from whence we ≈øprang (tho' there may be ≈øome Traces of their ancient Virtue left) are ≈øtubbornly fixed on our De≈øtruction!

Forbid it the Spirit of the brave MONTGOMORY! Forbid it the Spirit of immortal WARREN! Forbid it the Spirits of all our valiant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen!
