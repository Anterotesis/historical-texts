            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PRAYER.</head>
            <p>O MOST Mighty God, terrible in thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wonderful in thy doings towards the children of men! We thy ſinful ſervants here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before thee, confeſs, and adore the myſterious ſtrokes of thy ſupreme Providence.</p>
            <p>LONG has the land rejoiced in the abundant ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thy tender mercies. Not our merit but thy goodneſs, has turned the wilderneſs into fruitful fields, and the loneſome ſolitude into the cheerful dwellings of men. From year to year, almoſt from day to day, new habitations have ſprung up, which ought to reſound with the praiſe of thy holy name, of thy eternal and uncreated ſon, and of thy moſt bleſſed ſpirit.</p>
            <p>BUT alas with grief and ſhame we acknowledge, that we have not always made a right uſe of thy continued favours. Not according to thy benefits have been our improvements, not according to thy bounty has been our gratitude. Our hearts ſmite us when we reflect on the many inſtances of our neglect of heavenly, and our attachment to earthly things. Creation and all its bleſſings, redemption and all its
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013828_0003_0F91B23D44861C90"/>
graces have but too frequently elapſed from our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; and whilſt we have been anxiouſly attentive to the life that now is, we have been fooliſhly inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the promiſe of the life to come. We ſee, we feel, we own ourſelves unworthy of the leaſt of thy gracious vouchſafements; whereby as a ſtate we have been gradually led from weakneſs to ſtrength, as individuals from lonely helpleſſneſs to all the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous comforts of ſociety.</p>
            <p>HENCE doubtleſs it is; ſo it becomes us to believe, and ſo confeſs, that thou haſt permitted the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our proſpect to be overclouded, hence, for without thy ſovereign will nothing can take effect, the dreadful flame of diſcord has been kindled, and the devouring ſword of war unſheathed: Hence, we are wounded in the tendereſt part, are at variance with thoſe whom hitherto we have revered as fathers, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as teachers, loved as brethren, and dealt with as friends. <hi>For it is not an open enemy that has done us this diſhonour, neither is it an adverſary that has magnified himſelf againſt us; but it is even our brother, our guide, and familiar friend, with whom we took ſweet council, and in the moſt amicable intercourſe, walked together in the houſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN this ſevere diſtreſs whither ſhall we fly but to thy preſence? As a religious ſociety, prayer is our
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013828_0004_0F91B23E06C8ADD8"/>
only weapon: O may it prove the prayer of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may it pierce through the clouds, reach the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of thy Almighty throne, and not turn away till thou, O moſt high, regardeſt it! St. Paul, the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen veſſel of thy ſon, our ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt, has taught us to make prayer and ſupplications for all men—for Kings, and for all that are in eminent place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they, exerciſing their authority with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice, we may lead a peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, urged therefore alike by our duty, our inclination, and our neceſſity, we meekly and devoutly implore thee in behalf of George thy ſervant, our King, and Governor, that wiſdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from above may inform his ſoul, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

to remove him to a life of glory hereafter. We alſo pray thee for the rulers of this our country, that thou wouldſt give them righteous and underſtanding hearts, that wiſdom and gentleneſs, fortitude and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may equally animate their councils and actions, that in the preſent dangerous criſis of affairs, they may leave nothing undone that appertains to our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and welfare, nor do any thing from a principle of ambition, vain-glory, or ſelf intereſt, that in the midſt of war they may remember peace, and in the very moment of oppoſition, wiſh, long, pant, for a ſafe, happy, and honourable accommodation.</p>
            <p>O GRACIOUS God who alone makeſt men to be of one mind in a houſe, a city, a kingdom, a continent, and even a whole world, ſuffer not, in the ſincerity of our hearts, and bitterneſs of our ſouls we beſeech thee, ſuffer not thoſe to remain long divided, whom the ſame language, the ſame deſcent, the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ſame conſtitution, the ſame religion, have ſo intimately united. We confeſs that we are ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our mutual ſins, but do thou moſt gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, re-unite us for thy mercy's ſake. A terrible miſconception is gone forth, remove it, O remove it, thou, whoſe conceptions are clearer than light, and who alone can'ſt regulate the wills and affections of ſinful men. We humble ourſelves under thy correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, and confeſs the juſtice of all thy judgments,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013828_0006_0F91B240ACB92090"/>
but we pray, we are allowed to pray, that the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our puniſhment may be ſhortened, and our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come to an end. We pray for millions now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, and for millions yet unborn in both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who without thy interpoſing favour, will hereafter be affected by the conſequence of the preſent calamities, yet not on ourſelves but on thee do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our deliverance, not on our merits, but on our Saviour's merits do we depend for mercy: Hear us therefore, O Lord, hear thy people who call upon thee, that all the world may know, that thou art our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and mighty deliverer, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

            <p>BY the covenant which Almighty God was pleaſed to enter into with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jews, an immediate intercourſe was eſtabliſhed between heaven and earth. Each deviation from the divine law was followed by ſure pains and penalties; each return to holineſs was a certain return to peace and proſperity. The ſin of individuals never failed to bring upon them the curſe, their repentance always reſtored them to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Whenſoever the ſtate fell from its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to Jehovah, then ſtraightway came the great, the terrible day of vengeance: No
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013828_0008_0F91B241ADDCDC28"/>
ſooner was the trumpet blown in Zion, the faſt ſanctified, and the ſolemn aſſembly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, no ſooner did the Prieſts and Miniſters weep between the porch and the alter, and ſay ſpare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach; no ſooner was the act of public humiliation performed, than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic redreſs enſued—the Lord was jealous for his land, and pitied his people, and removed far off them the northern army.</p>
            <p>ON this foundation of God's unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſe it is, that King Solomon at the dedication of the temple frames his petition in the verſes preceding the text. His claim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſacred hiſtorian goes on to inform us, was allowed; and the moſt high by fire from Heaven ratified afreſh the covenant.</p>
            <p>THE proceſs is moſt plain and moſt awful. Iſrael offended, the God of Iſrael puniſhed with the famine, the peſtilence, or the ſword: The people conſcious of their ſins, made ſolemn prayer and ſupplication; the Lord ſaw the ſincerity of their repentance, and heard from heaven his dwelling place and forgave them.—What was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013828_0009_0F91B24260F00990"/>
—Man by correction learned to fear his God, and that holy fear inſuring the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine protection, he continued to dwell in ſafety in the land of his fathers.</p>
            <p>HAPPY will it be for us, happy will it be for every nation under the ſun, if due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given to this important leſſon. Were we but all convinced that <hi>righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a kingdom, whilſt ſin is a reproach to any people,</hi> and did we ſanctify this convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by practice, what a glorious, what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſcene of things would immediately preſent itſelf to our view! The nations would be bound in a golden chain of amity: None would groan under oppreſſion, for no one would dare to oppreſs: The haughty inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the cruel ſpoiler, the relentleſs deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would be terms no more made uſe of: And each man ſitting in ſafety under his own vine, and under his own fig tree would rapturouſly exclaim,—Lo this is the true, the genuine reign of Chriſt upon earth! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the kingdoms of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not in name, but in deed, not in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but in reality, the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013828_0010_0F91B243238867B0"/>BUT the multiplied provocations of the ſons of men forbid us to indulge the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſo pleaſing a proſpect. The beautious viſion ſhifts away from before our eyes, and in a moment we return to the real unhappy ſtate of things, a world of diſcord and lamentation, of violence and woe, where the long forbearance of the Almighty is much more conſpicuous than his judgments —Where it is more reaſonable to aſk, why cities and ſtates are permited to ſtand, than why they are deſtroyed—where the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Canaan, and even of Sodom and Gomorrah, are frequent in ſome communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—and where in the beſt and moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous congregations, the preacher has ſtill to cry aloud with ſolemn and unceaſing voice, —except ye repent ye muſt inevitably periſh.</p>
            <p>BLESSED forever be the hallowed lips of our moſt gracious redeemer, who foreſeeing that faith would decay, and love wax cold among his diſciples, has ſo affectionately called us to repentance, who delivering us from ſin, and well knowing that we ſhould lead ourſelves therewith a freſh, has ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

continent ſhould be bowed as the heart of one man to deprecate the wrath, and to entreat the protection of heaven, in one and the ſame hour, in one and the ſame cauſe? O it is a goodly ſight, and all the angelick hoſt will applaud our humiliation! it is to begin at the right end; for being once ſecure of defence from above, what is it that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly confound us. Loveſt thou, and art thou beloved of thy maker? His friendſhip <hi>ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea, in ſeven ſhall no evil touch thee; in famine he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thee from death, and in war from the power of the ſword, thou ſhalt not be afraid of the ſcourge of the tongue, nor of deſtruction when it cometh, yea though thou walkeſt through the valley of the ſhadow of death thou ſhalt fear no evil, for he is with thee his rod and his ſtaff ſhall comfort thee.</hi>

            <p>THE preſent ſituation is the moſt diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that could have happened to beings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with humanity. It is more replete with anguiſh, than even with danger. I have heard, and can well believe, that the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing armies reſpect and pity each other in the

very inſtant that their weapons are uplifted to deſtroy. Can we avoid praying that hearts ſo framed might be permitted to meet in equal and honourable union; neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering nor conquered, but as free citizens of the ſame realm, intitled to the ſame rights and privileges. Much, too much, does our caſe reſemble that recorded in ſcripture where King Rehoboam aſſembled the houſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, with the tribe of Benjamin to fight againſt the houſe of Iſrael: But alas! alas! there is no Prophet, no Shemiah the man of God, to ſpeak unto <hi>Rehoboam and to all the houſe of Judah and Benjamin, ſaying, ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your brethren the houſe of Iſrael; return ye every man to his houſe.</hi>

            <p>BUT my duty in this ſacred place leads me no farther than to bewail the miſeries brought upon this country by thoſe fatal miſconceptions that have gone forth on the other ſide of the atlantick, and to exhort my little flock, ſo to prepare themſelves by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned faith, by holy prayer, and by genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine repentance to deſerve (if man can be ſaid to deſerve) the temporal bleſſings of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,

which I truſt, nor truſt in vain, will be poured out upon us, if we patiently and manfully abide the appointed trial. There is who reigns on high, and at his pleaſure <hi>breaketh the bow and knappeth the ſpear in ſunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire</hi>; for his good time let us wait with calmneſs and ſubmiſſion, and let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhorten the period by the integrity of our behaviour, and by the fervour of our devotions. That good time will come; let us not doubt it for we have a gracious maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in heaven; when the labour of ſome of our fellow citizens, and the ſorrows of others ſhall ceaſe—when our darkneſs ſhall be turned into light, and our mourning into joy—when our loyalty ſhall ſtand confirmed, and our liberty eſtabliſhed by ſufferings— and when we ſhall meet again in the Lord's houſe, to celebrate his returning mercies, whoſe wrath we now deprecate, and to whoſe judgments we now bend with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive addoration.</p>
            <p>FOR in revolving the days of old, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the manner in which it has pleaſed

the almighty ruler to exerciſe his moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there is no reaſon to think, that any ſtate legitimately conſtituted, will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by his ſupreme fiat, till that ſtate has rendered itſelf unworthy of continuance, by acts that defile its purity, and corrupt its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſſence. I ſay legitimately conſtituted, meaning where the natural rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have been reſpected in its conſtitution, becauſe with domination founded in tyranny the allwiſe, and alljuſt ruler has no connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That is not his work, but rather the work of that malignant being, who delights in human wretchedneſs. Now the means by which the rulers of a ſtate may ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deviate, and thereby provoke the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of divine anger, are chiefly idolatry, perſecution for religious opinions, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> invaſion of their neighbours, mean pilfering and ſtealing of adjacent lands, and laws made on purpoſe to oppreſs, or corrupt the people. When enormities ſuch as theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, it is neither to be wondered or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at, if the ſtorm deſcends from above, and ſweeps away ſuch a perverted govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

from the face of the earth. But from enormities ſuch as theſe, blacker than the blackeſt night, more ſavage than the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wild beaſts of the foreſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to reaſon, to truth, to juſtice, and to human nature, this land of our hopes, and deſires is moſt notoriouſly, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably free. No man can dwell therein who believes in more than one God, the Creator of the univerſe, and none who profeſs themſelves the ſervants of that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious being, can be moleſted for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles. It is not upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of hiſtory, nor in the memory of man, that this government has ever in any ſhape, much leſs in wantonneſs, invaded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of others: From the poor untutored Indian it has uniformly diſdained to borrow, and abhorred to ſteal: Fair and open pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes have preceded every ſettlement: Its laws—but why ſhould I praiſe its laws to thoſe who live under them, when their good report is ſpread far and near, when I have heard it a thouſand times acknowledged in Europe, that they are the mildeſt, and moſt

No, we may rather comfort our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the aſſurance, that however great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have ſinned as individuals, yet that the judge of all the earth will not ſuffer the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent work of one immortal man to be defaced or demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to the preſent unnatural diſputes, it would ill become my place and ſtation to ſay any thing with the tone of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive authority: My maſter's kingdom is not of this world, nor am I appointed a Ruler, a Judge, or a Divider: But if nothing more is deſigned, than what is profeſſed; if to preſerve our rights and privileges be the ſole aim of the Continental Congreſs, and of thoſe who aſſemble at their biddings; if no ſparks of diſloyalty, no deſire of change, no intentions of removing the ancient land marks, lie concealed beneath the fair out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of public good; I ſay, if this be the caſe, and according to the beſt of my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it really is ſo, then we have a good

cauſe, and may expect the bleſſing of Heaven upon our endeavours. For the bleſſing of legal, and equal Liberty we pray; and tho' our prayers are ſincere, yet becauſe of our tender attachment to our parent ſtate, grief mixes with our devotions: For the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty our fellow citizens are to fight; and they will ſurely do it, with ſteady tho' reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant courage—with hearts that wiſh to ſave, in the ſame moment that they are obliged to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>IT happens, that many defenders of this land are now before me. Summoned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice, they have arrived here at this ſolemn ſeaſon, and have joined in our act of humiliation. Theſe I will exhort to go on to their appointed deſtination, in the fear of God, in the ſentiments of true honor, in the love of Liberty and of their Country —Deſcended from anceſtors who in the old world often proved, they preferred freedom to life, I truſt you have not degenerated from their nobleneſs of ſoul, but will even ſtrive to exceed your forefathers in deeds of valour, generoſity and humanity.

I have a commiſſion, and it is written in the moſt luminous characters of truth; to bid you honour the King—yet I truſt you want not the admonition: But I have no commiſſion to bid you honour thoſe, who wickedly ſtand between the throne and the ſubject; and yet I believe, you will begin to reſpect them, when they learn to reſpect themſelves, and the common rights of humanity. Go, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and may the Lord of Hoſts be with you: Go, and fill up the meaſure of your fame, more by generous behaviour, than even by feats of arms: Go, and defend our franchiſes, our wives, our children, and poſſeſſions: Go, and bring us back a ſpeedy

            <p>FOR us, Brethren, beloved in the Lord, let us, as I have already admoniſhed you, proceed as we have this day begun, and ſtrive to deſerve in ſome ſort, the Benediction of the Almighty. Nor only now with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hearts and voices, but alſo ſingly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately in the cloſet, unfeignedly confeſs and deplore our many ſins, and offer up our ſupplications to the allwiſe, omnipotent, and merciful Diſpoſer of all events, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our iniquities, remove our calamities, and avert thoſe deſſolating judgments with which we are threatened: That he will bleſs our rightful Sovereign King George the Third, and inſpire him with wiſdom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and purſue the true intereſt of all his ſubjects: That a ſpeedy end may be put to the diſcord between Great-Britain and the American Colonies without further effuſion of blood; and that the Britiſh nation may be
