            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Anſwer. I did apply to Mr. Buck, at his houſe in Vermont, and repreſented to him, generally, the nature and advantages of our plan; but I made no propoſal to him of benefit or advantage to himſelf, or of other improper inducement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Buck then informed the Houſe, that the ſaid Charles Whitney had made overtures to him in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, offering a ſhare in land, or an equivalent in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; or words to that effect: Whereupon,</p>
               <p>It was moved and ſeconded, that the ſaid Charles Whitney do now withdraw in cuſtody, and that all further proceedings reſpecting him be adjourned, until to-morrow, twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>A petition of Robert Randall, in cuſtody of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-at-arms, was preſented to the Houſe and read, praying that he may be indulged with the aſſiſtance of counſel, and a reaſonable time to prepare for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, on the charges now depending againſt him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe: Whereupon,</p>

               <p>The ſaid Robert Randall was then brought to the bar, in cuſtody of the Serjeant, and it being demanded of him by Mr. Speaker, "what further time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to prepare for his defence?" he anſwered until Friday next.</p>

               <p>The ſaid inſtrument of writing was read, and ordered to lie on the table.</p>
               <p>Charles Whitney was then brought to the bar, in cuſtody of the Serjeant, and the further information againſt him, by Mr. Buck, one of the members from Vermont, as ſtated in the journal of the proceedings of yeſterday, being read to him, he was interrogated by Mr. Speaker, "whether he did admit or deny the ſame?"—To which he anſwered, that he did wholly deny the ſame: Whereupon,</p>

               <div type="deposition">
                  <p>William Smith, one of the repreſentatives of the ſtate of South-Carolina, in the Congreſs of the United States, declares—</p>
                  <p>That on Tueſday laſt, the twenty-ſecond inſtant, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who called himſelf Randall, and who is ſaid to be from the ſtate of Maryland, applied to him at his lodgings, in the city of Philadelphia, and requeſted a private and confidential converſation of an hour, which the informant agreed to; and at the time appointed, which was the ſame evening, the ſaid Randall being alone with the informant, communicated to him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal for procuring from the legiſlature of the United States, a grant of about eighteen or twenty millions of acres, in the north weſtern territory, between lakes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chigan, Huron and Erie. That the ſaid Randall obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the grant he propoſed, would be of great ſervice to the United States, from the perſons who would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031364_0011_0FEC44011C29EE30"/>
therein, (to wit; certain Canada merchants, at or near Detroit, whoſe names he did not mention) having great influence over the Indians, who were not pacified by the late treaty concluded with general Wayne; and that the ſaid perſons would extinguiſh the Indian claims, at their own expenſe; and after ſetting forth the ſaving of expenſe, by the ceſſation of the Indian war, and other reaſons to induce a belief that the propoſed grant would be of public utility, he proceeded to inform the informant, that the intention was to divide the land into about forty ſhares, twenty-four of which would be allowed to, or diſtributed among ſuch perſons (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as this informant underſtood him, from the whole purport of his converſation, members of Congreſs) as would favor the meaſure: that of theſe twenty-four ſhares, he had the management or diſtribution of twelve, for the ſouthern part, (meaning, as the informant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the ſouthern members of Congreſs) and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, whoſe name he did not mention, had the diſpoſition of the other twelve, for the eaſtern part, (ſtill, as the informant underſtood, and believes, meaning as aforeſaid.) That he, the ſaid Randall, propoſed ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the ſaid ſhares into ſo many portions, as to have a ſufficiency to obtain a majority (meaning, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant underſtood him, a majority of Congreſs) and that gentlemen, after the ſeſſion was over, or when they returned to private life, might then have ſuch parts of ſhares, as the ſaid twenty-four ſhares would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ſuch of them as would favor the buſineſs, on the ſame terms as the original aſſociators. That the view of him, the ſaid Randall, and of thoſe concerned with him, was to preſent a memorial, on the following Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to Congreſs, to obtain the ſaid grant for a ſmall price, mentioning half a million of dollars; and that he ſuppoſed the land was worth more than two ſhillings an acre. On taking leave, he preſſed the informant for an early and deciſive anſwer to the foregoing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; to which the informant replied, that he would not wiſh to ſee him again before Friday morning, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031364_0012_0FEC4390DE9DB520"/>
requeſted him to call on him at Congreſs, and not at his lodgings; but the Houſe did not ſit on Friday, and the informant has not ſeen him ſince. The informant fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, that the foregoing is the ſubſtance and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the communication to him made by the ſaid Randall, on the ſubject above ſet forth; and that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion clearly made on the mind of the informant, by the overtures, was, that under a pretext of public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the object of the application was, to ſecure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant's influence, as a member of Congreſs, by a temptation of great perſonal advantage. That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, the next morning, communicated the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the foregoing to Mr. Murray, one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from Maryland, and conſulted him on the moſt proper mode of proceeding on ſo delicate an occaſion; that Mr. Murray adviſed a conſultation with Mr. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of the Senate; and that, in conſequence of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with Mr. Murray and Mr. Henry, on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day (Thurſday) it was reſolved, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant ſhould immediately communicate the whole tranſaction to the Preſident of the United States; which he accordingly did.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Murray declares, that on Wedneſday laſt, the twenty-third inſtant, Mr. Smith, member of Congreſs, of South-Carolina, informed him, that a man of the name of Randall, of Maryland, had the evening before attempted to bribe him in weſtern lands, on condition of his ſupporting an application, which Randall told him he ſhould ſoon make to Congreſs; the object of which application was, a grant from Congreſs, of from eighteen to twenty millions of acres of land, between Erie, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and Michigan. That Mr. Smith was extremely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, that ſome other gentleman ſhould immediately be informed of the infamous propoſal, and that he ſaid he would mention it to Mr. Henry, of the Senate, and adviſe with him, upon proper meaſures for the detecting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031364_0013_0FEC44059478EFB0"/>
of the full extent of the ſcheme, and cruſhing it.—That he had no opportunity of talking to Mr. Henry, on that day; but early on the morning of the twenty-fourth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, communicated the intelligence to Mr. Henry, who recommended, that Mr. Smith ſhould immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Preſident: That on the ſaid day, Mr. Randall of Maryland, was introduced to him, the informant, and requeſted a confidential interview, at his, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant's lodgings, which the informant readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, to be at five, for the purpoſe of developing his ſcheme. That Randall came at or near five, that day laſt named, to wit; on Thurſday, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Mr. Henry and himſelf, in general terms, the outline of a plan, by which he, Randall and his Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da friends, would extinguiſh the Indian title to all the lands between lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, as mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a map which Randall then ſhewed, containing from eighteen to twenty millions of acres. That he, the informant, then aſked Randall into his apartment, where they were alone. That Randall expatiated at firſt upon the public utility of his ſcheme, which was, that Congreſs ſhould grant to him, and his company, all the land afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid mentioned, for five hundred thouſand, or at moſt, one million of dollars; and that he would undertake, in four months, that the harmony of the Indians ſhould be ſecured to the union; or if Congreſs thought proper, that the Indian tribes, now on ſaid land, ſhould be removed to the Britiſh ſide, or down lake Michigan, reſerving to ſome aged chiefs, a few miles ſquare; that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and himſelf had determined to divide the lands aforeſaid, into forty (or forty-one) ſhares. That of theſe ſhares, twenty-four were to be reſerved for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of himſelf and his partner, now in town, for ſuch members of Congreſs as aſſiſted them, by their abilities and votes, in obtaining the grant aforeſaid.—That of theſe twenty-four ſhares, his partner had twelve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his management, for the eaſtern members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and that he, Randall, had the other twelve ſhares under his management, for the ſouthern members of

Congreſs. That theſe ſhares were to be ſo divided as to accompliſh the object by ſecuring a majority of Congreſs. That the informant ſtarted an objection to land ſpeculation, as troubleſome, and that he, Randall, ſaid, if you (meaning the informant,) do not chuſe to accept your ſhare of the land, you ſhall have caſh, in hand, for your ſhare. That the informant appointed Randall to meet him in the lobby of the Houſe, on Monday, the twenty-eighth inſtant. That Randall told him, a memorial was to be handed in, upon this ſubject, on ſaid Monday; but refuſed to inform the informant, what member was to preſent it. That Randall told him, that he, Randall, mentioned his plan to ſome members in the <hi>general way</hi> only—meaning thereby, as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, a view of the ſounder part of the plan, as being conducive to public utility. That, in the early part of the confidential and ſecret converſation, Randall ſaid, that the members of Congreſs, who would behave handſomely, ſhould come into their ſhares, on the ſame terms upon which the company obtained the grant; but ſoon after made propoſals, more openly, ſeductive and corrupt; cloſing them with the offer of caſh in hand, as aforeſaid.—That the informant on that evening when Randall went away, told Mr. Henry of the whole of Randall's offers aforeſaid; then called on the Secretary of State, and communicated the ſame to him; and next morning early, informed the Preſident of the tranſaction.</p>

                  <p>That in the evening of Thurſday, the ſeventeenth of December, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-five, as well as this informant recollects, a perſon called upon this informant, at his lodgings, under the name of Robert Randall, with an introductory note from Mr. Gabriel
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031364_0015_0FEC440CC4B8E878"/>
Chriſtie, in the uſual form, dated the fifteenth of the ſame month.</p>
                  <p>That the ſaid Robert Randall informed this informant, that he had ſome buſineſs of importance to communicate to this informant, which would probably come before Congreſs: That it reſpected the fur trade, at preſent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the Britiſh traders with the Indians, through the lakes. He obſerved, that it would be important to change the courſe of that trade into ſome channel through the United States.—That he believed he could put Congreſs upon ſome plan of effecting that object.—That the plan was of a ſecret nature.—That he was not then prepared to diſcloſe it, and requeſted a private interview with this informant, for that purpoſe, at ſome other time. Upon which requeſt, this informant appointed the next Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, at twelve o'clock, (being the nineteenth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) to receive the communication.</p>
                  <p>That about the time appointed, the ſaid Robert Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall called on this informant, and after ſome general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, informed this informant, that an aſſociation had been formed by himſelf and others, with ſome of the moſt influential traders at Detroit, for the purpoſe of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the lands contained in the peninſula formed by the lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, and the waters connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe lakes, amounting in the whole to twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty millions of acres, if the conſent of Congreſs could be obtained for the extinguiſhment of the Indian claims thereto. The ſaid Randall then produced a map of the peninſula and lakes.</p>
                  <p>That this tract of country was to be divided into ſhares, and that a number of ſhares was to be left unappropriated, until the neceſſary law of Congreſs ſhould paſs, authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extinguiſhment of the Indian claims; and might then be filled up by thoſe who might think proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the plan, and ſhould give their aid for procuring the paſſage of ſuch law. Upon this intimation, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant obſerved, that he hoped the ſaid Randall did not intend to addreſs the information of the unappropriated ſhares, particularly to this informant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:031364_0016_0FEC44E1665C5FA0"/>
To which the ſaid Randall replied, that he did not: That he only meant it as general information; but he could ſee no impropriety in the members of Congreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned in the ſcheme, if the public good was to be promoted by it; and that thirty or forty members were already engaged in its ſupport; or words to that effect.</p>
                  <p>After ſome further converſation of a general nature, reſpecting the preſent ſtate of the fur trade; the value of the lands contained in the peninſula; and the probable effect of the late treaty upon that trade and country, the ſaid Randall enquired of this informant "whether he deemed his plan adviſable, and whether it would meet with the ſupport of this informant, in Congreſs." To which this informant replied, that if the ſaid Randall ſhould bring his propoſals before Congreſs, this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant would give them the conſideration which his duty required, and ſhould give ſuch vote as he deemed right; or words to the ſame effect. Very ſhortly after this obſervation, Mr. Edward Livingſton, a member of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from New-York, entered the room, and the ſaid Randall left it, without further obſervation, as well as this informant recollects. This informant immediately communicated the contents of this converſation to Mr. Livingſton, and declared that he conſidered the proffer of the unappropriated ſhares to the members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, a direct attempt at corruption.</p>
                  <p>This informant, on the ſame day, communicated the ſubſtance of the converſation to the Speaker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, to Meſſrs. Blount and Macon of North-Carolina, and to Meſſrs. Madiſon and Venable of Virginia. It was deemed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable by all theſe gentlemen, as well as by this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, to permit the plan to be brought before Congreſs in the uſual way, by memorial, and to cauſe a detection, by means of a committee, to whom the ſaid memorial ſhould be referred: and in the mean time, if the ſaid Randall ſhould again call on this informant, he ſhould proceed to make further diſcovery of the real ſtate and nature of the tranſaction.</p>

                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:031364_0017_0FEC44E32DEEE940"/>
That on the next day, the ſaid Randall did again call on this informant, and informed him, that he, the ſaid Randall, then propoſed to diſcloſe his plan more particularly; and after ſome general remarks upon the public utility, as well as individual benefit of the plan, he ſaid that it was in ſubſtance as follows:</p>
                  <p>The tract of country before deſcribed, was to be divided into forty-one ſhares; five of which were to be reſerved to the Indian traders at Detroit; the other thirty-ſix were to be divided into two departments; eighteen to the eaſtern, and eighteen to the ſouthern department. That ſix, out of the eighteen ſhares, were to be reſerved to his eaſtern partner and aſſociates, and ſix, out of the remaining eighteen, to himſelf and his aſſociates. That the remaining twenty-four ſhares were to be left unappropriated, for the uſe of ſuch members of Congreſs as ſhould ſupport the meaſure. That the names of thoſe members were not to be made known until after the law for the extinguiſhment of the Indian claims had paſſed: and then requeſted this informant to prepare ſome writing which would compel the oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible perſons to ſurrender the unappropriated ſhares to the real ſupporters of the meaſure, after it ſhould be effected. That one million of dollars were ſpoken of, as the price for the lands; but that he deemed that ſum by far too much; and as Congreſs would have to fix the price, they might make the terms ſuch as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſiderable emoluments to the purchaſers. That a majority of the Senate had conſented to give the plan their ſupport, and within three of a majority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. After much further conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation on the ſubject, which this informant thinks unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to particularize, the ſaid Randall promiſed to wait again on this informant, at his lodgings, on Tueſday evening, at ſeven o'clock, and introduce to this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, his eaſtern aſſociate.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Randall did not call at the appointed hour, and this informant did not ſee him again until Friday, the twenty-fifth of December, when the ſaid Randall
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031364_0018_0FEC44E5B241D070"/>
again called on this informant, and after making an apology, for not calling at the appointed hour of the preceding Tueſday, informed him at the door of his apartment, that his memorial to Congreſs would be ready to be preſented on the next Monday; but as ſeveral gentlemen were in this informant's room, at that time, the ſaid Randall did not enter, and no further converſation was then had: ſince which time this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant has not ſeen the ſaid Randall, until he was brought to the bar of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, in cuſtody.</p>
                  <p>This informant further ſaith, that he communicated the ſubſtance of every material converſation with the ſaid Randall, to the Speaker of the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and to the ſeveral gentlemen before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

                  <p>I, Daniel Buck, inform and ſay, that about ten days previous to my ſetting out on my journey to Congreſs (which was on the thirtieth day of November laſt,) a ſtranger, whom I now know to be Charles Whitney, in cuſtody of the Serjeant-at-arms, called at my office in Norwich, in the ſtate of Vermont, introduced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the name of Whitney, and informed me, that he had ſome buſineſs of importance which he wiſhed to converſe with me upon. I aſked if he wiſhed to be in private, he ſignified that he did, upon which my clerk withdrew; and the ſaid Whitney proceeded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me that the buſineſs of which he wiſhed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, was of great importance to the public, as well as to the individuals immediately concerned.—That it would come before Congreſs, but was ſo circumſtanced as to render it neceſſary to make a previous ſtatement to ſome of the members, that they might be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to others; and the whole thereby be better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to judge upon the buſineſs: he declared he wiſhed for nothing improper, and that he did not want that I
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031364_0019_0FEC44E765927820"/>
ſhould favor the plan, unleſs I ſaw it to be conſiſtent; for he ſaid he wanted nothing but what was perfectly juſt and honorable, and was confident that if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be underſtood, it would appear to be of great public utility: he then ſtated, that he and his aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes had diſcovered a large and immenſely valuable tract of land, between, or contiguous to, lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, (if I miſtake not the names) which he ſaid might be purchaſed of the Indians, at a low rate: That this purchaſe would conciliate the affections, and ſecure the friendſhip of the hoſtile tribes.—That he, the ſaid Whitney, together with Ebenezer Allen, doctor Randall, and a number of Canadian merchants at De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, had formed an aſſociation for the purpoſe of extinguiſhing the Indian title, and petitioning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for the pre-emption right to thoſe lands; that if they ſucceeded, it was their intention immediately to make ſettlement on them.—That thoſe merchants had ſuch influence with, and controul over the Indians, that there would be no difficulty with them; and that ſuch a ſettlement would be a barrier againſt the ſavages, and effectually ſecure peace to the United States.—That thoſe merchants were then employed in the buſineſs, among the Indians; and that his partner, doctor Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and his other aſſociates, had ſuch connections, that there was a fair proſpect of ſucceſs.—That it was not their intention, however, to engroſs all this property to themſelves; but that it was to be divided into a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſhares, and that he and the ſaid Randall had the diſpoſal of them.—That he, the ſaid Whitney, was then directly from Philadelphia, and that it was agreed that Randall ſhould diſpoſe of a part amongſt his friends, and the influential characters in the ſouthern ſtates; that he, the ſaid Whitney, was to diſtribute the other part amongſt his the ſaid Whitney's friends, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential characters in the eaſtern and northern ſtates.—That they had already got a number engaged, but that the ſubſcription was not full, and that I might become an adventurer, if I wiſhed for it; and as he conceived
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031364_0020_0FEC44EA7A97C180"/>
that I could make myſelf acquainted with the facts, they, the ſaid aſſociates, would be able ſo clearly to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the public utility of the meaſure, that there could be no impropriety in my being concerned in the buſineſs, as I ſhould thereby only connect my private intereſt with the public good; and while I was advancing the greateſt intereſt of my country, might put two or three thouſand dollars in my own pocket. Upon my ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting that, by a late treaty, a peace was already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the Indians: and that this was a buſineſs that might involve in it an important national queſtion, as, by the treaty, the right of purchaſing lands of the Indians, was reſerved to the United States, the ſaid Whitney replied and ſaid, that the Indians were greatly diſſatisfied with the treaty, and would not keep it; and that another war would be the certain conſequence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs other meaſures were adopted. He then renewed the proteſtations of the purity of his intentions, and ſaid, that he conceived that they (meaning himſelf and aſſociates, as I underſtood him) ſhould ſo clearly evince the utility of the plan, as that there could be no doubt of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the mind of any well-wiſher to his country; and ſaid, that he thought it would be hard to ſuppoſe that members of Congreſs were, in conſequence of their appointment, to be deprived of thoſe advantages to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire property which might be taken by others. The ſaid Whitney ſhewed me a plan of the country, and the articles of agreement between the aſſociates, which appear to be the ſame as have been read in Congreſs: he alſo ſaid much upon the magnitude of the object, in reſpect to the ſubſcribers and partners: and though I cannot now repeat his expreſſions, yet I can truly aſſert, that I then clearly underſtood him, that if I would ſubſcribe as a partner, my name might be kept ſecret, and after the grant was obtained, if I choſe to relinquiſh my ſhare in the lands, I might receive money in lieu of it; though no ſpecified ſum was mentioned, other than has already been ſtated; and the converſation finally broke off upon my declaring that I would make no engagement in the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031364_0021_0FEC44F48D9B1010"/>
buſineſs, until I was better informed as to the merits of the queſtion.</p>

               <p>On motion of Mr. Chriſtie of Maryland, and Mr. Sedgwick of Maſſachuſetts, the ſeveral informations heretofore given by them on oath, in the caſe of Robert Randall, and now delivered in, in writing, at the Clerk's table, ſubſcribed with their names, reſpectively, were read, and ordered to be inſerted in the journal, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</p>
               <div type="deposition">
                  <p>The declaration of Gabriel Chriſtie is, that ſome time in the month of October or November laſt, this informant was in Philadelphia, when he ſaw Robert Randall, who had, as he informed this informant, juſt returned from Canada, where he had been diſappointed in the buſineſs he went to that country on; but he, Randall, informed this informant, that on his way home, he had called at Detroit, where he had ſpent ſome time; and had, he believed, entered into an aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, to which, if he got the conſent of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, would be of conſiderable advantage to him, and thoſe who choſe to aſſociate with him; and informed this informant, that he might be concerned with him, provided he liked the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031364_0023_0FEC45000D7F0C30"/>
he then informed this informant, that he had aſſociated with a number of influential perſons at De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, for the purpoſe of obtaining the pre-emption right to a large tract of country within the territory of the United States, and produced to this informant, the original aſſociation. After this informant had heard all that Randall had to communicate to him, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant told Randall, that he conſidered his ſcheme as a wild gooſe one; and that this informant would not have any concern in it. Randall then requeſted this informant, to give him his opinion in what manner he, Randall, ought to proceed: this informant told him, that the moſt proper perſon to apply to, was Mr. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph, the late ſecretary of ſtate; and if he, Randall, thought proper, this informant would inform Mr. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph of it, and get his advice, which Randall agreed to: this informant then went to Mr. Randolph, and gave him all the information that the informant had received from Randall. After conſidering the buſineſs ſome time, Mr. Randolph adviſed, that an application ſhould be made to the Preſident of the United States; which advice, the informant gave to Randall, who ſeemed, at that time, fully ſatisfied with the propoſal, and requeſted the informant to introduce him to the Preſident, for that purpoſe; but as this informant was going out of town in a day or two, he told Randall, that he would introduce him to the Preſident, on his return to Congreſs. When the informant came to Philadelphia, in December, he found Randall in the city; and after aſking Randall, what he had done in his buſineſs, and whether he ſtill meant to apply to the Preſident, Randall then informed the informant, that his friend and aſſociate, Mr. Whitney, had arrived in Philadelphia, and that upon conſulting with him, they came to a determination not to apply to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, as he heretofore had agreed, but had determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſent a memorial to the legiſlature, for a grant of the ſaid land. This informant told Randall, that he diſapproved of this mode, and aſked Randall who
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031364_0024_0FEC4501E4FC5688"/>
had adviſed him to it. Randall then informed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, that this ſaid Mr. Whitney had informed him, that he had conſulted with a number of the eaſtern members of Congreſs, and in particular, with Mr. Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, who had adviſed this mode of proceeding. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall alſo informed this informant, that Mr. Sedgwick had agreed to draw up, and preſent his memorial. This informant then informed Randall, that by this mode of proceeding, he had put it out of this inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's power to be concerned with him, if he thought ever ſo well of it. Randall aſked the informant the reaſon; the informant anſwered, that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper in any member of Congreſs, to be concerned in any thing that he was to vote on. This informant was not able to impreſs Randall with the propriety of his remark. The informant never underſtood, that Mr. Sedgwick was, in any manner, concerned with Randall, or his aſſociates; but that he, Mr. Sedgwick, thought the thing a public benefit, and would ſupport it. That Randall never informed this informant, that any of the members of Congreſs were concerned, but that a majority of them thought favourably of the plan, and would ſupport it. In all the converſation the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant had with Randall, this informant told him, that he could not expect this informant's aſſiſtance, as the informant would never agree to ſell any of the lands of the United States, for leſs than a dollar per acre. Randall then informed the informant, before a witneſs, that it was ſtrange, that the informant was the only perſon in Congreſs, that he had applied to, but what ſeemed to think favorably of his plan; the informant told Randall, that his opinion was fixed, and ſtill adviſed his application to the Preſident, which Randall declined.</p>

                  <p>The informant, Theodore Sedgwick, a member of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, declares, that ſome time before he left the place of his reſidence in Maſſachuſetts, one Iſrael Jones, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Adams, in that ſtate, waited on him and introduced to him, a man whom he now knows by the name of Charles Whitney, of the ſtate of Vermont. That Mr. Jones is a man of reſpectable character, a magiſtrate, a member of the ſtate legiſlature, (as the informant believes) and a truſtee of the corporation of Williams college. That Mr. Jones informed the informant, that he, with others, had in contemplation an application to Congreſs, for a grant of a tract of country lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lakes Huron, Michigan and Erie.—Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of a public nature having been ſtated and enlarged upon, the opinion of the informant was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, relative to the propriety and ſucceſs of the propoſed application. He anſwered in ſubſtance, that he believed it was to be doubted whether the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would undertake actually to contract for any of the vacant public lands, and that the doubt was ſtill ſtronger reſpecting theſe lands, the Indian claim to which had not been previouſly extinguiſhed. He ſtated to Mr. Jones that, by reaſon of ſickneſs in his family, it was not probable he ſhould attend the next ſeſſion of Congreſs; at all events, however, he adviſed Mr. Jones not to make an early application, as it was probable the ſubject of diſpoſing of the public lands would occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the attention of Congreſs, during the then enſuing ſeſſion; and that, by the delay, Mr. Jones could form a more correct judgment of the courſe which it would be moſt eligible for him to purſue, relative to this ſubject. That while the informant was waiting on Mr. Jones to the door, at his departure, Mr. Jones aſked him if there would be any impropriety in a member of Congreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned in an application for a grant of lands? The informant anſwered, that it would depend on the circumſtances under which the application was made; proper, if the application was made to a land-office, but
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031364_0026_0FEC4505E4DE3798"/>
otherwiſe, if to the legiſlature; becauſe in the latter caſe it would be for a man to contract with himſelf: to this anſwer Mr. Jones gave an explicit aſſent. That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant never at any time before or afterwards, to his remembrance, ſaw the ſaid Whitney, until he ſaw him in this city, during the preſent ſeſſion. That the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant came from his own home to New-York, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with col. Pepoon, ſtated by the ſaid Whitney, as one of his aſſociates. That the informant hath been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and believes that the ſaid Pepoon is now in this city; but that he had never ſpoken to the informant on the ſubject of the ſaid land ſpeculation. That not long after the arrival of the informant in this city, the ſaid Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, one morning waited on him, and ſtated to him an intended memorial reſpecting the tract of land aforeſaid, and urged on the conſideration of the informant, the motives of a public nature for a grant thereof. That the informant enquired of the ſaid Whitney, to what ſtate he belonged, and being anſwered to Vermont, he recommended to him to requeſt the repreſentatives of that ſtate to preſent his memorial. That the ſaid Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney requeſted the informant to peruſe his memorial when it ſhould be prepared, which he underſtood was not then the caſe. That he anſwered, according to his beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, that whenever he had leiſure he ſhould be willing to do it; or to that effect. That the whole time of the interview he believes did not exceed ſix, he is very confident, could not exceed ten minutes. That twice afterwards, the informant's ſervant informed him, that the ſaid Whitney wiſhed to ſee him, and that he cauſed himſelf to be denied; and the informant is very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he never undertook either to draft, or to preſent any memorial, for the ſaid Whitney.</p>
                  <p>On the morning of the twenty-eighth of December, Mr. Smith of South-Carolina, informed the informant of what he afterwards ſtated in evidence to the Houſe, reſpecting Robert Randall. The informant adviſed Mr. Smith, as ſoon as poſſible, to make the ſame known to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, (which Mr. Smith inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031364_0027_0FEC4508D65479F8"/>
the informant he had determined to do) and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant having previouſly adviſed the ſaid Whitney to apply to the Repreſentatives of Vermont, he thought it his duty, and he accordingly took the earlieſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to requeſt Mr. Smith of that ſtate, to avoid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting any memorial with which he might be entruſted for a grant of land, and deſired him to make the ſame requeſt to Mr. Buck, the other member from the ſame ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The informant further declares, that he never, to his remembrance, ſaw Robert Randall, till he ſaw him at the bar of the Houſe.</p>
