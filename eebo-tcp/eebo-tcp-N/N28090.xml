            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE BEING A SUMMARY ACCOUNT OF THE DIVERS DISPENSATIONS OF GOD TO MEN, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD TO THAT OF OUR PRESENT AGE, BY THE MINISTRY AND TESTIMONY OF HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT GEORGE FOX, AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENSUING JOURNAL.</head>
                  <p>DIVERS have been the diſpenſations of God ſince the creation of the world, unto the ſons of men; but the great end of all of them has been the renown of his own excellent name in the creation and reſtoration of man: man, the emblem of himſelf, as a god on earth, and the glory of all his works. The world began with innocency: all was then good that the good God had made: and as he bleſſed the works of his hands, ſo their natures and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony magnified him their Creator. Then the morning ſtars ſang together for joy, and all parts of his works ſaid Amen to his law. Not a jarr in the whole frame, but man in paradiſe, the beaſts in the field, the fowl in the air, the fiſh in the ſea, the lights in the heavens, the fruits of the earth; yea the air, the earth, the water and fire worſhipped, praiſed and exalted his power, wiſdom and goodneſs. O holy ſabbath, O holy day to the Lord!</p>
                  <p>But this happy ſtate laſted not long: for man, the crown and glory of the whole, being tempted to aſpire above his place, unhappily yielded againſt command and duty, as well as intereſt and felicity; and ſo fell below it, loſt the divine image, the wiſdom, power, and purity he was made in. By which, being no longer fit for paradiſe, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled that garden of God, his proper dwelling and reſidence,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037441_0003_100D8D63EA044960"/>and was driven out, as a poor vagabond, from the preſence of the Lord, to wander in the earth, the habitation of beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Yet God, that made him, had pity on him; for he ſeeing he was deceived, and that it was not of malice, or an original preſumption in him, but through the ſubtilty of the ſerpent (that had firſt fallen from his own ſtate, and by the mediation of the woman, man's own nature and companion, whom the ſerpent had firſt deluded) in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs and wiſdom found out a way to repair the breach, recover the loſs, and reſtore fallen man again by a nobler and more excellent Adam, promiſed to be born of a woman; that as by means of a woman the evil one had prevailed upon man, by a woman alſo He ſhould come into the world, who would prevail againſt him, and bruiſe his head, and deliver man from his power: and which, in a ſignal manner, by the diſpenſation of the Son of God in the fleſh, in the fulneſs of time, was perſonally and fully accompliſhed by him, and in him, as man's Saviour and Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>But his power was not limited, in the manifeſtation of it, to that time; for both before and ſince his bleſſed mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation in the fleſh, he has been the light and life, the rock and ſtrength of all that ever feared God: preſent with them in their temptations, followed them in their travels and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and ſupported and carried them through and over the difficulties that have attended them in their earthly pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage. By this, Abel's heart excelled Cain's, and Seth obtained the pre-eminence, and Enoch walked with God. It was this that ſtrove with the old world, and which they rebelled againſt, and which ſanctified and inſtructed Noah to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But the outward diſpenſation that followed the benighted ſtate of man, after his fall, eſpecially among the patriarchs, was generally that of angels; as the ſcriptures of the Old Teſtament do in many places expreſs, as to Abraham, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, &amp;c. The next was that of the law by Moſes, which was alſo delivered by angels, as the apoſtle tells us. This diſpenſation was much outward, and ſuited to a low and ſervile ſtate; called therefore that of a ſchoolmaſter, to point out and prepare that people to look and long for the Meſſiah, who would deliver them from the ſervitude of a ceremonious and imperfect diſpenſation, by knowing the realities of thoſe myſterious repreſentations in themſelves. In this time the law was written on ſtone, the temple built with hands, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:037441_0004_100D8D65E618A3C8"/>with an outward prieſthood and external rites and ceremonies, that were ſhadows of the good things that were to come, and were only to ſerve till the Seed came, or the more excellent and general manifeſtation of Chriſt, to whom was the promiſe, and to all men only in him, in whom it was Yea and Amen; even life from death, immortality and eternal life.</p>
                  <p>This the prophets foreſaw, and comforted the believing Jews in the certainty of it; which was the top of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical diſpenſation, and which ended in John's miniſtry, the forerunner of the Meſſiah, as John's was finiſhed in him, the fulneſs of all. And God, that at ſundry times and in divers manners had ſpoken to the fathers by his ſervants the prophets, ſpake then by his Son Chriſt Jeſus, <q>who is heir of all things;</q> being the goſpel-day, which is the diſpenſation of ſonſhip: bringing in thereby a nearer teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a better hope, even the beginning of the glory of the latter days, and of the reſtitution of all things; yea, the reſtoration of the kingdom unto Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Now the Spirit, that was more ſparingly communicated in former diſpenſations, began to be <q>poured forth upon all fleſh,</q> according to the prophet Joel, and the light that ſhined in darkneſs, or but dimly before, the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God cauſed to ſhine out of darkneſs, and the day-ſtar began to ariſe in the hearts of believers, giving unto them the knowledge of God in the face (or appearance) of his Son Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Now the poor in ſpirit, the meek, the true mourners, the hungry and thirſty after righteouſneſs, the peace-makers, the pure in heart, the merciful and the perſecuted, came more eſpecially in remembrance before the Lord, and were ſought out and bleſſed by Iſrael's true Shepherd. Old Jeruſalem with her children grew out of date, and the new Jeruſalem into requeſt, the mother of the ſons of the goſpel-day. Wherefore no more at old Jeruſalem, nor at the mountain of Samaria, will God be worſhipped above other places; for, behold, he is declared and preached a Spirit, and he will be known as ſuch, and worſhipped in the Spirit and in the Truth. He will come nearer than of old time, and he will write his law in the heart, and put his fear and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the inward parts, according to his promiſe. Then ſigns, types, and ſhadows flew away, the day having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their inſufficiency in not reaching to the inſide of the cup, to the cleanſing of the conſcience; and all element<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:037441_0005_100D8D67B3D71E40"/>ſervices were expired in and by him that is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all.</p>
                  <p>And to this great and bleſſed end of the diſpenſation of the Son of God, did the apoſtles teſtify, whom he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and anointed by his Spirit, to turn the Jews from their prejudice and ſuperſtition, and the Gentiles from their vanity and idolatry, to Chriſt's Light and Spirit that ſhined in them; that they might be quickened from the ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes in which they were dead, to ſerve the Living God in the newneſs of the Spirit of Life, and walk as children of the light, and of the day, even the day of holineſs: for ſuch "put on Chriſt," the light of the world, <q>and make no more proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</q> So that the Light, Spirit, and Grace that comes by Chriſt, and appears in man, was what the apoſtles miniſtered from, and turned people's minds unto, and in which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and built up the churches of Chriſt in their day. For which cauſe they adviſed them not to quench the Spirit, but wait for the Spirit, and ſpeak by the Spirit, and pray by the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit too, as that which approved them the truly begotten children of God, <q>born not of fleſh and blood, nor of the will of man, but of the will of God;</q> by doing his will, and denying their own; by drinking of Chriſt's cup, and being baptized with his baptiſm of ſelf-denial: the way and path that all the heirs of life have trod to bleſſedneſs. But alas! even in the apoſtles days (thoſe bright ſtars of the firſt magnitude of the goſpel-light) ſome clouds (foretelling an eclipſe of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive glory) began to appear, and ſeveral of them gave early caution of it to the chriſtians of their time; that even then there was, and yet would be more and more, a falling away from the power of godlineſs, and the purity of that ſpiritual diſpenſation, by ſuch as thought to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, but with whom the offence of the croſs ceaſed: yet with this comfortable concluſion, that they ſaw beyond it a more glorious time than ever, to the true church. Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight was true, and what they foretold to the churches, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by them in the name and power of Jeſus, came ſo to paſs: for chriſtians degenerated apace into outſides, as days, and meats, and divers other ceremonies. And which was worſe, they ſell into ſtrife and contention about them, ſeparating one from another, then envying, and, as they had power, perſecuting one another, to the ſhame and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of their common chriſtianity, and grievous ſtumbling
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:037441_0006_100D8D6AA2812CF8"/>and offence of the heathen, among whom the Lord had ſo long and ſo marvellouſly preſerved them. And having got at laſt the worldly power into their hands, by kings and emperors embracing the chriſtian profeſſion, they changed what they could the kingdom of Chriſt, which is not of this world, into a worldly kingdom; or at leaſt ſtiled the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdom that was in their hands the kingdom of Chriſt, and ſo they became worldly, and not true chriſtians. Then human inventions and novelties, both in doctrine and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, crowded faſt into the church, a door being opened thereunto by the groſſneſs and carnality that appeared then among the generality of chriſtians; who had long ſince left the guidance of God's meek and heavenly Spirit, and given themſelves up to ſuperſtition, will-worſhip, and voluntary humility. And as ſuperſtition is blind, ſo it is heady and furious; for all muſt ſtoop to its blind and boundleſs zeal, or periſh by it: in the name of the Spirit, perſecuting the very appearance of the Spirit of God in others, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that in them which they reſiſted in themſelves, viz. the Light, Grace, and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but always under the notion of innovation, hereſy, ſchiſm, or ſome ſuch plauſible name. Though chriſtianity allows of no name or pretence whatever for perſecuting of any man for matters of mere religion; religion being in its very nature meek, gentle, and forbearing; and conſiſts of faith, hope, and charity, which no perſecutor can have, whilſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a perſecutor; in that a man cannot believe well, or hope well, or have a charitable or tender regard to another, whilſt he would violate his mind or perſecute his body for matters of faith or worſhip towards his God.</p>
                  <p>Thus the falſe church ſprang up, and mounted the chair. But though ſhe loſt her nature, ſhe would keep her good name of the Lamb's bride, the true church and mother of the faithful; conſtraining all to receive her mark, either in their forehead or right-hand, publickly or privately: but in deed and in truth ſhe was Myſtery Babylon, the mother of harlots: mother of thoſe that with all their ſhow and outſide of religion, were adulterated and gone from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nature, and life of Chriſt, and grown vain, worldly, ambitious, covetous, cruel, &amp;c. which are the fruits of the fleſh, and not of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now it was that the true church fled into the wilderneſs, that is, from ſuperſtition and violence to a retired, ſolitary, and lonely ſtate; hidden and as it were out of ſight of men,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:037441_0007_100D8D6C367BE810"/>tho' not out of the world: which ſhews that her wonted viſibility was not eſſential to the being of a true church in the judgment of the Holy Ghoſt; ſhe being as true a church in the wilderneſs, though not as viſible and luſtrous, as when ſhe was in her former ſplendor of profeſſion. In this ſtate many attempts ſhe made to return, but the waters were yet too high, and her way blocked up, and many of her excellent children in ſeveral nations and centuries fell by the cruelty of ſuperſtition, becauſe they would not fall from their faithfulneſs to the truth.</p>
                  <p>The laſt age did ſet ſome ſteps towards it, both as to doctrine, worſhip, and practice. But practice quickly fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for wickedneſs flowed in a little time, as well among the profeſſors of the reformation, as thoſe they reformed from; ſo that by the fruits of converſation they were not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. And the children of the reformers, if not the reformers themſelves, betook themſelves very early to earthly policy and power to uphold and carry on their reformation that had been begun with ſpiritual weapons; which I have often thought has been one of the greateſt reaſons the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation made no better progreſs, as to the life and ſoul of religion: for whilſt the reformers were lowly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-minded, and truſted in God, and looked to Him, and lived in his fear, and conſulted not with fleſh and blood, nor ſought deliverance in their own way, there were daily added to the church ſuch as, one might reaſonably ſay, ſhould be ſaved. For they were not ſo careful to be ſafe from perſecution, as to be faithful under it.</p>
                  <p>Being more concerned to ſpread the truth by their faith and patience in tribulation, than to get the worldly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of their hands that inflicted their ſufferings upon them; and it will be well, if the Lord ſuffer them not to fall by the very ſame way they took to ſtand. In doctrine they were in ſome things ſhort; in other things, to avoid one extreme, they ran into another: and for worſhip, there was for the generality more of man than God. They owned the Spirit, inſpiration and revelation indeed, and grounded their ſeparation and reformation upon the ſenſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they received from it, in the reading of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth; and this was their plea, The Scripture was the text, the Spirit the interpreter, and that to every one for himſelf. But yet there was too much of human invention, tradition and art, that remained both in praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of worldly authority and worldly greatneſs in their
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:037441_0008_100D8D6DCEDC1F78"/>miniſters, eſpecially in this kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, and ſome parts of Germany. God was therefore pleaſed, among us, to ſhift from veſſel to veſſel: and the next remove hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the miniſtry, ſo that they were more ſtrict in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, devout in praying, and zealous for keeping the Lord's day, and catechiſing of children and ſervants, and repeating at home in their families what they had heard in publick.</p>
                  <p>But even as theſe grew into power, they were not only for whipping ſome out, but others into the temple: and they appeared rigid in their ſpirits, rather than ſevere in their lives, and more for a party, than for piety: which brought forth another people, that were yet more retired and ſelect. They would not communicate at large, or in common with others; but formed churches among themſelves of ſuch as could give ſome account of their converſion at leaſt, of very promiſing experiences of the work of God's grace upon their hearts, and under mutual agreements and covenants of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip they kept together. Theſe people were ſomewhat of a ſofter temper, and ſeemed to recommend religion by the charms of its love, mercy, and goodneſs, rather than by the terrors of its judgments and puniſhment; by which the former party would have terrified people into Religion.</p>
                  <p>They alſo allowed greater liberty to prophecy than thoſe before them; for they admitted any member to ſpeak or pray, as well as their paſtor (whom they always choſe, and not the civil magiſtrate). If ſuch found any thing preſſing upon them to either duty, even without the diſtinction of clergy or laity; perſons of any trade, be it never ſo low and mechanical. But alas! even theſe people ſuffered great loſs. for taſting of worldly empire, and the favour of princes, and the gain that enſued, they degenerated but too much. For though they had cried down national churches, and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and maintenance too, ſome of them, when it was their own turn to be tried, fell under the weight of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage, got into profitable parſonages too much, and outlived and contradicted their own principles: and, which was yet worſe, turned ſome of them abſolute perſecutors of other men for God's ſake, that but ſo lately came themſelves out of the furnace; which drove many a ſtep farther, and that was into the water. Another baptiſm, as believing they were not ſcripturally baptiſed; and hoping to find that preſence and power of God, in ſubmitting to that ordinance, which they deſired and wanted.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people made alſo profeſſion of neglecting, if not
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:037441_0009_100D8D6FBA6EA9F8"/>renouncing and cenſuring, not only the neceſſity, but uſe of all human learning, as to the miniſtry; and all other qualifications to it, beſides the helps and gifts of the Spirit of God, and thoſe natural and common to men; and for a time they ſeemed, like John of old, a burning and a ſhining light, to other ſocieties.</p>
                  <p>They were very diligent, plain and ſerious, ſtrong in ſcripture, and bold in profeſſion, bearing much reproach and contradiction: but that which others fell by proved their hurt. For worldly power ſpoiled them too; who had enough of it to try them, what they would do if they had more; and they reſted alſo too much upon their watery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, inſtead of paſſing on more fully to the Fire and Holy Ghoſt, which was his baptiſm who came with a <q>fan in his hand, that he might throughly (and not in part only) purge his floor,</q> and take away the droſs and the tin of his people, and make a man finer than gold. Withal, they grew high, rough, and ſelf-righteous, oppoſing further attainment; too much forgetting the day of their infancy and littleneſs, which gave them ſomething of a real beauty; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that many left them, and all viſible churches and ſocieties. and wandered up and down as ſheep without a ſhepherd, and as doves without their mates; ſeeking their beloved, but could not find him, as their ſouls deſired to know him; whom their ſouls loved above their chiefeſt joy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people were called Seekers by ſome, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Love by others; becauſe, as they came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one another, they ſometimes met together, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally to pray or preach, at appointed times and places, in their own wills, as in times paſt they were accuſtomed to do; but waited together in ſilence, and as any thing roſe in any one of their minds, that they thought ſavoured of a divine ſpring, ſo they ſometimes ſpoke. But ſo it was, that ſome of them not keeping in humility, and in the fear of God. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the abundance of revelation, were exalted above meaſure, and for want of ſtaying their minds in an humble depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him that opened their underſtandings to ſee great things in his law, they run out in their own imaginations, and mixing them with thoſe divine openings, brought ſorth a monſtrous birth, to the ſcandal of thoſe that feared God, and waited daily in the temple. not made with hands, for the conſolation of Iſrael; the Jew inward, and Circumciſion in ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>This people obtained the name of Ranters from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:037441_0010_100D8D71C3649378"/>diſcourſes and practices. For they interpreted Chriſt's fulfilling of the law for us, to be a diſcharging of us from any obligation and duty the law required, inſtead of the condemnation of the law for ſins paſt, upon faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that now it was no ſin to do that which before it was a ſin to commit; the ſlaviſh fear of the law being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by Chriſt, and all things good that man did, if he did but do them with the mind and perſuaſion that it was ſo. Inſomuch that divers fell into groſs and enormous practices; pretending in excuſe thereof, that they could, without evil, commit the ſame act which was ſin in another to do; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſtinguiſhing between the action and the evil of it, by the direction of the mind and intention in the doing of it. Which was to make ſin ſuper-abound by the aboundings of grace, and to turn from the grace of God into wantonneſs, a ſecurer way of ſinning than before: as if Chriſt came not to take away ſin, but that we might ſin more freely at his coſt, and with leſs danger to ourſelves. I ſay, this enſnared divers, and brought them to an utter and lamentable loſs, as to their eternal ſtate; and they grew very troubleſome to the better ſort of people, and furniſhed the looſer with an occaſion to prophane.</p>
                  <p>It was about that very ſame time, as you may ſee in the enſuing annals, that the eternal, wiſe, and good God was pleaſed, in his infinite love, to honour and viſit this benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bewildered nation with his glorious day-ſpring from on high; yea with a moſt ſure and certain ſound of the word of light and life, through the teſtimony of a choſen veſſel, to an effectual and bleſſed purpoſe, can many thouſands ſay, "Glory be to the name of the Lord for ever."</p>
                  <p>For as it reached the conſcience, and broke the heart, and brought many to a ſenſe and ſearch; ſo what people had been vainly ſeeking without, with much pains and coſt, they by this miniſtry found within; where it was they wanted what they ſought for, viz. the right way to peace with God. For they were directed to the light of Jeſus Chriſt within them, as the Seed and Leaven of the kingdom of God; near all, becauſe in all, and God's talent to all. A faithful and true witneſs and juſt monitor in every boſom. The gift and grace of God to life and ſalvation, that appears to all, though few regard it. This, the traditional chriſtian. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of himſelf, and ſtrong in his own will and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and overcome with blind zeal and paſſion, either deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed as a low and common thing, or oppoſed as a novelty,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:037441_0011_100D8D745E58C898"/>under many hard names and opprobrious terms; denying, in his ignorant and angry mind, any freſh manifeſtation of God's power and Spirit in man in theſe days, though never more needed to make true chriſtians: not u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>like thoſe Jews of old, that rejected the Son of God at the very ſame time that they blindly profeſſed to wait for the Meſſiah to come; becauſe, alas, he appeared not among them according to their carnal mind and expectation.</p>
                  <p>This brought forth many abuſive books, which filled the greater ſort with envy, and leſſer with rage, and made the way and progreſs of this bleſſed teſtimony ſtrait and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row indeed to thoſe that received it. However, God owned his own work, and this teſtimony did effectually reach, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, comfort, and eſtabliſh the weary and heavy laden, the hungry and thirſty, the poor and needy, the mournful and ſick of many maladies, that had ſpent all upon phyſicians of no value, and waited for relief from heaven, help only from above: ſeeing, upon a ſerious trial of all things, nothing elſe would do but Chriſt himſelf, the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a touch of his garment, and help from his hand, who cured the poor woman's iſſue, raiſed the centurion's ſervant, the widow's ſon, the ruler's daughter, and Peter's mother, and, like her they no ſooner felt his power and efficacy upon their ſouls, but they gave up to obey him in a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to his power, and with reſigned wills and faithful hearts, through all mockings, contradictions, beatings, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and many other jeopardies that attended them for his bleſſed name's ſake.</p>
                  <p>And truly, they were very many and very great; ſo that in all human probability they muſt have been ſwallowed up quick of the proud and boiſterous waves that ſwelled and beat againſt them; but that the God of all their tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was with them in his glorious authority, ſo that the hills often fled, and the mountains melted before the power that filled them; working mightily for them, as well as in them, one ever following the other. By which they ſaw plainly, to their exceeding great confirmation and comfort, <q>that all things were poſſible with him with whom they had to do.</q> And that the more that which God required ſeemed to croſs man's wiſdom, and expoſe, them to man's wrath, the more God appeared to help and carry them through all to his glory: inſomuch that if ever any people could ſay in truth, <q>Thou art our ſun and our ſhield, our rock and ſanctuary, and by thee we have leaped over a
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:037441_0012_100D8D75F7AEB708"/>wall, and by thee we have run through a troop, and by thee we have put the armies of the aliens to flight,</q> theſe people had right to ſay it. And as God had delivered their ſouls of the weariſome burthens of ſin and vanity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched their poverty of ſpirit, and ſatisfied their great hunger and thirſt after eternal righteouſneſs, and filled them with the good things of his own houſe, and made them ſtewards of his manifold gifts; ſo they went forth to all quarters of theſe nations, to declare to the inhabitants thereof, what God had done for them; what they had found, and where and how they had found it; viz. the way to peace with God: invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to come and ſee and taſte for themſelves, the truth of what they declared unto them.</p>
                  <p>And as their teſtimony was to the principle of God in man, the precious pearl and leaven of the kingdom, as the only bleſſed means appointed of God to quicken, convince, and ſanctify man; ſo they opened to them what it was in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and what it was given to them for: how they might know it from their own ſpirit, and that of the ſubtil appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the evil one, and what it would do for all thoſe, whoſe minds are turned off from the vanity of the world, and its lifeleſs ways and teachers, and adhere to this bleſſed light in themſelves, which diſcovers and condemns ſin in all its appearances, and ſhews how to overcome it, if minded and obeyed in its holy manifeſtations and convictions: giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to ſuch to avoid and reſiſt thoſe things that do not pleaſe God, and to grow ſtrong in love, faith, and good works: that ſo man, whom ſin hath made as a wilderneſs, over-run with briars and thorns, might become as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, cultivated by his divine power, and repleniſhed with the moſt virtuous and beautiful plants of God's own right-hand planting, to his eternal praiſe.</p>
                  <p>But theſe experimental preachers of glad tidings of God's truth and kingdom could not run when they lift, or pray or preach when they pleaſed, but as Chriſt their Redeemer prepared and moved them by his own bleſſed Spirit, for which they waited in their ſervices and meetings, and ſpoke as that gave them utterance, and which was as thoſe having authority, and not like the dreaming, dry, and formal Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees. And ſo it plainly appeared to the ſerious-minded, whoſe ſpiritual eye the Lord Jeſus had in any meaſure open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that to one was given the word of exhortation, to another the word of reproof, to another the word of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:037441_0013_100D8D780B521DF8"/>and all by the ſame Spirit and in the good order thereof, to the convincing and edifying of many.</p>
                  <p>And truly they waxed ſtrong and bold through faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and by the power and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus became very fruitful; thouſands, in a ſhort time, being turned to the truth through their teſtimony in miniſtry and ſufferings, inſomuch as in moſt counties, and many of the conſiderable towns of England, meetings were ſettled, and daily there were added ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. For they were diligent to plant and to water, and the Lord bleſſed their labours with an exceeding great increaſe, notwithſtanding all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made to their bleſſed progreſs, by falſe rumours, calumnies, and bitter perſecutions; not only from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the earth, but from every one that liſted to injure and abuſe them: ſo that they ſeemed indeed to be as poor ſheep appointed to the ſlaughter, and as a people killed all the day long.</p>
                  <p>It were fitter for a volume than a preface, but ſo much as to repeat the contents of their cruel ſufferings from profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors as well as from prophane, and from magiſtrates as well as the rabble; ſo that it may well be ſaid of this abuſed and deſpiſed people, they went forth weeping, and ſowed in tears, bearing teſtimony to the precious ſeed, the ſeed of the kingdom, which ſtands not in words, the fineſt, the higheſt that man's wit can uſe, but in power; the power of Chriſt Jeſus, to whom God the Father hath given all power in heaven and in earth, that he might rule angels above, and men below; who impowered them, as their work witneſſeth, by the many that were turned through their miniſtry from darkneſs to the light, and out of the broad into the narrow way, bringing people to a weighty, ſerious, and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; the practice of that doctrine which they taught.</p>
                  <p>And as without this ſecret divine power there is no quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and regenerating of dead ſouls, ſo the want of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating and begetting power and life is the cauſe of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fruit that the many miniſtries that have been, and are in the world bring forth. O that both miniſters and people were ſenſible of this! My ſoul is often troubled for them, and ſorrow and mourning compaſs me about for their ſakes. O that they were wiſe! O that they would conſider and lay to heart the things that truly and ſubſtantially make for their laſting peace!</p>
                  <p>Two things are to be briefly touched upon, the doctrine they taught, and the example they led among all people. I
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:037441_0014_100D8D7A81B001C0"/>have already touched upon their fundamental principle, which is as the corner ſtone of their fabrick: and to ſpeak eminently and properly, their characteriſtick, or main di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing point or principle, viz. the light of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as God's gift for man's ſalvation. This, I ſay, is as the root of the goodly tree of doctrines that grew and branched out from it, which I ſhall now mention in their natural and experimental order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, repentance from dead works to ſerve the living God. Which comprehends three operations. Firſt, A ſight of ſin. Secondly, A ſenſe and godly ſorrow for it. Thirdly, An amendment for the time to come. This was the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they preached and preſſed, and a natural reſult from the principle they turned all people unto. For of light came ſight; and of ſight came ſenſe and ſorrow; and of ſenſe and ſorrow, came amendment of life: which doctrine of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance leads to juſtification; that is, forgiveneſs of the ſins that are paſt through Chriſt, the alone propitiation; and the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification or purgation of the ſoul from the defiling nature and habits of ſin preſent; which is juſtification in the complete ſenſe of that word; comprehending both juſtification from the guild of the ſins that are paſt, as if they had never been cominitted, through the love and mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus; and the creature's being made inwardly juſt through the cleanſing and ſanctifying power and Spirit of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the ſoul; which is commonly called ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>From hence ſprang a ſecond doctrine they were led to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, as the mark of the prize of the high calling of all true Chriſtians, viz. perfection from ſin, according to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth, which teſtify it to be the end of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the nature of his kingdom, and for which his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was given. But they never held a perfection in wiſdom and glory in this life, or from natural infirmities or death, as ſome have with a weak or ill mind imagined and inſinuated againſt them.</p>
                  <p>This they called a redeemed ſtate, regeneration, or the new birth: teaching every where according to their foundation, that without this work were known, there was no inheriting the kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>Third, to an acknowledgement of eternal rewards and puniſhment, as they have good reaſon; for elſe of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, certainly they muſt be the moſt miſerable: who for about forty years have been exceeding great ſufferers for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:037441_0015_100D8D7C88359000"/>and in ſome caſes treated worſe than the worſt of men, yea as the refuſe and off-ſcouring of all things.</p>
                  <p>This was the purport of their doctrine and miniſtry; which, for the moſt part, is what other profeſſors of Chriſtianity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to hold in words and forms, but not in the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; that has been long loſt by mens departing from that principle and ſeed of life that is in man, and which man has not regarded, but loſt the ſenſe of, and in and by which he can only be quickened in his mind to ſerve the living God in newneſs of life. For as the life of religion was loſt, and the generality lived and worſhipped God after their own wills, and not after the will of God, nor the mind of Chriſt, which ſtood in the works and fruits of the Holy Spirit; ſo that which they preſſed was not notion but experience, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality but godlineſs; as being ſenſible in themſelves, through the work of God's righteous judgments, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs no man ſhould ever ſee the Lord with comfort.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe doctrines, and out of them, as the larger branches, there ſprang forth ſeveral particular doctrines, that did exemplify and further explain the truth and efficacy of the general doctrine before obſerved in their lives and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Communion and loving one another. This is a noted mark in the mouth of all ſorts of people concerning them. "They will meet, they will help and ſtick one to another." Whence it is common to hear ſome ſay, <q>Look how the Quakers love and take care of one another.</q> Others leſs moderate will ſay, "The Quakers love none but themſelves;" and if loving one another, and haying an intimate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in religion, and conſtant care to meet to worſhip God and help one another, be any mark of primitive chriſtianity, they had it, bleſſed be the Lord, in an ample manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To love enemies: this they both taught and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed: for they did not only refuſe to be revenged for injuries done them, and condemned it as of an unchriſtian ſpirit, but they did freely forgive, yea help and relieve, thoſe that had been cruel to them, when it was in their power to have been even with them; of which many and ſingular inſtances might be given: endeavouring, through patience, to overcome all injuſtice and oppreſſion, and preaching this doctrine as chriſtian for others to follow.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The ſufficiency of truth-ſpeaking, according to Chriſt's own form of words, of yea, yea, and nay, nay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong chriſtians, without Wearing, both from Chriſt's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:037441_0016_100D8D7E7B1AA938"/>prohibition to "ſwear at all," Mat. v. and for that they being under the tie and bond of truth in themſelves, there was both no neceſſity for an oath, and it would be a reproach to their chriſtian veracity to aſſure their truth by ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way of ſpeaking: but offering at the ſame time to be puniſhed to the full for falſe ſpeaking, as others for perjury, if ever guilty of it; and hereby they exclude, with all true, all falſe and profane ſwearing; for which the land did and doth mourn, and the great God was and is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle offended with it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Not fighting but ſuffering is another teſtimony pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this people: they affirm that Chriſtianity teacheth people <q>to beat their ſwords into plough-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks, and to learn war no more, that ſo the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf, and nothing that deſtroys be entertained in the hearts of people;</q> exhorting them to employ their zeal againſt ſin, and turn their anger againſt ſatan, and no longer war one againſt another; becauſe all wars and fightings come of mens own hearts luſts, according to the apoſtle James, and not of the meek Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, who is captain of another warfare, and which is carried on with other weapons. Thus, as truth-ſpeaking ſucceeded ſwearing, ſo faith and truth ſucceeded fighting, in the doctrine and practice of this people. Nor ought they for this to be obnoxious to civil government, ſince if they cannot fight for it, neither can they fight againſt it; which is no mean ſecurity to the ſtate: nor is it reaſonable that people ſhould be blamed for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more for others than they can do for themſelves. And Chriſtianity ſet aſide, if the coſts and fruits of war were well conſidered, peace, with its inconveniencies, is generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. But though they were not for fighting, they were for ſubmitting to government; and that not only for fear, but for conſcience ſake, where government doth not interfere with conſcience: believing it to be an ordinance of God, and where it is juſtly adminiſtred, a great benefit to mankind: though it has been their lot, through blind zeal in ſome, and intereſt in others, to have felt the ſtrokes of it with greater weight and rigour than any other perſuaſion in this age; whilſt they, of all others (religion ſet aſide) have given the civil magiſtrate the leaſt occaſion of trouble in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his office.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Another part of the character of this people is, they refuſe to pay tythes, or maintenance to a national miniſtry,
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:037441_0017_100D8D8129AE2E68"/>and that for two reaſons; the one is, that they believe all compelled maintenance, even to goſpel miniſters, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe expreſsly contrary to Chriſt's command, who ſaid, "Freely you have received, freely give:" at leaſt, that the maintenance of goſpel miniſters ſhould be free and not forced. The other reaſon of their refuſal is, becauſe thoſe miniſters are not goſpel ones, in that the Holy Ghoſt is not their foundation, but human arts and parts: ſo that it is not matter of humour or fullenneſs, but pure conſcience towards God, that they cannot help to ſupport national miniſters where they dwell, which are but too much and too viſibly become ways of worldly advantage and preferment.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Not to reſpect perſons, was another of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and practices, for which they were often buffeted and abuſed. They affirmed it to be ſinful to give flattering ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or to uſe vain geſtures and compliments of reſpect; though to virtue and authority they ever made a difference, but after their plain and homely manner, yet ſincere and ſubſtantial way; well remembering the example of Morde cai and Elihu, but more eſpecially the command of their Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, who forbad his followers to call men Rabbi, which implies Lord and Maſter, alſo the faſhionable greetings and ſalutations of thoſe times; that ſo ſelf-love and honour, to which the proud mind of man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, in his fallen eſtate, might not be indulged but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked.</p>
                  <p>They alſo uſed the plain language of Thou and Thee to a ſingle perſon, whatever was his degree among men. And indeed the wiſdom of God was much ſeen, in bringing forth this people in ſo plain an appearance; for it was a cloſe and diſtinguiſhing teſt upon the ſpirit of thoſe they came among; ſhewing their inſides and what predominated, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their high and great profeſſion of religion. This, among the reſt, ſounded ſo harſh to many of them, and they took it ſo ill, that they would ſay, <q>Thou me, thou my dog: if thou thoueſt me, I'll thou thy teeth down thy throat,</q> forgetting the language they uſe to God in their own prayers, and the common ſtyle of the Scriptures, and that it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and eſſential propriety of ſpeech: and what good had their religion done them, who were ſo ſenſibly touch'd with indignation for the uſe of this plain, honeſt, and true ſpeech.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. They recommended ſilence by their example, having very few words upon all occaſions: they were at a word in dealing; nor could their cuſtomers many words tempt them
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:037441_0018_100D8D83901BEAA8"/>from it; having more regard for truth than cuſtom, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample than gain, they ſought ſolitude; but when in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they would neither uſe nor willingly hear unneceſſary as well as unlawful diſcourſes; whereby they preſerved their minds pure and undiſturbed from unprofitable thoughts and diverſions: nor could they humour the cuſtom of <q>good night, good morrow, God ſpeed;</q> for they knew the night was good, and the day was good, without wiſhing of either; and that in the other expreſſion, the holy name of God was too lightly and unthinkingly uſed, and therefore taken in vain. Beſides they were words and wiſhes of courſe, and are uſually as little meant, as are love and ſervice in the cuſtom of cap and knee; and ſuperfluity in thoſe as well as in other things was burthenſome to them, and therefore they did not only decline to uſe them, but ſound themſelves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preſt to reprove the practice.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon they forbore drinking to people, or pledging of them, as the manner of the world is: a practice that is not only unneceſſary, but they thought evil in the tendencies of it; being a provocation to drinking more than did people good, as well as that it was in itſelf vain and heatheniſh.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Their way of marriage is peculiar to them, and is a diſtinguiſhing practice from all other ſocieties profeſſing chriſtianity. They ſay that marriage is an ordinance of God, and that God only can rightly join man and woman in marriage. Therefore they uſe neither prieſt nor magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, but the man and woman concerned take each other as huſband and wife in the preſence of divers credible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <q>promiſing unto each other, with God's aſſiſtance, to be loving and faithful in that relation till death ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them.</q> But, antecedent to all this, they firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to the monthly meeting for the affairs of the church where they reſide; there declaring their intentions to take one another as man and wife, if the ſaid meeting have nothing material to object againſt it. They are conſtantly alked the neceſſary queſtions, as in caſe of parents or guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, if they have acquainted them with their intention, and have their conſent, &amp;c. The method of the meeting is to take a minute thereof, and to appoint proper perſons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their converſation and clearneſs from all others, and whether they have diſcharged their duty to their parents or guardian, and make report thereof the next monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; where the ſame parties are deſired to give their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:037441_0019_100D8D857A08EB18"/>In caſe it appears they proceeded orderly, the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſes their propoſal, and ſo records it in their meeting-book; and in caſe the woman be a widow and hath chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, due care is there taken, that proviſion alſo be made by her for the orphans before the ſaid marriage; adviſing the parties concerned to appoint a convenient time and place, and to give fitting notice to their relations, and ſuch friends and neighbours as they deſire ſhould be the witueſſes of their marriage: where they take one another by the hand, and by name promiſing reciprocally after the manner before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Of all which proceedings a narrative, in a way of certificate, is made, to which the ſaid parties firſt ſet their hands, thereby making it their act and deed; and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the relations, ſpectators, and auditors ſet their names as witneſſes of what they ſaid and ſigned. Which certiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is afterwards regiſtered in the record belonging to the meeting where the marriage is ſolemnized. Which regular method has been, as it deſerves, adjudged in courts of law a good marriage, where it has been diſputed and conteſted for want of the accuſtomed formality of prieſt and ring. &amp;c. Which ceremonies they have refuſed, not out of humour, but conſcience reaſonably grounded, inaſmuch as no ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-example tells us, that the prieſt had any other part of old time than that of a witneſs among the reſt, before whom the Jews uſed to take one another: and therefore this people look upon it as an impoſition to advance the power and profits of the clergy. And for the uſe of the ring, it is enough to ſay, that it was an heathen and vain cuſtom, and never in practice among the people of God, Jews or primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. The words of the uſual form, as "With my body I thee worſhip." &amp;c. are hardly defenſible: in ſhort, they are more careful, exact, and regular than any form now uſed, and it is free of the inconveniencies other methods are attended with. Their care and checks being ſo many, and ſuch as no clandeſtine marriages can be performed among them.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. It may not be unfit to ſay ſomething here of their births and burials, which make up ſo much of the pomp and ſolemnity of too many called Chriſtians. For births, the parents name their own children, which is uſually ſome days after they are born, in the preſence of the midwife (if ſhe can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:037441_0020_100D8D871962E2D8"/>in aproper book in the monthly meeting, to which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents belong; avoiding the accuſtomed ceremonies and feſtivals.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Their burials are performed with the ſame ſimplicity. If the corpſe of the deceaſed be near any public meeting-place, it is uſually carried thither, for the more convenient reception of thoſe that accompany it to the ground they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in; and it ſo falls out ſometimes, that while the meeting is gathering for the burial, ſome or other have a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, for the ſake of the people there met together: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the body is borne away by the young men, or thoſe that are of their neighbourhood, or that were moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of the deceaſed party; the corpſe being in a plain coffin, without any covering or furniture upon it. At the ground, they pauſe ſome time before they put the body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its grave, that if any one there ſhould have any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to exhort the people, they may not be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the relations may the more retiredly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly take their laſt leave of the corpſe of their departed kindred, and the ſpectators have a ſenſe of mortality, by the occaſion then given them to reflect upon their own lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. Otherwiſe, they have no ſet rites or ceremonies on thoſe occaſions; neither do the kindred of the deceaſed ever wear mourning; they looking upon it as a worldly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and piece of pomp; and that what mourning is fit for a chriſtian to have at the departure of a beloved relation or friend, ſhould be worn in the mind, which is only ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the loſs, and the love they had to them, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, to be outwardly expreſſed by a reſpect to their advice, and care of thoſe they have left behind them, and their love of that they loved. Which conduct of theirs, tho' unmodiſh or unfaſhionable, leaves nothing of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things neglected or undone; and as they aim at no more, ſo that ſimplicity of life is what they obſerve with great ſatisfaction, though it ſometimes happens not to be without the mockeries of the vain world they live in.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things gave them a rough and diſagreeable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the generality; who thought them turners of the world upſide-down, as indeed in ſome ſenſe they were; but in no other than that wherein Paul was ſo charged, viz. to bring things back into their primitive and right order again. For theſe and ſuch like practices of theirs were not the reſult of humour, as ſome have fancied, but a fruit of inward ſenſe, which God, through his fear, had begotten in them. They
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:037441_0021_100D8D893A926E38"/>did not conſider how to contradict the world, or diſtinguiſh themſelves; being none of their buſineſs, as it was not their intereſt, no, it was not the reſult of their conſultation, or a framed deſign to declare or recommend ſchiſm or novelty. But God having given them a ſight of themſelves, they ſaw the whole world in the ſame glaſs of truth; and ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the affections and paſſions of men, and the riſe and tendency of things. What gratified <q>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world;</q> and from thence ſprang in that night of darkneſs and apoſtacy, which hath been over people, through their degeneracy from the light and Spirit of God, theſe and many other vain cuſtoms; which are ſeen by the heavenly day of Chriſt, which dawns in the ſoul, to be, either wrong in their original, or, by time or abuſe, hurtful in their practice. And though theſe things ſeemed trivial to ſome, and rendered this people ſtingy and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch perſons opinions, there was and is more in them than they were aware of. It was not very eaſy to our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive friends to make themſelves ſights and ſpectacles, and the ſcorn and deriſion of the world; which they eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw muſt be the conſequence of ſo unfaſhionable a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it. But herein was the wiſdom of God ſeen, in the fooliſhneſs of theſe things. Firſt, That they diſcovered the ſatisfaction and concern that people had in and for the faſhions of this world, notwithſtanding their pretences to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; in that any diſappointment about them came ſo very near them, that the greateſt honeſty, virtue, wiſdom, and ability, were unwelcome without them. Secondly, It ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and proſitably divided converſation; for making their ſociety uneaſy to their relations and acquaintance, it gave them the opportunity of more retirement and ſolitude, wherein they met with better company, even the Lord God their Redeemer, and grew ſtrong in his love, power, and wiſdom, and were thereby better qualified for his ſervice, and the ſucceſs abundantly ſhewed it; bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And though they were not great and learned in the eſteem of this world (for then they had not wanted followers upon their own credit and authority) yet they were generally of the moſt ſober of the ſeveral perſuaſions they were in, and of the moſt repute for religion; and many of them of good capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſubſtance, and account among men.</p>
                  <p>And alſo ſome among them neither wanted for parts,
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:037441_0022_100D8D8B9882E318"/>learning nor eſtate; though then, as of old, not many wiſe, nor noble, &amp;c. were called, or at leaſt received the heavenly call; becauſe of the croſs that attended the profeſſion of it in ſincerity: but neither do parts or learning make men the better Chriſtans, though the better orators and diſputants; and it is the ignorance of people about the divine gift, that cauſes that vulgar and miſchievous miſtake. Theory and practice, expreſſion and enjoyment, words and life, are two things. Oh! 'tis the penitent, the reformed, the lowly, the watchful, the ſelf-denying and holy ſoul that is the Chriſtian; and that frame is the ſruit and work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the life of Jeſus; whoſe life, though hid in God the Father, is ſhed abroad in the hearts of them that truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Oh! that people did but know this to cleanſe them, to circumciſe them, to quicken them, and to make them new creatures indeed; re-created or regenerated after Chriſt Jeſus unto good works: that they might live to God, and not to themſelves; and offer up living prayers, and living praiſes, to the living God, through his own living Spirit, in which he is only to be worſhipped in this goſpel-day. Oh! that they that read me could but feel me; for my heart is affected with this merciful viſitation of the Father of lights and ſpints to this poor nation, and the whole world through the ſame teſtimony. Why ſhould the inhabitants thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it? Why ſhould they loſe the bleſſed benefit of it? Why ſhould they not turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and ſay from the heart, "Speak, Lord, for now thy poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hear?" Oh! that thy will may be done, thy great, thy good and holy will, on earth as it is in heaven: do it in us, do it upon us, do what thou wilt with us; for we are thine, and deſire to glorify thee our Creator, both for that, and becauſe thou art our Redeemer, for thou art redeeming us from the earth, from the vanities and pollutions of it, to be a peculiar people unto thee. Oh! this were a brave day for England, if ſo ſhe could ſay in truth. But alas, the caſe is otherwiſe, for which ſome of thine inhabitants, O land of my nativity! have mourned over thee with bitter wailing and lamentation. Their heads have been indeed as waters, and their eyes as fountains of tears, becauſe of thy tranſgreſſion and ſtiffneckedneſs; becauſe thou wilt not hear, and fear, and return to the Rock, even thy Rock, O Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land! from whence thou wert hewn.

Oh! be thou awakened, leſt Jeruſalem's judgments do ſwiftly overtake thee, becauſe of Jeruſalem's ſins that abound in thee. For ſhe abounded in formality, but made void the weighty things of God's law, as thou daily doſt.</p>
                  <p>She withſtood the Son of God in the fleſh, and thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteſt the Son of God in the Spirit. He would have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ſhe would not! ſo would he have gathered thee out of thy lifeleſs profeſſion, and have brought thee to inherit ſubſtance, to have known his power and kingdom, for which he often knocked within, by his Grace and Spirit, and without, by his ſervants and witneſſes; but thou wouldſt not be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but on the contrary, as Jeruſalem of old perſecuted the manifeſtation of the Son of God in the fleſh, and crucified him, and whipped and impriſoned his ſervants, ſo haſt thou, O land, crucified to thyſelf afreſh the Lord of life and glory, and done deſpite to his Spirit of grace; ſlighting the fatherly viſitation, and perſecuting the bleſſed diſpenſers of it by thy laws and magiſtrates; though they have early and late pleaded with thee in the power and Spirit of the Lord, in love and meekneſs, that thou mighteſt know the Lord, and ſerve him, and become the glory of all lands.</p>
                  <p>But thou haſt evilly entreated and requited them. Thou haſt ſet at nought all their counſel, and wouldſt have none of their reproof, as thou ſhouldſt have done. Their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was too ſtrait, and their qualifications were too mean for thee to receive them, who, like the Jews of old, that cried, <q>Is not this the carpenter's ſon? and are not his brethren among us? which of the ſcribes, of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (the orthodox) believe in him?</q> Propheſying their fall in a year or two, and making and executing of ſevere laws to bring it to paſs, by endeavouring to terrify them out of their holy way, or deſtroying them for abiding faithful to it. But thou haſt ſeen how many governments that roſe againſt them, and determined their downfal, have been overturned and extinguiſhed, and that they are ſtill preſerved, and become a great and a conſiderable people among the middle ſort of thy numerous inhabitants. And notwithſtanding the many difficulties, without and within, which they have laboured under, ſince the Lord God Eternal firſt gathered them, they are an increaſing people, the Lord ſtill adding unto them, in divers parts, ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, if they perſevere to the end. And to thee were they and are they lifted up as a
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:037441_0024_100D8D8F34A04A40"/>ſtandard, and as a city ſet upon a hill, and to the nations round about thee, that in their light thou mayeſt come to ſee light, even in Chriſt Jeſus, the light of the world; and therefore thy light and life too, if thou wouldſt but turn from thy many evil ways, and receive and obey it. For in the <q>light of the Lamb muſt the nations of them that are ſaved walk,</q> as the ſcriptures teſtify.</p>
                  <p>Remember, O nation of great profeſſion! how the Lord has waited upon thee ſince the days of reformation, and the many mercies and judgments with which he has pleaded with thee; and awake and ariſe out of thy deep ſleep, and yet hear his word in thy heart, that thou mayeſt live.</p>

Their hearts were rent as well as their garments changed, and they knew the power and work of God upon them. This was ſeen by the great alteration it made, and their ſtricter courſe of life, and more godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that immediately followed upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. They went not forth or preached in their own time or will, but in the will of God, and ſpoke not their own ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died matter, but as they were opened and moved of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. with which they were well acquainted in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; which cannot be expreſſed to carnal men ſo as to give them any intelligible account, for to ſuch it is, as Chriſt ſaid, <q>like the blowing of the wind, which no man knows whence it cometh, or whither it goeth:</q> yet this proof and ſeal went along with their miniſtry, that many were turned from their lifeleſs profeſſions and the evil of their ways, to the knowledge of God and an holy life, as thouſands can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as they freely received what they had to ſay from the Lord, ſo they freely adminiſtered it to others.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The bent and ſtreſs of their miniſtry was converſion to God, regeneration, and holineſs; not ſchemes of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and verbal creeds, or new forms of worſhip; but a leaving off in religion the ſuperſluous, and reducing the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious and formal part, and preſſing earneſtly the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:037441_0025_100D8D917AF25CD0"/>the neceſſary and profitable part; as all upon a ſerious reflection muſt and do acknowledge.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. They directed people to a principle, by which all that they aſſerted, preached, and exhorted others to, might be wrought in them, and known, through experience, to them to be true; which is a high and diſtinguiſhing mark of the truth of their miniſtry; both that they knew what they ſaid, and were not afraid of coming to the teſt. For as they were bold from certainty, ſo they required confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity upon no human authority, but upon conviction, and the conviction of this principle, which they aſſerted was in them that they preached unto, and unto that directed them, that they might examine and prove the reality of thoſe things which they had affirmed of it, and its manifeſtation and work in man. And this is more than the many mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries in the world pretend to. They declare of religion; ſay many things true in words, of God, Chriſt, and the Spirit; of holineſs and heaven; that all men ſhould repent and mend their lives, or they will go to hell, &amp;c. but which of them all pretend to ſpeak of their own knowledge and experience? or ever directed men to a divine principle or agent, placed of God in man, to help him? and how to know it, and wait to feel its power to work that good and acceptable will of God in them?</p>
                  <p>Some of them indeed have ſpoke of the Spirit, and the operations of it to ſanctification, and performance of worſhip to God; but where and how to find it, and wait in it to perform, was yet as a myſtery reſerved for this further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reformation. So that this people did not only in words more than equally preſs repentance, converſion, and holineſs, but did it knowingly and experimentally; and directed thoſe to whom they preached to a ſufficient princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and told them where it is, and by what tokens they might know it, and which way they might experience the power and efficacy of it to their ſouls happineſs: which is more than theory and ſpeculations, upon which moſt other miniſtries depend; for here is certainly a bottom upon which man may boldly appear before God in the great day of account.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. They reached to the inward ſtate and condition of people, which is an evidence of the virtue of their principle, and of their miniſtring from it, and not their own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gloſſes, or comments upon ſcripture. For nothing reaches the heart but what is from the heart, or pierces the
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:037441_0026_100D8D9414B7F098"/>conſcience but what comes from a living conſcience; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it hath often happened, where people have under ſecrecy revealed their ſtate or condition to ſome choice friends for advice or eaſe, they have been ſo particularly directed in the miniſtry of this people, that they have challenged their friends with diſcovering their ſecrets, and telling the preachers their caſes; yea, the very thoughts and purpoſes of the hearts of many have been ſo plainly detected, that they have, like Nathaniel, cried out of this inward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Iſrael." And thoſe that have embraced this divine principle, have found this mark of its truth and divinity, that the woman of Samaria did of Chriſt when in the fleſh, to be the Meſſiah, viz. "It had told them all that ever they did;" ſhewed them their inſides, the moſt inward ſecrets of their hearts, and laid judgment to the line, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the plummet; of which thouſands can at this day give in their witneſs. So that nothing has been affirmed by this people of the power and virtue of this heavenly principle, that ſuch as have turned to it have not found true, and more; and that one half had not been told to them of what they have ſeen of the power, purity, wiſdom, mercy, and goodneſs of God herein.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The accompliſhments with which this principle fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even ſome of the meaneſt of this people for their work and ſervice, furniſning ſome of them with an extraordinary underſtanding in divine things, and an admirable fluency and taking way of expreſſion, which gave occaſion to ſome to wonder, ſaying of them, as of their Maſter, "Is not this ſuch a mechanick's ſon? how came he by this learning?" As from thence others took occaſion to ſuſpect and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate they were jeſuits in diſguiſe, who have had the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learned men for an age paſt, though there was not the leaſt ground of truth for any ſuch reflection.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. They came forth low, and deſpiſed and hated, as the primitive chriſtians did, and not by the help of worldly wiſdom or power, as former reformations in part have done; but in all things it may be ſaid this people were brought forth in the croſs, in a contradiction to the ways, worſhip, faſhion, and cuſtoms of this world, yea againſt wind and tide, that ſo no fleſh might glory before God.</p>
                  <p>They could have no deſign to themſelves in this work, thus to expoſe themſelves to ſcorn and abuſe, to ſpend and be ſpent; leaving wife and children, houſe and land, and
<pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:037441_0027_100D8D95A6F01BF0"/>all that can be accounted dear to men, with their lives in their hands, being daily in jeopardy, to declare this primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meſſage, 1 John i. v. revived in their ſpirits by the good Spirit and power of God; viz. <q>That God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all; and that he has ſent his Son a light into the world to enlighten all men in order to ſalvation; and that they that ſay they have fellowſhip with God, and are his children and people, and yet walk in darkneſs, (viz. in diſobedience to the light in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and after the vanity of this world) they lie and do not the truth. But that all ſuch as love the light and bring their deeds to it, and walk in the light, as God is light, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his ſon ſhould cleanſe them from all ſin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Their known great conſtancy and patience in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for their teſtimony, in all the branches of it, and that ſometimes unto death, by beatings, bruiſings, long and crowded impriſonments, and noiſome dungeons. Four of them in New England dying by the hands of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, purely for preaching amongſt that people; beſides baniſhments and exceſſive plunders and ſequeſtrations of their goods and eſtates, almoſt in all parts, not eaſily to be expreſſed, and leſs to be endured, but by thoſe that have the ſupport of a good and glorious cauſe; refuſing deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by any indirect ways and means, as often as it was offered to them.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. That they did not only not ſhew any diſpoſition to revenge, when it was at any time in their power, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave their cruel enemies, ſhewing mercy to thoſe that had none for them.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Their plainneſs with thoſe in authority, not unlike the ancient prophets; not fearing to tell them to their faces of their private and publick ſins, and their prophecies to them of their afflictions and downfal, when in the top of their glory; alſo of ſome national judgments, as of the plague and fire of London, in expreſs terms, and likewiſe particular ones to divers perſecutors, which accordingly overtook them, and which were very remarkable in the places where they dwelt, and in time they may be made publick for the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus, reader, thou ſeeſt this people in thein riſe, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, miniſtry, and progreſs, both their general and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular teſtimony, by which thou mayeſt be informed how and upon what foot they ſprung and became ſo conſiderable
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:037441_0028_100D8D979B29F6D8"/>a people. It remains next that I ſhew alſo their care, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and diſcipline, as a chriſtian and reformed ſociety, that they might be found living up to their own principles and profeſſion; and this the rather, becauſe they have hardly ſuffered more in their character from the unjuſt charge of error, than by the falſe imputation of diſorder; which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny indeed has not failed to follow all the true ſteps that were ever made to reformation, and under which reproach none ſuffered more than the primitive chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that were the honour of chriſtianity, and the great lights and examples of their own and ſucceeding ages.</p>
                  <p>This people increaſing daily both in town and country, an holy care fell upon ſome of the elders among them for the benefit and ſervice of the church. And the firſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their view, after the example of the primitive ſaints, was the exerciſe of charity, to ſupply the neceſſities of the poor, and anſwer the like occaſions: wherefore collections were early and liberally made for that and divers other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the church, and intruſted with faithful men, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and of good report, who were not weary in well-doing; adding often of their own in large proportions, which they never brought to account or deſired ſhould be known, much leſs reſtored to them, that none might want, nor any ſervice be retarded or diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>They were alſo very careful, that every one that belonged to them anſwered their profeſſion in their behaviour among men upon all occaſions; that they lived peaceably, and were in all things good examples. They found themſelves engaged to record their ſufferings and ſervices; and in caſe of marriage, which they could not perform in the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the nation, but among themſelves, they took care that all things were clear between the parties and all others, and it was then rare that any one entertained ſuch inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a perſon on that account, till he or ſhe had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated it ſecretly to ſome very weighty and eminent friends among them, that they might have a ſenſe of the matter; looking to the counſel and unity of their brethren as of great moment to them. But becauſe the charge of the poor, the number of orphans, marriages, ſufferings, and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters multiplied, and that it was good that the churches were in ſome way and method of proceeding in ſuch affairs among them, to the end they might the better correſpond upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, where a member of one meeting might have to do with one of another; it pleaſed the Lord in his wiſdom and
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:037441_0029_100D8D9967D382C8"/>goodneſs to open the underſtanding of the firſt inſtrument of this diſpenſation of life, about a good and orderly way of proceeding; and he felt an holy concern to viſit the churches in perſon throughout this nation, to begin and eſtabliſh it among them; and by his epiſtles the like was done in other nations and provinces abroad, which he alſo afterwards viſited and helped in that ſervice, as ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved when I come to ſpeak of him.</p>
                  <p>Now the care, conduct, and diſcipline, I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and which is now practiſed among this people, is as followeth:
This godly elder, in every county where he travelled, exhorted them, that ſome out of every meeting of worſhip ſhould meet together once in the month, to confer about the wants and occaſions of the church: and as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, ſo thoſe monthly meetings were fewer or more in number in every reſpective county; four or ſix meetings of worſhip uſually making one monthly meeting of buſineſs. And accordingly the brethren met him from place to place, and began the ſaid meetings; viz. <q>For the poor, orphans, orderly walking, integrity to their profeſſion, births, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, burials, ſufferings, &amp;c.</q> And that theſe monthly meetings ſhould in each county make up one quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where the moſt zealous and eminent friends of the county ſhould aſſemble to communicate, adviſe, and help one another, eſpecially when any buſineſs ſeemed difficult, or a monthly meeting was tender of determining a matter.</p>
                  <p>Alſo that theſe quarterly meetings ſhould digeſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the monthly meetings, and prepare one for the county againſt the yearly meeting, in which the quarterly meetings reſolve, which is held yearly in London, where the churches in this nation and other nations and provinces meet, by choſen members of their reſpective counties, both mutually to communicate their church-affairs, and to adviſe and be adviſed in any depending caſe to edification; alſo to provide a requiſite ſtock for the diſcharge of general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for general ſervices in the church, not needful to be here particularized.</p>
                  <p>At theſe meetings any of the members of the churches may come, if they pleaſe, and ſpeak their minds freely in the fear of God to any matter; but the mind of each meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein repreſented is chiefly underſtood, as to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, in the ſenſe delivered by the perſons deputed or choſen for that ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:037441_0030_100D8D9C88E9D088"/>
During their yearly meeting, to which their other meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings refer in their order, and reſolve themſelves, care is taken by a ſelect number, for that ſervice choſen by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly, to draw up the minutes of the ſaid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſeveral matters that have been under conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation therein, to the end that the reſpective quarterly and monthly meetings may be informed of all proceedings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a general exhortation to holineſs, unity and charity: of all which proceedings in yearly, quarterly, and monthly meetings, due record is kept by ſome one appointed for that ſervice, or that hath voluntarily undertaken it. Theſe meetings are opened and uſually concluded in their ſolemn waiting upon God, who is ſometimes graciouſly pleaſed to anſwer them with as ſignal evidences of his love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as in any other of their meetings for worſhip.</p>
                  <p>It is farther to be noted, that, in theſe ſolemn aſſemblies for the church's ſervice, there is no one preſides among them after the manner of the aſſemblies of other people, Chriſt only being their preſident, as he is pleaſed to appear in life and wiſdom in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their capacity or degree, the reſt adhere with a firm unity, not of authority but conviction, which is the divine authority and way of Chriſt's power and ſpirit in his people; making good his bleſſed promiſe, <q>That he would be in the midſt of his, where and whenever they were met together in his name, even to the end of the world.</q> So be it.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be expected I ſhould here ſet down what ſort of authority is exerciſed by this people upon ſuch members of their ſociety as correſpond not in their lives with their profeſſion, and that are refractory to this good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome order ſettled among them; and the rather, becauſe they have not wanted their reproach and ſuffering from ſome tongues upon this occaſion in a plentiful manner.</p>
                  <p>The power they exerciſe is ſuch as Chriſt has given to his own people to the end of the world in the perſons of his diſciples; viz. "To overſee, exhort, reprove," and after long-ſuffering and waiting upon the diſobedient and refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, <q>to diſown them as any more of their communion, or that they will any longer ſtand charged in the ſight and judgment of God or men with their converſation or behaviour as one of them until they repent.</q> The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter about which this authority, in any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going branches of it, is exerciſed, is, firſt, in relation to
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:037441_0031_100D8D9E1EEF2C98"/>common and general practice: and, ſecondly, about thoſe things that more ſtrictly refer to their own character and profeſſion, and diſtinguiſh them from all other profeſſors of chriſtianity; avoiding two extremes upon which many ſplit, viz. perſecution and libertiniſm. A coercive power to whip people into the temple; that ſuch as will not conform, though againſt faith and conſcience, ſhall be puniſhed in their perſons or eſtates; or leaving all looſe and at large as to practice, unaccountable to all but God and the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. To which hurtful extreme nothing has more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, than the abuſe of church-power by ſuch as ſuffer their paſſions and private intereſts to prevail with them to carry it to outward force and corporal puniſhment; a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice they have been taught to diſlike by their extreme ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as well as their known principle for an univerſal liberty of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand they equally diſlike an independency in ſociety; an unaccountableneſs in practice and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the terms of their own communion, and to thoſe that are the members of it. They diſtinguiſh between impoſing any practice that immediately regards faith or worſhip (which is never to be done, nor ſuffered, or ſubmitted unto) and requiring chriſtian compliance with thoſe methods that only reſpect church-buſineſs in its more civil part and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and that regard the diſcreet and orderly maintenance of the character of the ſociety, as a ſober and religious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. In ſhort, what is for the promotion of holineſs and charity, that men may practiſe what they profeſs, live up to their own principles, and not be at liberty to give the lie to their own profeſſion without rebuke. They compel none to them, but oblige thoſe that are of them to walk ſuitably, or they are denied by them: that is all the mark they ſet upon them, and the power they exerciſe, or judge a chriſtian ſociety can exerciſe upon thoſe that are the members of it.</p>
                  <p>The way of their proceedings againſt ſuch as have lapſed or tranſgreſſed is this. He is viſited by ſome of them, and the matter of fact laid home to him, be it any evil practice againſt known and general virtue, or any branch of their particular teſtimony, which he, in common, profeſſeth with them. They labour with him in much love and zeal for the good of his ſoul, the honour of God, and reputation of their profeſſion, to own his fault, and condemn it, in as ample a manner as the evil or ſcandal was given by him;
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:037441_0032_100D8DA06AEF4988"/>which for the moſt part, is performed by ſome written teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony under the party's hand: and if it ſo happen that the party prove refractory, and is not willing to clear the truth they profeſs from the reproach of his or her evil-doing or unfaithfulneſs, they, after repeated intreaties, and due wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a token of repentance, give forth a paper to diſown ſuch a fact, and the party offending; recording the ſame as a teſtimony of their care for the honour of the truth they profeſs.</p>
                  <p>And if he or ſhe ſhall clear their profeſſion and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſincere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly ſorrow for ſo doing, they are received, and looked upon again as members of their communion. For as God, ſo his true people upbraid no man after repentance.</p>
                  <p>This is the account I had to give of the people of God called Quakers, as to their riſe, appearance, principles, and practices in this age of the world, both with reſpect to their faith and worſhip, diſcipline and converſation. And I judge it very proper in this place, becauſe it is to preface the journal of the firſt bleſſed and glorious inſtrument of this work, and for a teſtimony to him in his ſingular qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſervices, in which he abundantly excelled in this his day, and are worthy to be ſet forth as an example to all ſucceeding times, to the glory of the Moſt High God, and for a juſt memorial to that worthy and excellent man, his faithful ſervant and apoſtle to this generation of the world.</p>
                  <p>I am now come to the third head or branch of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, viz. the inſtrumental author. For it is natural for ſome to ſay, Well, here is the people and work, but where and who was the man, the inſtrument; he that in this age was ſent to begin this work and people? I ſhall, as God ſhall enable me, declare who and what he was, not only by report of others, but from my own long and moſt inward converſe and intimate knowledge of him; for which my ſoul bleſſeth God, as it hath often done; and I doubt not, but by that time I have diſcharged myſelf of this part of my preface, my ſerious readers will believe I had good cauſe ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſed inſtrument of and in this day of God, and of whom I am now about to write, was GEORGE FOX, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from another of that name, by that other's addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of younger to his name in all his writings; not that he was ſo in years, but that he was ſo in the truth; but he was alſo a worthy man, witneſs and ſervant of God in his time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:037441_0033_100D8DA20913DE28"/>
But this George Fox was born in Leiceſterſhire, about the year 1624. He deſcended of honeſt and ſufficient pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who endeavoured to bring him up, as they did the reſt of their children, in the way and worſhip of the nation; eſpecially his mother, who was a woman accompliſhed above moſt of her degree in the place where ſhe lived. But from a child he appeared of another frame of mind than the reſt of his brethren; being more religious, inward, ſtill, ſolid, and obſerving, beyond his years, as the anſwers he would give, and the queſtions he would put upon occaſion mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, to the aſtoniſhment of thoſe that heard him, eſpecially in divine things.</p>
                  <p>His mother taking notice of his ſingular temper, and the gravity, wiſdom, and piety that very early ſhone through him, refuſing childiſh and vain ſports and company when very young, ſhe was tender and indulgent over him, ſo that from her he met with little difficulty. As to his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was brought up in country buſineſs; and as he took moſt delight in ſheep, ſo he was very ſkilful in them; an employment that very well ſuited his mind in ſeveral reſpects, both for its innocency and ſolitude; and was a juſt figure of his after miniſtry and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not break in upon his own account, which is by much the beſt that can be given; and therefore deſire, what I can, to avoid ſaying any thing of what is ſaid already, as to the particular paſſages of his coming forth: but, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, when he was ſomewhat above twenty, he left his friends, and viſited the moſt retired and religious people, and ſome there were at that time in this nation, eſpecially in thoſe parts, who waited for the conſolation of Iſrael night and day, as Zacharias, Anna, and good old Simeon did of old time. To theſe he was ſent, and theſe he ſought out in the neighbouring countries, and among them he ſojourned till his more ample miniſtry came upon him.</p>
                  <p>At this time he taught and was an example of ſilence, endeavouring to bring people from ſelf-performances, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and turning to the light of Chriſt within them, and encouraging them to wait in patience to feel the power of it to ſtir in their hearts, that their knowledge and worſhip of God might ſtand in the power of an endleſs life, which was to be found in the light, as it was obeyed in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it in man. <q>For in the Word was life, and that life was the light of men.</q> Life in the Word, light in men, and life too, as the light is obeyed; the children of
<pb n="xxxv" facs="unknown:037441_0034_100D8DA48BBBDC48"/>the light living by the life of the Word, by which the Word begets them again to God, which is the regeneration and new birth, without which there is no coming unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; and which, whoever comes to, is greater than John, that is, than John's miniſtry, which was not that of the kingdom, but the conſummation of the legal, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel-diſpenſation. Accordingly, ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were gathered in thoſe parts; and thus his time was employed for ſome years.</p>
                  <p>In 1652, he being in his uſual retirement to the Lord upon a very high mountain, in ſome of the hither parts of Yorkſhire, as I take it, his mind exerciſed towards the Lord, he had a viſion of the great work of God in the earth, and of the way that he was to go forth to begin it. He ſaw people as thick as motes in the ſun, that ſhould in time be brought home to the Lord, that there might be but one Shepherd and one ſheepfold in all the earth. There his eye was directed northward, beholding a great people that ſhould receive him and his meſſage in thoſe parts. Upon this mountain he was moved of the Lord to ſound out his great and notable day, as if he had been in a great auditory, and from thence went north, as the Lord had ſhewn him: and in every place where he came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular exerciſe and ſervice ſhewn to him, ſo that the Lord was his leader indeed; for it was not in vain that he travelled, God in moſt places ſealing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with the convincement of ſome of all ſorts, as well publicans as ſober profeſſors of religion. Some of the firſt and moſt eminent of them, which are at reſt, were Richard Farnſworth, James Nayler, William Dewſberry, Francis Howgil, Edward Burrough, John Camm. John Audland, Richard Hubberthorn, T. Taylor, John Aldam, T. Holmes, Alexander Parker, William Simpſon, William Caton, John Stubbs, Robert Widders, John Burnyeat, Robert Lodge, Thomas Salthouſe, and many more worthies, that cannot be well here named, together with divers yet living of the firſt and great convincement, who after the knowledge of God's purging judgments in themſelves, and ſome time of waiting in ſilence upon him, to feel and receive power from on high to ſpeak in his name (which none elſe rightly can, though they may uſe the ſame words.) felt the divine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were frequently drawn forth, eſpecially to viſit the publick aſſemblies, to reprove, inform, and exhort them, ſometimes in markets, fairs, ſtreets, and by the highway ſide,
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="unknown:037441_0035_100D8DA69BC2EB18"/>calling people to repentance, and to turn to the Lord with their hearts as well as their mouths; directing them to the light of Chriſt within them, to ſee and examine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their ways by, and to eſchew the evil and do the good and acceptable will of God. And they ſuffered great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips for this their love and good-will, being often ſtocked, ſtoned, beaten, whipped, and impriſoned, though honeſt men and of good report where they lived, that had left wives and children, and houſes and lands, to viſit them with a living call to repentance. And though the prieſts generally ſet themſelves to oppoſe them, and write againſt them, and inſinuated moſt falſe and ſcandalous ſtories to defame them, ſtirring up the magiſtrates to ſuppreſs them, eſpecially in thoſe northern parts, yet God was pleaſed ſo to fill them with his living power, and give them ſuch an open door of utterance in his ſervice, that there was a mighty convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>And through the tender and ſingular indulgence of Judge Bradſhaw and Judge Fell, in the infancy of things, the prieſts were never able to gain the point they laboured for, which was to have proceeded to blood, and if poſſible, Herod-like, by a cruel exerciſe of the civil power, to have cut them off and rooted them out of the country. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Judge Fell, who was not only a check to their rage in the courſe of legal proceedings, but otherwiſe upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and finally countenanced this people; for his wife receiving the truth with the firſt, it had that influence upon his ſpirit, being a juſt and wiſe man, and ſeeing in his own wiſe and family a full confutation of all the popular cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt the way of truth, that he covered them what he could, and freely opened his doors, and gave up his houſe to his wife and her friends, not valuing the reproach of ignorant or evil-minded people, which I here mention to his and her honour, and which will be I believe an honour and a bleſſing to ſuch of their name and family as ſhall be found in that tenderneſs, humility, love, and zeal for the truth and people of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>That houſe was for ſome years at firſt, till the truth had opened its way in the ſouthern parts of this iſland, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent receptacle of this people. Others of good note and ſubſtance in thoſe northern countries had alſo opened their houſes with their hearts to the many publiſhers, that in a ſhort time the Lord had raiſed to declare his ſalvation to the people, and where meetings of the Lord's meſſengers
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="unknown:037441_0036_100D8DA8F3F423F0"/>were frequently held, to communicate their ſervices and exerciſes, and comfort and edify one another in their bleſſed miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>But leſt this may be thought a digreſſion, having touched upon this before, I return to this excellent man: and for his perſonal qualities, both natural, moral, and divine, as they appeared in his converſe with his brethren and in the church of God, take as follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. He was a man that God endowed with a clear and wonderful depth, a diſcerner of others ſpirits, and very much a maſter of his own. And though the ſide of his under ſtanding which lay next to the world, and eſpecially the expreſſion of it, might found uncouth and unfaſhionable to nice ears, his matter was nevertheleſs very profound, and would not only bear to be often conſidered, but the more i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was ſo, the more weighty and inſtructing it appeared. And as abruptly and brokenly as ſometimes his ſentences would fall from him about divine things, it is well known they were often as texts to many fairer declarations. And indeed it ſhewed beyond all contradiction that God ſent him, that no arts or parts had any ſhare in the matter or manner of his miniſtry, and that ſo many great, excellent, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truths as he came forth to preach to mankind, had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing of man's wit or wiſdom to recommend them. So that as to man he was an original, being no man's copy. And his miniſtry and writings ſhew they are from one that was not taught of man, nor had learned what he ſaid by ſtudy. Nor were they notional or ſpeculative, but ſenſible and practical truths, tending to converſion and regeneration, and the ſetting up the kingdom of God in the hearts of men, and the way of it was his work. So that I have many times been overcome in myſelf, and been made to ſay with my Lord and Maſter upon the like occaſion, <q>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent of this world, and revealed them to babes;</q> for many times hath my ſoul bowed in an humble thankfulneſs to the Lord, that he did not chooſe any of the wiſe and learned of this world to be the firſt meſſenger in our age of his bleſſed truth to men; but that he took one that was not of high degree, or elegant ſpeech, or learned after the way of this world, that his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and work he ſent him to do might come with leſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion or jealouſy of human wiſdom and intereſt, and with more force and clearneſs upon the conſciences of thoſe that
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="unknown:037441_0037_100D8DAB0AF45240"/>ſincerely ſought the way of truth in the love of it. I ſay, beholding with the eye of my mind, which the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had opened in me, the marks of God's finger and hand viſibly in this teſtimony from the clearneſs of the principle, the power and efficacy of it in the exemplary ſobriety, plainneſs, zeal, ſteadineſs, humility, gravity, punctuality, charity, and circumſpect care in the government of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affairs, which ſhined in his and their life and teſtimony that God employed in this work, it greatly confirmed me that it was of God, and engaged my ſoul in a deep love, fear, reverence, and thankſulneſs for his love and mercy therein to mankind; in which mind I remain, and ſhall, I hope, to the end of my days.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In his teſtimony or miniſtry he much laboured to open truth to the people's underſtandings, and to bottom them upon the principle and principal, Chriſt Jeſus, the light of the world, that by bringing them to ſomething that was of God in themſelves, they might the better know and judge of him and themſelves.</p>
                  <p>He had an extraordinary gift in opening the ſcriptures. He would go to the marrow of things, and ſhew the mind, harmony, and fulfilling of them with much plainneſs, and to great comfort and edification.</p>
                  <p>The myſtery of the firſt and ſecond Adam, of the fall and reſtoration, of the law and goſpel, of ſhadows and ſubſtance, of the ſervant and ſon's ſtate, and the fulſilling of the ſcriptures in Chriſt, and by Chriſt the true light, in all that are his, through the obedience of faith, were much of the ſubſtance and drift of his teſtimonies. In all which he was witneſſed to be of God, being ſenſibly felt to ſpeak that which he had received of Chriſt, and was his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in that which never errs nor fails.</p>
                  <p>But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardneſs and weight of his ſpirit, the reverence and ſolemnity of his addreſs and behaviour, and the fewneſs and fulneſs of his words, have often ſtruck even ſtrangers with admiration, as they uſed to reach others with conſolation. The moſt awful, living, reverent frame I ever felt or beheld, I muſt ſay, was his in prayer. And truly it was a teſtimony he knew, and lived nearer to the Lord than other men; for they that know him moſt will ſee moſt reaſon to approach him with reverence and fear.</p>
                  <p>He was of an innocent life, no buſy-body, nor ſelf-ſeeker, neither touchy nor critical: what fell from him was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive,
<pb n="xxxix" facs="unknown:037441_0038_100D8DAD2170CA80"/>if not very edifying. So meek, contented, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, eaſy, ſteady, tender, it was a pleaſure to be in his company. He exerciſed no authority but over evil, and that every-where and in all; but with love, compaſſion, and long-ſuffering. A moſt merciful man, as ready to forgive as unapt to take or give an offence. Thouſands can truly ſay, he was of an excellent ſpirit and favour among them, and becauſe thereof the moſt excellent ſpirits loved him with an unfeigned and unfading love.</p>
                  <p>He was an inceſſant labourer; for in his younger time, before his many great and deep ſufferings and travels had enfeebled his body for intinerant ſervices, he laboured much in the word and doctrine and diſcipline in England, Scotland, and Ireland, turning many to God, and confirming thoſe that were convinced of the truth, and ſettling good order as to church-affairs among them. And towards the concluſion of his travelling ſervices, between the years ſeventy-one and ſeventy-ſeven, he viſited the churches of Chriſt in the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in America, and in the United Provinces, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, as his following Journal relates, to the convincement and conſolation of many. After that time he chiefly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in and about the city of London, and beſides the ſervices of his miniſtry, which were frequent, he wrote much both to them that are within and thoſe that are without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But the care he took of the affairs of the church in general was very great.</p>
                  <p>He was often where the records of the affairs of the church are kept, and the letters from the many meetings of God's people over all the world, where ſettled, come upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; which letters he had read to him, and communicated them to the meeting that is weekly held there for ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; he would be ſure to ſtir them up to diſcharge them, eſpecially in ſuffering caſes: ſhewing great ſympathy and compaſſion upon all ſuch occaſions, carefully looking into the reſpective caſes, and endeavouring ſpeedy relief accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of them; ſo that the churches and any of the ſuffering members thereof were ſure not to be forgotten or delayed in their deſires if he were there.</p>
                  <p>As he was unwearied, ſo he was undaunted in his ſervices for God and his people; he was no more to be moved to fear than to wrath. His behaviour at Derby, Litchfield, Appleby, before Oliver Cromwell at Lanceſton, Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, Worceſter, and Weſtminſter-hall, with many other
<pb n="xl" facs="unknown:037441_0039_100D8DAF4F894F68"/>places and exerciſes, did abundantly evidence it to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as well as his friends.</p>
                  <p>But as in the primitive times ſome roſe up againſt the bleſſed apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even from among thoſe that they had turned to the hope of the goſpel, and who became their greateſt trouble, ſo this man of God had his ſhare of ſuffering from ſome that were convinced by him, who through prejudice or miſtake ran againſt him as one that ſought dominion over conſcience; becauſe he preſſed, by his preſence or epiſtles, a ready and zealous compliance with ſuch good and wholeſome things as tended to an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation about the aſſairs of the church, and in their walking before men. That which contributed much to this ill work, was in ſome a begrudging of this meek man the love and eſteem he had and deſerved in the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and weakneſs in others that were taken with their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuggeſtions of impoſition and blind obedience.</p>
                  <p>They would have had every man independent, that as he had the principle in himſelf, he ſhould only ſtand and fall to that and nobody elſe; not conſidering that the principle is one in all, and though the meaſure of light or grace might differ, yet the nature of it was the ſame, and being ſo they ſtruck at the ſpiritual unity, which a people guided by the ſame principle are naturally led into: ſo that what is evil to one is ſo to all, and what is virtuous, honeſt, and of good report to one, is ſo to all, from the ſenſe and ſavour of the one univerſal principle which is common to all, and (which the diſaffected profeſs to be) the root of all true chriſtian fellowſhip, and that ſpirit into which the people of God drink, and come to be ſpiritually minded, and of one heart and one ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Some weakly miſtook good order in the government of church-affairs for diſcipline in worſhip, and that it was ſo preſſed or recommended by him and other brethren: and they were ready to reflect the ſame things that diſſenters had very reaſonably objected upon the national churches, that have coercively preſſed conformity to their reſpective creeds and worſhips: whereas theſe things related wholly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the outward and (as I may ſay) civil part of the church, that men ſhould walk up to the principles of their belief, and not be wanting in care and charity. But though ſome have ſtumbled and fallen through miſtakes and an unreaſonable obſtinacy even to a prejudice, yet bleſſed be God, the generality have returned to their firſt love, and
<pb n="xli" facs="unknown:037441_0040_100D8DB0EDF6EFF0"/>ſeen the work of the enemy, that loſes no opportunity or advantage by which he may check or hinder the work of God, and diſquiet the peace of his church, and chill the love of his people to the truth, and one to another; and there is hope of divers that are yet at a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe occaſions, though there was no perſon the diſcontented ſtruck ſo ſharply at as this good man, he bore all their weakneſs and prejudice, and returned not reflection for reflection: but forgave them their weak and bitter ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, praying for them that they might have a ſenſe of their hurt, and ſee the ſubtilty of the enemy to rend and divide, and return into their firſt love that thought no ill.</p>
                  <p>And truly, I muſt ſay, that though God had viſibly cloathed him with a divine preference and authority, and indeed his very preſence expreſſed a religious majeſty, yet he never abuſed it, but held his place in the church of God with great meekneſs, and a moſt engaging humility and moderation. For upon all occaſions, like his bleſſed Maſter, he was a ſervant to all, holding and exerciſing his elderſhip in the inviſible power that had gathered them, with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the head and care over the body, and was received only in that ſpirit and power of Chriſt, as the firſt and chief elder in this age; who as he was therefore worthy of double honour, ſo for the ſame reaſon it was given by the faithful of this day; becauſe his authority was inward and not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that he got it and kept it by the love of God and power of an endleſs life. I write my knowledge and not report, and my witneſs is true, having been with him for weeks and months together on divers occaſions, and thoſe of the neareſt and moſt exerciſing nature, and that by night and by day, by ſea and by land, in this and in foreign countries: and I can ſay I never ſaw him out of his place, or not a match for every ſervice or occaſion.</p>
                  <p>For in all things he acquitted himſelf like a man, yea a ſtrong man, a new and heavenly-minded man. A divine, and a naturaliſt, and all of God Almighty's making. I have been ſurprized at his queſtions and anſwers in natural things, that whilſt he was ignorant of uſeleſs and ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcience, he had in him the foundation of uſeful and commendable knowledge, and cheriſhed it every-where. Civil beyond all forms of breeding in his behaviour; very temperate, eating little and ſleeping leſs, though a bulky perſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus he lived and ſojourned among us, and as he lived
<pb n="xlii" facs="unknown:037441_0041_100D8DB4327ACE48"/>ſo he died, feeling the ſame eternal power that had raiſed and preſerved him in his laſt moments. So full of aſſurance was he that he triumphed over death; and ſo even to the laſt, as if death were hardly worth notice or a mention: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to ſome with him the diſpatch and diſperſion of an epiſtle, juſt before written to the churches of Chriſt, throughout the world, and his own books; but above all, friends, and of all friends thoſe in Ireland and America, twice over: ſaying, Mind poor friends in Ireland and America.</p>
                  <p>And to ſome that came in and inquired how he found himſelf, he anſwered, <q>Never heed, the Lord's power is over all weakneſs and death, the Seed reigns, bleſſed be the Lord:</q> which was about four or five hours before his departure out of this world. He was at the great meeting near Lombard-ſtreet on the firſt day of the week, and it was the third following about ten at night when he left us, being at the houſe of H. Goldney in the ſame court. In a good old age he went, after having lived to ſee his childrens children to ſeveral generations in the truth. He had the comfort of a ſhort illneſs, and the bleſſing of a clear ſenſe to the laſt; and we may truly ſay with a man of God of old, that "being dead, he yet ſpeaketh;" and though abſent in body, he is preſent in Spirit; neither time nor place being able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the communion of ſaints, or diſſolve the fellowſhip of the ſpirits of the juſt. His works praiſe him, becauſe they are to the praiſe of him that worked by him; for which his memorial is and ſhall be bleſſed. I have done, as to this part of my preface, when I have left this ſhort epitaph to his name: <q>Many ſons have done virtuouſly in this day, but, dear GEORGE, thou excelleſt them all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, Friends, you that profeſs to walk in the way this bleſſed man was ſent of God to turn us into, ſuffer I beſeech you the word of exhortation, as well fathers as children, and elders as young men. The glory of this day, and foundation of the hope that has not made us aſhamed ſince we were a people, you know is that bleſſed principle of light and life of Chriſt, which we profeſs, and direct all people to, as the great inſtrument and agent of man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God: it was by this we were firſt touched, and effectually enlightened, as to our inward ſtate; which put us upon the conſideration of our latter end, cauſing us to ſet the Lord before our eyes, and to number our days, that we might apply our hearts to wiſdom. In that day we
<pb n="xliii" facs="unknown:037441_0042_100D8DB5CFBAEE88"/>judged not after the ſight of the eye, or after the hearing of the ear, but according to the light and ſenſe this bleſſed principle gave us; we judged and acted in reference to Things and Perſons, ourſelves and others, yea, towards God our Maker. For being quickened by it in our inward man, we could eaſily diſcern the difference of things, and feel what was right, and what was wrong, and what was fit, and what not, both in reference to religion and civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. That being the ground of the fellowſhip of all ſaints, it was in that our fellowſhip ſtood. In this we deſired to have a ſenſe one of another, acted towards one another and all me, in love, faithfulneſs, and fear.</p>
                  <p>In the feeling of the motions of this principle we drew near to the Lord, and waited to be prepared by it, that we might feel thoſe drawings and movings, before we approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord in prayer, or opened our mouths in miniſtry. And in our beginning and ending with this, ſtood our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſervice, and edification. And as we ran faſter, or fell ſhort, we made burthens for ourſelves to bear; our ſervices finding in ourſelves a rebuke, inſtead of an acceptance; and in lieu of "Well done," <q>Who hath required this at your hands?</q> In that day we were an exerciſed people, our very countenances and deportment declared it.</p>
                  <p>Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for ourſelves, eſpecially the young convinced. Often had we the burthen of the word of the Lord to our neighbours, relations, and acquaintance, and ſometimes ſtrangers alſo: we were in travail for one another's preſervation; not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſhunning occaſions of any coldneſs or miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, treating one another as thoſe that believed and felt God preſent; which kept our converſation innocent, ſerious, and weighty, guarding ourſelves againſt the cares and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the world. We held the truth in the Spirit of it, and not in our own ſpirits, or after our own will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. They were bowed and brought into ſubjection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it was viſible to them that knew us, we did not think ourſelves at our own diſpoſal, to go where we liſt, or ſay or do what we liſt, or when we liſt. Our liberty ſtood in the liberty of the Spirit of truth; and no pleaſure, no proſit, no fear, no favour could draw us from this retired, ſtrict, and watchful ſrame. We were ſo far from ſeeking occaſions of company, that we avoided them what we could, purſuing our own buſineſs with moderation, inſtead of meddling with other people's unneceſſarily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xliv" facs="unknown:037441_0043_100D8DB7F894F858"/>
Our words were few and ſavoury, our looks compoſed and weighty, and our whole deportment very obſervable. True it is, that this retired and ſtrict ſort of life from the liberty of the converſation of the world, expoſed us to the cenſures of many, as humouriſts, conceited, and ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, &amp;c. But it was our preſervation from many ſnares, to which others were continually expoſed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life, that wanted no occaſions or temptations to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them abroad in the converſe of the world.</p>
                  <p>I cannot forget the humility and chaſte zeal of that day. O how conſtant at meetings, how retired in them, how firm to truth's life, as well as truth's principles, and how intire and united in oar communion, as indeed became thoſe that profeſs one head, even Chriſt Jeſus the Lord!</p>
                  <p>This being the teſtimony and example the man of God before-mentioned was ſent to declare and leave amongſt us, and we having embraced the ſame as the merciful viſitation of God to us, the word of exhortation at this time is, that we continue to be found in the way of this teſtimony with all zeal and integrity, and ſo much the more by how much the day draweth near.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, as to you, my beloved and much honoured brethren in Chriſt that are in the exerciſe of the miniſtry: O feel life in the miniſtry! Let life be your commiſſion, your well-ſpring and treaſury in all ſuch occaſions; elſe you well know there can be no begetting to God, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can quicken or make people alive to God, but the life of God: and it muſt be a miniſtry in and from life that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens any people to God. We have ſeen the fruit of all other miniſtries by the few that are turned from the evil of their ways. It is not our parts or memory, the repetition of former openings in our own will and time, that will do God's work. A dry doctrinal miniſtry, however ſound in words, can reach but the ear, and is but a dream at the beſt: there is another ſoundneſs, that is ſoundeſt of all, viz. Chriſt the power of God. This is the key of David, that opens, and none ſhuts; and ſhuts, and none can open; as the oil to the lamp and the ſoul to the body, ſo is that to the beſt of words. Which made Chriſt to ſay, <q>My words they are ſpirit, and they are life;</q> that is, they are from life, and therefore they make you alive that receive them. If the diſciples, that had lived with Jeſus, were to ſtay at Jeruſalem till they received it; ſo muſt we wait to receive
<pb n="xlv" facs="unknown:037441_0044_100D8DB9D183D360"/>before we miniſter, if we will turn people from darkneſs to light, and from Satan's power to God.</p>
                  <p>I fervently bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you may always be like-minded, that you may ever wait reverently for the coming and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of life, and attend upon it in your miniſtry and ſervice, that you may ſerve God in his Spirit. And be it little, or be it much, it is well; for much is not too much, and the leaſt is enough, if from the motion of God's Spirit; and without it, verily, never ſo little is too much, becauſe to no profit.</p>
                  <p>For it is the Spirit of the Lord immediately, or through the miniſtry of his ſervants, that teacheth his people to profit; and to be ſure, ſo far as we take him along with us in our ſervices, ſo far are we profitable, and no farther. For if it be the Lord that muſt work all things in us, and for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, much more is it the Lord that muſt work in us for the converſion of others. If therefore it was once a croſs to us to ſpeak, though the Lord required it at our hands, let it never be ſo to be ſilent, when he does not.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the moſt dreadful ſayings in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That he that adds to the words of the prophecy of this book, God will add the plagues written in this book. To keep back the counſel of God, is as terrible; for he that takes away from the words of the prophecy of this book, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life. And truly it has great caution in it to thoſe that uſe the name of the Lord, to be well aſſured the Lord ſpeaks, that they may not be found of the number of thoſe that add to the words of the teſtimony of prophecy which the Lord giveth them to bear; nor yet to mince or diminiſh the ſame, both being ſo very offenſive to God.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, brethren, let us be careful neither to out-go our guide, nor yet loiter behind him; ſince he that makes haſte may miſs his way, and he that ſtays behind loſe his guide: for even thoſe that have received the word of the Lord had need wait for wiſdom, that they may ſee how to divide the word aright; which plainly implieth, that it is poſſible for one that hath received the word of the Lord to miſs in the diviſion and application of it, which muſt come from an impatiency of ſpirit, and a ſelf-working; which makes an unſound and dangerous mixture, and will hardly beget a right-minded living people to God.</p>
                  <p>I am earneſt in this, above all other conſiderations, as
<pb n="xlvi" facs="unknown:037441_0045_100D8DBC49D78030"/>to publick brethren, well knowing how much it concerns the preſent and future ſtate and preſervation of the church of Chriſt Jeſus, that has been gathered and built up by a living and powerful miniſtry, that the miniſtry be held, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and continued in the manifeſtations, motions, and ſupplies of the ſame life and power from time to time.</p>
                  <p>And where-ever it is obſerved that any one does miniſter more from gifts and parts than life and power, though they have an enlightened and doctrinal underſtanding, let them in time be adviſed and admoniſhed for their preſervation; becauſe inſenſibly ſuch will come to depend upon ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, to forſake Chriſt the living fountain, and to hew out unto themſelves ciſterns that will hold no living waters, and by degrees draw others from waiting upon the gift of God in themſelves, and to feel it in others, in order to their ſtrength and refreſhment, to wait upon them, and to turn from God to man again, and ſo to make ſhipwreck of the faith once delivered to the Saints, and of a good conſcience towards God; which are only kept by that divine gift of life that begat the one and wakened and ſanctified the other in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it enough that we have known the divine gift, and in it have reached to the ſpirits in priſon, and been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the convincing of others of the way of God, if we keep not as low and poor in ourſelves, and as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord as ever; ſince no memory, no repetitions of former openings, revelations, or enjoyments will bring a ſoul to God, or afford bread to the hungry, or water to the thirſty, unleſs life go with what we ſay, and that muſt be waited for.</p>
                  <p>O that we may have no other fountain, treafury, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance! that none may preſume at any rate to act of themſelves for God; becauſe they have long acted from God; that we may not ſupply want of waiting with our own wiſdom, or think that we may take leſs care and more liberty in ſpeaking than formerly; and that where we do not feel the Lord by his power to open us and enlarge us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the expectation of the people or has been our cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary ſupply and character, we may not exceed or ſill up the time with our own.</p>
                  <p>I hope we ſhall ever remember who it was that ſaid, "Of yourſelves ye can do nothing;" our ſufficiency is in Him: and if we are not to ſpeak our own words, or take thought what we ſhould ſay to men in our defence when
<pb n="xlvii" facs="unknown:037441_0046_100D8DBF4017D590"/>expoſed for our teſtimony, ſurely we ought to ſpeak none of our own words, or take thought what we ſhall ſay in our teſtimony and miniſtry in the name of the Lord to the ſouls of the people; for then of all times, and of all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhould it be fulfilled in us; <q>for it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of my Father that ſpeaketh in you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed the miniſtry of the Spirit muſt and does keep its analogy and agreement with the birth of the Spirit; that as no man can inherit the kingdom of God unleſs he be born of the Spirit, ſo no miniſtry can beget a ſoul to God, but that which is from the Spirit. For this, as I ſaid before, the diſciples waited before they went forth, and in this our elder brethren, and meſſengers of God in our day, waited, viſited, and reached to us. And having begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, let none ever hope or ſeek to be made perfect in the fleſh: for what is the fleſh to the ſpirit, or the chaff to the wheat? And if we keep in the ſpirit, we ſhall keep in the unity of it, which is the ground of true fellowſhip. For by drinking into that one Spirit, we are made one people to God, and by it we are continued in the unity of the faith and the bond of peace. No envying, no bitterneſs, no ſtrife can have place with us. We ſhall watch always for good, and not for evil over one another, and rejoice exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and not begrudge at one another's increaſe in the riches of the grace with which God repleniſheth his faithful ſervants.</p>
                  <p>And, brethren, as to you is committed the diſpenſation of the oracles of God, which give you frequent opportunities and great place with the people among whom you travel, I beſeech you that you would not think it ſufficient to declare the word of life in their aſſemblies, however edifying and comfortable ſuch opportunities may be to you and them; but as was the practice of the man of God before-mentioned in great meaſure, when among us, inquire the ſtate of the ſeveral churches you viſit, who among them are afflicted or ſick, who are tempted, if any are unfaithful or obſtimate, and endeavour to iſſue thoſe things in the wiſdom and power of God, which will be a glorious crown upon your miniſtry. As that prepares your way in the hearts of the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you as men of God, ſo it gives you credit with them to do them good by your advice in other reſpects. The afflicted will be comforted by you, the tempted ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſick refreſhed, the unfaithful convicted and reſtored, and ſuch as are obſtinate ſoftened and ſitted for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xlviii" facs="unknown:037441_0047_100D8DC0D3FED5E0"/>which is clenching the nail, and applying and faſtening the general teſtimony by that particular care of the ſeveral branches of it, in reference to them more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it.</p>
                  <p>For though good and wiſe men and elders too may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in ſuch places, who are of worth and importance in the general and in other places, yet it does not always follow that they may have the room they deſerve in the hearts of the people they live among, or ſome particular occaſion may make it unfit for him or them to uſe that authority; but you that travel as God's meſſengers, if they receive you in the greater, ſhall they refuſe you in the leſs? And if they own the general teſtimony, can they withſtand the particular application of it in their own caſes? Thus ye will ſhew yourſelves workmen indeed, and carry your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before you, to the praiſe of his name that hath called you from darkneſs to light, that you might turn others from Satan's power unto God and his kingdom which is within. And oh! that there were more of ſuch faithful labourers in the vineyard of the Lord! never more need ſince the day of God!</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I cannot but cry and call aloud to you, that have been long profeſſors of the truth, and know the truth in the convincing power of it, and have had a ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among men, yet content yourſelves only to know truth for yourſelves; to go to meetings, and exerciſe an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary charity in the church and an honeſt behaviour in the world, and limit yourſelves within thoſe bounds, feeling little or no concern upon your ſpirits for the glory of the Lord in the proſperity of his truth in the earth, more than to be glad that others ſucceed in ſuch ſervice; ariſe ye in the name and power of the Lord Jeſus! behold how white the fields are unto harveſt in this and other nations, and how few able and faithful labourers there are to work therein! your country folks, neighbours, and kindred want to know the Lord and his truth, and to walk in it. Does nothing lie at your door upon their account? Search and ſee, and loſe no time, I beſeech you, for the Lord is at hand. I do not judge you; there is one that judgeth all men, and his judgment is true: you have mightily increaſed in your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubſtance, may you equally increaſe in your inward riches, and do good with both while you have a day to do good. Your enemies would once have taken what you had from you for his name's take in whom you have believed,
<pb n="xlix" facs="unknown:037441_0048_100D8DC292F90288"/>wherefore he has given you much of the world in the face of your enemies. But oh! let it be your ſervant and not your maſter, your diverſion rather than your buſineſs! let the Lord be chiefly in your eye, and ponder your ways, and ſee if God has nothing more for you to do; and if you find yourſelves ſhort in your account with him, then wait for his preparation, and be ready to receive the word of command, and be not weary of well-doing when you have put your hand to the plough; and aſſuredly you ſhall reap, if you faint not, the fruit of your heavenly labour in God's everlaſting kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And you, young convinced ones, be you intreated and exhorted to a diligent and chaſte waiting upon God in the way of his bleſſed manifeſtation and appearance of himſelf to you. Look not out but within; let not another's liberty be your ſnare: neither act by imitation, but ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's power in yourſelves: cruſh not the tender bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of it in your ſouls, nor over-run in your deſires and your warmneſs of affections the holy and gentle motions of it. Remember it is a ſtill voice that ſpeaks to us in this day, and that it is not to be heard in the noiſes and hurries of the mind, but is diſtinctly underſtood in a retired frame. Jeſus loved and choſe out ſolitudes, often going to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, to gardens, and ſea-ſides, to avoid crowds and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to ſhew his diſciples it was good to be ſolitary and ſit looſe to the world. Two enemies lie near your ſtate, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Liberty; but the plain, practical, living, holy truth, that has convinced you will preſerve you, if you mind it in yourſelves, and bring all thoughts, imaginations, and affections to the teſt of it, to ſee if they are wrought in God, or of the enemy, or your own ſelves: ſo will a true taſte, diſcerning, and judgment be preſerved to you, of what you ſhould do and leave undone: and in your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and faithfulneſs in this way you will come to inherit ſubſtance, and Chriſt, the eternal wiſdom, will fill your treaſury. And when you are converted, as well as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then confirm your brethren, and be ready to every good word and work that the Lord ſhall call you to, that you may be to his praiſe who has choſen you to be partakers with the Saints in light of a kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, an inheritance incorruptible, in eternal habitations.</p>
                  <p>And now, as for you that are the children of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a great concern is upon my ſpirit for your good, and often are my knees bowed to the God of your fathers for
<pb n="l" facs="unknown:037441_0049_100D8DC5CF05DB10"/>you, that you may come to be partakers of the ſame divine life and power, that has been the glory of this day, that a generation you may be to God, a holy nation and a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, zealous of good works, when all our heads are laid in the duſt. Oh! you young men and women, let it not ſuffice you that you are the children of the people of the Lord! you muſt alſo be born again if you will inherit the kingdom of God! Your fathers are but ſuch after the fleſh, and could but beget you into the likeneſs of the firſt Adam; but you muſt be begotten into the likeneſs of the ſecond Adam by a ſpiritual generation. And therefore look carefully about you, O ye children of the children of God, conſider your ſtanding, and ſee what you are in relation to this divine kindred, family, and birth! Have you obeyed the light, and received and walked in the Spirit, that is the incorruptible ſeed of the word and kingdom of God, of which you muſt be born again? God is no reſpecter of perſons: the father cannot ſave or anſwer for the child, the child for the father, <q>but in the ſin thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt die, and in the righteouſneſs thou doeſt through Chriſt Jeſus thou ſhalt live;</q> for it is the willing and obedient that ſhall eat the good of the land.</p>
                  <p>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, ſuch as all nations and people ſow, ſuch ſhall they reap at the hand of the juſt God. And then your many and great privileges above the children of other people will add weight in the ſcale againſt you, if you chooſe not the way of the Lord; for you have had line upon line, and precept upon precept, and not only good doctrine but good example; and which is more, you have been turned to and acquainted with a principle in yourſelves which others have been ignorant of, and you know you may be as good as you pleaſe, without the fear of frowns and blows, or being turned out of doors, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of father and mother for God's ſake and his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as has been the caſe of ſome of your fathers in the day they firſt entered into this holy path: and if you, after hearing and ſeeing the wonders that God has wrought in the deliverance and preſervation of them through a ſea of troubles, and the manifold temporal as well as ſpiritual bleſſings that he has filled them with in the ſight of their enemies. ſhould neglect or turn your backs upon ſo great and ſo near a ſalvation, you would not only be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful children to God and them, but muſt expect that God will call the children of thoſe that know him not to
<pb n="li" facs="unknown:037441_0050_100D8DC7F7750580"/>take the crown out of your hands, and that your lot will be a dreadful judgment at the hand of the Lord. But oh! that it may never be ſo with any of you! The Lord forbid, ſaith my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, O ye young men and women, look to the rock of your fathers; chooſe the God of your fathers: there is no other God but him, no other light but his, no other grace but his, nor Spirit but his to convince you, quicken and comfort you, to lead, guide, and preſerve you to God's everlaſting kingdom; ſo will you be poſſeſſors as well as profeſſors of the truth, embracing it not only by education but judgment and conviction, from a ſenſe begotten in your ſouls through the operation of the eternal Spirit and power of God in your hearts, by which you may come to be the ſeed of Abraham through faith, and the circumciſion not made with hands, and ſo heirs of the promiſe made to the fathers of an incorruptible crown: that, as I ſaid before, a generation you may be to God, holding up the profeſſion of the bleſſed truth in the life and power of it. For forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in religion is nauſeous to God and good men; and the more ſo, where any form or appearance has been new and peculiar, and begun and practiſed upon a principle with an uncommon zeal and ſtrictneſs. Therefore, I ſay, for you to fall flat and formal, and continue the profeſſion without that ſalt and ſavour by which it is come to obtain a good report among men, is not to anſwer God's love, nor your parents care, nor the mind of truth in yourſelves, nor in thoſe that are without; who though they will not obey the truth, have ſight and ſenſe enough to ſee if they do that make a profeſſion of it. For where the divine virtue of it is not felt in the ſoul, and waited for, and lived in, imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will quickly break out, and ſhew themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the unfaithfulneſs of ſuch perſons, and that their inſides are not ſeaſoned with the nature of that holy principle which they profeſs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, dear children, let me intreat you to ſhut your eyes at the temptations and allurements of this low and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing world, and not ſuffer your affections to be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by thoſe luſts and vanities that your fathers, for truth's ſake, long ſince turned their backs upon: but as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the truth, receive it into your hearts, that you may become the children of God: ſo that it may never be ſaid of you as the evangeliſt writes of the Jews of his time, that Chriſt the true light came to his own, but his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="lii" facs="unknown:037441_0051_100D8DC9936B8AD8"/>him not; but to as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the <q>children of God; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</q> A moſt cloſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive paſſage to this occaſion: you exactly and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly anſwer to thoſe profeſſing Jews, in that you bear the name of God's people, by being the children and wearing the form of God's people: ſo that he by his light in you may be ſaid to come to his own, and if you obey it not, but turn your back upon it, and walk after the vanities of your minds, you will be of thoſe that receive him not, which I pray God may never be your caſe and judgment; but that you may be thoroughly ſenſible of the many and great obligations you lie under to the Lord for his love, and your parents for their care; and with all your heart, and all your ſoul, and all your ſtrength, turn to the Lord, to his gift and Spirit in you, and hear his voice and obey it, that you may ſeal to the teſtimony of your fathers by the truth and evidence of your own experience; that your childrens children may bleſs you, and the Lord for you, as thoſe that delivered a faithful example, as well as record of the truth of God unto them. So will the grey hairs of your dear parents yet alive go down to the grave with joy, to ſee you the poſterity of truth, as well as theirs, and that not only their natures but Spirit ſhall live in you when they are gone.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this preface with a few words to thoſe that are not of our communion, into whoſe hands this may come, eſpecially thoſe of our own nation.</p>
                  <p>Friends, as you are the ſons and daughters of Adam, and my brethren after the fleſh, often and earneſt have been my deſires and prayers to God on your behalf, that you may come to know him that has made you to be your Redeemer and Reſtorer to the image, that through ſin you have loſt, by the power and Spirit of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath given for the light and life of the world. And O that you, who are called Chriſtians, would receive him into your heart! for there it is you want him, and at that door he ſtands knocking, that you ſhould let him in, but you do not open him; you are full of other gueſts, ſo that a manger is his lot among you now, as well as of old; yet you are full of profeſſion, as were the Jews when he came among them, who knew him not, but rejected and
<pb n="liii" facs="unknown:037441_0052_100D8DCB35DA25E8"/>evilly intreated him. So that if you come not to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and experience of what you profeſs, all your forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in religion will ſtand you in no ſtead in the day of God's judgment.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you ponder with yourſelves your eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſee what title, what ground and foundation, you have for your chriſtianity: if more than a profeſſion, and an hiſtorical belief of the goſpel. Have you known the baptiſm of fire and the Holy Ghoſt, and the fan of Chriſt that winnows away the chaff, the carnal luſts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? That divine leaven of the kingdom, that, being received, leavens the whole lump of man, ſanctifying him throughout in body, ſoul, and ſpirit? If this be not the ground of your confidence, you are in a miſerable eſtate.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, perhaps, that though you are ſinners, and live in the daily commiſſion of ſin, and are not ſanctified, as I have been ſpeaking, yet you have faith in Chriſt, who has borne the curſe for you, and in him you are complete by faith; his righteouſneſs being imputed to you.</p>
                  <p>But my friends, let me intreat you not to deceive your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo important a point as is that of your immortal ſouls. If you have true faith in Chriſt, your faith will make you clean, it will ſanctify you; for the ſaints faith was their victory: by this they overcame ſin within and ſinful men without. And if thou art in Chriſt, thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, whoſe fruits are manifeſt. Yea thou art a new creature, new made, new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned after God's will and mould: old things are done away, and behold all things are become new: new love, deſires, will, affections, and practices. It is not any longer thou that liveſt, thou diſobedient, carnal, worldly one; but it is Chriſt liveth in thee, and to live is Chriſt, and to die is thy eternal gain; becauſe thou art aſſured, "That thy corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and thy mortal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;" and that thou haſt a glorious houſe eternal in the heavens, that will never wax old or paſs away. All this follows being in Chriſt, as the ſenſation of heat follows fire, and light the ſun.</p>
                  <p>Therefore have a care how you preſume to rely upon ſuch a notion, as that you are in Chriſt whilſt in your old fallen nature. For "what communion hath light with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Chriſt with Belial?" Hear what the beloved diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tells you; "If we ſay we have fellowſhip with God, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth." That is,
<pb n="liv" facs="unknown:037441_0053_100D8DCD5A25D900"/>if we go on in a ſinful way, are captivated by our carnal affections, and are not converted to God, we walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cannot poſſibly have any fellowſhip with God. Chriſt cloaths them with his righteouſneſs, that receive his grace in their hearts, and deny themſelves, and take up his croſs daily, and follow him. Chriſt's righteouſneſs makes men inwardly holy, of holy minds, wills, and practices. It is nevertheleſs Chriſt's becauſe we have it; for it is ours not by nature, but by faith and adoption: it is the gift of God: but ſtill, though not ours as of or from ourſelves, for in that ſenſe it is Chriſt's, for it is of and from him, yet it is ours, and muſt be ours in poſſeſſion, efficacy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, to do us any good, or Chriſt's righteouſneſs will profit us nothing. It was after this manner that he was made to the primitive Chriſtians, righteouſneſs, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, juſtification, and redemption; and if ever you will have the comfort, kernel, and marrow of the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, thus you muſt come to learn and obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Now my friends, by what you have read, and will read in what follows, you may perceive that God has viſited a poor people among you with this ſaving knowledge and teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony; whom he has upheld and increaſed to this day, notwithſtanding the fierce oppoſition they have met withal. Deſpiſe not the meanneſs of this appearance: It was, and yet is, we know, a day of ſmall things, and of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with too many; and many hard and ill names are given to it; but it is of God, it came from him, becauſe it leads to him. This we know, but we cannot make another know it as we know it, unleſs he will take the ſame way to know it that we took. The world talks of God; but what do they do? They pray for power, but reject the principle in which it is. If you would know God, and worſhip and ſerve God as you ſhould do, you muſt come to the means he has ordained and given for that purpoſe. Some ſeek it in books, ſome in learned men; but what they look for is in themſelves, yet they overlook it. The voice is too ſtill, the ſeed too ſinall, and the light ſhineth in darkneſs. They are abroad, and ſo cannot divide the ſpoil; but the woman, that loſt her ſilver, found it at home, after ſhe had lighted her candle and ſwept her houſe. Do you ſo too, and you ſhall find what Pilate wanted to know, viz. truth.</p>
                  <p>The light of Chriſt within, who is the light of the world, and ſo a light to you, that tells you the truth of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, leads all that take heed unto it out of darkneſs into
<pb n="lv" facs="unknown:037441_0054_100D8DD024E3E4B8"/>God's marvellous light; for light grows upon the obedient. It is ſown for the righteous, and their way is a ſhining light, that ſhines forth more and more to the perfect day.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, O friends, turn in, turn in, I beſeech you! Where is the poiſon, there is the antidote: there you want Chriſt, and there you muſt find him; and bleſſed be God, there you may find him. "Seek and you ſhall find," I teſtify for God: but then you muſt ſeek aright with your whole heart, as men that ſeek for their lives, yea, for their eternal lives: diligently, humbly, patiently, as thoſe that can taſte no pleaſure, comfort, or ſatisfaction in any thing elſe, unleſs you find him whom your ſouls want, and deſire to know and love above all. O it is a travel, a ſpiritual travel! let the carnal profane world think and ſay as it will. And through this path you muſt walk to the city of God, that has eternal foundations, if ever you will come there.</p>
                  <p>Well! and what does this bleſſed light do for you? Why, 1. It ſets all your ſins in order before you: it detects the ſpirit of this world in all its baits and allurements, and ſhows how man came to fall from God, and the fallen eſtate he is in. 2. It begets a ſenſe and ſorrow, in ſuch as believe in it, for this fearful lapſe. You will then ſee him diſtinctly whom you have pierced, and all the blows and wounds you have given him by your diſobedience; and how you have made him to ſerve with your ſins, and you will weep and mourn for it, and your ſorrow will be a godly ſorrow. 3. After this it will bring you to the holy watch, to take care that you do ſo no more, that the enemy ſurpriſe you not again: then thoughts, as well as words and works, will come to judgment, which is the way of holineſs, in which the redeemed of the Lord do walk. Here you will come to love God above all, and your neighbours as yourſelves. Nothing hurts, nothing harms, nothing makes afraid on this holy mountain: now you come to be Chriſt's indeed, for you are his in nature and ſpirit, and not your own. And when you are thus Chriſt's, then Chriſt is your's, and not before: and here communion with the Father and with the Son you will know, and the efficacy of the blood of cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that immaculate Lamb, which ſpeaketh better things than the blood of Abel, and which cleanſeth from all ſin the conſciences of thoſe that, through the living Faith, come to be ſprinkled with it from dead works to ſerve the living God.</p>

                     <pb n="lvi" facs="unknown:037441_0055_100D8DD1BA009260"/>
To conclude, Behold the teſtimony and doctrine of the people called Quakers! Behold their Practice and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline! And behold the bleſſed man and men that were ſent of God in this excellent work and ſervice! All which will be more particularly expreſſed in the enſuing annals of the man of God; which I do heartily recommend to my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's moſt ſerious peruſal, and beſeech Almighty God that his bleſſing may go along with it, to the convincing of many as yet ſtrangers to this holy diſpenſation, and alſo to the edification of the church of God in general: who, for his manifold and repeated mercies and bleſſings to his people, in this day of his great love, is ever worthy to have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, honour, thankſgiving, and renown; and be it rendered and aſcribed, with fear and reverence, through him in whom he is well pleaſed, his beloved Son and Lamb, our light and life, that ſits with him upon the throne, world without end. Amen,</p>

                  <head>The TESTIMONY of MARGARET FOX, concerning her late Huſband GEORGE FOX: together with a brief Account of ſome of his Travels, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Hardſhips endured for the Truth's Sake.</head>
                  <p>IT having pleaſed Almighty God to take away my dear huſband out of this troubleſome world, who was not a man thereof, being choſen out of it, and had his life and being in another region, and his teſtimony was againſt the world that the deeds thereof were evil, and therefore the world hated him; ſo I am now to give in my account and teſtimony for my dear huſband, whom the Lord hath taken unto his bleſſed kingdom and glory: and it is before me from the Lord, and in my view, to give a relation and leave upon record the dealings of the Lord with us from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>He was the inſtrument in the hand of the Lord in this preſent age, which he made uſe of to ſend forth into the world to preach the everlaſting goſpel, which had been hid from many ages and generations; the Lord revealed it unto him, and made him open that new and living way that leads to life eternal, when he was but a youth and a ſtripling. And when he declared it in his own country of Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and in Derbyſhire, Nottinghamſhire, and Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and his declaration being againſt the hireling-prieſts and their practices, it raiſed a great fury and oppoſition amongſt the prieſts and people againſt him; yet there was always ſome that owned him in ſeveral places, but very few that ſtood firm to him when perſecution came on him. There was he and one other put in priſon at Derby, but the other declined and left him in priſon there; where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almoſt a whole year, and then he was releaſed out of priſon, and went on with his teſtimony abroad, and was put in priſon again at Nottingham; and there he continued awhile, and after was releaſed again.</p>
                  <p>And then he travelled on into Yorkſhire, and paſſed up and down that great county, and ſeveral received him; as William Dewſbury, Richard Farnſworth, Thomas Aldam, and others, who all came to be faithful miniſters of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for the Lord. And he continued in that country, and travelled through Holderneſs and the Woulds, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance were convinced; and ſeveral were brought to priſon at York for their teſtimony to the truth, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:

And after awhile he travelled up farther towards the dales in Yorkſhire, as Wenſdale and Sedbur; and amongſt the hills, dales and mountains he came on, and convinced many of the eternal truth.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1652 it pleaſed the Lord to draw him towards us; ſo he came on from Sedbur into Weſtmoreland, to Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank-Chapel, where John Blaykling came with him; and ſo on to Preſton, Grarig. Kendal, Under-barrow, Poobank, Cartmel, and Staveley, and ſo on to Swarthmore, my dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe, whither he brought the bleſſed tidings of the everlaſting goſpel, which I and many hundreds in theſe parts have cauſe to praiſe the Lord for. My then huſband, Thomas Fell, was not at home at that time, but gone the Welſh circuit, being one of the judges of aſſize; and our houſe being a place open to entertain miniſters and religious people at, one of GEORGE FOX's friends brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where he ſtaid all night: and the next day, being a lecture or a faſt-day, he went to Ulverſton ſteeple-houſe, but came not in till people were gathered; I and my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had been a long time there before. And when they were ſinging before the ſermon he came in, and when they had done ſinging he ſtood up upon a ſeat or form, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired "that he might have liberty to ſpeak;" and he that was in the pulpit ſaid he might. And the firſt words that he ſpoke were as followeth: <q>He is not a Jew that is one outward. neither is that circumciſion which is outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, and that is circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is of the heart.</q> And ſo he went on and ſaid <q>that Chriſt was the light of the world, and lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that by this light they mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ht be gathered to God,</q> &amp;c. I ſtood up in my pew, and wondered at his doctrine; for I had never heard ſuch before. And then he went on, and opened the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſaid, <q>The ſcriptures were the prophets words, and Chriſt's and the apoſtles words, and what, as they ſpoke, they enjoyed and poſſeſſed, and had it from the Lord:" and ſaid, "Then what had any to do with the ſcriptures, but as they came to the ſpirit that gave them forth. You will ſay, Chriſt ſaith this, and the apoſtles ſay this; but what canſt thou ſay? Art thou a child of light, and haſt walked in the light, and what thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is it inwardly from God.</q> &amp;c. This opened me ſo,
<pb n="lix" facs="unknown:037441_0058_100D8DD8F03C53E0"/>that it cut me to the heart; and then I ſaw clearly, we were all wrong. So I ſat down in my pew again, and cried bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly; and I cried in my ſpirit to the Lord, <q>We are all thieves, we are all thieves, we have taken the ſcriptures in words, and know nothing of them in ourſelves.</q> So that ſerved me, that I cannot well tell what he ſpoke after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but he went on in declaring againſt the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, prieſts, and deceivers of the people. And there was one John Sawrey, a juſtice of peace, and a profeſſor, that bid the churchwarden taken him away: and he laid his hands on him ſeveral times, and took them off again, and let him alone; and then after a while he gave over, and came to our houſe again that night. And he ſpoke in the family amongſt the ſervants, and they were all generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; as William Caton, Thomas Salthouſe, Mary Aſkew, Anne Clayton, and ſeveral other ſervants. And I was ſtruck into ſuch a ſadneſs, I knew not what to do, my huſband being from home. I ſaw it was the truth, and I could not deny it; and I did, as the Apoſtle ſaith, "I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the truth in the love of it:" and it was opened to me ſo clear, that I had never a tittle in my heart againſt it; but I deſired the Lord that I might be kept in it, and then I deſired no greater portion.</p>
                  <p>He went on to Dalton, Aldingham, Dendrum, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ramſyde chapels and ſteeple-houſes, and ſeveral places up and down, and the people followed him mightily: and abundance were convinced, and ſaw that which he ſpoke was truth, but the prieſts were all in a rage. And about two weeks after James Naylor and Richard Farnſworth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him and enquired him out till they came to Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and there ſtaid awhile with me at our houſe, and did me much good; for I was under great heavineſs and judgment. But the power of the Lord entered upon me within about three weeks that he came, and about three weeks end my huſband came home; and many were in a mighty rage, and a deal of the captains and great ones of the country went to meet my then huſband as he was coming home, and informed him, <q>That a great diſaſter was befallen amongſt his family, and that they were witches; and that they had taken us out of our religion; and that he muſt either ſet them away, or all the country would be undone.</q> But no weapons formed againſt the Lord ſhall proſper, as you may ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>So my huſband came home greatly offended; and any
<pb n="lx" facs="unknown:037441_0059_100D8DDA8853DDD0"/>may think what a condition I was like to be in, that either I muſt diſpleaſe my huſband or offend God; for he was very much troubled with us all in the houſe and family, they had ſo prepoſſeſſed him againſt us. But James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and Richard Farnſworth were both then at our houſe, and I deſired them to come and ſpeak to him; and ſo they did very moderately and wiſely: but he was at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with them, till they told him "they came in love and good-will to his houſe." And after that he had heard them ſpeak awhile he was better ſatisfied, and they offered as if they would go away; but I deſired them to ſtay, and not to go away yet, for GEORGE FOX will come this evening. And I would have had my huſband to have heard them all, and ſatisfied himſelf farther about them, becauſe they had ſo prepoſſeſſed him againſt them of ſuch dangerous fearful things in his coming firſt home. And then he was pretty moderate and quiet, and his dinner being ready he went to it, and I went in and ſate me down by him. And whilſt I was ſitting the power of the Lord ſeized upon me, and he was ſtruck with amazement, and knew not what to think; but was quiet and ſtill. And the children were all quiet and ſtill, and grown ſober, and could not play on their muſick that they were learning; and all theſe things made him quiet and ſtill.</p>
                  <p>At night GEORGE FOX came: and after ſupper my huſband was ſitting in the parlour, and I aſked him, If GEORGE FOX might come in? And he ſaid, Yes. So GEORGE came in without any compliment, and walked into the room, and began to ſpeak preſently; and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and James Naylor and Richard Farnſworth came all in: and he ſpoke very excellently as ever I heard him, and opened Chriſt's and the apoſtles practices, which they were in, in their day. And he opened the night of apoſtacy ſince the apoſtles days, and laid open the prieſts and their practices in the apoſtacy; that if all in England had been there, I thought they could not have denied the truth of thoſe things. And ſo my huſband came to ſec clearly the truth of what he ſpoke, and was very quiet that night, ſaid no more, and went to bed. The next morning came Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, prieſt of Ulverſton, and got my huſband into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and ſpoke much to him there; but my huſband had ſeen ſo much the night before, that the prieſt got little entrance upon him. And when the prieſt, Lampit, was come into the houſe, GEORGE ſpoke ſharpy to him, and
<pb n="lxi" facs="unknown:037441_0060_100D8DDC1D4F8658"/>aſked him, <q>When God ſpoke to him, and called him to go and preach to the people?</q> But after awhile the prieſt went away: this was on the ſixth day of the week, about the fifth month, 1652. And at our houſe divers friends were ſpeaking one to another, how there were ſeveral convinced here-aways, and we could not tell where to get a meeting; my huſband alſo being preſent, he overheard, and ſaid of his own accord, "You may meet here if you will:" and that was the firſt meeting we had that he offered of his own accord. And then notice was given that day and the next to friends, and there was a good large meeting the firſt day, which was the firſt meeting that was at Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and ſo continued there a meeting from 1652 to 1690. And my huſband went that day to the ſteeple-houſe, and none with him but his clerk, and his groom that rid with him: and the prieſt and the people were all fearfully troubled; but praiſed be the Lord, they never got their wills upon us to this day.</p>
                  <p>After a few weeks GEORGE went to Ulverſton ſteeple-houſe again, and the ſaid juſtice Sawrey, with others, ſet the rude rabble upon him, and they beat him ſo that he fell down as in a ſwoon, and was ſore bruiſed and blackened in his body, and on his head and arms. Then my huſband was not at home; but when he came home, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that they ſhould do ſo, and ſpoke to juſtice Sawrey, and ſaid, "It was againſt law to make riots." After that he was ſore beat and ſtoned at Walney till he fell down, and alſo at Dalton was he ſore beat and abuſed; ſo that he had very hard uſage in divers places in theſe parts. And then when a meeting was ſettled here, he went again into Weſtmoreland, and ſettled meetings there; and there was a great convincement, and abundance of brave miniſters came out there-aways; as John Camm, John Audland, Francis Howgil, Edward Burrough, Miles Halhead, and John Blaykling, with divers others. He alſo went over the ſands to Lancaſter, and Yelland, and Kellet, where Robert Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Richard Hubberthorn, and John Lawſon, with many others, were convinced. And about that time he was in thoſe parts, many prieſts and profeſſors roſe up, and falſely accuſed him for blaſphemy, and did endeavour to take away his life, and got people to ſwear at a ſeſſions at Lancaſter that he had ſpoken blaſphemy. But my then huſband and colonel Weſt, having had ſome ſight and knowledge of the truth, withſtood the two perſecuting juſtices, John Sawrey
<pb n="lxii" facs="unknown:037441_0061_100D8DDEEDBCC550"/>and Thompſon, and brought him off, and cleared him; for indeed he was innocent. And after the ſeſſions there was a great meeting in the town of Lancaſter; and many of the town's people came in, and many were convinced, And thus he was up and down about Lancaſter, Yelland, Weſtmoreland, and ſome parts of Yorkſhire, and our parts above one year; in which time there were above twenty-four miniſters brought forth, that were ready to go with their teſtimony of the eternal truth unto the world: and ſoon after Francis Howgil and John Camm went to ſpeak to Oliver Cromwel.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1653 GEORGE's drawings were into Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by Milholm, Lampley, Embleton and Brigham, Pard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey and Cockermouth, where at or near Embleton he had a diſpute with ſome prieſts, as Larkham and Benſon, but chiefly with John Wilkinſon, a preacher at Embleton and Brigham; who was afterwards convinced, and owned the truth, and was a ſerviceable miniſter both in England, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland. And then he went to Coldbeck and ſeveral places, till he came to Carliſle, and went to their ſteeple-houſe: and they beat and abuſed him, and had him before the magiſtrates; who examined him, and put him in priſon there in the common gaol among the thieves. And at the aſſizes was one Anthony Pearſon, who had been a juſtice of peace, and was convinced at Appleby, when he was upon the bench, by James Naylor and Francis How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, who were then priſoners there, and brought before him; ſo Anthony Pearſon ſpake to the juſtices at Carliſle, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with them, having married his wife out of Cumberland; and after awhile they releaſed him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he went into ſeveral other parts of Cumberland, and many were convinced, and owned the truth: and he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſettled meetings there amongſt them, and up and down in ſeveral parts there in the north.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1654 he went ſouthward to his own country of Leiceſterſhire, viſiting friends. And then colonel Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſent him to Oliver Cromwel: and after his being kept priſoner a while, he was brought before Oliver, and was releaſed. And then he ſtayed a while, viſiting friends in London, and the meetings therein; and ſo paſſed weſtward to Briſtol, and viſited friends there: and after went into Cornwall, where they put him in priſon at Launceſton, and one Edward Pyot with him; where he had a bad, long impriſonment. When he was releaſed, he paſſed into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="lxiii" facs="unknown:037441_0062_100D8DE2A98AA0D8"/>parts in that county of Cornwall, and ſettled meetings there. And then he travelled through many counties, viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends and ſettling meetings all along: and ſo came into the north, and to Swarthmore, and to Cumberland.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for Scotland he paſſed in the year 1657, and there went with him Robert Widders, James Lancaſter, John Grave, and others. And he travelled through many places in that nation, as Douglas, Heads, Hamilton, Glaſgow, and to Edinburgh, where they took him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him before general Monk and the council, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and aſked him his buſineſs into that nation; who anſwered, He came to viſit the ſeed of God. And after they had threatened him, and charged him to depart their nation of Scotland, they let him go. And then he went to Linlithgow, and Stirling, and Johnſtons, and many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, viſiting the people: and ſeveral were convinced. And after he had ſtaid a pretty while, and ſettled ſome meetings, he returned into Northumberland, and into the biſhoprick of Durham, viſiting friends and ſettling meetings as he went; and then returned back again to Swarthmore, and ſtaid amongſt friends awhile, and ſo returned ſouth again. [In 1658 judge Fell died.]</p>
                  <p>And in 1660 he came out of the ſouth into the north, and had a great general meeting about Balby in Yorkſhire; and ſo came on viſiting friends in many places, till he came to Swarthmore again. And king Charles being then come in, the juſtices ſent out warrants, and took him at Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, charging him in their warrants, that he drew away the king's liege people, to the endangering the embruing the nation in blood, and ſent him priſoner to Lancaſter caſtle. And I having a great family, and he being taken in my houſe, I was moved of the Lord to go to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Whitehall; and took with me a declaration, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our principles; and a long time, and much ado I had, to get to him. But at laſt, when I got to him, I told him, If he was guilty of thoſe things, I was guilty, for he was taken in my houſe: and I gave him the paper of our principles, and deſired that he would ſet him at liberty, as he had promiſed that none ſhould ſuffer for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences, and we were of tender conſciences, and deſired nothing but the liberty of our conſciences. And then with much ado, after he had been kept priſoner near half a year at Lancaſter, we got a habeas corpus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him to the King's Bench, where he was releaſed.
<pb n="lxiv" facs="unknown:037441_0063_100D8DE443BAE908"/>And then would I gladly have come home to my great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but was bound in my ſpirit, and could not have freedom to get away for a whole year. And the king had promiſed me ſeveral times, that we ſhould have our liberty: and then the monarchy-men roſe; and then came the great and general impriſonment of friends the nation through: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> could I not have freedom nor liberty to come home, till we had got a general proclamation for all our friends liberty; and then I had freedom and peace to come home.</p>
                  <p>In 1663 he came north again, and to Swarthmore: and then they ſent out warrants, and took him again, and had him to Holcrof before the juſtices, and tendered him the oath of allegiance, and ſent him priſoner to Lancaſter caſtle. And about a month after, the juſtices ſent for me alſo out of my houſe, and tendered me the oath; and ſent me pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to Lancaſter. And the next aſſizes they tendered the oath of allegiance and ſupremacy again to us both, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munired me: but they had miſſed the date and other things in his indictment, and ſo it was quaſhed; but they tendered him the oath again, and kept him priſoner a year and a half at Lancaſter caſtle. And then they ſent him to Scarborough caſtle in Yorkſhire, where they kept him priſoner cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſoldiers moſt of a year and a half; ſo that a friend could ſcarcely have ſpoken to him; yet after that, it pleaſed the Lord that he was releaſed. But I continued in priſon, and a priſoner four years at that time; and an order was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the council, whereby I was ſet at liberty. And in that time I went down into Cornwall with my ſon and daughter Lower, and came back by London to the yearly meeting; and there I met with him again: And then he told me, The time was drawing towards our marriage, but he might firſt go into Ireland. And a little before this time was he priſoner in his own country at Leiceſter for awhile; and then releaſed. And ſo into Ireland he went: and I went into Kent and Suſſex; and came back to London again; and afterward I went to the weſt, towards Briſtol, in 1669, and there I ſtaid till he came over from Ireland, which was eleven years after my former huſband's deceaſe. In Ireland he had had a great ſervice for the Lord and his eternal truth amongſt friends and many people there, but eſcaped many dangers, and times of being taken priſoner, they having lain in wait aforehand for him in many places; and being returned, at Briſtol he declared his intentions of
<pb n="lxv" facs="unknown:037441_0064_100D8DE68CC220E8"/>marriage; and there accordingly our marriage was ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: and then within ten days after I came homewards; and my huſband ſtaid up and down in the countries amongſt friends, viſiting them.</p>
                  <p>Soon after I came home, there came another order from the council to caſt me into priſon again; and the ſheriff of Lancaſhire ſent his bailiff, and pulled me out of my own houſe, and had me priſoner to Lancaſter caſtle, upon the old premunire; where I continued a whole year: and moſt part of all that time I was ſick and weakly, and alſo my huſband was weak and ſickly at that time. After awhile he recovered, and went about to get me out of priſon; and a diſcharge at laſt was got under the great ſeal, and ſo I was ſet at liberty: and then I was to go up to London again, for my huſband was intending for America; and he was full two years away before he came back again to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: and arriving at Briſtol, he came thence to London, and intended to have come to the middle of the nation with me. But when we came into ſome parts of Worceſterſhire, they got there information of him; and one juſtice Parker by his warrant ſent him and my ſon Lower to Worceſter gaol; and the juſtices there tendered him the oath, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munired him, but releaſed my ſon Lower; who ſtaid with him moſt of the time he was priſoner there.</p>
                  <p>And after ſome time he fell ſick in a long lingering ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and many times was very ill; ſo they wrote to me from London, that if I would ſee him alive, I might go to him; which accordingly I did. And after I had tarried ſeventeen weeks with him at Worceſter, and no diſcharge like to be obtained for him, I went up to London, and wrote to the king an account of his long impriſonment, and that he was taken in his travel homewards; and that he was ſick and weak, and not like to live, if they kept him long there. And I went with it to Whitehall myſelf; and I met with the king, and gave him the paper: and he ſaid, I muſt go to the chancellor, he could do nothing in it. Then I writ alſo to the lord chancellor, and went to his houſe, and gave him my paper, and ſpoke to him, That the king had left it wholly to him; and if he did not take pity, and releaſe him out of that priſon. I feared he would end his days there. And the lord chancellor Finch was a very tender man, and ſpoke to the judge, who gave out an habeas corpus preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And when we got it, we ſent it down to Worceſter; and they would not part with him at firſt, but ſaid, he was
<pb n="lxvi" facs="unknown:037441_0065_100D8DE8AD1A95C8"/>premunired, and was not to go out on that manner. And then we were forced to go to judge North, and to the attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-general, and we got another order, and ſent down from them; and with much ado, and great labour and induſtry of William Mead, and other friends, we got him up to London, where he appeared at Weſtminſter Hall at the King's Bench, before judge Hales, who was a very honeſt, tender man; and he knew they had impriſoned him but in envy. So that which they had againſt him was read; and our counſel pleaded, that he was taken up in his travel and journey; and there was but little ſaid till he was acquitted. And this was the laſt priſon that he was in, being freed by the court of King's Bench.</p>
                  <p>When he was at liberty, he recovered again; and then I was very deſirous to go home with him, which we did; and this was the firſt time that he came to Swarthmore after we were married, and he ſtaid here about two years, and then went to London again to the yearly meeting; and after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while went into Holland, and ſome parts of Germany, where he ſtaid a pretty while, and then returned to London again at the next yearly meeting. And after he had ſtaid awhile in and about London, he came into the north to Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more again, and ſtaid that time nigh two years; and then he grew weakly, being troubled with pains and aches, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had many ſore and long travels, beatings, and hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments. But after ſome time he rode to York, and ſo paſſed on through Nottinghamſhire and ſeveral counties, viſiting friends till he came to London to the yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtaid there and thereabouts till he finiſhed his courſe, and laid down his head in peace.</p>
                  <p>And though the Lord had provided an outward habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him, yet he was not willing to ſtay at it, becauſe it was ſo remote and far from London, where his ſervice moſt lay. And my concern for God and his holy eternal truth was then in the north, where God had placed and ſet me; and likewiſe for the ordering and governing of my children and family; ſo that we were willing both of us to live apart ſome years upon God's account and his truth's ſervice, and to deny ourſelves of that comfort which we might have had in being together, for the ſake and ſervice of the Lord and his truth. And if any took occaſion, or judged hard of us becauſe of that, the Lord will judge them; for we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. And for my own part, I was willing to make many long journeys, for taking away all occaſion of evil thoughts:
<pb n="lxvii" facs="unknown:037441_0066_100D8DEBB5009E68"/>and though I lived two hundred miles from London, yet have I been nine times there, upon the Lord's and his truth's account; and of all the times that I was at London, this laſt time was moſt comfortable, that the Lord was pleaſed to give me ſtrength and ability to travel that great journey, being ſeventy-ſix years of age, to ſee my dear huſband, who was better in his health and ſtrength than many times I had ſeen him before. I look upon it that the Lord's ſpecial hand was in it that I ſhould go then, for he lived but about half a year after I left him; which makes me admire the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in ordering my journey at that time.</p>
                  <p>And now he hath finiſhed his courſe and his teſtimony, and is entered into his eternal reſt and felicity. I truſt in the ſame powerful God, that his holy arm and power will carry me through, whatever he hath yet for me to do; and that he will be my ſtrength and ſupport, and the bearer-up of my head unto the end and in the end. For I know his faithfulneſs and goodneſs, and I have experience of his love; to whom be glory and powerful dominion for ever. Amen.</p>

Of which truth he was made an able miniſter, and one, if not the firſt promulgator of it in our age; who, though of no great literature, nor ſeeming much learned as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being hid from the wiſdom of this world, yet he had the tongue of the learned, and could ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to the conditions and capacities of moſt, eſpecially to them that were weary and wanted ſoul's reſt, being deep in the divine myſteries of the kingdom of God. And the word of life and ſalvation through him reached into many ſouls,
<pb n="lxviii" facs="unknown:037441_0067_100D8DED4D7DA4D0"/>whereby many were convinced of their great duty of inward retiring to wait upon God; and as they became diligent in the performance of that ſervice, were alſo raiſed to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſame everlaſting goſpel of peace and glad tidings to others; who are as ſeals to his miniſtry both in this and other nations, and may poſſibly give a more full account thereof. Howbeit we knowing his unwearied diligence, not ſparing but ſpending himſelf in the work and ſervice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was choſen and called of God, could not but give this ſhort teſtimony of his faithfulneſs therein, and likewiſe of his tender love and care towards us; who as a tender father to children, in which capacity we ſtood, being ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto him, he never failed to give us his wholeſome counſel and advice. And not only ſo, but, as a father in Chriſt, he took care of the whole family and houſhold of faith, which the Lord had made him an eminent overſeer of, and endued him with ſuch an excellent ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, to propoſe and direct helps and advantages to the well-ordering and eſtabliſhing of affairs and government in the church, as now are found very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable thereunto, and have greatly diſappointed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the falſe, looſe, and libertine ſpirit in ſome, who to their confuſion have endeavoured, by ſeparation and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to diſturb the church's peace. And although many of that ſort have at ſundry times ſhot their poiſonous darts at him, publickly in print, and privately other ways, yet he has always been preſerved by the heavenly power of God out of the reach of their envy, and all perils and difficulties that attended on their account; who, as a ſixed ſtar in the firmament of God's power, did conſtantly abide, and held his integrity to the laſt, being of a ſweet ſavory life, and as to converſation kept his garments clean: and though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly dead yet liveth, and his memory is right precious unto us; and it is and will be to all that abide in the love of truth, and have not declined the way of it. For he was one of the Lord's worthies, valiant for the truth upon earth, not turning his back in the day of battle; but his bow ſtill abiding in its ſtrength, he, through many hardſhips, brought gladneſs and refreſhment to Iſrael's camp, being aſſiſled by the might of that power that always put the armi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="lxix" facs="unknown:037441_0068_100D8DEF6B761D28"/>its full ſeaſon, and to that habitation of ſafety where the wicked ceaſe from troubling and the weary be at reſt.</p>

                  <head>An EPISTLE by way of TESTIMONY to Friends and Brethren of the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings in England, Wales, and elſewhere, concerning the Deceaſe of our faithful Brother GEORGE FOX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">From our Second Day's Morning-Meeting in London, the 26th of the 11th month, 1690.</head>
                  <p>DEAR and truly beloved friends, brethren, and ſiſters in Chriſt Jeſus, our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and tenderly ſalute you all in his free and tender love, wherewith he hath graciouſly viſited us, and largely ſhed it abroad in our ſouls, to our own unſpeakable comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and towards his whole heritage and offspring: bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his pure and powerful name for evermore. And our ſouls do truly and fervently deſire, and breathe unto the God of all our mercies, that you all may be preſerved and kept truly faithful and diligent in his work and ſervice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your heavenly calling and endowments, with his light, grace, and truth unto the end of your days; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing livingly engaged thereby all your appointed time to ſerve him, and to wait till your change come; that none may neglect that true improvement of your times and talents that God has afforded you here for your eternal advantage hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that inheritance and life immortal that never fades away. And that the whole flock and heritage of Chriſt Jeſus, which he has purchaſed and bought for himſelf with a price incorruptible, may always be preſerved in his own pure love and life, ſo as to grow, increaſe, and proſper in the ſame, and thereby be kept in love, unity, and peace with one
<pb n="lxx" facs="unknown:037441_0069_100D8DF20B152498"/>another, as becomes his true and faithful followers, is that which our very hearts and ſouls deſire, being often truly comforted and enlarged in the living ſenſe and feeling of the increaſe and aboundings thereof among faithful friends and brethren.</p>
                  <p>And dear brethren and ſiſters, unto this our tender ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we are concerned, in brotherly love and true tender-heartedneſs, to add and impart unto you ſome account of the deceaſe of our dear and elder brother in Chriſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his and his church's true and faithful ſervant and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter GEORGE FOX, whom it hath pleaſed the Lord to take unto himſelf, as he hath divers others of his faithful ſervants and miniſters of late time; who have faithfully ſerved out their generation, and finiſhed their teſtimony and courſe with joy and peace. Howbeit, O dear brethren and friends! that ſo many worthies in Iſrael, and ſerviceable inſtruments in the Lord's hand, are of late taken away and removed from us, ſo ſoon one after another, appears a diſpenſation that deeply and ſorrowfully affects us and many more, whoſe hearts are upright and tender towards God and one to another in the truth. The conſideration of the depth, weight, and meaning thereof is very weighty upon our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, tho' their precious life and teſtimony lives with us, as being of that ſame body, united to one head, even Jeſus Chriſt; in which we ſtill, and hope ever ſhall have ſecret comfort and union with them, whom the Lord has removed and taken to himſelf, out of their earthly tabernacles and houſes, into their heavenly and everlaſting manſions.</p>
                  <p>This our dear brother, GEORGE FOX, was enabled by the Lord's power to preach the truth fully and effectually in our publick meeting in White Hart Court, by Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church-ſtreet, London, on the 11th day of this inſtant 11th month, 1690: after which he ſaid, "I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear." He was the ſame day taken with ſome illneſs or indiſpoſition of body more than uſual, and continued weak in body for two days after at our friend Henry Gouldney's houſe in the ſame court, cloſe by the meeting-houſe, in much contentment and peace, and very ſenſible to the laſt. In which time he mentioned divers friends, and ſent for ſome in particular; to whom he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his mind for the ſpreading friends books and truth in the world and through the nations thereof, as his ſpirit in the Lord's love and power was univerſally ſet and bent for truth and righteouſneſs, and the making known the way thereof
<pb n="lxxi" facs="unknown:037441_0070_100D8DF4CE977170"/>to the nations and people afar off; ſignifying alſo to ſome friends, "That all is well; and the ſeed of God reigns over all, and over death itſelf: that though he was weak in body, yet that the power of God is over all, and the ſeed reigns over all diſorderly ſpirits:" which were his wonted ſenſible expreſſions, being in the living faith and ſenſe thereof, which he kept to the end. And on the 13th inſtant, between the ninth and tenth hour of the night, he quietly departed this life in peace, being two days after the Lord enabled him to publiſh and preach the bleſſed truth in the meeting as aforeſaid. So that he clearly and evidently ended his days in his faithful teſtimony, in perfect love and unity with his brethren, and peace and good-will to all men, being about ſixty and ſix years of age, as we underſtand, when he departed this life.</p>
                  <p>And on the ſixteenth of this inſtant, being the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his funeral, a very great concourſe of friends and other people aſſembled at our meeting-houſe in White Hart Court aforeſaid, about the mid-day, in order to attend his body to our burying place near Bunhillfields, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, as friends laſt office of love and reſpect due on that account. The meeting was held about two hours, with great and heavenly ſolemnity, manifeſtly attended with the Lord's bleſſed power and preſence; and divers living teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies given from a lively remembrance and ſenſe of this his dear ancient ſervant, his bleſſed miniſtry and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the breaking forth of this goſpel-day; his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life, long and great travels, and labours of love in the everlaſting goſpel, for the turning and gathering many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands from darkneſs to the light of Chriſt Jeſus, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true faith; alſo of his manifold ſufferings, afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and oppoſitions which he met withal for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teſtimony, both from his open adverſaries and falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and his preſervations, dominion, and deliverances out of them all by the power of God: to whom the glory and honour was and is aſcribed, in raiſing up and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this his faithful witneſs and miniſter to the end of his days, whoſe bleſſed memorial will everlaſting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He loved truth and righteouſneſs, and bore faithful teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt deceit and the myſtery of iniquity; and often, of late time eſpecially, warned friends againſt covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, earthly-mindedneſs, againſt getting into the earth, and into a brittle ſpirit; and the younger ſort, againſt looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pride of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="lxxii" facs="unknown:037441_0071_100D8DF661F48140"/>
A few days before he died he had a great concern upon his mind concerning ſome in whom the Lord's power was working, to lead them into a miniſtry and teſtimony to his truth; who, through their too much entangling themſelves in the things of this world, did make themſelves unready to anſwer the call and leadings of the power of God, and hurt the gift that was beſtowed upon them, and did not take that regard to their ſervice and miniſtry as they ought. And mentioned the apoſtle's exhortation to Timothy, to <q>take heed to his miniſtry, and to ſhew himſelf approved,</q> &amp;c. And expreſſed his grief concerning ſuch as preferred their own buſineſs before the Lord's buſineſs, and ſought the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing worldly concerns before the concerns of truth: and concluded with a tender and fatherly exhortation to all to whom God had imparted of his heavenly treaſure, that they would improve it faithfully; and be diligent in the Lord's work, that the earth might be ſown with the ſeed of the kingdom, and God's harveſt might be minded by thoſe whom he had called and enabled to labour therein: and that ſuch would commit the care of their outward concerns to the Lord, who would care for them, and give a bleſſing to them. However, this is not mentioned to encourage any to run unſent, or without being called of God.</p>
                  <p>Many are living witneſſes that the Lord raiſed him up by his power, to proclaim his mighty day to the nations, and made him an effectual inſtrument in our day to turn many from darkneſs to light, and from Satan's power to God; and freely to ſuffer and bear all reproaches, and the manifold perſecutions, buffetings, halings, ſtonings, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, and cruelties, that were in the beginning and for ſome time inflicted on him and others, for the name of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>He was in his teſtimony as a fixed ſtar in the firmament of God's power, where all that be truly wiſe, and that turn many to righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever and ever. He knew and preached the myſtery of Chriſt revealed, the life and ſubſtance, and the power of godlineſs, above all ſhadows and forms: the Lord endued him with a hidden wiſdom and life. He loved peace, and earneſtly laboured for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal love, unity, peace, and good order in the churches of Chriſt: and where-ever he met with the contrary, it was his great grief and burden. He was greatly for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of faithful labourers in the Lord's work; and it
<pb n="lxxiii" facs="unknown:037441_0072_100D7F34499FCA78"/>was a great offence and grief to him to have their teſtimony weakened, or labours ſlighted, through prejudice in any profeſſing truth.</p>
                  <p>And inaſmuch as the Lord ſuffered him not to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to the will of his enemies and perſecutors, who often heretofore breathed out cruelty againſt him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his deſtruction; but in his good pleaſure ſo fairly and quietly took him away in his own time, when his teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony was ſo bleſſedly finiſhed, and his work accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this is all remarkable, and worthy of ſerious and due obſervation, as being a ſpecial and divine providence and wiſdom of God; to whom we aſcribe the glory of all, and not unto man or creatures. Though we muſt needs allow and own that good report and due eſteem which faithful elders, miniſters, and ſervants of God and Chriſt have by faith obtained, to the praiſe of that bleſſed Power that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them in every age in their day; many whereof are even of late taken away from the evil to come, and are at reſt in the Lord, out of the reach of all envy and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the wicked cannot trouble them any more.</p>
                  <p>And we muſt patiently bear our parting with them, and our loſs and ſorrow on that account, with reſpect to their unſpeakable gain: yet how can we avoid being deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſadneſs of ſpirit and brokenneſs of heart, under the ſenſe and conſideration of ſuch loſs and revolutions, which we have cauſe to believe are ominous of calamities to the wicked world, though of good to the righteous? Did the death of plain upright Jacob, namely Iſrael, who was as a prince of God, ſo deeply affect both his own children and kindred, as that they made a great and ſore lamentation for him; and even the Egyptians alſo, that they bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſeventy days? And the death of Moſes ſo deeply affect the Children of Iſrael, as that they "did weep and mourn for him in the plain of Moab thirty days?" And the death of Stephen, that faithful martyr of Jeſus, ſo deeply affect certain men fearing God, as <q>that they made great lamentation for him?</q> And the apoſtle Paul, when taking his leave of the elders of the church of Epheſus and telling them, "they ſhould ſee his face no more?" If this did ſo deeply affect them, that they "wept all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, ſorrowing moſt of all for theſe words, that they ſhould ſee his face no more;" with many more of this kind, how then can we otherwiſe chooſe but be deeply affected with ſorrow and ſadneſs of heart, though not as thoſe which
<pb n="lxxiv" facs="unknown:037441_0073_100D8DFA22398920"/>have no hope, when ſo many of our ancient, dear, and faithful brethren, with whom we have had much ſweet ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, are removed from us one after another? (We pray God raiſe up and increaſe more ſuch!) Yet muſt we all contentedly ſubmit to the good pleaſure and wiſdom of the Lord our God in all theſe things; who taketh away, and none can hinder him, nor may any ſay unto him, "What doſt thou?" Yet we have cauſe to bleſs the Lord that he hath of late raiſed, and is raiſing up more to publiſh his name in the earth; and we that yet remain have but a ſhort time to ſtay after them that are gone, but we ſhall be gone to them alſo. The Lord God of life keep us all faithful in his holy truth, love, unity, and life to the end. He hath a great work ſtill to bring forth in the earth, and great things to bring to paſs, in order to make way for truth and righteouſneſs to take place therein; and that his ſeed may come forth and be gathered, and the power and kingdom of our God and of his Chriſt made known and exalted in the earth, unto the ends thereof.</p>
                  <p>Dear friends and brethren, Be faithful till death, that a crown of life you may obtain. All dwell in the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, in union and peace in him; to whom we tenderly commit you to keep and ſtrengthen you, bleſs and preſerve you to the end of your days. In whoſe dear and tender love we remain—</p>

                  <head>THOMAS ELLWOOD'S Account of that eminent and honourable Servant of the Lord, GEORGE FOX.</head>
                  <p>THIS holy man was raiſed up by God in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, for an extraordinary work, even to awaken the ſleeping world, by proclaiming the mighty day of the Lord to the nations, and publiſhing again the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goſpel to the inhabitants of the earth, after the long and diſmal night of apoſtacy and darkneſs. For this work the Lord began to prepare him by many and various trials and exerciſes from his very childhood; and having fitted and furniſhed him for it, he called him into it very young; and made him inſtrumental, by the effectual working of the Holy Ghoſt, through his miniſtry, to call many others into the ſame work, and to turn many thouſands from darkneſs to the light of Chriſt, and from the power of Satan unto God. I knew him not till they year 1660: from that time to the time of his death, I knew him well, converſed with him often, obſerved him much, loved him dearly, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him truly; and upon good experience can ſay, he was indeed an heavenly-minded man, zealous for the name of the Lord, and preferred the honour of God before all things.</p>
                  <p>He was valiant for the truth, bold in aſſerting it, patient in ſuffering for it, unwearied in labouring in it, ſteady in his teſtimony to it; immovable as a rock. Deep he was in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge, clear in opening heavenly myſteries, plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer. He was richly endued with heavenly wiſdom, quick in diſcerning, ſound in judgment, able and ready in giving, diſcreet in keeping counſel; a lover of righteouſneſs, an encourager of
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="unknown:037441_0075_100D8DFECF84A418"/>virtue, juſtice, temperance, meekneſs, purity, chaſtity, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, humility, charity and ſelf-denial in all, both by word and example. Graceful he was in countenance, manly in perſonage, grave in geſture, courteous in converſation, weighty in communication, inſtructive in diſcourſe; free from affectation in ſpeech or carriage. A ſevere reprover of hard and obſtinate ſinners; a mild and gentle admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſuch as were tender, and ſenſible of their failings; not apt to reſent perſonal wrongs; eaſy to forgive injuries; but zealouſly earneſt where the honour of God, the proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of truth, the peace of the church were concerned. Very tender, compaſſionate, and pitiful he was to all that were under any ſort of affliction; full of brotherly love, full of fatherly care: for indeed the care of the churches of Chriſt was daily upon him, the proſperity and peace whereof he ſtudiouſly ſought. Beloved he was of God, beloved of God's people; and (which was not the leaſt part of his honour) the common butt of all apoſtates envy, whoſe good notwithſtanding he earneſtly ſought.</p>
                  <p>He lived to ſee the deſire of his ſoul, the ſpreading of that bleſſed principle of divine light through many of the European nations, and not a few of the American iſlands and provinces, and the gathering many thouſands into an eſtabliſhment therein; which the Lord vouchſafed him the honour to be the firſt effectual publiſher of in this latter age of the world. And having fought a good fight, finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his could, and kept the faith, his righteous ſoul, freed from the earthly tabernacle, in which he had led an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life of holineſs, was tranſlated into thoſe heavenly manſions, where Chriſt our Lord went to prepare a place for his; there to poſſeſs that glorious crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is laid up for, and ſhall be given by the Lord the righteous judge to all them that love his appearance. Ages to come and people yet unborn ſhall call him bleſſed, and bleſs the Lord for raiſing of him up: and bleſſed ſhall we alſo be, if we ſo walk as we had him for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for whom this teſtimony lives in my heart, He lived and died the SERVANT of the LORD.</p>

                  <head>A JOURNAL OR HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, TRAVELS, SUFFERINGS, &amp;c. OF GEORGE FOX.</head>
                  <p>THAT all may know the dealings of the LORD with me, and the various exerciſes, trials, and troubles through which be led me; in order to prepare and fit me for the work unto which he had appointed me, and may thereby be drawn to admire and glorify his Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs; I think fit, before I proceed to ſet forth my publick travels in the ſervice of Truth, briefly to mention how it was with me in my youth, and how the work of the LORD was begun, and gradually carried on in me, even from my childhood.</p>
                  <p>I was born in the month called July, in the year 1624, at Drayton in the Clay, in Leiceſterſhire. My father's name was Chriſtopher Fox. He was by profeſſion a weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, an honeſt man, and there was a Seed of GOD in him. The neighbours called him Righteous Chriſter. My mother was an upright woman; her maiden name was Mary Lago, of the family of the Lago's, and of the ſtock of the martyrs.</p>
                  <p>In my very young years I had a gravity and ſtayedneſs of mind and ſpirit not uſual in children; inſomuch that when I have ſeen old men carry themſelves lightly and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly towards each other, a diſlike thereof hath riſen in my heart, and I have ſaid within myſelf. <q>If ever I come to be a man, ſurely I ſhould not do ſo, nor be ſo wanton.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="unknown:037441_0079_100D8EB560F9E8E8"/>
When I came to eleven years of age, I knew pureneſs and righteouſneſs; for while I was a child I was taught how to walk ſo as to be kept pure. The LORD taught me to be faithful in all things, and to act faithfully two ways, viz. inwardly to GOD, and outwardly to man; and to keep to yea and nay in all things. For the LORD ſhewed me, though the people of the world have mouths full of deceit and changeable words, that I was to keep to yea and nay in all things, that my words ſhould be few and ſavoury, ſeaſoned with grace; and that I might not eat and drink to make myſelf wanton, but for health, uſing the creatures in their ſervice, as ſervants in their places, to the glory of him that created them: they being in their covenant, and I being brought up into the covenant, as ſanctified by the Word which was in the beginning, by which all things are upheld, wherein is unity with the creation.</p>
                  <p>But people being ſtrangers to the covenant of life with God, they eat and drink to make themſelves wanton with the creatures, waſting them upon their luſts, living in all filthineſs, and devouring the creation; all this in the world, in the pollutions thereof without God: therefore I was to ſhun all ſuch.</p>
                  <p>As I grew up my relations thought to have made me a prieſt; but others perſuaded to the contrary. Whereupon I was put to a man who was a ſhoe-maker by trade, and dealt in wool. He alſo uſed grazing, and ſold cattle; and a great deal went through my hands. While I was with him he was bleſt, but after I left him he broke and came to nothing. I never wronged man or woman in all that time; for the Lord's power was with me, and over me, to preſerve me. While I was in that ſervice, I uſed in my dealings the word [Verily] and it was a common ſaying among thoſe that knew me, <q>If George ſays verily, there is not altering him.</q> When boys and rude perſons would laugh at me: I let them alone and went my way: but people had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a love to me for my innocency and honeſty.</p>
                  <p>When I came towards nineteen years of age, being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on buſineſs at a fair, one of my couſins, whoſe name was Bradford, a profeſſor, having another profeſſor with him, came and aſked me to drink part of a jug of beer with them, I, being thirſty, went in with them; for I loved any who had a ſenſe of good, or that ſought after the Lord. When we had drank a glaſs apiece, they began to drink healths, and called for more drink, agreeing together, That he that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037441_0080_100D7F4C48348E30"/>would not drink, ſhould pay all. I was grieved that any, who made profeſſion of religion ſhould offer to do ſo. They grieved me very much, having never had ſuch a thing put to me before, by any ſort of people. Wherefore I roſe up, and putting my hand in my pocket, took out a groat, and laid it upon the table before them, ſaying. "If it be ſo, I will leave you." So I went away; and when I had done my buſineſs returned home; but did not go to bed that night, nor could I ſleep; but ſometimes walked up and down, and ſometimes prayed, and cried to the Lord, who ſaid unto me; ☟ <q>Thou ſeeſt how young people go together into vanity, and old people into the earth; thou muſt forſake all, young and old, keep out of all, and be as a ſtranger unto all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then at the command of God, the ninth of the ſeventh month, 1643, I left my relations, and broke off all famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity or fellowſhip with young or old. I paſſed to Lutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth where I ſtaid ſome tirae. From thence I went to Northampton, where alſo I made ſome ſtay; then paſſed to Newport-pagnel, in Buckinghamſhire; where, after I had ſtaid awhile I went to Barnet, in the fourth month called June, in the year 1644. As I thus travelled through the country, profeſſors took notice of me, and ſought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me; but I was afraid of them: for I was ſenſible they did not poſſeſs what they profeſſed. During the time I was at Barnet, a ſtrong temptation to deſpair came upon me. I then ſaw how Chriſt was tempted, and mighty troubles I was in. Sometimes I kept myſelf retired in my chamber, and often walked ſolitary in the Chace to wait upon the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I wondered why theſe things ſhould come to me. I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon myſelf, and ſaid, "Was I ever ſo before?" Then I thought, becauſe I had forſaken my relations, I had done amiſs againſt them. So I was brought to call to mind all my time that I had ſpent, and to conſider whether I had wronged any: but temptations grew more and more, and I was tempted almoſt to deſpair; and when Satan could not effect his deſign upon me that way, he laid ſnares and baits to draw me to commit ſome ſin, whereby he might take advantage to bring me to deſpair. I was about twenty years of age when theſe exerciſes came upon me, and ſome years I continued in that condition in great trouble, and fain I would have put if from me. I went to many a prieſt to look for comfort, but found no comfort from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037441_0081_100D7F4DCC896578"/>
From Barnet I went to London, where I took a lodging, and was under great miſery and trouble there; for I looked upon the great profeſſors of the city of London, and ſaw all was dark and under the chain of darkneſs. I had an uncle there, one Pickering, a baptiſt, and they were tender then: yet I could not impart my mind to him, nor join with them; for I ſaw all, young and old, where they were. Some tender people would have had me ſtaid, but I was fearful, and returned homeward into Leiceſterſhire, having a regard upon my mind to my parents and relations, leſt I ſhould grieve them; who, I underſtood, were troubled at my abſence.</p>
                  <p>Being returned into Leiceſterſhire, my relations would have had me married; but I told them I was but a lad, and muſt get wiſdom. Others would have had me into the auxiliary band among the ſoldiery, but I refuſed, and was grieved that they offered ſuch things to me, being a tender youth. Then I went to Coventry, where I took a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for awhile at a profeſſor's houſe, till people began to be acquainted with me; for there were many tender people in that town. After ſome time I went into my own country again, and continued about a year, in great ſorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and walked many nights by myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Then the prieſt of Drayton, the town of my birth, whoſe name was Nathaniel Stevens, came often to me, and I went often to him; and another prieſt ſometimes came with him; and they would give place to me, to hear me; and I would aſk them queſtions, and reaſon with them. This prieſt Stevens aſked me, <q>Why Chriſt cried out upon the croſs, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</q> And why he ſaid, <q>If it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; yet not my will, but thine be done?</q> I told him; at that time the ſins of all mankind were upon him, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities and tranſgreſſions, with which he was wounded; which he was to bear and to be an offering for, as he was man, but died not as he was God; ſo, in that he died for all men, taſting death for every man, he was an offering for the ſins of the whole world. This I ſpoke, being at that time in a meaſure ſenſible of Chriſt's ſufferings. The prieſt ſaid, <q>It was a very good, full anſwer, and ſuch a one as he had not heard.</q> At that time he would applaud and ſpeak highly of me to others; and what I ſaid in diſcourſe to him on week-days, he would preach of on firſt-days,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037441_0082_100D7F4F64776B30"/>which gave me a diſlike to him. This prieſt afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my great perſecutor.</p>
                  <p>After this I went to another ancient prieſt at Manſetter in Warwickſhire, and reaſoned with him about the ground of deſpair and temptations; but he was ignorant of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: he bid me take tobacco and ſing pſalms. Tobacco was a thing I did not love, and pſalms I was not in a ſtate to ſing; I could not ſing. He bid me come again, and he would tell me many things; but when I came he was angry and pettiſh, for my former words had diſpleaſed him. He told my troubles, ſorrows, and griefs to his ſervants, ſo that it was got among the milk-laſſes. It grieved me that I ſhould open my mind to ſuch a one. I ſaw they were all miſerable comforters, and this increaſed my troubles upon me. I heard of a prieſt living about Tamworth, who was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an experienced man. I went ſeven miles to him, but found him like an empty, hollow caſk. I heard of one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dr. Cradock, of Coventry, and went to him; I aſked him the ground of temptations and deſpair, and how trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles came to be wrought in man? He aſked me, <q>Who was Chriſt's father and mother?</q> I told him Mary was his mother, and that he was ſuppoſed to be the ſon of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph; but he was the Son of God. As we were walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his garden, the alley being narrow, I chanced, in turning, to ſet my foot on the ſide of a bed; at which he raged as if his houſe had been on fire. Thus all our diſcourſe was loſt, and I went away in ſorrow, worſe than I was when I came: I thought them miſerable comforters, and ſaw they were all as nothing to me; for they could not reach my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. After this I went to another, one Macham, a prieſt, in high account. He would needs give me ſome phyſick, and I was to have been let blood; but they could not get one drop of blood from me, either in arms or head, though they endeavoured it, my body being, as it were, dried up with ſorrows, grief, and troubles, which were ſo great upon me, that I could have wiſhed I had never been born, or that I had been born blind, that I might never have ſeen wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs nor vanity; and deaf, that I might never have heard vain and wicked words, or the Lord's name blaſphemed. When the time called Chriſtmas came, while others were feaſting and ſporting themſelves, I looked out poor widows from houſe to houſe, and gave them ſome money. When I was invited to marriages I went to none at all; but the next day, or ſoon after, I would go and viſit them; and if
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037441_0083_100D7F6B5DB20D00"/>they were poor I gave them ſome money; for I had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both to keep myſelf from being chargeable to others, and to adminiſter ſomething to the neceſſities of others.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of the year 1646, as I was going into Coventry, a conſideration aroſe in me, how it was ſaid, that "All chriſtians are believers, both proteſtants and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;" and the Lord opened to me that if all were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, then they were all born of God, and paſſed from death to life; and that none were true believers but ſuch: and though others ſaid they were believers, yet they were not. At another time as I was walking in a field on a firſt-day morning, the Lord opened unto me, <q>That being bred at Oxford or Cambridge was not enough to fit and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify men to be miniſters of Chriſt:</q> and I. wondered at it, becauſe it was the common belief of people. But I ſaw it clearly as the Lord opened it to me, and was ſatisfied and admired the goodneſs of the Lord, who had opened this thing unto me that morning. This ſtruck at prieſt Stevens's miniſtry, namely, that <q>to be bred at Oxford or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge was not enough to make a man fit to be a miniſter of Chriſt.</q> So that which opened in me, I ſaw ſtruck at the prieſt's miniſtry. But my relations were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that I would not go with them to hear the prieſt; for I would go into the orchard or the fields, with my bible, by myſelf. I aſked them, did not the apoſtle ſay to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <q>That they needed no man to teach them, but as the anointing teacheth them?</q> Though they knew this was ſcripture, and that it was true, yet they were grieved becauſe I could not be ſubject in this matter, to go to hear the prieſt with them. I ſaw that to be a true believer was another thing than they looked upon it to be; and I ſaw that being bred at Oxford or Cambridge did not qualify or fit a man to be a miniſter of Chriſt; what then ſhould I follow ſuch for? So neither them, nor any of the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people could I join with; but was as a ſtranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>At another time it was opened in me, <q>That God who made the world did not dwell in temples made with hands.</q> This at the firſt ſeemed ſtrange, becauſe both prieſts and people uſed to call their temples or churches, dreadful places, holy ground, and the temples of God. But the Lord ſhewed me clearly, that he did not dwell in theſe temples which men had commanded and ſet up, but in peoples hearts. Both Stephen and the apoſtle Paul bore
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037441_0084_100D7F6E0DAA3AE0"/>teſtimony, that he did not dwell in temples made with hands, not even in that which he had once commanded to be built, ſince he put an end to the typical diſpenſation; but that his people were his temple, and he dwelt in them. This opened in me, as I walked in the fields to my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's houſe. When I came there, they told me Nathaniel Stevens, the prieſt, had been there, and ſaid, <q>He was afraid of me for going after new lights.</q> I ſmiled in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, knowing what the Lord had opened in me concerning him and his brethren; but I told not my relations, who though they ſaw beyond the prieſts, yet went to hear them, and were grieved becauſe I would not go alſo. But I ſhewed them by the ſcriptures, there was an anointing within man to teach him, and that the Lord would teach his people himſelf. I had great openings concerning the things written in the Revelations; and when I ſpoke of them, the prieſts and profeſſors would ſay, that was a ſealed book, and would have kept me out of it. But I told them, Chriſt could open the ſeals, and that they were the neareſt things to us; for the Epiſtles were written to the ſaints that lived in former ages, but the Revelations were written of things to come.</p>
                  <p>After this I met with a ſort of people that held, women have no ſouls (adding in a light manner) no more than a gooſe. I reproved them, and told them that was not right: for Mary ſaid, <q>My ſoul doth magnify the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Removing to another place I came among a people that relied much on dreams. I told them except they could diſtinguiſh between dream and dream they would confound all together; for there were three ſorts of dreams: multitude of buſineſs ſometimes cauſed dreams; and there were whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings of Satan in man in the night ſeaſon; and there were ſpeakings of God to man in dreams. But theſe people came out of theſe things, and at laſt became friends.</p>
                  <p>Though I had great openings, yet great trouble and temptations came many times upon me, ſo that when it was day I wiſhed for night, and when it was night I wiſhed for day; and by reaſon of the openings I had in my troubles, I could ſay as David ſaid, <q>Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge.</q> When I had openings they anſwered one another, and anſwered the ſcriptures; for I had great openings of the ſcriptures; and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037441_0085_100D7F49F2061378"/>when I was in troubles, one trouble alſo anſwered to another.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of the year 1647 I was moved of the Lord to go into Derbyſhire, where I met with ſome friendly people, and had many diſcourſes with them. Then paſſing into the Peak-country, I met with more friendly people, and with ſome in empty high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>notions. Travelling through ſome parts of Leiceſterſhire, and into Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, I met with a tender people, and a very tender wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe name was Elizabeth Hootton. With theſe I had ſome meetings and diſcourſes; but my troubles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and I was often under great temptations. I faſted much, walked abroad in ſolitary places many days, and often took my bible, and ſate in hollow trees and loneſome places till night came on; and frequently in the night walked mournfully about by myſelf: for I was a man of ſorrows in the time of the firſt workings of the Lord in me.</p>
                  <p>During all this time I was never joined in profeſſion of religion with any, but gave up myſelf to the Lord, having forſaken all evil company, taken leave of father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all other relations, and travelled up and down as a ſtranger in the earth, which way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a chamber to myſelf in the town where I came, and tarrying ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs in a place: for I durſt not ſtay long in a place, being afraid both of profeſſor and profane, leſt, being a tender young man, I ſhould be hurt by converſing much with either. For which reaſon I kept much as a ſtranger, ſeeking hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdom, and getting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord alone. Though my exerciſes and troubles were very great, yet were they not ſo continual but that I had ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and was ſometimes brought into ſuch an heavenly joy, that I thought I had been in Abraham's boſom. As I cannot declare the miſery I was in, it was ſo great and heavy upon me, ſo neither can I ſet forth the mercies of God unto me in all my miſery. O the everlaſting love of God to my ſoul, when I was in great diſtreſs! when my troubles and torments were great, then was his love exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great. Thou, Lord, makeſt a fruitful field a barren wilderneſs, and a barren wilderneſs a fruitful field! thou bringeſt down and ſetteſt up! thou killeſt and makeſt alive! all honour and glory be to thee, O Lord of Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y! The knowledge of thee in the Spirit is life; but that knowledge
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037441_0086_100D7F6FA172B2C8"/>which is fleſhly works death. While there is this knowledge in the fleſh, deceit and ſelf will conform to any thing, and will ſay Yes, Yes, to that it doth not know. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which the world hath, of what the prophets and apoſtles ſpake, is a fleſhly knowledge; and the apoſtates from the life, in which the prophets and apoſtles were, have got their words, the holy ſcriptures, in a form, but not in the life nor ſpirit that gave them forth. So they all lie in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and are making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof, but not to fulfil the law and command of Chriſt in his power and Spirit: for that, they ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do; but to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, that they can do with delight.</p>
                  <p>After I had received that opening from the Lord, that to be bred at Oxford or Cambridge, was not ſufficient to fit a man to be a miniſter of Chriſt, I regarded the prieſts leſs, and looked more after the diſſenting people. Among them I ſaw there was ſome tenderneſs; and many of them came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be convinced, for they had ſome openings. But as I had forſaken the prieſts, ſo I left the ſeparate preachers alſo, and thoſe called the moſt experienced people; for I ſaw there was none among them all that could ſpeak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, ſo that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do; then, O then, I heard a voice which ſaid, "There is one, even Chriſt Jeſus, that can ſpeak to thy condition." When I heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord let me ſee why there was none upon the earth that could ſpeak to my condition, namely, that I might give him all the glory. For all are concluded under ſin, and ſhut up in unbelief, as I had been, that Jeſus Chriſt might have the pre-eminence, who enlightens, and gives grace, faith, and power. Thus when God doth work, who ſhall let it? This I knew experimentally. My deſires after the Lord grew ſtronger, and zeal in the pure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of Chriſt alone, without the help of any man, book, or writing. For though I read the ſcriptures that ſpake of Chriſt and of God, yet I knew him not but by revelation, as he who hath the key did open, and as the Father of life drew me to his Son by his Spirit. Then the Lord gently led me along, and let me ſee his love, which was endleſs and eternal, ſurpaſſing all the knowledge that men have in the natural ſtate, or can get by hiſtory or books. That love let me ſee myſelf, as I was without him;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037441_0087_100D8E0858005D08"/>and I was afraid of all company: for I ſaw them perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where they were, through the love of God which let me ſee myſelf. I had not fellowſhip with any people, prieſts, nor profeſſors, nor any ſort of ſeparated people, but with Chriſt who hath the key, and opened the door of light and life unto me. I was afraid of all carnal talk and talkers, for I could ſee nothing but corruptions, and the life lay under the burden of corruptions. When I was in the deep, under all ſhut up, I could not believe that I ſhould ever overcome; my troubles, my ſorrows, and my tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſo great, that I often thought I ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired, I was ſo tempted. But when Chriſt opened to me how he was tempted by the ſame devil, and had overcome him, and had bruiſed his head; and that through him and his power, light, grace, and Spirit, I ſhould overcome alſo, I had confidence in him. So he it was that opened to me when I was ſhut up, and had neither hope nor faith. Chriſt, who had enlightened me, gave me his light to believe in, and gave me hope, which is himſelf revealed in me, and gave me his ſpirit and grace, which I found ſufficient in the deeps and in weakneſs. Thus in the deepeſt miſeries, in the greateſt ſorrows and temptations that beſet me, the Lord in his mercy did keep me. I found two thirſts in me; the one after the creatures, to have got help and ſtrength there; and the other after the Lord the Creator, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and I ſaw all the world could do me no good. If I had had a king's diet, palace and attendance, all would have been as nothing; for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power. I ſaw profeſſors, prieſts, and people, were whole and at eaſe in that condition which was my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and they loved that which I would have been rid of. But the Lord did ſtay my deſires upon himſelf, from whom my help came, and my care was caſt upon him alone. Therefore, all wait patiently upon the Lord, whatſoever condition you be in; wait in the grace and truth that comes by Jeſus; for if ye ſo do, there is a promiſe to you, and the Lord God will fulfil it in you. Bleſſed are all they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that do indeed hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, they ſhall be ſatisfied with it. I have found it ſo, praiſed be the Lord who filleth with it, and ſatisfieth the deſires of the hungry ſoul. O let the houſe of the ſpiritual Iſrael ſay, His mercy endureth for ever! It is the great love of God, to make a wilderneſs of that which is pleaſant to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye and fleſhly mind; and to make a fruitful field of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037441_0088_100D8E09ED3B48E0"/>a barren wilderneſs. This is the great work of God. But while people's minds run in the earthly, after the creatures and changeable things, changeable ways and religions, and changeable uncertain teachers, their minds are in bondage, and they are brittle and changeable, toſſed up and down with windy doctrines, thoughts, notions, and things; their minds being out of the unchangeable truth in the inward parts, the light of Jeſus Chriſt, which would keep them to the unchangeable. He is the way to the Father; who in all my troubles preſerved me by his Spirit and power, praiſed be his holy name for ever!</p>
                  <p>Again, I heard a voice which ſaid, Thou ſerpent, thou doſt ſeek to deſtroy the life, but canſt not; for the ſword which keepeth the tree of life ſhall deſtroy thee. So Chriſt, the Word of God, that bruiſed the head of the ſerpent, the deſtroyer, preſerved me; my mind being joined to his good ſeed that bruiſed the head of this ſerpent, the deſtroyer. This inward life ſprung up in me, to anſwer all the oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſors and prieſts, and brought ſcriptures to my memory to refute them with.</p>
                  <p>At another time I ſaw the great love of God, and was filled with admiration at the infiniteneſs of it. I ſaw what was caſt out from God, and what entered into God's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and how by Jeſus, the opener of the door by his heavenly key, the entrance was given. I ſaw death, how it had paſſed upon all men, and oppreſſed the ſeed of God in man, and in me; and how I in the ſeed came forth, and what the promiſe was to. Yet it was ſo, that there ſeemed to be two pleading in me; and queſtionings aroſe in my mind about gifts and prophecies, and I was tempted again to deſpair, as if I had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt. I was in great perplexity and trouble for many days; yet I gave up myſelf to the Lord ſtill. One day, when I had been walking ſolitarily abroad, and was come home, I was taken up in the love of God, ſo that I could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the greatneſs of his love; and while I was in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it was opened unto me by the eternal light and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and I therein clearly ſaw. That all was done and to be done in and by Chriſt; and how he conquers and deſtroys this tempter the devil, and all his works, and is atop of him; and that all theſe troubles were good for me, and temptations for the trial of my faith, which Chriſt had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me. The Lord opened me, that I ſaw through all theſe troubles and temptations. My living faith was raiſed, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037441_0089_100D8E0CB2CF8D98"/>I ſaw all was done by Chriſt the life, and my belief was in him. When at any time my condition was veiled, my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret belief was ſtayed firm, and hope underneath held me, as an anchor in the bottom of the ſea, and anchored my immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul to its biſhop, cauſing it to ſwim above the ſea, the world, where all the raging waves, foul weather, tempeſts and temptations are. But O! then did I ſee my troubles, trials, and temptations more clearly than ever I had done. As the light appeared, all appeared that is out of the light; darkneſs, death, temptations, the unrighteous, the ungodly; all was manifeſt and ſeen in the light. After this, a pure fire appeared in me: then I ſaw how he ſat as a refiner's fire, and as the fuller's ſope. Then the ſpiritual diſcerning came into me; by which I diſcerned my own thoughts, groans, and ſighs; and what it was that veiled me, and what it was that opened me. That which could not abide in the patience, nor endure the fire, in the light I found to be the groans of the fleſh, that could not give up to the will of God; which had ſo veiled me, that I could not be patient in all trials, troubles, anguiſhes, and perplexities; could not give up ſelf to die by the croſs, the power of God, that the living and quickened might follow him, and that that which would cloud and veil from the preſence of Chriſt, that which the ſword of the Spirit cuts down, and which muſt die, might not be kept alive. I diſcerned the groans of the Spirit, which opened me, and made interceſſion to God: in which Spirit is the true waiting upon God, for the redemption of the body, and of the whole creation. By this true Spirit, in which the true ſighing is I ſaw over the falſe ſighings and groanings. By this inviſible Spirit I diſcerned all the falſe hearing, the falſe ſeeing, and the falſe ſmelling, which was above the Spirit, quenching and grieving it; and that all that were there were in confuſion and deceit, where the falſe aſking and praying is, in deceit and atop, in that nature and tongue that takes God's holy name in vain, wallows in the Egyptian ſea, and aſketh but hath not; for they hate his light, reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, turn the grace into wantonneſs, rebel againſt the Spirit, and are erred from the faith they ſhould aſk in, and from the Spirit they ſhould pray by. He that knoweth theſe things in the true Spirit can witneſs them. The divine light of Chriſt manifeſteth all things, the ſpiritual fire trieth and ſevereth all things. Several things did I then ſee, as the Lord opened them to me; for he ſhewed me that which can live in his holy
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037441_0090_100D8E0EAC19FE48"/>refining fire, and that can live to God under his law. He made me ſenſible, how the law and the prophets were until John; and how the leaſt in the everlaſting kingdom of God is greater than John. The pure and perfect law of God is over the fleſh, to keep it and its works, which are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, under, by the perfect law: and the law of God which is perfect, anſwers the perfect principle of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> every one. This law the Jews, the prophets, and John were to perform and do. None knows the giver of this law but by the Spirit of God; neither can any truly read it, or hear its voice, but by the Spirit of God. He that can receive it, let him. John, who was one of the greateſt prophets that was born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, bore witneſs to the light which Chriſt, the great heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophet, hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal; that they might believe in it, become the children of light, and ſo have the light of life, and not come into condemnation. For the true belief ſtands in the light that condemns all evil; and the devil, who is the prince of darkneſs, and would draw out of the light into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They that walk in this light, come to the mountain of the houſe of God, eſtabliſhed above all mountains, and to God's teaching, who will teach them his ways. Theſe things were opened to me in the light.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo the mountains burning up, and the rubbiſh, the rough, crooked ways and places made ſmooth and plain, that the Lord might come into his tabernacle. Theſe things are to be found in man's heart; but to ſpeak of theſe things being within, ſeemed ſtrange to the rough, crooked, and mountainous ones. Yet the Lord ſaith, <q>O earth, hear the word of the Lord!</q> The law of the Spirit croſſeth the fleſhly mind, ſpirit, and will, which lives in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and doth not keep within the law of the Spirit. I ſaw this law was the pure love of God which was upon me, and which I muſt go through, though I was troubled while I was under it; for I could not be dead to the law but through the law, which did judge and condemn that which is to be condemned. I ſaw, many talked of the law, who had never known the law to be their ſchool-maſter; and many ralked of the goſpel of Chriſt, who had never known life and immortality brought to light in them by it. You that have been under that ſchool-maſter, and the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it, know theſe things; for though the Lord in that day opened theſe things unto the in ſecret, they have been ſince publiſhed by his eternal Spirit, as on the houſe-top.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037441_0091_100D8E10476BCBA8"/>As you are brought into the law, and through the law to be dead to it, and witneſs the righteouſneſs of the law ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in you, ye will afterwards come to know what it is to be brought into the faith, and through faith from under the law; and abiding in the faith, which Chriſt is the author of, ye will have peace and acceſs to God. But if ye look out from the faith, and from that which would keep you in the victory, and look after fleſhly things or words, ye will be brought into bondage to the fleſh again, and to the law which takes hold upon the fleſh and ſin, and worketh wrath, and the works of the fleſh will appear again. This law of God takes hold upon the law of ſin and death; but the law of faith, the law of the Spirit of life, which is the love of God, and which comes by Jeſus (who is the end of the law for righteouſneſs-ſake) makes free from the law of ſin and death. The law of life fleſhly-minded men do not know; yet they will tempt you, to draw you from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the fleſh, and ſo into bondage. Therefore ye, who know the love of God, and the law of his Spirit, and the freedom that is in Jeſus Chriſt, ſtand faſt in him, in that divine faith which he is the author of in you; and be not entangled with the yoke of bondage. For the miniſtry of Chriſt Jeſus, and his teaching, bringeth into liberty and freedom; but the miniſtry that is of man, and by man, which ſtands in the will of man, bringeth into bondage, and under the ſhadow of death and darkneſs. Therefore none can be miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus but in the eternal Spirit, which was before the ſcriptures were given forth; for if they have not his Spirit, they are none of his. Though they may have his light to condemn them that hate it, yet they can never bring any into unity and fellowſhip in the Spirit, except they be in it; for the ſeed of God is a burthenſome ſtone to the ſelfiſh, fleſhly, earthly will, which reigns in its own knowledge and underſtanding that muſt periſh, and its own wiſdom that is deviliſh. The Spirit of God is grieved, vexed, and quenched with that which brings into the fleſhly bondage; and that which wars againſt the Spirit of God muſt be mortified by it; for the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other. The fleſh would have its liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Spirit would have its liberty; but the Spirit is to have its liberty, and not the fleſh. If therefore ye quench the Spirit, join to the fleſh, and be ſervants of it, then ye are judged and tormented by the Spirit; but if ye join to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037441_0092_100D8E11FA0FBD30"/>the Spirit, and ſerve God in it, ye have liberty and victory over the fleſh and its works. Therefore keep in the daily croſs, the power of God, by which ye may witneſs all that to be crucified which is contrary to the will of God, and which ſhall not come into his kingdom. Theſe things are here mentioned and opened for information, exhortation, and comfort to others, as the Lord opened them unto me in that day. In that day I wondered that the children of Iſrael ſhould murmur for water and victuals, for I could have faſted long without murmuring or minding victuals. But I was judged at other times, that I was not contented to be ſometimes without the water and bread of life, that I might learn to know how to want, and how to abound.</p>
                  <p>I heard of a woman in Lancaſhire, who had faſted two-and-twenty days, and I travelled to ſee her; but when I came to her, I ſaw ſhe was under a temptation. When I had ſpoken to her what I had from the Lord, I left her, her father being high in profeſſion. Paſſing on, I went among the profeſſors at Duckenfield and Mancheſter, where I ſtaid awhile and declared truth among them. There were ſome convinced, who received the Lord's teaching, by which they were confirmed, and ſtood in the truth. The profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were in a rage, all pleading for ſin and imperfection; and could not endure to hear talk of perfection, or of a holy and ſinleſs life. But the Lord's power was over all; though they were chained under darkneſs and ſin, which they pleaded for, and quenched the tender thing in them.</p>
                  <p>About this time there was a great meeting of the baptiſts at Broughton, in Leiceſterſhire, with ſome that had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them. People of other counties went thither, and I went alſo. Not many of the baptiſts came, but abundance of other people were there; and the Lord open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mouth, and his everlaſting truth was declared amongſt them, and the power of the Lord was over them all. In that day the Lord's power began to ſpring; I had great openings in the ſcriptures, and ſeveral were convinced in thoſe parts, and turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God: his power they did receive, and by it many were raiſed up to praiſe God. When I reaſoned with profeſſors and other people, ſome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and did ſtand. Yet I was under great temptations ſometimes, and my inward ſufferings were heavy; but I could find none to open my condition to but the Lord alone, unto whom I cried night and day. I went back
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037441_0093_100D8E14EC4E4518"/>into Nottinghamſhire, where the Lord ſhewed me, that the natures of thoſe things which were hurtful without, were within in the hearts and minds of wicked men. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of dogs, ſwine, vipers, of Sodom and Egypt, Pharaoh, Cain Iſhmael, Eſau, &amp;c. The natures of theſe I ſaw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in though people had been looking without. I cried to the Lord, ſaying, <q>Why ſhould I be thus, ſeeing I was never addicted to commit thoſe evils?</q> And the Lord anſwered, <q>It was needful I ſhould have a ſenſe of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, how elſe ſhould I ſpeak to all conditions?</q> In this I ſaw the infinite love of God. I ſaw alſo, that there was an ocean of darkneſs and death; but an infinite ocean of light and love, which flowed over the ocean of darkneſs. In that alſo I ſaw the infinite love of God, and I had great openings. As I was walking by the ſteeple-houſe ſide in the town of Mansfield, the Lord ſaid unto me, <q>That which people trample upon muſt be thy food.</q> And as the Lord ſpake he opened to me, that people and profeſſors trampled upon the life, even the life of Chriſt was trampled upon; they fed upon words, and fed one another with words; but trampled under foot the blood of the ſon of God, which blood was my life: and they lived in their airy notions talking of him. It ſeemed ſtrange to me at the firſt, that I ſhould feed on that which the high profeſſors tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon; but the Lord opened it clearly to me by his eternal Spirit and power.</p>
                  <p>Then came people from far and near to ſee me; but I was fearful of being drawn out by them: yet I was made to open things to them. One Brown had great prophecies and ſights upon his death-bed of me. He ſpoke openly, of what I ſhould be made inſtrumental by the Lord to bring forth. And of others he ſpoke, that they ſhould come to nothing; which was fulfilled on ſome, who then were ſomething in ſhew. When this man was buried, a great work of the Lord fell upon me, to the admiration of many, who thought I had been dead; and many came to ſee me for about fourteen days. I was very much altered in countenance and perſon, as if my body had been new-moulded o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> changed. While I was in that condition, I had a ſenſe and diſcerning given me by the Lord, through which I ſaw plainly, that when many people talked of God and of Chriſt, &amp;c. the ſerpent ſpoke in them; but this was hard to be borne. Yet the work of the Lord went on in ſome, and my ſorrows and troubles began to wear off,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037441_0094_100D8E1778552868"/>and tears of joy dropped from me, ſo that I could have wept night and day with tears of joy to the Lord, in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and brokenneſs of heart. I ſaw into that which was without end, things which cannot be uttered, and of the greatneſs and infiniteneſs of the love of God, which cannot be expreſſed by words. For I had been brought through the very ocean of darkneſs and death, and through and over the power of Satan, by the eternal glorious power of Chriſt; even through that darkneſs was I brought which covered over all the world, which chained down all, and ſhut up all in the death. The ſame eternal power of God which brought me through theſe things, was that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhook the nations, prieſts, profeſſors, and people. Then could I ſay, I had been in ſpiritual Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, and the grave; but by the eternal power of God I was come out of it, was brought over it, and the power of it into the power of Chriſt. And I ſaw the harveſt white, and the ſeed of God lying thick in the ground, as ever did wheat that was ſown outwardly, and none to gather it; for this I mourned with tears. A report went abroad of me, that I was a young man who had a diſcerning ſpirit; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many came to me from far and near, profeſſors, prieſts, and people. The Lord's power broke forth, and I had great openings and prophecies, and ſpoke unto them of the things of God, which they heard with attention and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and went away and ſpread the ſame thereof. Then came the tempter and ſet upon me again, charging me, that I had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but I could not tell in what. Then Paul's condition came before me, how after he had been taken up into the third heavens, and ſeen things not lawful to be uttered, a meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him. Thus by the power of Chriſt I got over that temptation alſo.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1648, as I was ſitting in a friend's houſe in Nottinghamſhire (for by this time the power of God had opened the hearts of ſome to receive the word of life and reconciliation) I ſaw there was a great crack to go through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the earth, and a great ſmoke to go as the crack went, and that after the crack there ſhould be a great ſhaking. This was the earth in people's hearts, which was to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the ſeed of God was raiſed out of the earth. And it was ſo: for the Lord's power began to ſhake them, and great meetings we began to have, and a mighty power
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037441_0095_100D8E190F05DEF8"/>and work of God there was amongſt people, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of both people and prieſts.</p>
                  <p>There was a meeting of prieſts and profeſſors at a juſtice's houſe, and I went among them. Here they diſcourſed how Paul ſaid, <q>He had not known ſin but by the law, which ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt:</q> and they held that to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the outward law. But I told them, Paul ſpoke that after he was convinced; for he had the outward law before, and was bred up in it, when he was in the luſt of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but this was the law of God in his mind which he ſerved, which the law in his members warred againſt: for that which he thought had been life to him, proved death. So the more ſober of the prieſts and profeſſors conſented that it was not the outward law, but the inward, which ſhewed the inward luſt which Paul ſpake of after he was convinced; for the outward law took hold of the outward action, but the inward law of the inward luſt.</p>
                  <p>After this I went again to Mansfield, where was a great meeting of profeſſors and people, where I was moved to pray; and the Lord's power was ſo great, that the houſe ſeemed to be ſhaken. When I had done, ſome of the profeſſors ſaid, <q>It was now as in the days of the apoſtles, when the houſe was ſhaken where they were.</q> After I had prayed, one of the profeſſors would pray which brought deadneſs and a veil over them. Others of the profeſſors were grieved at him, and told him, "It was a temptation upon him." Then he came to me, and deſired that I would pray again; but I could not pray in man's will.</p>
                  <p>Soon after there was another great meeting of profeſſors, and a captain named Amor Stoddard came in. They were diſcourſing of the blood of Chriſt. As they were diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, I ſaw, through the immediate opening of the inviſible Spirit, the blood of Chriſt; and cried out among them, ſaying, <q>Do ye not ſee the blood of Chriſt? See it in your hearts, to ſprinkle your hearts and conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</q> For I ſaw the blood of the new covenant, how it came into the heart. This ſtartled the profeſſors, who would have the blood only without them, and not in them. But captain Stoddard was reached, and ſaid, <q>Let the youth ſpeak, hear the youth ſpeak;</q> when he ſaw they endeavoured to bear me down with many words.</p>
                  <p>There were alſo a company of prieſts, that were looked upon to be tender; one of their names was Kellet, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037441_0096_100D8E1B2BB8A468"/>tender people went to hear them. I was moved to go after them, and bid them mind the Lord's teaching in their inward parts. Prieſt Kellet was againſt parſonage then: but afterwards he got a great one, and turned perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſome ſervice in theſe parts, I went through Derbyſhire into my own country Leiceſterſhire again, and ſeveral tender people were convinced. Paſſing thence, I met with a great company of profeſſors in Warwickſhire, who were praying and expounding the ſcriptures in the fields. They gave the bible to me, and I opened it on the fifth of Matthew, where Chriſt expounded the law; and I opened the inward ſtate to them, and outward ſtate; upon which they fell into a fierce contention, and parted: but the Lord's power got ground.</p>
                  <p>Then I heard of a great meeting to be at Leiceſter for a diſpute, wherein preſbyterians, independents, baptiſts, and common-prayer-men, were ſaid to be all concerned. The meeting was in a ſteeple-houſe; to which I was moved by the Lord God to go, and be amongſt them. I heard their diſcourſe and reaſonings, ſome being in pews, and the prieſt in the pulpit, abundance of people being gathered together. At laſt one woman aſked a queſtion out of Peter, What that birth was, viz. A being born again of incorruptible ſeed, by the Word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever? The prieſt ſaid to her, I permit not a woman to ſpeak in the church; though he had before given liberty for any to ſpeak. Whereupon I was wrapped up as in a rapture, in the Lord's power; and I ſtepped up, and aſked the prieſt, Doſt thou call this place (the ſteeple-houſe) a church? or doſt thou call this mixed multitude a church? For the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aſking a queſtion, he ought to have anſwered it, having given liberty for any to ſpeak. But, inſtead of anſwering me, he aſked me, What a church was? I told him, The church was the pillar and ground of truth, made up of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones, living members, a ſpiritual houſhold, which Chriſt was the head of: but he was not the head of a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed multitude, or of an old houſe made up of lime, ſtones, and wood. This ſet them all on a fire. The prieſt came down from his pulpit, and others out of their pews, and the diſpute there was marred. I went to a great inn, and there diſputed the thing with the prieſts and profeſſors, who were all on fire. But I maintained the true church, and the true head thereof, over their heads, till they all gave out and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037441_0097_100D8E1D5D9086F8"/>fled away. One man ſeemed loving, and appeared for a while to join with me; but he ſoon turned againſt me, and joined with a prieſt, in pleading for infant baptiſm, though himſelf had been a baptiſt before; ſo he left me alone. Howbeit, there were ſeveral convinced that day; the woman that aſked the queſtion was convinced, and her family: and the Lord's power and glory ſhined over all.</p>
                  <p>After this I returned into Nottinghamſhire again, and went into the Vale of Beavor. As I went, I preached re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to the people. There were many convinced in the Vale of Beavor, in many towns; for I ſtaid ſome weeks amongſt them. One morning, as I was ſitting by the fire, a great cloud came over me, a temptation beſet me; and I ſat ſtill. It was ſaid, "All things come by nature:" and the elements and ſtars came over me, ſo that I was in a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er quite clouded with it. But as I ſat ſtill and ſaid nothing, the people of the houſe perceived nothing. And as I ſat ſtill under it and let it alone, a living hope and a true voice aroſe in me, which ſaid, <q>There is a living God who made all things.</q> Immediately the cloud and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation vaniſhed away, and life roſe over it all; my heart was glad, and I praiſed the living God. After ſome time I met with ſome people who had a notion that there was no God, but that all things come by nature. I had a great diſpute with them, and overturned them, and made ſome of them confeſs, that there is a living God. Then I ſaw that it was good that I had gone through that exerciſe. We had great meetings in thoſe parts; for the power of the Lord broke through in that ſide of the country. Returning into Nottinghamſhire, I found there a company of ſhattered baptiſts, and others. The Lord's power wrought mightily, and gathered many of them. Afterwards I went to Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field and there-away; where the Lord's power was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully manifeſted both at Mansfield, and other towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. In Derbyſhire the mighty power of God wrought in a wonderful manner. At Eton, a town near Derby, there was a meeting of friends, where appeared ſuch a mighty power of God that they were greatly ſhaken, and many mouths were opened in the power of the Lord God. Many were moved by the Lord to go to ſteeple-houſes to the prieſts and people, to declare the everlaſting truth unto them.</p>
                  <p>At a certain time when I was at Mansfield there was a ſitting of the juſtices about hiring ſervants; and it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037441_0098_100D8E200456CF30"/>me from the Lord to go and ſpeak to the juſtices, that they ſhould not oppreſs the ſervants in their wages. So I walked towards the inn where they ſat; but finding a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fiddlers there, I did not go in, but thought to come in the morning, when I might have a more ſerious opportunity to diſcourſe with them, not thinking that a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time. But when I came again in the morning, they were gone, and I was ſtruck even blind, that I could not ſee. I inquired of the inn-keeper, where the juſtices were to ſit that day? He told me, At a town eight miles off. My ſight began to come to me again; and I went and ran thitherward as faſt as I could. When I was come to the houſe where they were, and many ſervants with them, I exhorted the juſtices not to oppreſs the ſervants in their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but to do that which was right and juſt to them; and I exhorted the ſervants to do their duties, and ſerve honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. They all received my exhortation kindly, for I was moved of the Lord therein.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I was moved to go to ſeveral courts and ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſes at Mansfield and other places, to warn them to leave off oppreſſion and oaths, and to turn from deceit to the Lord, and do juſtly. Particularly at Mansfield, after I had been at a court there, I was moved to go and ſpeak to one of the wickedeſt men in the country, one who was a common drunkard, a noted whoremaſter, and a rhime-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and I reproved him, in the dread of the mighty God, for his evil courſes. When I had done ſpeaking, and left him, he came after me, and told me, He was ſo ſmitten when I ſpake to him, that he had ſcarce any ſtrength left in him. So this man was convinced, turned from his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and remained an honeſt, ſober man, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the people who had known him before. Thus the work of the Lord went forward, and many were turned from darkneſs to light, within the compaſs of theſe three years, 1646, 1647, and 1648. Divers meetings of friends, in ſeveral places, were then gathered to God's teaching, by his light, Spirit, and power: for the Lord's power broke forth daily more and more wonderfully.</p>
                  <p>Now was I come up in Spirit, through the flaming ſword, into the paradiſe of God. All things were new; and all the creation gave another ſmell unto me than before, beyond what words can utter. I knew nothing but pureneſs, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and righteouſneſs, being renewed up into the image of God by Chriſt Jeſus; ſo that I was come up to the ſtate
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037441_0099_100D8E21966A72F8"/>of Adam, which he was in before he fell. The creation was opened to me; and it was ſhewed me, how all things had their names given them, according to their nature and virtue. I was at a ſtand in my mind, whether I ſhould practice phyſick for the good of mankind, ſeeing the nature and virtues of the creatures were ſo opened to me by the Lord. But I was immediately taken up in Spirit, to ſee into another or more ſteadfaſt ſtate than Adam's in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, even into a ſtate in Chriſt Jeſus, that ſhould never fall. The Lord ſhewed me, that ſuch as were faithful to him, in the power and light of Chriſt, ſhould come up into that ſtate in which Adam was before he fell; in which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable works of the creation, and the virtues thereof may be known, through the openings of that divine Word of wiſdom and power by which they were made. Great things did the Lord lead me into, and wonderful depths were opened unto me, beyond what can by words be declared; but as people come into ſubjection to the Spirit of God, and grow up in the image and power of the Almighty, they may receive the word of wiſdom that opens all things, and come to know the hidden unity in the Eternal Being.</p>
                  <p>Thus travelled I in the Lord's ſervice, as he led me. When I came to Nottingham, the mighty power of God was there among friends. From thence I went to Clauſon in Leiceſterſhire, in the Vale of Beavor, and the mighty power of God appeared there alſo, in ſeveral towns and villages where friends were gathered. While I was there, the Lord opened to me three things, relating to thoſe three great profeſſions in the world, law, phyſick, and divinity (ſo called.) He ſhewed me, that the phyſicians were out of the wiſdom of God, by which the creatures were made; and knew not the virtues of the creatures, becauſe they were out of the Word of wiſdom, by which they were made. He ſhewed me, the prieſts were out of the true faith, which Chriſt is the author of; the faith which purifies, gives vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and brings people to have acceſs to God. by which they pleaſe God; the myſtery of which faith is held in a pure conſcience. He ſhewed me alſo, that the lawyers were out of the equity, out of the true juſtice, and out of the law of God, which went over the firſt tranſgreſſion, and over all ſin, and anſwered the Spirit of God, that was grieved and tranſgreſſed in man. And that theſe three, the phyſicians, the prieſts, and the lawyers, ruled the world out of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, out of the faith, and out of the equity and law of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037441_0100_100D8E2373121CA8"/>God; the one pretending the cure of the body, the other the cure of the ſoul, and the third the protection of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the people. But I ſaw they were all out of the wiſdom, out of the faith, out of the equity and perfect law of God. And as the Lord opened theſe things unto me, I felt his power went forth over all, by which all might be reformed, if they would receive and bow unto it. The prieſts might be reformed, and brought into the true faith, which is the gift of God. The lawyers might be reformed, and brought into the law of God, which anſwers that of God, which is tranſgreſſed, in every one, and brings to love one's neighbour as himſelf. This lets man ſee, if he wrongs his neighbour, he wrongs himſelf; and this teaches him to do unto others as he would they ſhould do unto him. The phyſicians might be reformed, and brought into the wiſdom of God, by which all things were made and created; that they might receive a right knowledge of the creatures, and underſtand the virtues of them, which the Word of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which they were made and are upheld, hath given them. Abundance was opened concerning theſe things; how all lay out of the wiſdom of God, and out of the righteouſneſs and holineſs that man at the firſt was made in. But as all believe in the light, and walk in the light which Chriſt hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal, and become children of the light, and of the day of Chriſt; in his day all things are ſeen, viſible and inviſible, by the divine light of Chriſt, the ſpiritual heavenly man, by whom all things were made and created.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw concerning the prieſts, that although they ſtood in the deceit, and acted by the dark power which both they and their people were kept under; yet they were not the greateſt deceivers ſpoken of in the ſcriptures, for they were not come ſo far as many of theſe had come. But the Lord opened to me who the greateſt deceivers were, and how far they might come; even ſuch as came as far as Cain, to hear the voice of God; ſuch as came out of Egypt, and through the Red Sea, to praiſe God on the banks of the ſea-ſhore; ſuch as could ſpeak by experience of God's miracles and wonders; ſuch as were come as far as Corah, Dathan, and their company; ſuch as were come as far as Balaam, who could ſpeak the word of the Lord, who heard his voice and knew it, and knew his Spirit, and could ſee the ſtar of Jacob, and the goodlineſs of Iſrael's Tent; the ſecond birth, which no enchantment could prevail againſt; theſe that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037441_0101_100D8E26D36721F0"/>could ſpeak ſo much of their experiences of God, and yet turned from the Spirit and the Word, and went into the gainſaying, theſe were and would be the great deceivers, far beyond the prieſts. Likewiſe among chriſtians, ſuch as ſhould preach in Chriſt's name, ſhould work miracles, caſt out devils, and go as far as a Cain, a Corah, and a Balaam in the goſpel-times, theſe were and would be the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers. They that could ſpeak ſome experiences of Chriſt and God, but lived not in the life, theſe were they that led the world after them, who got the form of godlineſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the power; who inwardly ravened from the Spirit, and brought people into the form, but perſecuted them that were in the power, as Cain did; and ran greedily after the error of Balaam, through covetouſneſs, loving the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, as Balaam did. Theſe followers of Cain, Corah, and Balaam, have brought the world, ſince the apoſtles days to be like a ſea. Such as theſe I ſaw might deceive now, as they did in former ages; but it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to deceive the elect, who were choſen in Chriſt, who was before the world began, and before the deceiver was: though others may be deceived in their openings and prophecies, not keeping their minds to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who doth open and reveal to his.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw the ſtate of thoſe, both prieſts and people, who in reading the ſcriptures cry out much againſt Cain, Eſau, Judas, and other wicked men of former times, mentioned in the holy ſcriptures; but do not ſee the nature of Cain, of Eſau, of Judas, and thoſe others, in themſelves. Theſe ſaid, it was they, they, they, that were the bad people; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it off from themſelves: but when ſome of theſe came, with the light and Spirit of truth, to ſee into themſelves, them they came to ſay, I, I, I, it is I myſelf, that have been the Iſhmael, the Eſau, &amp;c. For then they ſaw the nature of wild Iſhmael in themſelves; the nature of Cain, Eſau, Corah, Balaam, and of the ſon of perdition in themſelves, ſitting above all that is called God in them. I ſaw, it was the fallen man that was got up into the ſcriptures, and was finding fault with thoſe before-mentioned; and with the backſliding Jews, calling them the ſturdy oaks, tall cedars, fat bulls of Baſhan, wild heifers, vipers, ſerpents, &amp;c. and charging them, that it was they that cloſed their eyes, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their ears, hardened their hearts, and were dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it was they that hated the light, rebelled againſt it, quenched the Spirit, vexed and grieved it, walked deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037441_0102_100D8E28DC07A0F0"/>againſt the Spirit of grace, and turned the grace of God into wantonneſs; it was they that reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, got the form of godlineſs, and turned againſt the power; and they were the inwardly ravening wolves who had got the ſheep's cloathing; they were the wells without water, clouds without rain, trees without fruit, &amp;c. But when theſe, who were ſo much taken up with finding fault with others, and thought themſelves clear from theſe things, came to look into themſelves, and with the light of Chriſt throughly to ſearch themſelves, they might ſee enough of this in themſelves; then the cry could not be, It is he or they, but I and we are found in theſe conditions.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, how people read the ſcriptures without a right ſenſe of them, and without duly applying them to their own ſtates. For when they read, that death reigned from Adam to Moſes; that the law and the prophets were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til John; and that the leaſt in the kingdom is greater than John; they read theſe things without them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to others (and the things were true of others) but they did not turn in to find the truth of theſe things in themſelves. As theſe things were opened in me, I ſaw death reigned over them from Adam to Moſes; from the entrance into tranſgreſſion, till they came to the miniſtration of condemnation, which reſtrains people from ſin that brings death. When the miniſtration of Moſes is paſſed through, the miniſtry of the prophets comes to be read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which reaches through the figures, types, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows unto John, the greateſt prophet born of a woman; whoſe miniſtration prepares the way of the Lord, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the exalted mountains, and making ſtraight paths. As this miniſtration is paſſed through, an entrance comes to be known into the everlaſting kingdom. I ſaw plainly, that none could read Moſes aright without Moſes's Spirit, by which he ſaw how man was in the image of God in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, how he fell, how death came over him, and how all men have been under this death. I ſaw how Moſes receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pure law, that went over all tranſgreſſors; and how the clean beaſts, which were figures and types, were offered up, when the people were come into the righteous law that went over the firſt tranſgreſſion. Moſes and the prophets ſaw through the types and figures, and beyond them, and ſaw Chriſt the great prophet, that was to come to fulfil them. I ſaw that none could read John's words aright, and with a true underſtanding of them, but in and with
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037441_0103_100D8E2A718B0778"/>the ſame divine Spirit by which John ſpake them; and by his burning, ſhining light which is ſent from God. For by that Spirit their crooked nature might be made ſtraight, their rough natures ſmooth, and the exacter and violent doer in them might be caſt out; and thoſe that had been hypocrites, might come to bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and their mountain of ſin and earthlineſs might be laid low, and their valley exalted in them, that there might be a way prepared for the Lord in them: then the leaſt in the kingdom is greater than John. But all muſt firſt know the voice crying in the wilderneſs in their hearts, which through tranſgreſſion were become as a wilderneſs. Thus I ſaw it was an eaſy matter to ſay, death reigned from Adam to Moſes; and that the law and the prophets were until John; and that the leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is greater than John; but none could know how death reigned from Adam to Moſes, &amp;c. but by the ſame holy Spirit which Moſes, the prophets, and John were in. They could not know the ſpiritual meaning of Moſes, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and John's words, nor ſee their path and travels, much leſs to ſee through them, and to the end of them into the kingdom, unleſs they had the Spirit and light of Jeſus; nor could they know the words of Chriſt and of his apoſtles without his Spirit. But as man comes thro' by the Spirit and power of God to Chriſt (who fulfils the types, figures, ſhadows, promiſes, and prophecies concerning him) and is led by the Holy Ghoſt into the truth and ſubſtance of the ſcriptures, ſitting down in him who is the author and end of them, then are they read and underſtood with profit and great delight.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Lord God let me ſee, when I was brought up into his image in righteouſneſs and holineſs, and into the paradiſe of God, the ſtate, how Adam was made a living ſoul; and alſo the ſtature of Chriſt, the myſtery that had been hid from ages and generations: which things are hard to be uttered, and cannot be borne by many. For of all the ſects in Chriſtendom (ſo called) that I diſcourſed withal, I found none who could hear to be told, that any ſhould come to Adam's perfection, into that image of God, that righteouſneſs and holineſs that Adam was in before he fell; to be clear and pure without ſin as he was. Therefore, how ſhould they be able to bear being told, that any ſhould grow up to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, when they cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear to hear that any ſhall come, whilſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037441_0104_100D8E2CB7FC1F70"/>upon earth, into the ſame power and Spirit that the prophets and apoſtles were in? Though it be a certain truth, that none can underſtand their writings aright, without the ſame ſpirit by which they were written.</p>
                  <p>The Lord God opened to me by his inviſible power, how "every man was enlightened by the divine light of Chriſt." I ſaw it ſhine through all, and that they that believed in it came out of condemnation to the light of life, and became the children of it; but they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemned by it, though they made a profeſſion of Chriſt. This I ſaw in the pure openings of the light without the help of any man; neither did I then know where to find it in the ſcriptures; though afterwards, ſearching the ſcriptures, I found it. For I ſaw in that Light and Spirit which was before the Scriptures were given forth, and which led the holy men of God to give them forth, that all muſt come to that Spirit, if they would know God or Chriſt, or the ſcriptures aright, which they that gave them forth were led and taught by.</p>
                  <p>But I obſerved a dulneſs and drowzy heavineſs upon people, which I wondered at; for ſometimes, when I would ſet myſelf to ſleep, my mind went over all to the beginning, in that which is from everlaſting to everlaſting I ſaw death was to paſs over this ſleepy, heavy ſtate, and I told people they muſt come to witneſs death to that ſleepy, heavy nature, and a croſs to it in the power of God, that their minds and hearts might be on things above.</p>
                  <p>On a certain time, as I was walking in the fields, the Lord ſaid unto me, <q>Thy name is written in the Lamb's book of life, which was before the foundation of the world:</q> and as the Lord ſpoke it, I believed and ſaw it in the new birth. Some time after, the Lord commanded me to go abroad into the world, which was like a briery, thorny wilderneſs. When I came in the Lord's mighty power with the word of life into the world, the world ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and made a noiſe like the great raging waves of the ſea. Prieſts and profeſſors, magiſtrates and people, were all like a ſea, when I came to proclaim the day of the Lord amongſt them, and to preach repentance to them.</p>
                  <p>I was ſent to turn people from darkneſs to the light, that they might receive Chriſt Jeſus; for to as many as ſhould receive him in his light, I ſaw he would give power to become the ſons of God; which I had obtained by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt. I was to direct people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Spirit, that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037441_0105_100D8E2EAC473480"/>gave forth the ſcriptures, by which they might be led into all truth, and up to Chriſt and God, as thoſe had been who gave them forth. I was to turn them to the grace of God, and to the truth in the heart, which came by Jeſus; that by this grace they might be taught, which would bring them ſalvation, that their hearts might be eſtabliſhed by it, their words might be ſeaſcned, and all might come to know their ſalvation nigh. I ſaw Chriſt died for all men, was a propitiation for all, and enlightened all men and women with his divine and ſaving light; and that none could be true believers, but thoſe who believed therein. I ſaw that the grace of God, which brings ſalvation, had appeared to all men, and that the manifeſtation of the Spirit of God was given to every man, to profit withal. Theſe things I did not ſee by the help of man, nor by the letter, though they are written in the letter; but I ſaw them in the light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by his immediate Spirit and power, as did the holy men of God by whom the holy ſcriptures were written. Yet I had no ſlight eſteem of the holy ſcriptures, they were very precious to me; for I was in that Spirit by which they were given forth; and what the Lord opened in me, I afterwards found was agreeable to them. I could ſpeak much of theſe things, and many volumes might be written; but all would prove too ſhort to ſet forth the infinite love, wiſdom, and power of God, in preparing, fitting, and furniſhing me for the ſervice he had appointed me to; letting me ſee the depth of Satan on the one hand, and opening to me, on the other hand, the divine myſteries of his own everlaſting kingdom.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt ſent me forth into the world to preach his everlaſting goſpel and kingdom, I was glad that I was commanded to turn peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But with and by this divine power and ſpirit of God. and the light of Jeſus, I was to bring people off from all their own ways, to Chriſt the new and living way; from their churches, which men had made and gathered, to the church in God, the general aſſembly written in heaven, which Chriſt is the head of; and off from the world's teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made by men, to learn of Chriſt, who is the way, the truth, and the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I was to bring people off from all the world's religions, which are in vain; that they might know the pure religion might viſit the fatherleſs, the widows and the ſtrangers, and keep themſelves from the ſpots of the world: then there would not be ſo many beggars; the ſight of whom often grieved my heart, as it denoted ſo much hard-heartedneſs amongſt thoſe that profeſſed the name of Chriſt. I was to bring them off from all the world's fellowſhips, prayings, and ſingings, which ſtood in forms without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that their fellowſhip might be in the Holy Ghoſt, the eternal Spirit of God; that they might pray in the Holy Ghoſt, ſing in the Spirit, and with the grace that comes by Jeſus; making melody in their hearts to the Lord, who hath ſent his beloved Son to be their Saviour, cauſed his heavenly ſun to ſhine upon all the world, and through them all; and his heavenly rain to fall upon the juſt and the unjuſt (as his outward rain doth fall, and his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſun doth ſhine on all) which is God's unſpeakable love to the world. I was to bring people off from Jewiſh ceremonies, from heatheniſh fables, from men's inventions and windy doctrines, by which they blowed the people about, this way and the other way, from ſect to ſect; and from all their beggarly rudiments, with their ſchools and colleges, for making miniſters of Chriſt, who are indeed miniſters of their own making, but not of Chriſt's; and from all their images, croſſes, and ſprinkling of infants, with their holy-days (ſo called) and all their vain traditions, which they had got up ſince the apoſtles days, which the Lord's power was againſt. In the dread and authority thereof was I moved to declare againſt them all, and againſt all that preached and not freely, as ſuch who had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived freely from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when the Lord ſent me into the world, he forbad me "to put off my hat" to any, high or low; and I was required to thee and thou all men and women, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to rich or poor, great or ſmall. And as I travelled up and down, I was not to bid people Good morrow, or Good evening, neither might I bow or ſcrape with my leg to any one; this made the ſects and profeſſions
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037441_0107_100D8E32CBBF7240"/>rage. But the Lord's power carried me over all to his glory, and many came to be turned to God in a little time; for the heavenly day of the Lord ſprung from on high, and broke forth apace; by the light of which many came to ſee where they were.</p>
                  <p>Oh! the rage that was in the prieſts, magiſtrates, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and people of all ſorts; but eſpecially in prieſts and profeſſors: for though thou to a ſingle perſon was according to their accidence and grammar rules, and according to the bible, yet they could not bear to hear it; and becauſe I could not put off my hat to them, it ſet them all into a rage. But the Lord ſhewed me that it was an honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which he would lay in the duſt and ſtain; an honour which proud fleſh looked for, but ſought not the honour which comes from God only. That it was an honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by men in the fall and in the alienation from God, who were offended if it was not given them; yet would be looked upon as ſaints, church-members, and great Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: but Chriſt ſaith, <q>How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only? And I (ſaith Chriſt) receive not honour of men.</q> Shewing that men have an honour which they will receive and give, but Chriſt will have none of it. This is the honour which Chriſt will not receive, and which muſt be laid in the duſt. Oh! the ſcorn, heat, and fury that aroſe! Oh! the blows, punchings, beatings, and impriſonments that we underwent for not putting off our hats to men! For that ſoon tried all mens patience and ſobriety, what it was. Some had their hats violently pluck'd off and thrown away, ſo that they quite loſt them. The bad language and evil uſage we received on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is hard to be expreſſed, beſides the danger we were ſometimes in of loſing our lives for this matter, and that by the great profeſſors of chriſtianty, who thereby diſcovered they were not true believers. And though it was but a ſmall thing in the eye of man, yet a wonderful confuſion it brought among all profeſſors and prieſts; but, bleſſed be the Lord, many came to ſee the vanity of that cuſtom of putting off the hat to men, and felt the weight of Truth's teſtimony againſt it.</p>
                  <p>About this time I was ſorely exerciſed in going to their courts to cry for juſtice, in ſpeaking and writing to judges and juſtices to do juſtly; in warning ſuch as kept publick houſes for entertainment, that they ſhould not let people
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037441_0108_100D8E34F15A00B0"/>have more drink than would do them good; in teſtifying againſt wakes, feaſts, may-games, ſports, plays, and ſhews, which trained up people to vanity and looſeneſs, and led them from the fear of God; and the days ſet forth for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days were uſually the times wherein they moſt diſhonoured God by theſe things. In fairs alſo, and in markets, I was made to declare againſt their deceitful merchandize, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cozening; warning all to deal juſtly, to ſpeak the truth, to let their yea be yea, and their nay be nay, and to do unto others as they would have others do unto them; forewarning them of the great and terrible day of the Lord, which would come upon them all. I was moved alſo to cry againſt all ſorts of muſick, and againſt the mountebanks playing tricks on their ſtages; for they burthened the pure life, and ſtirred up people's minds to vanity. I was much exerciſed too with ſchool-maſters and ſchool-miſtreſſes, warning them to teach children ſobriety in the fear of the Lord, that they might not be nurſed and trained up in lightneſs, vanity, and wantonneſs. I was made to warn maſters and miſtreſſes, fathers and mothers in private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to take care that their children and ſervants might be trained up in the fear of the Lord, and that themſelves ſhould be therein examples and patterns of ſobriety and virtue to them. For I ſaw that as the Jews were to teach their children the law of God, the old covenant, and to train them up in it, and their ſervants, yea the very ſtrangers were to keep the ſabbath among them, and be circumciſed, before they might eat of their ſacrifices; ſo all that made a profeſſion of chriſtianity ought to train up their children and ſervants in the new covenant of light, Chriſt Jeſus, who is God's ſalvation to the ends of the earth, that all may know their ſalvation. And they ought to train them up in the law of life, the law of the Spirit, the law of love and of faith, that they might be made free from the law of ſin and death. And all chriſtians ought to be circumciſed by the Spirit, which puts off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, that they may come to eat of the heavenly ſacrifice, Chriſt Jeſus, that true ſpiritual food, which none can rightly feed upon but they that are circumciſed by the Spirit. Likewiſe I was exerciſed about the ſtar-gazers, who drew people's minds from Chriſt, the bright and the morning-ſtar, and from the Sun of righteouſneſs, by whom the ſun, moon, and ſtars, and all things elſe were made, who is the wiſdom of God, from whom the right knowledge of all things is received.</p>

                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:037441_0109_100D8E3760BBC6A8"/>
But the black earthly ſpirit of the prieſt wounded my life: and when I heard the bell toll to call people together to the ſteeple-houſe, it ſtruck at my life; for it was like a market-bell to gather people together, that the prieſt might ſet forth his ware to ſale. Oh! the vaſt ſums of money that are got by the trade they make of ſelling the ſcriptures, and by their preaching, from the higheſt biſhop to the loweſt prieſt! What one trade elſe in the world is comparable to it? notwithſtanding the ſcriptures were given forth freely, Chriſt commanded his miniſters to preach freely, and the prophets and apoſtles denounced judgment againſt all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous hirelings and diviners for money. But in this free Spirit of the Lord Jeſus was I ſent forth to declare the word of life and reconciliation freely, that all might come to Chriſt, who gives freely, and renews up into the image of God, which man and woman were in before they fell, that they might ſit down in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>As I went towards Nottingham on a firſt-day in the morning, with friends to a meeting there, when I came on the top of a hill in ſight of the town, I eſpied the great ſheeple-houſe; and the Lord ſaid unto me, <q>Thou muſt go cry againſt yonder great idol, and againſt the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers therein.</q> I ſaid nothing of this to the friends, but went with them to the meeting, where the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord God was amongſt us; in which I left friends ſitting in the meeting, and went to the ſteeple-houſe. When I came there all the people looked like fallow ground, and the prieſt, like a great lump of earth, ſtood in his pulpit above: he took for his text theſe words of Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r. <q>We have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy, where unto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</q> He told the people this was the ſcriptures, by which they were to try all doctrines, religions, and opinions. Now the Lord's power was ſo mighty upon me, and ſo ſtrong in me, that I could not hold; but was made to cry out, <q>Oh! no; it is not the ſcriptures;</q> and told them it was the holy Spirit, by which the holy men of God gave forth the ſcriptures, whereby opinions, religions, and judgments were to be tried; for it led into all truth, and ſo gave the knowledge of all truth. The Jews had the ſcriptures, yet reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, and rejected Chriſt, the bright morning-ſtar.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037441_0110_100D8E38F4C9BBA0"/>They perſecuted him and his apoſtles, and took upon them to try their doctrines by the ſcriptures, but erred in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and did not try them right; becauſe they tried without the Holy Ghoſt. As I ſpoke thus amongſt them, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came, took me away, and put me into a naſty ſtinking priſon; the ſmell whereof got ſo into my noſe and throat, that it very much annoyed me.</p>
                  <p>But that day the Lord's power ſounded ſo in their ears, that they were amazed at the voice, and could not get it out of their ears for ſome time after; they were ſo reached by the Lord's power in the ſteeple-houſe. At night they took me before the mayor, aldermen and ſheriffs of the town. When I was brought before them, the mayor was in a peeviſh fretful temper, but the Lord's power allay'd him. They examined me at large; and I told them how the Lord had moved me to come. After ſome diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and me, they ſent me back to priſon; but ſome time after the head ſheriff, whoſe name was John Reckleſs, ſent for me to his houſe. When I came in, his wife met me in the hall, and ſaid, "Salvation is come to our houſe." She took me by the hand, and was much wrought upon by the power of the Lord; and her huſband, children, and ſervants were much changed, for the power of the Lord wrought upon them. I lodged at the ſheriff's, and great meetings we had in his houſe. Some perſons of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition in the world came to them, and the Lord's power appeared eminently amongſt them. This ſheriff ſent for the other ſheriff, and a woman they had had dealings with in the way of trade; and he told her before the other ſheriff, that they had wronged her in their dealings with her (for the other ſheriff and he were partners) and that they ought to make her reſtitation. This he ſpoke cheerfully; but the other ſheriff denied it, and the woman ſaid ſhe knew nothing of it. But the friendly ſheriff ſaid it was ſo, the other knew it well enough; and having diſcovered the matter, and acknowledged the wrong done by them, he made reſtitution to the woman, and exhorted the other ſheriff to do the like. The Lord's power was with this friendly ſheriff, wrought a mighty change in him, and great openings he had. The next market-day, as he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me in the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ruber, he ſaid, <q>I muſt go into the market, and preach repentance to the people.</q> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he went in his ſlippers into the market, and into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037441_0111_100D8E3B408EF1C0"/>others alſo in the town were moved to ſpeak to the mayor and magiſtrates, and to the people, exhorting them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Hereupon the magiſtrates grew very angry, ſent for me from the ſheriff's houſe and committed me to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priſon. When the aſſize came on, one perſon was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come and offer up himſelf for me, body for body, yea, life alſo: but when I ſhould have been brought before the judge, the ſheriff's man being ſomewhat long in bringing me to the ſeſſions-houſe, the judge was riſen before I came. At which I underſtood the judge was offended, and ſaid, <q>He would have admoniſhed the youth, if he had been brought before him:</q> for I was then impriſoned by the name of a youth. So I was returned to priſon again, and put into the common gaol. The Lord's power was great among friends; but the people began to be very rude: wherefore the governor of the caſtle ſent ſoldiers, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them; after that they were quiet. Both prieſts and people were aſtoniſhed at the wonderful power that broke forth; ſeveral of the prieſts were made tender, and ſome did confeſs to the power of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>After I was ſet at liberty from Nottingham gaol, where I had been kept priſoner a pretty long time, I travelled as before, in the work of the Lord. Coming to Mansfield Woodhouſe, there was a diſtracted woman under a doctor's hand, with her hair looſe about her care. He was about to let her blood, ſhe being firſt bound, and many people about her, holding her by violence; but he could get no blood from her. I deſired them to unbind her and let her alone, for they could not touch the ſpirit in her by which ſhe was tormented. So they did unbind her; and I was moved to ſpeak to her, and in the name of the Lord to bid her be quiet and ſtill; and ſhe was ſo. The Lord's power ſettled her mind. and ſhe mended. Afterwards ſhe received the truth, and continued in it to her death; and the Lord's name was honoured; to whom the glory of all his works belongs. Many great and wonderful things were wrought by the heavenly power in thoſe days; for the Lord made bare his omnipotent arm, and manifeſted his power to the aſtoniſhment of many; by the healing virtue whereof many have been delivered from great infirmities, and the devils were made ſubject through his name; of which particular inſtances might be given, beyond what this unbelieving age is able to receive or bear. Bleſſed for ever be the name of the Lord, and everlaſtingly honoured,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037441_0112_100D8E3CE30FFB90"/>and over all exalted and magnified be the arm of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power, by which he hath wrought gloriouſly: let the honour and praiſe of all his works be aſcribed to him alone.</p>
                  <p>While I was at Mansfield Woodhouſe, I was moved to go to the ſteeple-houſe, and declare the truth to the prieſt and people. But the people fell upon me in great rage, ſtruck me down, and almoſt ſtifled me. I was cruelly beaten and bruiſed by them with their hands, bibles, and ſticks. Then they haled me out, though I was hardly able to ſtand, and put me into the ſtocks, where I ſat ſome hours; and they brought dog-whips and horſe-whips, threatening to whip me. After ſome time they had me before the magiſtrate, at a knight's houſe, where were many great perſons; who, ſeeing how evilly I had been uſed, after much threatening ſet me at liberty: but the rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtoned me out of the town, for preaching the Word of life to them. I was ſcarce able to go, or well to ſtand, by reaſon of the ill uſage I had received; yet with much ado I got about a mile from the town, and then I met with ſome people that gave me ſomething to comfort me, becauſe I was inwardly bruiſed: but the Lord's power ſoon healed me again. That day ſome people were convinced of the Lord's truth, and turned to his teaching; at which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced.</p>
                  <p>Then went I out of Nottinghamſhire into Leiceſterſhire, ſeveral friends accompanying me. There were ſome baptiſts in that country, whom I deſired to ſpeak with, becauſe they were ſeparated from the publick worſhip. So Oats, one of their chief teachers, and others of the heads of them, with ſeveral of their company, came to meet us at Barrow, where we diſcourſed with them. One of them ſaid, What was not of faith, was ſin. Whereupon I afked them, What Faith was? and how it was wrought in man? But they turned off from that, and ſpake of their baptiſm in water. Then I aſked them, Whether their mountain of ſin was brought down, and laid low in them? and their rough and crooked ways made ſmooth and ſtraight in them? They looked upon the ſcriptures as meaning outward moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and ways; but I told them, they muſt ſind them in their own hearts; which they ſeemed to wonder at. We aſked them, Who baptized John the baptiſt? who baptized Peter, John, and the reſt of the apoſtles? and put them to prove by ſcripture, that theſe were baptized in water: but they were ſilent, Then I aſked them, Seeing Judas,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037441_0113_100D8E40D45B9FC8"/>who betrayed Chriſt, and was called the ſon of perdition, had hanged himſelf, what ſon of perdition was that which Paul ſpake of, that ſat in the temple of God, exalted above all that is called God? And what temple of God that was in which this ſon of perdition ſat? And whether he, that betrays Chriſt within in himſelf, be not one in nature with that Judas that betrayed Chriſt without? But they could not tell what to make of this, nor what to ſay to it. So after ſome diſcourſe we parted; and ſome of them were loving to us.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt-day following we came to Bagworth, and went to a ſteeple-houſe, where ſome friends were got in, and the people locked them in, and themſelves too, with the prieſt. But after the prieſt had done, they opened the door, and we went in alſo, and had ſervice for the Lord amongſt them. Afterwards we had a meeting in the town, amongſt ſeveral that were in high notions. Then paſſing from thence, I heard of a people in priſon at Coventry for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As I walked towards the gaol, the word of the Lord came to me ſaying, MY LOVE WAS ALWAYS TO THEE, AND THOU ART IN MY LOVE. And I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with the ſenſe of the love of God, and greatly ſtrengthened in my inward man. But when I came into the gaol where thoſe priſoners were, a great power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtruck at me; and I ſat ſtill, having my ſpirit gathered into the love of God. At laſt theſe priſoners began to rant, vapour and blaſpheme; at which my ſoul was greatly griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They ſaid, they were God; but we could not bear ſuch things. When they were calm, I ſtood up and aſked them, Whether they did ſuch things by motion, or from Scripture? They ſaid, From Scripture. Then a bible lying by, I aſked them for that ſcripture; and they ſhewed me that place where the ſheet was let down to Peter; and it was ſaid to him, what was ſanctified he ſhould not call common or unclean. When I had ſhewed them That ſcripture made nothing for their purpoſe, they brought another, which ſpake of God's reconciling all things to himſelf, things in heaven and things in earth. I told them I owned that ſcripture alſo; but ſhewed them it was nothing to their purpoſe neither. Them ſeeing they ſaid, They were God, I aſked them, If they knew whether it would rain to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? They ſaid, They could not tell. I told them, God could tell. I aſked them, If they thought they ſhould be always in that condition, or ſhould change? They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037441_0114_100D8E4264C99658"/>They could not tell. Then ſaid I, God can tell, and he doth not change. You ſay you are God; at I yet you cannot tell whether you ſhall change or no. So they were conſounded, and quite brought down for the time. After I had reproved them for their blaſphemous expreſſions, I went away; for I perceived they were Ranters. I had met with none before; and I admired the goodneſs of the Lord in appearing ſo unto me, before I went amongſt them. Not long after this, one of theſe Ranters, whoſe name was Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Salmon, publiſhed a recantation; upon which they were ſet at liberty.</p>
                  <p>From Coventry I went to Atherſtone; and it being their lecture-day, I was moved to go to their chapel to ſpeak to the prieſt and people. They were generally pretty quiet; only ſome ſew raged, and would have had my relations to have bound me. I declared largely to them, that God was come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his people himſelf, and to bring them from all their man-made teachers, to hear his Son; and ſome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced there.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to Market-Boſſoth, and there was a lecture alſo. He that preached was Nathaniel Stevens, the prieſt of the town where I was born. He raged much when I ſpake, and told the people I was mad; though he had ſaid before to Colonel Purfoy, There was never ſuch a plant bred in England: he bid the people not to hear me; who, being ſtirred up by this deceitful prieſt, fell upon us, and ſtoned us out of the town: yet they did not do us much hurt. Howbeit ſome people were made loving that day; and others were confirmed, ſeeing the rage of both prieſts and profeſſors; and ſome cried out, that the prieſt durſt not ſtand to prove his miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>As I travelled through markets, fairs, and divers places, I ſaw death and darkneſs in all people, where the power of the Lord had not ſhaken them. As I was paſſing on in leiceſterſhire, I came to Twy-Croſs, where there were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſemen. I was moved of the Lord to go and warn them to take heed of oppreſſing the poor; and people were much affected with it. There was in that town a great man that had long lain ſick, and was given over by the phyſicians. Some friends in the town deſired me to viſit him. I went up to him in his chamber, and ſpake the word of life to him, and was moved to pray by him; and the Lord was entreated, and reſtored him to health. When I was come down the ſtairs into a lower room, and was ſpeaking to the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037441_0115_100D8E44592C5DD0"/>ſervants, and others there, a ſervant man of his came raving out of another room, with a naked rapier in his hand, and ſet it juſt to my ſide. I looked ſteadfaſtly on him, and ſaid, <q>Alack for thee, poor creature! what wilt thou do with thy carnal weapon? It is no more to me than a ſtraw.</q> The ſtanders-by were much troubled, and he went away in a rage. But when the news of it came to his maſter, he turned him out of his ſervice. Thus the Lord's power preſerved me, and raiſed up the, weak man; who afterwards was very loving to friends. When I came to that town again, both he and his wife came to ſee me.</p>
                  <p>After this I was moved to go into Derbyſhire, where the mighty power of God was among friends. I went to Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfield, where one Britland was prieſt. He ſaw beyond the common ſort of prieſts; for he had been partly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and had ſpoken much on behalf of truth before he was prieſt there: but when the prieſt of that town died, he got the parſonage, and choked himſelf with it. I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſpeak to him and the people in the great love of God, that they might come off from all men's teaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's teaching; and he was not able to gainſay. But they had me before the mayor, and threatened to ſend me, with ſome others, to the houſe of correction; and kept us in cuſtody till it was late in the night. Then the officers with the watchmen, put us out of the town, leaving us to ſhift as we could. I bent my courſe towards Derby, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend or two with me. In our way we met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſors; and at Kidſey Park many were convinced.</p>
                  <p>Coming to Derby, I lay at a doctor's houſe, whoſe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> was convinced; and ſeveral more in the town. As I was walking in my chamber, the bell rung; and it ſtruck at my life at the very hearing of it. So I aſked the woman of the houſe, What the bell rung for? She ſaid, There was to be a great lecture there that day, and many officers of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, prieſts, and preachers, were to be there, and a colonel, that was a preacher. Then was I moved of the Lord to go up to them. When they had done, I ſpake to them what the Lord commanded me; and they were pretty quiet. But there came an officer, and took me by the hand, and ſaid, I muſt go before the magiſtrates, and the other two that were with me. It was about the firſt hour after noon that we came before them. They alked me, Why we came thither? I ſaid, God moved us ſo to do; and told them, "God dwells not in temples made with hands." I
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037441_0116_100D8E45F39C3438"/>alſo ſaid, All their preaching, baptiſm, and ſacrifices would never ſanctify them; and bid them look unto Chriſt in them, and not unto men; for it is Chriſt that ſanctiſies. Then they ran into many words; but I told them they were not to diſpute of God and Chriſt, but to obey him. The power of God thundered among them, and they did fly like chaff before it. They put me in and out of the room often, hurrying me backward and forward, for they were from the firſt hour till the ninth at night in examining me. Sometimes they would tell me in a deriding manner, that I was taken up in raptures. At laſt they aſked me, Whether I was ſanctified? I anſwered, Yes; for I was in the paradiſe of God. Then they aſked me, If I had no ſin? I anſwered, Chriſt my Saviour has taken away my ſin; and in him there is no ſin. They aſked, How we knew that Chriſt did abide in us? I ſaid, By his Spirit that he hath given us. They temptingly aſked, If any of us were Chriſt? I anſwered, Nay, we were nothing, Chriſt was all. They ſaid, If a man ſteal, is it no ſin? I anſwered, All unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs is ſin. When they had wearied themſelves in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining me, they committed me and one other man to the houſe of correction in Derby for ſix months, as blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers; as may appear by the mittimus, a copy whereof here followeth:</p>

Now did the prieſts beſtir themſelves in their pulpits to preach up ſin for term of life. Much of their work was, to plead for it; ſo that people ſaid, Never was the like heard. After ſome time, the perſon committed with me, not ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithful in his teſtimony, got in with the gaoler, and by him made way to the juſtice to have leave to go ſee his mother; and ſo got his liberty. It then was reported, that he ſaid I had bewitched and deceived him: but my ſpirit was ſtrengthened when he was gone. The prieſts, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, juſtices, and the gaoler, were all in a great rage againſt me. The gaoler watched my words and actions, often aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me queſtions to enſnare me; and ſometimes he would aſk me ſuch ſilly queſtions, as, Whether the door was latched or not? Thinking to draw ſome ſudden, unadviſed anſwer from me, from whence he might take advantage to charge ſin upon me: but I was kept watchſul and chaſte, ſo that they could get no advantage of me; which they admired.</p>
                  <p>Not long after my commitment, I was moved to write to the prieſts and magiſtrates of Derby. And firſt to the prieſts.</p>

                        <p>O Friends, I was ſent to you to tell you, That if you had received the goſpel freely, you would miniſter it freely without money or price: but you make a trade and ſale of what the prophets and apoſtles have ſpoken; and ſo you corrupt the truth.

                        <p>THOU that doſt profeſs God and Chriſt in words, ſee how thou followeſt him. To take off burdens, to viſit them that are in priſon, to ſhew mercy, cloath thy own fleſh, and deal thy bread to the hungry; theſe are God's commandments. To relieve the fatherleſs, to viſit the widows in their affliction, and to keep thyſelf unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the world, this is pure religion before God. But if thou profeſs Chriſt, and followeſt covetouſneſs and earthly-mindedneſs, thou denieſt him in life, deceiveſt thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, and takeſt him for a cloak. Wo be to you, greedy men and rich men; weep and howl for your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſhall come! Take heed of covetouſneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion: God doth forbid that.

                  <p>While I was here in priſon divers profeſſors came to diſcourſe with me. I had a ſenſe before they ſpoke, that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037441_0122_100D8E54B366B100"/>they came to plead for ſin and imperfection. I aſked them, Whether they were believers and had faith? They ſaid, Yes. I aſked them, In whom? They ſaid, In Chriſt. I replied, If ye are true believers in Chriſt, you are paſſed from death to life; and if paſſed from death, then from ſin that bringeth death: and if your faith be true, it will give you victory over ſin and the devil, puriſy your hearts and conſciences (for the true faith is held in a pure conſcience) and bring you to pleaſe God, and give you acceſs to him again. But they could not endure to hear of purity, and of victory over ſin and the devil. They ſaid, <q>They could not believe any could be free from ſin on this ſide the grave.</q> I bid them give over babbling about the ſcriptures, which were holy men's words, whilſt they plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for unholineſs. At another time a company of profeſſors came, who alſo began to plead for ſin. I aſked them, Whether they had hope? They ſaid. Yes: God forbid but we ſhould have hope. I aſked them, What hope is it that you have? Is Chriſt in you the hope of your glory? Doth it purify you, as he is pure? But they could not abide to hear of being made pure here. Then I bid them forbear talking of the ſcriptures, which were the holy men's words; for the holy men that wrote the ſcriptures pleaded for holineſs in heart, life, and converſation here; but ſince you plead for impurity and ſin, which is of the devil, what have you to do with the holy men's words?</p>
                  <p>The keeper of the priſon, being an high profeſſor, was greatly enraged againſt me, and ſpoke very wickedly of me; but it pleaſed the Lord one day to ſtrike him ſo, that he was in great trouble, and under much terror of mind. And as I was walking in my chamber, I heard a doleful noiſe; and ſtanding ſtill, I heard him ſay to his wife, <q>Wife, I have ſeen the day of judgment; and I ſaw GEORGE there, and I was afraid of him; becauſe I had done him ſo much wrong, and ſpoken ſo much againſt him to the miniſters and profeſſors, and to the juſtices, and in taverns and alchouſes.</q> After this, towards the evening, he came into my chamber, and ſaid to me, <q>I have been as a lion againſt you; but now I come like a lamb, and like the gaoler that came to Paul and Silas trembling.</q> And he deſired he might lodge with me; I told him, I was in his power, he might do what he would: but he ſaid, <q>Nay, he would have my leave; and he could deſire to be always with me, but not to have me as a priſoner.</q> He ſaid,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037441_0123_100D8E564B77C698"/>
                     <q>He had been plagued, and his houſe had been plagued for my ſake.</q> So I ſuffered him to lodge with me. Then he told me all his heart, and ſaid, He believed what I had ſaid of the true faith and hope to be true; and he wondered that the other man, who was put in priſon with me, did not ſtand it; and ſaid, <q>That man was not right, but I was an honeſt man.</q> He confeſſed alſo to me, that at thoſe times when I had aſked him to let me go forth to ſpeak the word of the Lord to the people, when he refuſed to let me go, and I laid the weight thereof upon him, that he uſed to be under great trouble, amazed, and almoſt diſtracted for ſome time after, and in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had little ſtrength left him. When the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came, he roſe and went to the juſtices, and told them, "That he and his houſe had been plagued for my ſake." One of the juſtices replied (as he reported to me) that the plagues were upon them too for keeping me. This was juſtice Bennet of Derby, who was the firſt that called us Quakers, becauſe I bid them tremble at the word of the Lord. This was in the year 1650.</p>
                  <p>After this the juſtices gave leave, that I ſhould have liberty to walk a mile. I perceived their end, and told the gaoler. If they would ſet down to me how far a mile was, I might take the liberty of walking it ſometimes. For I had a ſenſe that they thought I would go away. And the gaoler confeſſed afterwards they did it with that intent to have me go away, to eaſe them of their plague; but I told him I was not of that ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>This gaoler had a ſiſter, a ſickly young woman. She came up into my chamber to viſit me; and after ſhe had ſtaid ſome time, and I had ſpoken the words of truth to her, ſhe went down, and told them, <q>we were an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people, and did none any hurt, but did good to all, even to them that hated us;</q> and deſired them to be tender towards me.</p>
                  <p>As by reaſon of my reſtraint I had not the opportunity of travelling about to declare and ſpread truth through the countries, it came upon me to write a paper, and ſend it forth to be ſpread amongſt friends and other tender people, for the opening of their underſtandings in the way of truth, and directing them to the true teacher in themſelves.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037441_0124_100D8E588701E648"/>be brought to ſee his evil thoughts, running mind, and vain imaginations, and may ſtrive to keep them down, and to keep his mind in; but cannot overcome them, nor keep his mind within to the Lord. In this ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſubmit to the Spirit of the Lord that ſhews them, and that will bring to wait upon the Lord; and he that hath diſcovered them will deſtroy them. Therefore ſtand in the faith of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (who is the author of the true faith) and mind him; for he will diſcover the root of luſts, evil thoughts, and vain imaginations; how they are begotten, conceived, and bred; how they are brought forth, and how every evil member doth work. He will diſcover every principle from its own nature and root.</p>
                        <p>So mind the faith of Chriſt, and the anointing which is in you, to be taught by it, which will diſcover all work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in you. As he teacheth you, ſo obey and forſake; elſe you will not grow in the faith, nor in the life of Chriſt, where the love of God is received. Love beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth love, its own nature and image: and when mercy and truth meet, what joy there is! Mercy triumphs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and love and mercy bear the judgment of the world in patience. That which cannot bear the world's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the love of God; for love beareth all things, and is above the world's judgment; for the world's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is but fooliſhneſs. Though it be the world's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice to caſt all the filthineſs that is among themſelves upon the ſaints, yet their judgment is falſe. The chaſte virgins follow Chriſt the lamb, that takes away the ſins of the world; but they that are of that ſpirit which is not chaſte, will not follow Chriſt the lamb in his ſteps, but are diſobedient to him in his commands. The fleſhly mind doth mind the fleſh, talketh fleſhly, and its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is fleſhly, and not ſpiritual; but ſavours of death, not of the Spirit of life. Some men have the nature of ſwine wallowing in the mire. Some have the nature of dogs, to bite both the ſheep and one another. Some have the nature of lions, to tear, devour, and deſtroy. Some the nature of wolves, to tear and devour the lambs and ſheep of Chriſt: and ſome the nature of the ſerpent (that old adverſary) to ſting, envenom, and poiſon. <q>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear,</q> and learn theſe things within himſelf. Some men have the natures of other beaſts and creatures, minding nothing but earthly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, and feeding without the fear of God. Some
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037441_0125_100D8E5A37305778"/>have the nature of a horſe, to prance and vapour in their ſtrength, and to be ſwift in doing evil. Some have the nature of tall ſturdy oaks, to flouriſh and ſpread in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſtrength, who are ſtrong in evil, which muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and come to the fire. Thus evil is but one in all, but worketh many ways; and whatſoever a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's nature is addicted to that is outward, the evil one will ſuit him, and pleaſe his nature and appetite, to keep his mind in his inventions, and in the creatures from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. O therefore let not the mind go from God; for if it do, it will be ſtained, venomed, and corrupted. If the mind go forth from the Lord, it is hard to bring it in again: therefore take heed of the enemy, and keep in the faith of Chriſt. Oh! therefore mind that which is eternal and inviſible, and him who is the Creator and Mover of all things: for the things that are made, are not made of things that appear; for the viſible covereth the inviſible ſight in you. But as the Lord, who is inviſible, doth open you by his inviſible power and ſpirit, and brings down the carnal mind in you; ſo the inviſible and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal things are brought to light in you. O therefore you that know the light, walk in the light! for there are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſs that will talk of the light, and of the truth, yet not walk in it; but the children of light love the light, and walk in the light. But the children of darkneſs walk in darkneſs, and hate the light. In them the earthly luſts and carnal mind choke the ſeed of faith, which bringeth oppreſſion on the ſeed, and death over themſelves. O therefore mind the pure Spirit of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, which will teach you to uſe the creatures in, their right place, and which judgeth the evil. <q>To thee, O God, be all glory and honour, who art Lord of all viſibles and inviſibles! To thee be all praiſe, who bringeſt out of the deep to thyſelf; O powerful God, who art worthy of all glory!</q> For the Lord who created all, and "gives life and ſtrength to all, is over all and merciful to all. <q>So thou, who haſt made all, and art over all, to thee be all glory! In thee is my ſtrength, refreſhment, and life, my joy and my gladneſs, my rejoicing and glorying for evermore!</q> To live and walk in the Spirit of God is joy, peace, and life; but the mind going forth into the creatures, or into any viſible things from the Lord, this bringeth death. When the mind is got into the fleſh, and into death, the accuſer gets within, and the law of ſin and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037441_0126_100D8E5D59AFF168"/>death gets into the fleſh. Then the life ſuffers under the law of ſin and death, and then there is ſtraitneſs and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For then the good is ſhut up, and the ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is ſet atop. Then man doth work in the outward law, though he cannot juſtify himſelf by the law, but is condemned by the light: for he cannot get out of that ſtate, but by abiding in the light, reſting in the mercy of God, and believing in him from whom all mercy flows. For there is peace in reſting in the Lord Jeſus. This is the narrow way that leads to him, the life; but few will abide in it. Keep in the innocency, and be obedient to the faith in him. Take heed of conforming to the world, and of reaſoning with fleſh and blood, for that bringeth diſobedience; and then imaginations and queſtionings ariſe, to draw from obedience to the truth of Chriſt. But the obedience of faith deſtroyeth imaginations, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. and reaſonings, with all the temptations in the fleſh, buffetings, lookings forth, and fetching up things that are paſt. But, not keeping in the life and light, not croſſing the corrupt will by the power of God, the evil nature grows up in man; then burdens will come, and man will be ſtained with that nature. But Eſau's mountain ſhall be laid waſte, and become a wilderneſs, where the dragons lie; but Jacob, the ſecond birth, ſhall be fruitful and ſhall ariſe. For Eſau is hated, and muſt not be lord; but Jacob, the ſecond birth, which is perfect and plain, ſhall be lord; for he is beloved of God.</p>

So I was had up before the juſtices; and becauſe I would not conſent that they or any ſhould be bound for me (for I was innocent from any ill behaviour. and had ſpoken the word of life and truth unto them) juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Bennet roſe up in a range; and as I was kneeling down to pray to the Lord to forgive him, he ran upon me, and ſtruck me with both his hands, crying, <q>away with him, gaoler: take him away, gaoler.</q> Whereupon I was had again to priſon, and there kept, till the time of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment for ſix months was expired.

Now, friends, where is your example, if the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be your rule, to impriſon for religion? Have you any command for it from Chriſt? If that were in you, which you profeſs, you would walk in their ſteps who ſpake the ſcriptures. But he is not a Jew who is one outward, whoſe praiſe is of Men; but he is a Jew who is one inward, whoſe praiſe is of God.

The ſaints, whom the love of God did change, were brought thereby to walk in love and mercy; for he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God. But where envy, pride, and hatred rule, the nature of the world rules, not the nature of Jeſus Chriſt.

Love the croſs; ſatisfy not your own minds in the fleſh; but prize your time while you have it. and walk up to that you know, in obedience to God; then you ſhall not be condemned for that you know not, but for that you know, and do not obey.

While I was ſpeaking to him, the Lord's power opened him ſo that he began to have a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Lord's truth, and to be ſenſible of God's mercies. He ſpoke boldly in his quarters amongſt the ſoldiers, and to others, concerning truth (for the ſcriptures were very much opened to him) inſomuch that he ſaid, <q>His colonel was a blind as Nebuchadnezzar, to caſt the ſervant of the Lord into priſon.</q> Upon this, his colonel conceived a ſpite againſt him: and at Worceſter fight the year after, when the two armies lay near one another, two came out from the king's army, and challenged any two of the parliament army to fight with them; his colonel made choice of him and another to anſwer the challenge. And when in the encounter his companion was ſlain, he drove both his enemies within muſket-ſhot of the town, without ſiring a piſtol at them. This, when he returned, he told me with his own mouth. But when the ſight was over, he ſaw the deceit and hypocriſy of the officers; and being ſenſible how wonderfully the Lord had preſerved him, and ſeeing alſo to the end of fighting, he laid down his arms.</p>
                  <p>The time of my commitment to the houſe of correction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very near out, and there being many new ſoldiers raiſed, the commiſſioners would have made me captain over them; and the ſoldiers cried, They would have none but me. So the keeper of the houſe of correction was commanded to
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037441_0133_100D8E6BEEF73950"/>bring me before the commiſſioners and ſoldiers in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place; where they offered me that preferment, as they called it, aſkingme, If I would not take up arms for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth againſt Charles Stewart? I told them I knew from whence all wars aroſe, even from the luſts, according to James's doctrine; and that I lived in the virtue of that life and power that took away the occaſion of all wars. Yet they courted me to accept of their offer, and thought I did but compliment them. But I told them I was come into the covenant of peace, which was before wars and ſtrifes were. They ſaid, They offered it in love and kindneſs to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my virtue; and ſuch-like flattering words they uſed. But I told them, If that was their love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I trampled it under my feet. Then their rage got up, and they ſaid, <q>Take him away, Gaoler, and put him into the priſon amongſt the rogues and felons.</q> So I was put into a louſy ſtinking place, without any bed, amongſt thirty felons, where I was kept almoſt half a year; yet at times they would het me walk to the garden, believing I would not go away. When they had got me into Derby pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it was the ſaying of people that I ſhould never come out; but I had faith in God that I ſhould be delivered in his time: for the Lord had given me to believe that I was not to be removed from that place yet, being ſet there for a ſervice which he had for me to do.</p>
                  <p>After it was bruited abroad that I was in Derby priſon, my relations came to ſee me again; and were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that I ſhould be in priſon; for they looked upon it to be a great ſhame to them for me to lie in gaol. It was a ſtrange thing then to be impriſoned for religion; and ſome thought I was mad, becauſe I ſtood for purity, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection.</p>
                  <p>Among others that came to ſee and diſcourſe with me, there was a certain perſon from Nottingham, a ſoldier, who had been a baptiſt, as I underſtood, and with him came ſeveral others. In diſcourſe, this perſon ſaid to me, <q>Your faith ſtands in a man that died at Jeruſalem, and there never was any ſuch thing.</q> Being exceedingly grieved to hear him, I ſaid, <q>How! did not Chriſt ſuffer without the gates of Jeruſalem, through the profeſſing Jews, chief prieſts, and Pilate?</q> He denied that ever Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered there outwardly. Then I aſked him, Whether there were not chief prieſt, and Jews, and Pilate there outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? When he could not deny that, I told him, As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037441_0134_100D8E6DE1406F98"/>as there was a chief prieſt, and Jews and Pilate there outwardly, ſo certainly was Chriſt perſecuted by them, and did ſuffer there outwardly under them, Yet from this man's words was a ſtander raiſed upon us, That the Quakers ſhould deny Chriſt, that ſuffered and died at Jeruſalem: which was all utterly falſe; the leaſt thought of it never entered our hearts. The ſame perſon alſo ſaid. That never any of the prophets, nor apoſtles, nor holy men of God, ſuffered any thing outwardly, but all their ſufferings were inward. I inſtanced to him many of the prophets and apoſtles, how and by whom they ſuffered. So the power of the Lord was brought over his wicked imaginations and whimſies.</p>
                  <p>There came alſo another company to me, that pretended they were triers of ſpirits: I aſked them, What was the firſt ſtep to peace? And what it was by which a man might ſee his ſalvation? They were preſently up in the airy mind, and ſaid, I was mad. Thus they came to try ſpirits, who did not know themſelves nor their own ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>In this time of my impriſonment I was exceedingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about the proceedings of the judges and magiſtrates in their courts of judicature, and was moved to write to the judges concerning their putting men to death for ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and to ſhew them how contrary it was to the law of God in old time; for I was under great ſuffering in my ſpirit becauſe of it, and under the very ſenſe of death; but ſtanding in the will of God, an heavenly breathing aroſe in my ſoul to the Lord. Then did I ſee the heavens open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I rejoiced, and gave glory to God. So I wrote to the judges in manner following:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>I AM moved to write unto you, to take heed of putting men to death for ſtealing cattle, or money, &amp;c. for thieves in old time were to make reſtitution; and if they had not wherewith, they were to be ſold for their theft. Mind the laws of God in the ſcriptures, and the Spirit that gave them forth; let them be your rule in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting judgment; and ſhew mercy, that you may receive mercy from God, the judge of all. Take heed of gifts and rewards, and of pride; for God doth forbid them, and they blind the eyes of the wiſe. I do not write to give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſin, God hath forbidden it; but that you ſhould judge according to his laws, and ſhew mercy; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in true judgment, and in mercy. I beſeech you,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037441_0135_100D8E7010C99798"/>mind theſe things, prize your time, now you have it; fear God, and ſerve him, for he is a conſuming fire.</p>

                  <p>Beſides this, I wrote another letter to the judges, to this effect:</p>

                  <p>Moreover, I laid before the judges what an hurtful thing it was that priſoners ſhould lie ſo long in gaol; ſhewing how they learned wickedneſs one of another, in talking of their bad deeds; therefore ſpeedy juſtice ſhould be done. For I was a tender youth, and dwelt in the fear of God; and being grieved to hear their bad language, I was often made to reprove them for their wicked words, and evil car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards each other. People admired that I was ſo preſerved and kept; for they never could catch a word or action from me, to make any thing of againſt me, all the time I was there; for the Lord's infinite power upheld and preſerved me all that time; to him be praiſes and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever!</p>
                  <p>While I was here, there was a young, woman in the gaol for robbing her maſter. When ſhe was to be tried for her life, I wrote to the judge and jury, ſhewing them how contrary it was to the law of God in old time to put people to death for ſtealing; and moving them to ſhew mercy. Yet ſhe was condemned to die, and a grave was made for her; and at the time appointed ſhe was carried forth to execution. Then I wrote a few words, warning all to beware of greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or covetouſneſs, for it leads from God; and that all ſhould fear the Lord, avoid earthly luſts, and prize their
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037441_0136_100D8E71A4AB2560"/>time while they have it: this I gave to be read at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. And though they had her upon the ladder, with a cloth bound over her face, ready to be turned off. yet they did not put her to death, but brought her back to priſon, where ſhe afterwards came to be convinced of God's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo in the gaol, while I was there, a wicked ungodly man who was reputed a conjurer. He threatened he would talk with me, and what he would do; but he never had power to open his mouth to me. And the gaoler and he falling out, he threatened to raiſe the devil, and break his houſe down; ſo that he made the gaoler afraid. I was moved of the Lord to go in his power and rebuke him, and to ſay to him <q>Come, let's ſee what thou canſt do; do thy worſt.</q> I told him <q>The devil was raiſed high enough in him already; but the power of God chained him down;</q> ſo he ſlunk away from me.</p>
                  <p>The time of Worceſter fight coming on, juſtice Bennet ſent conſtables to preſs me for a ſoldier, ſeeing I would not voluntarily accept of a command. I told them, that I was brought off from outward wars. They came again to give me preſs-money; but I would take none. Then I was brought up to ſerjeant Holes, kept there awhile, and taken down again. Afterwards the conſtables brought me a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time before the commiſſioners, who ſaid I ſhould go for a ſoldier; but I told them I was dead to it. They ſaid I was alive. I told them, where envy and hatred is, there is confuſion. They offered me money twice, but I refuſed it. Being diſappointed, they were angry, and committed me cloſe priſoner, without bail or mainprize. Whereupon I wrote to them again, directing my letter to colonel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a preacher, and the reſt that were concerned in my commitment. I wrote thus:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>YOU who are without Chriſt, and yet uſe the words which he and his ſaints have ſpoken, conſider neither he nor his apoſtles did ever impriſon any; but our Saviour is merciful even to the unmerciful and rebellious.

                  <p>About this time I was moved to give forth the following lines, to go amongſt the convinced and tender people, to manifeſt the deceits of the world, and how the prieſts have deceived the people.</p>
                  <p>To all that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with a pure and naked heart, and the generation of the righteous.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>CHRIST was ever hated; and the righteous for his ſake. Mind who they were that did ever hate them. He that was born after the fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit; ſo it is now. Mind who were the chiefeſt againſt Chriſt; even the great learned men, the heads of the people, rulers, and teachers, that profeſſed the law and the prophets, and looked for Chriſt. They looked for an outwardly-glorious Chriſt, to hold up their outward glory; but Chriſt ſpoke againſt the works of the world, and againſt the prieſts, ſcribes, and phariſees, and their hypocritical profeſſion. He that is a ſtranger to Chriſt, is an hireling; but the ſervants of Chriſt are free men. Falſe teachers always laid burdens upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the true ſervants of the Lord declared againſt them. Jeremiah ſpoke againſt hirelings, and ſaid. It was an horrible thing; and, What will ye do in the end? For the people and prieſts were given to covetouſneſs. Paul ſpoke againſt ſuch as made gain upon the people, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the ſaints to turn away from ſuch as were covetous and proud, ſuch as loved pleaſures more than God, ſuch as had a form of godlineſs, but denied the power thereof. "For of this ſort;", ſaid he <q>are they, that creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women, who are ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The apoſtle in his time ſaw this corruption entering, which now is ſpread over the world, of having a form of godlineſs but denying the power. Aſk any of your teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whether you, may ever overcome your corruptions or ſins? None of them believe that: but <q>as long as man is here, he muſt (ſay they) carry about with him the body of ſin.</q> Thus pride is kept up, and that honour and maſterſhip which Chriſt denied, and all unrightcouſneſs. Yet multitudes of teachers! heaps of teachers! the golden cup full of abominations! Paul did not preach for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but laboured with his hands, that he might be an example to all that follow him. O people, ſee who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Paul! The prophet Jeremiah ſaid, <q>The prophets propheſy falſely, and the prieſts bear rule by their means;</q> but now the prieſts bear rule by the means they get from the people: take away their means, and they will bear rule over you no longer. They are ſuch as the apoſtle ſaid, <q>Intruded into thoſe things which they never ſaw, being vainly puffed up with a fleſhly mind;</q> and as the ſcriptures declare of ſome of old, <q>They go in the way of Cain, who was a murderer, and in the way of Balaam, who coveted the wages of unrighteouſneſs.</q> The prophet Micah alſo cried againſt the judges that judged for reward, and the prieſts that taught for hire, and the prophets that propheſied for money; yet leaned on the Lord, ſaying. "Is not the Lord amongſt us?" Gifts blind the eyes of the wiſe. The gift of God was never purchaſed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

What doth the Lord require of you, but to do juſtice, to love and ſhew mercy, to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with him, and to help the widows and fatherleſs to their right? But inſtead thereof ye oppreſs the poor. Do not your judges judge for rewards, and your prieſts teach for hire? The time is coming, that he who ſeeth all things will diſcover all your ſecrets. Know this aſſuredly, The Lord will deliver his ſervants our of your hands, and he will recompenſe all your unjuſt dealings towards his people. I deſire you to conſider of theſe things; ſearch the ſcriptures, and ſee, whether any of the people of God did ever impriſon any for religion.

Great was the exerciſe and travail in ſpirit that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went during my impriſonment here, becauſe of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was in this town; for though ſome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, yet the generality were a hardened people. I ſaw the viſitation of God's love paſs away from them. I mourned over them; and it came upon me to give forth the following lines, as a lamentation for them:</p>

                        <p>AS the waters run away when the flood-gates are up, ſo doth the viſitation of God's love paſs away from thee, O Derby! Therefore look where thou art, and how thou art grounded; and conſider, before thou art utterly forſaken. The Lord moved me twice before I came to cry againſt the deceits and vanities that are in thee, and to warn all to look at the Lord, and not at man. The wo is againſt the crown of pride, againſt drunkenneſs and vain pleaſures, and againſt them that make a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religion in words, yet are high and lofty in mind, and live in oppreſſion and envy. O Derby! thy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and preaching ſtinks before the Lord. You profeſs a ſabbath in words, and meet together, dreſſing yourſelves in fine apparel, and you uphold pride. Thy women go with ſtretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, &amp;c. which the true prophets of old cried againſt. Your aſſemblies are odious, an abomination to the Lord: pride is ſet up and bowed down to, covetouſneſs abounds, and he that doth wickedly is honoured. So deceit bears with deceit, yet they profeſs Chriſt in words. Oh! the deceit that is within thee! It even breaks my heart to ſee how God is diſhonoured in thee, O Derby!</p>

                  <p>After I had ſeen the viſitation of God's love paſs away from this place, I knew that my impriſonment here would, not continue long; but I ſaw that when the Lord ſhould bring me forth, it would be as the letting of a lion out of a den amongſt the wild beaſts of the foreſt. For all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſtood in a beaſtly ſpirit and nature, pleading for ſin, and for the body of ſin and imperfection, as long as they lived. They raged, and ran againſt the life and ſpirit which gave forth the ſcriptures, yet profeſſed them in words, as will appear hereafter.</p>
                  <p>There was a great judgment upon the town, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were uneaſy about me; but could not agree what to do with me. One while they would have ſent me up to

At length they were made to turn me out of gaol, about the beginning of winter in the year 1651, after I had been a priſoner in Derby almoſt a year; ſix months in the houſe of correction, and the reſt of the time in the common gaol.</p>
                  <p>Being at liberty I went on, as before, in the work of the Lord. paſſing through the country into Leiceſterſhire, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meetings as I went; and the Lord's Spirit and power accompanied me. Afterwards I went near Burton upon Trent, where ſome were convinced; and to Buſhel-Houſe, where I had a meeting. I went into the country, where there were friendly people; yet an outrageous wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor had an intent to have done me a miſchief, but the Lord prevented him: bleſſed be the Lord!</p>
                  <p>As I was walking with ſeveral friends, I lifted up my head, and ſaw three ſteeple-houſe ſpires, and they ſtruck at my life. I aſked them what place that was? They ſaid, Lichfield. Immediately the word of the Lord came to me, that I muſt go thither. Being come to the houſe we were going to, I wiſh'd friends to walk into the houſe, ſaying nothing to them whither I was to go. As ſoon as they were gone I ſtept away, and went by my eye over hedge and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a great field, ſhepherds were keeping their ſheep. Then was I commanded by the Lord to pull off my ſhoes. I ſtood ſtill, for it was winter; and the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I put off my ſhoes, and left them with the ſhepherds; and the poor ſhepherds trembled, and were aſtoniſhed. Then I walked on about a mile, and as ſoon as I was got within the city, the word of the Lord came to me again, ſaying; Cry, <q>Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield!</q> So I went up and down the ſtreets, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a loud voice, WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD! It being market-day, I went into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and to and fro in the ſeveral parts of it, and made ſtands, crying as before, WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying through the ſtreets, there ſeemed to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037441_0142_100D8E7F5C26F860"/>me to be a channel of blood running down the ſtreets, and the market-place appeared like a pool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt myſelf clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds gave them ſome money, and took my ſhoes of them again. But the ſire of the Lord was ſo in my feet, and all over me, that I did not matter to put on my ſhoes again, and was at a ſtand whether I ſhould or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord ſo to do: them, after I had waſhed my feet, I put on my ſhoes again. After this a deep conſideration came upon me, for what reaſon I ſhould be ſent to cry againſt that city, and call it THE BLOODY CITY! For though the parliament had the minſter one while, and the king another, and much blood had been ſhed in the town during the wars between them, yet that was no more than had befallen many other places. But afterwards I came to underſtand, that in the emperor Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian's time a thouſand Chriſtians were martyr'd in Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. So I was to go, without my ſhoes, through the channel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the market-place, that I might raiſe up the memorial of the blood of thoſe martyrs, which had been ſhed above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before, and lay cold in their ſtreets. So the ſenſe of this blood was upon me, and I obeyed the word of the Lord. Ancient records teſtify how many of the chriſtian Britons ſuffered there. Much I could write of the ſenſe I had of the blood of the martyrs, that hath been ſhed in this nation for the name of Chriſt, both under the ten perſecutions and ſince; but I leave it to the Lord, and to his book, out of which all ſhall be judged; for his book is a moſt certain record, and his Spirit a true recorder.</p>
                  <p>Then I paſſed through the countries, having meetings amongſt friendly people in many places; but my relations were offended at me. After ſome time I returned into Nottinghamſhire, to Mansfield, and into Derbyſhire, viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends. Then paſſing into Yorkſhire, I preached re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance through Doncaſter, and ſeveral other places; and came to Balby, where Richard Far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſworth and others were convinced. So travelling through ſeveral places, preaching repentance, and the word of life to the people, I came into the parts about Wakefield, where James Nayler lived; who, with Thomas Goodyear, came to me, and were both convinced, and received the truth. William Dewſbury alſo and his wife, with many more came to me, who were
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037441_0143_100D8E81972F68D8"/>convinced, and received the truth. From thence I paſſed towards captain Purſloe's by Selby, and viſited John Leek, who had been to ſee me in Derby priſon, and was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I had a horſe, but was fain to leave him, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do with him; for I was moved to go to many great houſes, to admoniſh and exhort the people to turn to the Lord. I was moved of the Lord to go to Beverly ſteeple-houſe, which was a place of high profeſſion. Being very wet with rain, I went firſt to an inn. As ſoon as I came to the door, a young woman of the houſe ſaid, "What! is it you? Come in," as if ſhe had known me before; for the Lord's power bowed their hearts. So I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed myſelf, and went to bed. In the morning, my cloaths' being ſtill wet, I got ready, and having paid for what I had, went up to the ſteeple-houſe, where was a man preaching. When he had done, I was moved to ſpeak to him and to the people in the mighty power of God, and turned them to their teacher, Chriſt Jeſus. The power of the Lord was ſo ſtrong, that it ſtruck a mighty dread amongſt the people. The mayor came and ſpoke a few words to me; but none had power to meddle with me. So I paſſed out of the town, and in the afternoon went to another ſteeple-houſe about two miles off. When the prieſt had done I was moved to ſpeak to him and to the people very largely, ſhewing them the way of life and truth, and the ground of election and reprobation. The prieſt ſaid, he was but a child, and could not diſpute with me. I told him I did not come to diſpute, but to hold forth the word of life and truth unto them, that they might all know the one ſeed which the promiſe of God was to, both in the male and in the female. Here the people were very loving, and would have had me come again on a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and preach among them: but I directed them to their teacher, Chriſt Jeſus; and the next day went to Cranſick, to captain Purſloe's; who accompanied me to juſtice Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham's. Juſtice Hotham was a pretty tender man, and had ſome experience of God's workings in his heart. After ſome diſcourſe with him of the things of God, he took me into his cloſet; where ſitting together, he told me he had known that principle theſe ten years, and was glad that the Lord did now ſend his ſervants to publiſh it abroad to the people. After awhile a prieſt came to viſit him, with whom I had ſome diſcourſe concerning truth. His mouth was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037441_0144_100D8E83F08A1238"/>quickly ſtopt; for he was nothing but a notioniſt, and not in poſſeſſion of what he talked of.</p>
                  <p>While I was there, a great woman of Beverly came to juſtice Hotham about ſome buſineſs. In diſcourſe ſhe told him, <q>The laſt ſabbath-day, as ſhe called it, there was an angel or ſpirit came into the church at Beverly, and ſpoke the wonderful things of God, to the aſtoniſhment of all that were there; and when it had done, it paſſed away, and they did not know whence it came nor whither it went; but it aſtoniſhed all, prieſt, profeſſors, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</q> This relation juſtice Hotham gave me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and then I gave him an account that I had been that day at Beverly ſteeple-houſe, and had declared truth to the prieſt and people there.</p>
                  <p>In the country thereabouts were ſome noted prieſts and doctors that juſtice Hotham had acquaintance with. He would fain have them ſpeak with me, and offered to ſend for them, under pretence of ſome buſineſs he had with them; but I wiſh'd him not to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>When firſt-day was come, juſtice Hotham walked out with me into the fields; and captain Purſloe coming after us, juſtice Hotham left us, and returned home; but captain Purſloe went with me into the ſteeple-houſe. When the prieſt had done, I ſpoke to both prieſt and people; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them the word of life and truth, and directed them where they might find their teacher, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Some were convinced, received the truth, and ſtand faſt in it, and have a ſine meeting to this day.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon I went to another ſteeple-houſe, about three miles off, where preached a great high prieſt, called a doctor, one of them whom juſtice Hotham would have ſent for to have ſpoken with me. I went into the ſteeple-houſe, and ſtaid till the prieſt had done. The words which he took for his text were theſe: <q>Ho, every one that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</q> Then was I moved of the Lord God to ſay to him, <q>Come down, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; doſt thou bid people come freely, and take of the water of life freely, and yet thou takeſt three hundred pounds a year of them for preaching the ſcriptures to them? Mayſt thou not bluſh for ſhame? Did the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah and Chriſt do ſo, who ſpake the words, and gave them forth freely?</q> Did not Chriſt ſay to his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037441_0145_100D8E86CD5C6900"/>whom he ſent to preach, <q>Freely ye have received, freely give?</q> The prieſt, like a man amazed, haſted away. After he had left his flock, I had as much time as I could deſire to ſpeak to the people. I directed them from darkneſs to the light, and to the grace of God that would teach them, and bring them ſalvation; to the Spirit of God in their inward parts, which would be a free teacher unto them.</p>
                  <p>Having cleared myſelf amongſt that people, I returned to juſtice Hotham's that night; who, when I came in, took me in his arms, and ſaid, His houſe was my houſe, for he was exceeding glad at the work of the Lord, and that his power was revealed. Then he told me why he went not with me to the ſteeple-houſe in the morning, and what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings he had in himſelf about it; for he thought, if he had gone with me to the ſteeple-houſe, the officers would have put me to him; and then he ſhould not have known what to have done: but he was glad, he ſaid, when captain Purſloe came up to go with me; yet neither of them was dreſſed, nor had their bands about their necks. It was a ſtrange thing then to ſee a man come into a ſteeple-houſe without a band; yet captain Purſloe went in with me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his band, the Lord's power and truth had ſo affected him that he minded it not.</p>
                  <p>From hence I paſſed on, and came at night to an inn where was a company of rude people. I bid the woman of the houſe, if ſhe had any meat, to bring me ſome; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid Thee and Thou to her, ſhe looked ſtrangely on me. I aſked her if ſhe had any milk? She ſaid, No. I was ſenſible ſhe ſpake falſely; and, being willing to try her fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I aſked her, If ſhe had any cream? She denied that ſhe had any. There ſtood a churn in the room, and a little boy playing about, put his hands into it, and pulled it down, and threw all the cream on the floor before my eyes. Thus was the woman manifeſted to be a liar. She was amazed, bleſſed herſelf, took up the child, and whipped it ſorely: but I reproved her for her lying and deceit. After the Lord had thus diſcovered her deceit and perverſeneſs, I walked out of the houſe, and went away till I came to a ſtack of hay, and lay in the hay-ſtack that night, in rain and ſnow; it being but three days before the time called Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as.</p>
                  <p>The next day I came into York, where were ſeveral very tender people. Upon the firſt-day following. I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Lord to go and ſpeak to prieſt Bowles and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037441_0146_100D8E8941FF9CA8"/>his hearers in their great cathedral. Accordingly I went: When the prieſt had done, I told them I had ſomething from the Lord God to ſpeak to the prieſt and people. <q>Then ſay on quickly.</q> ſaid a profeſſor, for it was froſt and ſnow, and very cold weather. Then I told them, This was the word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in words, but God Almighty looked for fruits amongſt them. As ſoon as the words were out of my mouth, they hurried me out, and threw me down the ſteps. But I got up again without hurt, and went to my lodging, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were convinced there. For what aroſe from the weight and oppreſſion that was upon the Spirit of God in me, would open people, ſtrike them, and make them conſeſs that the groans which brake forth through me did reach them; for my life was burthened with their profeſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſſeſſion, and words without fruit.</p>
                  <p>After I had done my preſent ſervice in York, and ſeveral were convinced there, received the truth of God, and were turned to his teaching; I looked towards Cleaveland, and ſaw there was a people that had taſted of the power of God. I ſaw there was a ſeed in that country, and that God had an humble people there. Paſſing onwards that night, a papiſt overtook me, and talked to me of his religion, and of their meetings; and I let him ſpeak all that was in his mind. That night I ſtaid at an alehouſe. Next morning I was moved to ſpeak the word of the Lord to this papiſt. So I went to his houſe, and declared againſt all their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ways; and told him, that God was come to teach his people himſelf. This put him into ſuch a rage, that he could not endure to ſtay in his own houſe.</p>
                  <p>Next day I came to Burraby, where a prieſt and ſeveral friendly people were met together. Many of the people were convinced, and have continued faithful ever ſince. There is a great meeting of friends in that town. The prieſt alſo was forced to confeſs to truth, though he came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p>The day following I went to Cleaveland, amongſt thoſe people that had taſted of the power of God. They had formerly had great meetings, but were then ſhattered to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the heads of them turned Ranters. I told them, That after they had ſuch meetings, they did not wait upon God to ſeel his power to gather their minds inward, that they might ſeel his preſence and power amongſt them in their meetings, to ſit down therein and wait upon him: for
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037441_0147_100D8E8ADB815DD8"/>they had ſpoken themſelves dry; they had ſpent their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not living in that which they ſpake of, they were now become dry. They had ſome kind of meetings ſtill; but they took tobacco, and drank ale in their meetings, and were grown light and looſe. But my meſſage unto them from the Lord was, That they ſhould all come together again, and wait to ſeel the Lord's power and Spirit in themſelves; to gather them to Chriſt, that they might be taught of him, who ſays, "Learn of me." For when they had declared that which the Lord had opened to them, then the people were to receive it; and both the ſpeakers and the hearers were to live in that themſelves. But when theſe had no more to declare, but went to ſeek forms without life, that made themſelves dry and barren, and the people alſo; and from thence came all their loſs: for the Lord renews his mercies and his ſtrength to them that wait upon him. The heads of them came to nothing: but moſt of the people were convinced, and received God's everlaſting truth, and continue a meeting to this day, ſitting under the teaching of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt their Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Upon the firſt day of the next week, the word of the Lord came to me to go to the ſteeple-houſe; which I did. When the prieſt had done, I ſpake the truth to him and the people, and directed them to their teacher within. Chriſt Jeſus, their free teacher who had bought them. The prieſt came to me, and I had a little diſcourſe with him; but he was ſoon ſtopped, and ſilent. Then, being clear of the place, I paſſed away, having had ſeveral meetings amongſt thoſe people.</p>
                  <p>Though the ſnow was very deep, I kept travelling; and came to a market-town, where I met with many profeſſors, with whom I had much reaſoning. I aſked them many queſtions, which they were not able to anſwer; ſaying, They never had ſuch deep queſtions put to them in their lives.</p>
                  <p>From them I went to Stath, where I met with many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and ſome Ranters. I had large meetings amongſt them, and a great convincement there was. Many received the truth: amongſt whom one was a man of an hundred years of age; another was a chief conſtable; a third was a prieſt, whoſe name was Philip Scafe. Him the Lord, by his free Spirit, did afterwards make a free miniſter of his free goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The prieſt of this town was a loſty one, who much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037441_0148_100D8E8D14637B80"/>the people for his tythes. If they went a fiſhing many leagues off, he would exact the tythe-money of what they made of their fiſh, though they catched them at a great diſtance, and carried them as far as Yarmouth to ſell. I was moved to go to the ſteeple-houſe there, to declare the truth, and lay open the prieſt. When I had ſpoken to him, and laid his oppreſſing of the people upon him, he fled away. The chief of the pariſh were very light and vain. After I had ſpoken the word of life to them, I turned away from them, becauſe they did not receive it; and left them. But the word of the Lord, which I had declared amongſt them, ſtuck with ſome, ſo that at night ſome of the heads of the pariſh came to me. Moſt of them were convinced and ſatisfied, and confeſſed to the truth. Thus the truth began to ſpread in that country, and great meetings we had; at which the prieſt began to rage, and the Ranters to be ſtirred; who ſent me word they would have a diſpute with me; both the oppreſſing prieſt and the leader of the Ranters. A day was fixed, and the Ranter came with his company. Another prieſt, a Scotchman, came; but not the oppreſſing prieſt of Stath. Philip Scafe was with me; and a great number of people met. When we were ſettled, T. Buſhel, the Ranter, told me. He had had a viſion of me, that I was ſitting in a great chair, and that he was to come and put off his hat, and bow down to the ground before me; which he did. I told him, It was his own fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; and ſaid, "Repent, thou beaſt." He ſaid it was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy in me to ſay ſo. I aſked him the ground of jealouſy, and how it came to be bred in man? And the nature of a beaſt, what made it, and how it was bred in man? For I ſaw him directly in that nature of the beaſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I queried how that nature came to be bred in him? I told him. He ſhould give me an account of things done in the body, before we came to diſcourſe of things done out of the body. So I ſtopt his mouth, and his fellow Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſilenced: for he was the head of them. Then I called for the oppreſſing prieſt; but only the Scotch prieſt came, whoſe mouth was ſoon ſtopt, with a very few words, he being out of the life of what he profeſſed. Then I had good opportunity with the people. I laid open the Ranters, ranking them with the old Ranters in Sodom. The prieſts I maniſelted to be of the ſame ſtamp with their fellow hirelings, the falſe prophets of old, and the prieſts that then bore rule over the people by their means, ſeeking their
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037441_0149_100D8E8EB179C580"/>gain from their quarter, divining for money, and teaching for filthy lucre. I brought all the prophets, Chriſt and the apoſtles, over the heads of the prieſts, ſhewing how the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles, had long ſince diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by their marks and fruits. I directed the people to the inward teacher, Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour; and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Chriſt in the hearts of his people, when all theſe mountains were laid low. The people were all quiet, and the gainſayers mouths were ſtopped; for though they broil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inwardly, the divine power ſo bound them down, that they could not break out.</p>
                  <p>After the meeting, this Scottiſh prieſt deſired me to walk with him atop of the cliffs. Whereupon I called a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law of his, who was in ſome meaſure convinced, and deſired him to go with me, telling him, I was willing to have ſomebody by to hear what we ſaid; leſt the prieſt, when I was gone, ſhould report any thing of me which I did not ſay. We went together, the prieſt aſking me many things concerning the light, and concerning the ſoul; all which I anſwered him fully. When he had done queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we parted; and he went his way; and meeting with Philip Scafe, he brake his cane againſt the ground in mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſaid, If ever he met with me again, he would have my life, or I ſhould have his; adding, that he would give his head, if I was not knocked down within a month. By this, friends ſuſpected his intent was, in deſiring me to walk with him alone, either to have thruſt me down from the cliff, or to have done me ſome other miſchief; and being fruſtrated, it made him rage. But I neither regarded his prophecies, nor his threats; for I feared God Almighty. After ſome years, this very Scotch prieſt and his wife came to be convinced of the truth; and about twelve years after I was at their houſe.</p>
                  <p>Another prieſt came to a meeting where I was; one in repute above all the prieſts in the country. As I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that the goſpel was the power of God, and how it brought life and immortality to light in men, and was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people from darkneſs to light; this high-flown prieſt ſaid, The goſpel was mortal. I told him, The true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſaid, The goſpel was the power of God; and would he make the power of God mortal? Upon that, the other prieſt Philip Scafe, that was convinced, and had felt the immortal power of God in himſelf, took him up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him; ſo a great diſpute aroſe between them: the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037441_0150_100D8E916FF93060"/>convinced prieſt holding that the goſpel was immortal, and the other holding it was mortal. But the Lord's power was too hard for this oppoſer, and ſtopped his mouth; and many were convinced, ſeeing the darkneſs of the oppoſing prieſt, and the light that was in the convinced prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Another prieſt ſent to have a diſpute with me, and friends went with me to the houſe where he was; but when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood we were come, he ſlipt out of the houſe, and hid himſelf under an hedge. The people went and found him, but could not get him to come to us. Then I went to a ſteeple-houſe hard by, where the prieſt and people were in a great rage: this prieſt had threatened friends what he would do: but when I came, he ſled: for the Lord's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came over him and them. Yea, the Lord's everlaſting power was over the world, and reached to the hearts of people, and made both prieſts and profeſſors tremble. It ſhook the earthly and airy ſpirit, in which they held their profeſſion of religion and worſhip; ſo that it was a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to them, when it was told them, "The man in leathern breeches is come." At the hearing thereof the prieſts in many places got out of the way; they were ſo ſtruck with the dread of the eternal power of God; and fear ſurpriſed the hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed to Whitby and Scarborough, where we had ſome ſervice for the Lord: large meetings are ſettled there ſince. From thence I paſſed over the Woulds to Malton, where we had great meetings, as we had alſo at the towns thereabouts. At one town a prieſt ſent me a challenge to diſpute with me; but when I came he would not come forth. I had a good opportunity with the people, and the Lord's power laid hold upon them. One, who had been a wild drunken man, was ſo reached, that he came to me as lowly as a lamb; though he and his companions had before ſent for drink to make the people rude, on purpoſe that they might abuſe us. When I found the prieſt would not come forth, I was moved to go to the ſteeple-houſe, and he was confounded; the Lord's power coming over all.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day following, came one of the higheſt indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent profeſſors, a woman, who had let in ſuch a prejudice againſt me, that ſhe ſaid, before the came, She could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have gone to ſee me hanged. But coming, the was convinced, and remains a friend.</p>
                  <p>I turned to Malton again, and very great meetings there
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037441_0151_100D8E93A26EED18"/>were; to which ſeveral more would have come, but durſt not for fear of their relations; for it was thought a ſtrange thing then to preach in houſes, and not go to the church, as they called it; I was therefore much deſired to go and ſpeak in the ſteeple-houſes. One of the prieſts wrote to me, and invited me to preach in his ſteeple-houſe, calling me his brother: another prieſt, a noted man, kept a lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there. The Lord ſhewed me, while I was in Derby priſon, that I ſhould ſpeak in ſteeple-houſes, to gather peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from thence; and a concern ſometimes came upon my mind about the pulpits that the prieſts lolled in. For the ſteeple-houſes and pulpits were offenſive to my mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both prieſts and people called them the houſe of God, and idolized them; reckoning that God dwelt in the outward houſe. Whereas they ſhould have looked for God and Chriſt to dwell in their hearts, and their bodies to be made the temples of God; for the apoſtle ſaid, <q>God dwelleth not in temples made with hands:</q> but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the people's idolizing thoſe places, it was counted an heinous thing to declare againſt them. When I came into the ſteeple-houſe, there were not above eleven hearers, and the prieſt was preaching to them. But after it was known in the town that I was there, it was ſoon filled with people. When the prieſt had done, he ſent the other prieſt who had invited me thither, to bring me into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; but I ſent him word, that I needed not go into the pulpit. He ſent to me again, deſiring me to go up into it; for, he ſaid, it was a better place, and there I might be ſeen of the people. I ſent him word again, I could be ſeen and heard well enough where I was; and that I came not there to hold up ſuch places, nor their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and trade. Upon this they began to be angry, and ſaid, <q>Theſe falſe prophets were to come in the laſt times.</q> Their ſaying ſo grieved many of the people, and ſome began to murmur at it. Whereupon I deſired all to be quiet; and, ſtepping upon an high ſeat, declared to them the marks of the falſe prophets, ſhewing that they were already come; and ſet the true prophets, Chriſt, and his apoſtles over them; and manifeſted theſe to be out of the ſteps of the true prophets, of Chriſt and his apoſtles. I directed the people to their inward teacher, Chriſt Jeſus, who would turn them from darkneſs to light. And having opened divers ſcriptures to them, I directed them to the Spirit of God in themſelves, by which they might come to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037441_0152_100D8E95F34CD000"/>him, and by which they might alſo come to know who the falſe prophets were. So having had a large opportunity among them, I departed in peace.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time, I came to Pickering, where in the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſe the juſtices held their ſeſſions, juſtice Robinſon being chairman. I had a meeting in the ſchool-houſe at the ſame time; and abundance of prieſts and profeſſors came to it, aſking queſtions, which were anſwered to their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. It being ſeſſions-time, four chief conſtables and many other people were convinced that day; and word was carried to juſtice. Robinſon that his prieſt was overthrown and convinced; whom he had a love to, more than to all the prieſts beſides. After the meeting, we went to an inn, Juſtice Robinſon's prieſt was very lowly and loving, and would have paid for my dinner; but I would by no means ſuffer it. Then he offered me his ſteeple-houſe to preach in; but I refuſed it, and told him and the people, that I came to bring them off from ſuch things to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The next morning I went with the four chief conſtables and ſome others, to viſit juſtice Robinſon, who met me at his chamber-door. I told him, I could not honour him with man's honour. He ſaid he did not look for it. So I went into his chamber, and opened to him the ſtate of the falſe prophets, and of the true prophets; and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the true prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles, over the other; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his mind to Chriſt his teacher. I opened to him the parables, and how election and reprobation ſtood; as that reprobation ſtood in the firſt birth, and election in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth. I ſhewed alſo what the promiſe of God was to, and what the judgment of God was againſt. He confeſſed to it all, and was ſo opened with the truth, that when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other juſtice made ſome little oppoſition, he informed him. At our parting, he ſaid, It was very well that I did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that gift which God had given me. He took the chief conſtables aſide, and would have given them ſome money for me, ſaying. He would not have me be at any charge in their country; but they told him, they themſelves could not get me to take any money; and ſo accepting his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I refuſed his money.</p>
                  <p>From thence I paſſed into the country, and the prieſt that called me brother (in whoſe ſchool-houſe I had the meeting at Pickering) went along with me. When we came into a town to bait, the bells rang. I aſked what they rang for? They ſaid, For me to preach in the ſteeple-houſe.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037441_0153_100D8E98654E8D68"/>After ſome time I felt drawings that way: and as I walked to the ſteeple-houſe, I ſaw the people gathered together in the yard. The old prieſt would have had me gone into the ſteeple-houſe. I ſaid, It was no matter. But it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange to the people, that I would not go into that which they called the houſe of God. I ſtood up in the ſteeple-houſe yard, and declared to the people, That I came not to hold up their idol-temples, nor their prieſts, nor their tythes, nor their augmentations, nor their prieſts-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor their Jewiſh and heatheniſh ceremonies and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (for I denied all theſe) and told them, that piece of ground was no more holy than another piece of ground. I ſhewed them, that the apoſtles going into the Jews ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and temples, which God had commanded, was to bring people off from that temple, and thoſe ſynagogues, and from the offerings, tythes, and covetous prieſts of that time; that ſuch as came to be convinced of the truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to it, and believed in Jeſus Chriſt, whom the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles preached, met together in dwelling-houſes; and that all who preach Chriſt, the Word of life, ought to preach freely, as the apoſtles did, and as he commanded. So I was ſent of the Lord God of heaven and earth to preach freely, and to bring people off from theſe outward temples made with hands, which God dwelleth not in; that they might know their bodies to become the temples of God and of Chriſt; and to draw people off from all their ſuperſtitious ceremonies, Jewiſh and heatheniſh cuſtoms, traditions, and doctrines of men; and from all the world's hireling teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that take tythes and great wages, preaching for hire, and divining for money, whom God and Chriſt never ſent, as themſelves confeſs, when they ſay, They never heard God's nor Chriſt's voice. I exhorted the people to come off from all theſe things, directing them to the Spirit and grace of God in themſelves, and to the light of Jeſus in their own hearts; that they might come to know Chriſt, their free teacher, to bring them ſalvation, and to open the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them. Thus the Lord gave me a good opportunity to open things largely unto them. All was quiet, and many were convinced: bleſſed be the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed to another town, where was another great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the old prieſt being with me; and there came profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of ſeveral ſorts to it. I ſate on a hay-ſtack, and ſpoke nothing for ſome hours; for I was to famiſh them from words. The profeſſors would ever and anon be ſpeaking to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037441_0154_100D8E9A74284B80"/>the old prieſt, and aſking him when I would begin, and when I would ſpeak? He bade them wait; and told them, that the people waited upon Chriſt a long while before he ſpoke. At laſt I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak; and they were ſtruck by the Lord's power. The word of life reached to them, and there was a general convincement amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>From hence I paſſed on, the old prieſt being ſtill with me, and ſeveral others. As we went along, ſome people called to him and ſaid, <q>Mr. Boyes, we owe you ſome money for tythes, pray come and take it.</q> But he threw up his hands, and ſaid, <q>He had enough, he would have none of it; they might keep it:</q> and, <q>he praiſed the Lord he had enough.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At length we came to his ſteeple-houſe in the Moors, and he went before me, and held open the pulpit door; but I told him I would not go into it. This ſteeple-houſe was very much painted. I told him and the people, the painted beaſt had a painted houſe. I opened to them the riſe of thoſe houſes; and their ſuperſtitious ways; ſhewing them, that as the end of the apoſtles going into the temple and ſynagogues, which God had commanded, was not to hold them up, but to bring them to Chriſt the ſubſtance; ſo the end of my coming there was not to hold up theſe temples, prieſts, and tythes, which God had never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but to bring them from all theſe things to Chriſt the ſubſtance. I ſhewed them the true worſhip which Chriſt had ſet up, and diſtinguiſhed Chriſt the true way from all the falſe ways, opening the parables to them, and turning them from darkneſs to the true light, that by it they might ſee themſelves, their ſins, and Chriſt their Saviour; that believing in him they might be ſaved from their ſins.</p>
                  <p>After this we went to one Birdet's, where I had a great meeting; and this old prieſt accompanied me ſtill, leaving his ſteeple-houſe. He had been looked upon as a famous prieſt, above common-prayermen, preſbyters, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents too. Before he was convinced he went ſometimes into their ſteeple-houſes, and preached; for he had been a zealous man in his way: and when they complained of him to juſtice Hotham, he bid them diſtrain his horſe for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Lord's day, as he called it; but Hotham did that to put them off, for he knew the prieſt uſed no horſe, but travelled on foot.</p>
                  <p>Now I came towards Crantſick to captain Purſloe's and
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037441_0155_100D8E9C8EA06E38"/>juſtice Hotham's, who received me kindly, being glad the Lord's power had ſo appeared, that truth was ſpread and ſo many had received it, and that juſtice Robinſon was ſo civil. Juſtice Hotham ſaid, If God had not raiſed up this principle of light and life, which I preached, the nation had been over-run with Ranteriſm, and all the juſtices in the nation could not have ſtopped it with all their laws; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid he, they would have ſaid as we ſaid, and done as we commanded, and yet have kept their own principle ſtill. But this principle of truth overthrows their principle in the root and ground thereof; therefore he was glad the Lord had raiſed up this principle of life and truth.</p>
                  <p>From thence I travelled into Holderneſs, and came to a juſtice's houſe, whoſe name was Pearſon, where was a very tender woman, that believed in the truth, and was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, that ſhe ſaid, <q>She could have left all and have followed me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thence I went to Oram, to George Hartiſe's; where many of that town were convinced. On the firſt-day I was moved to go into the ſteeple-houſe, where the prieſt had got another to help him: and many profeſſors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders were got together. But the Lord's power was over all; the prieſts fled away, and a great deal of good ſervice I had for the Lord amongſt the people. Some of thoſe great profeſſors were convinced, and became honeſt faithful friends; being men of account in that place.</p>
                  <p>The next day, friends and friendly people having left me, I travelled alone, declaring the day of the Lord amongſt people in the towns where I came, and warning them to repent. I came towards night into a town called Patring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. As I walked along the town, I warned both prieſts and people (for the prieſt was in the ſtreet) to repent and turn to the Lord. It grew dark before I came to the end of the town, and a multitude of people gathered about me, to whom I declared the word of life.</p>
                  <p>When I had cleared myſelf I went to an inn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to let me have a lodging; but they would not. I deſired a little meat or milk, and I would pay for it; but they refuſed. So I walked out of the town, and a company of fellows followed, and aſked me, What news? I bid them repent, and fear the Lord. After I was gone a pretty way, I came to another houſe, and deſired the people to let me have a little meat, drink, and lodging for my money; but they denied me. I went to another houſe, and deſired the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037441_0156_100D8E9EC14706C0"/>ſame; but they refuſed me alſo. By this time it was grown ſo dark that I could not ſee the highway; but I diſcerned a ditch, and got a little water and refreſhed myſelf. Then I got over the ditch; and, being weary with travelling, I ſate down amongſt the furze buſhes till it was day. About break of day I got up, and paſſed on the fields. A man came after me with a great pikeſtaff, and went along with me to a town; and he raiſed the town upon me, with the conſtable and chief conſtable, before the ſun was up. I declared God's everlaſting truth amongſt them, warning them of the day of the Lord, that was coming upon all ſin and wickedneſs; and exhorted them to repent. But they ſeized me, and had me back to Patrington, about three miles, guarding me with watch-bills, pikes, ſtaves, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds. When I was come to Patrington, all the town was in an uproar, and the prieſt and conſtables were conſulting together; ſo I had another opportunity to declare the word of life amongſt them, and warn them to repent. At laſt a profeſſor, a tender man, called me into his houſe, and there I took a little milk and bread, having not eaten for ſome days before. Then they guarded me about nine miles to a juſtice. When I was come near his houſe, a man came riding after us, and aſked me, whether I was the man that was apprehended? I aſked him, wherefore he aſked? He ſaid, for no hurt. I told him, I was: ſo he rode away to the juſtice before us. The men that guarded me ſaid, It was well if the juſtice was not drunk before we got to him; for he uſed to get drunk early. When I was brought in before him, becauſe I did not put off my hat, and ſaid Thou to him, he aſked the man that rode thither before me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was not mazed or fond? The man told him, no; it was my principle. I warned him to repent, and come to the light, which Chriſt had enlightened him withal; that by it he might ſee all his evil words and actions, and turn to Chriſt Jeſus whilſt he had time; and that whilſt he had time he ſhould prize it. Ay, ay, ſaid he, the light that is ſpoken of in the third of John. I deſired he would mind it, and obey it. As I admoniſhed him, I laid my hand upon him, and he was brought down by the power of the Lord; and all the watchmen ſtood amazed. Then he took me into a little parlour with the other man, and deſired to ſee what I had in my pockets of letters or intelligence. I plucked out my linen, and ſhewed him I had no letters. He ſaid, he is not a vagrant by his linen: then he ſet me at
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037441_0157_100D8EA0EC481328"/>liberty. I went back to Patrington with the man that had rode before me to the juſtice: for he lived at Patrington. When I came there, he would have had me had a meeting at the Croſs; but I ſaid, it was no matter, his houſe would ſerve. He deſired me to go to bed, or lie down upon a bed; which he did, that they might ſay they had ſeen me in or upon a bed, for they had got a report that I would not lie on any bed, becauſe I laid many times without doors. When firſt-day was come I went to the ſteeple-houſe, and declared the truth to the prieſt and people; and the people did not moleſt me, for the power of God was come over them. Preſently after I had a great meeting at the man's houſe where I lay, and many were convinced of the Lord's everlaſting truth, who ſtand faithful witneſſes of it to this day; and they were exceedingly grieved that they did not receive me, nor give me lodging, when I was there before.</p>
                  <p>From hence I travelled through the country to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part thereof, warning people in towns and villages to repent, and directing them to Chriſt Jeſus, their teacher.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day I came to colonel Overton's, and had a great meeting of the prime of the people of that country, where many things were opened out of the ſcriptures, which they had never heard before. Many were convinced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word of life, and were ſettled in the truth of God.</p>
                  <p>I returned to Patrington again, and viſited thoſe friends that were convinced there; by whom I underſtood, that taylor and ſome wild blades in that town had occaſioned my being carried before the juſtice. The taylor came to aſk me forgiveneſs, fearing I would complain of him. The conſtables alſo were afraid, leſt I ſhould trouble them. But I forgave them all, and warned them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their lives. That which made them the more afraid was this: when I was in the ſteeple-houſe at Oram not long before, a profeſſor gave me a puſh on the breaſt in the ſteeple-houſe, and bid me get out of the church. Alas! poor man! ſaid I, doſt thou call the ſteeple-houſe the church? The church is the people whom God hath purchaſed with his blood, and not the houſe. It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that juſtice Hotham came to hear of this man's abuſe, ſent his warrant for him, and bound him over to the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſo affected was he with the truth, and ſo zealous to keep the peace: and indeed this juſtice had aſked me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037441_0158_100D8EA3C9210170"/>whether any had meddled with me or abuſed me? But I was not to tell him any thing of that kind; but was to forgive all.</p>
                  <p>From Patrington I went to ſeveral great men's houſes, warning them to repent. Some received me lovingly, and ſome ſlighted me. At night I came to another town, where I deſired lodging and meat, and I would pay for it; but they would not lodge me, except I would go to the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was the cuſtom (they ſaid) of all lodgers at inns, if ſtrangers. I told them, I would not go; for that cuſtom was for ſuſpicious perſons, I was an innocent man. After I had warned them to repent, declared to them the day of their viſitation, and directed them to the light of Chriſt and the ſpirit of God, that they might come to know ſalvation, I paſſed away; and the people were ſomewhat tendered and troubled afterwards. When it grew dark, I ſpied a hay-ſtack, and went and ſate under it till morning.</p>
                  <p>The next day I paſſed into Hull, admoniſhing and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, as I went, to turn to Chriſt Jeſus, that they might receive ſalvation. That night I got a lodging; but was very ſore with travelling on foot ſo far.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards I came to Balby, viſited friends up and down in thoſe parts, and then paſſed into the edge of Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, viſiting friends there: and ſo into Lincolnſhire, and viſited friends there. On firſt-day I went to a ſteeple-houſe on this ſide of Trent, and in the afternoon to another on the other ſide of Trent, declaring the word of life to the people, and directing them to their teacher Chriſt Jeſus, who died for them, that they might hear him and receive ſalvation by him. Then I went further into the country, and had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meetings. To one meeting came a great man, a prieſt, and many profeſſors; but the Lord's power came over them all, and they went their way peaceably. There came a man to that meeting, who had been at one before, and raiſed a falſe accuſation againſt me, and made a noiſe up and down the country, reporting, that I ſaid I was Chriſt; which was utterly falſe. When I came to Gainſborough, where a friend had been declaring truth in the market, the town and market-people were all in an uproar. I went into a friendly man's houſe, and the people ruſhed in after me; ſo that the houſe was filled with profeſſors, diſputers, and rude people. This falſe accuſer came in, and charged me openly before the people, <q>That I ſaid I was Chriſt, and he had got witneſſes to prove it.</q> Which put the people into ſuch a rage, that they had much to do
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037441_0159_100D8EA55D4535B8"/>to keep their hands off me. I was moved of the Lord to ſtand up upon the table, in the eternal power of God, and tell the people, <q>That Chriſt was in them, except they were reprobates; and that it was Chriſt, the eternal power of God, that ſpoke in me at that time unto them; NOT that I was CHRIST.</q> And the people were greatly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, except himſelf, a profeſſor, and his own falſe witneſſes. I called the accuſer Judas, and was moved to tell him that Judas's end ſhould be his; that was the word of the Lord and of Chriſt through me to him. The Lord's power came over all, and quieted the minds of the people, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in peace. But this Judas ſhortly after hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a ſtake was driven into his grave. Afterwards the wicked prieſts raiſed a ſcandal upon us, and reported that a Quaker had hanged himſelf in Lincolnſhire, and had a ſtake driven through him. This falſehood they printed to the nation, adding ſin to ſin; which the truth and we were clear of: for he was no more a Quaker than the prieſt that printed it, but one of their own people. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this wicked ſlander by which the adverſary deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defame us, and turn people's minds againſt the truth we held forth, many in Lincolnſhire received the goſpel, being convinced of the Lord's everlaſting truth, and ſate down therein under his heavenly teaching.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed in the Lord's power into Yorkſhire, came to Warnſworth, and went to the ſteeple-houſe in the forenoon; but they ſhut the door againſt me: yet after awhile they let in Thomas Aldam, and then ſhut it again; and the prieſt fell upon him, aſking him queſtions. At laſt they opened the door, and I went in. As ſoon as I was come in the prieſt's ſight he left preaching, though I ſaid nothing to him; and aſked me, "What have you to ſay?" and preſently cried out. <q>Come, come, I will prove them falſe prophets in Matthew.</q> But he was ſo confounded, he could not ſind the chapter. Then he ſell on me, aſking me many queſtions; and I ſtood ſtill all this while, not ſaying any thing amongſt them. At laſt I ſaid, <q>Seeing here are ſo many queſtions aſked, I may anſwer them.</q> But as ſoon as I began to ſpeak, the people violently ruſhed upon me, thruſt me out of the ſteeple-houſe again, and locked the door againſt me. As ſoon as they had done their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and were come forth, the people ran upon me, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſorely with their ſtaves, threw clods and ſtones at me, and abuſed me much: the prieſt alſo, being in a great rage,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037441_0160_100D8EA7695FC430"/>laid violent hands on me himſelf. I warned them and him of the terrible day of the Lord, and exhorted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn to Chriſt. Being filled with the Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing power, I was not ſenſible of much hurt I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their blows. In the afternoon I went to another ſteeple-houſe, but the prieſt had done before I got thither: ſo I preached repentance to the people that were left, and directed them to their inward teacher, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>From hence I went to Balby, and Doucaſter, where I had formerly preached repentance on the market-day; which had made a noiſe and alarm in the country. On firſt-day I went to the ſteeple-houſe, and after the prieſt had done, I ſpoke to him and the people what the Lord commanded me: and they were in a great rage, hurried me out, threw me down, and haled me before the magiſtrates. A long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination they made of me, and much work I had with them. They threatened my life, if ever I came there again; and that they would leave me to the mercy of the people. Nevertheleſs I declared truth amongſt them, and directed them to the light of Chriſt in them; teſtifying unto them, <q>That God was come to teach his people himſelf, whether they would hear or forbear.</q> After awhile they put us out (for ſome friends were with me) among the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and they ſtoned us down the ſtreets. An innkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a bailiff, came and took us into his houſe; and they broke his head, ſo that the blood ran down his face, with the ſtones that they threw at us. We ſtaid awhile in his houſe, and ſhewed the more ſober people the prieſt's fruits. Then we went away to Balby about a mile off. The rude people laid wait for us, and ſtoned us down the lane; but, bleſſed be the Lord, we did not receive much hurt.</p>
                  <p>The next firſt-day I went to Tickhill, whither the friends of that ſide gathered together, and a mighty brokenneſs by the power of God there was amongſt the people. I went out of the meeting, being moved of God to go to the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſe. When I came there, I found the prieſt and moſt of the chief of the pariſh together in the chancel. I went up to them, and began to ſpeak; but they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell upon me; the clerk up with his bible, as I was ſpeaking, and <q>ſtruck me on the face with it, ſo that my face guſhed out with blood; and I bled exceedingly in the ſteeple-houſe.</q> The people cried, <q>Let us have him out of the church.</q> When they had got me out, they beat me exceedingly, threw me down, and turned me
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037441_0161_100D8EA9B4AF7CE0"/>over a hedge. They afterwards dragged me through a houſe into the ſtreet, ſtoning and beating me as they dragged me along; ſo that I was all over beſmeared with blood and dirt. They got my hat from me, which I never had again. Yet when I was got upon my legs, I declared the word of life, ſhewed them the fruits of their teacher, and how they diſhonoured chriſtianity. After awhile I got into the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again amongſt friends, and the prieſt and people coming by the houſe, I went with friends into the yard, and there ſpoke to the prieſt and people. The prieſt ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at us, and called us Quakers. But the Lord's power was ſo over them, and the word of life was declared in ſuch authority and dread to them, that the prieſt fell a trembling himſelf; and one of the people ſaid, <q>Look how the prieſt trembles and ſhakes, he is turned a Quaker alſo.</q> When the meeting was over, friends departed; and I went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my hat to Balby about ſeven or eight miles. Friends were much abuſed that day by the prieſt and his people: inſomuch that ſome moderate juſtices hearing of it, two or three of them came and ſate at the town to examine the buſineſs. He that had ſhed my blood was afraid of having his hand cut off, for ſtriking me in the church, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it; but I forgave him, and would not appear againſt him.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this year 1652, great rage got up in prieſts and people, and in ſome of the magiſtrates, in the weſt riding of Yorkſhire, againſt the truth and friends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the prieſt of Warnſworth procured a warrant from the juſtices againſt me and Thomas Aldam, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in any part of the weſt riding of Yorkſhire. At the ſame time I had a viſion of a bear and two great maſtiff dogs; that I ſhould paſs by them, and they ſhould do me no hurt: and it proved ſo. For the conſtable took Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aldam, and carried him to York. I went with Thomas twenty miles towards York, and the conſtable had a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for me alſo, and ſaid, <q>He ſaw me, but he was loth to trouble ſtrangers;</q> but Thomas Aldam was his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. So the Lord's power reſtrained him, that he had not power to meddle with me. We went to lieutenant Roper's, where we had a great meeting of many conſiderable men. The truth was powerfully declared amongſt them, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wonderfully opened, the parables and ſayings of Chriſt expounded, the ſtate of the church in the apoſtles days plainly ſet forth, and the apoſtacy ſince from that ſtate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:037441_0162_100D8EAC45B4E060"/>The truth had great dominion that day: ſo that thoſe great men preſent did generally confeſs to it, ſaying, <q>They believed this principle muſt go over the whole world.</q> There were at this meeting James Nayler, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Goodyear, and William Dewſbury, who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the year before, and Richard Farnſworth alſo. The conſtable ſtaid with Thomas Aldam till the meeting was over, and then went towards York priſon; but did not meddle with me.</p>
                  <p>From hence I went to Wakefield, and the firſt-day after to a ſteeple-houſe, where James Nayler had been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an independent church; but, upon his receiving truth, he was excommunicated. When I came in, and the prieſt had done, the people called me to come to the prieſt; which I did: but when I began to declare the word of life to them, and to lay open the deceit of the prieſt, they ruſhed upon me on a ſudden, thruſt me out at the other door, punching and beating me, and cried <q>Let us have him to the ſtocks.</q> But the Lord's power was over them, and ſo reſtrained them, that they were not able to put me in. So I paſſed away to the meeting, where were a great many profeſſors and friendly people gathered, and a great convincement there was; for the people were mightily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that they were directed to the Lord's teaching in themſelves. Here we got lodging; for four of us had lain abroad under a hedge the night before, there being then few friends in that place.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day Richard Farnſworth went to another great ſteeple-houſe belonging to a high prieſt, and declared the word of truth unto the people; and great ſervice he had amongſt them: for the Lord's dread and power was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over all.</p>
                  <p>The prieſt of that church, which James Nayler had been a member of, whoſe name was Marſhal, raiſed many wicked ſlanders upon me, <q>That I carried bottles about with me, and made people drink of my bottles, which made them follow me.</q> And, <q>That I rid upon a great black horſe, and was ſeen in one country upon my black horſe in one hour, and in the ſame hour in another country threeſcore miles off;</q> and <q>That I ſhould give a fellow money to follow me when I was on my black horſe.</q> With theſe helliſh lies he fed his people, to make them think evil of the truth which I had declared amongſt them. But by theſe lies he preached many of his hearers away
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037441_0163_100D8EADDA1C7A90"/>from him; for I travelled on foot, and had no horſe at that time; and that the people generally knew. The Lord ſoon after met with this envious prieſt, and cut him off in his wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>After this I came to High-Town, where dwelt a woman who had been convinced a little before. We went to her houſe, and had a meeting. The town's people gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; we declared the truth to them, had ſome ſervice for the Lord amongſt them; and they paſſed away again peaceably. But there was a widow woman in the town, whoſe name was Green, who, being filled with envy, went to one called a gentleman in the town, who was reported to have killed two men and one woman, and informed him againſt us, though he was no officer. The next morning we drew up ſome queries, to be ſent to the prieſt. When we had done, and were juſt going away, ſome of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people of the town came running, and told us, That this murdering man had ſharpened a pike to ſtab us, and was coming with his ſword by his ſide. Being juſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away, we miſſed him. But he came to the houſe where we had been; and the people generally concluded, if we had not been gone, he would have murdered ſome of us. That night we lay in a wood, and were very wet, for it rained exceedingly. In the morning I was moved to return to that town, when we had a full relation of this wicked man.</p>
                  <p>From hence we paſſed to an houſe at Bradford, where we met with Richard Farnſworth, from whom we had parted a little before. When we came in they ſet meat before us; but as I was going to eat, the word of the Lord came to me, ſaying, <q>Eat not the bread of ſuch as have an evil eye.</q> Immediately I aroſe from the table, and ate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. After I had exhorted the family to turn to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and hearken to his teachings in their own hearts, we departed thence.</p>
                  <p>As we travelled through the country, preaching repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the people, we came into a market-town, where a lecture was held that day. I went into the ſteeple-houſe, where many prieſts, profeſſors and people were. The prieſt that preached, took for his text thoſe words of Jeremiah, chap. 5. ver. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. "My people love to have it ſo;" leaving out the foregoing words, viz. <q>The prophets propheſy falſely, and the prieſts bear rule by their means.</q> I ſhewed the people his deceit; and directed them to Chriſt,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037441_0164_100D8EB0378A3F18"/>the true teacher within; declaring, that God was come to teach his people himſelf, and to bring them off from all the world's teachers and hirelings; that they might come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive freely from him. Then warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all fleſh, I paſſed from thence without much oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>At night we came to a country place, where there was no publick houſe near. The people deſired us to ſtay all night; which we did, and had good ſervice for the Lord, declaring his truth amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>The Lord had ſaid unto me, <q>If but one man or woman were raiſed by his power, to ſtand and live in the ſame Spirit that the prophets and apoſtles were in who gave forth the ſcriptures, that man or woman ſhould ſhake all the country in their profeſſion for ten miles round.</q> For people had the ſcriptures, but were not in the ſame light, power, and Spirit, which thoſe were in who gave forth the ſcriptures; ſo they neither knew God, Chriſt, nor the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aright; nor had they unity one with another, being out of the power and Spirit of God. Therefore we warned all, where-ever we met them, of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</p>
                  <p>As we travelled, we came near a very great high hill, called Pendlehill, and I was moved of the Lord to go up to the top of it; which I did with much ado, it was ſo very ſteep and high. When I was come to the top, I ſaw the ſea bordering upon Lancaſhire. From the top of this hill the Lord let me ſee in what places he had a great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be gathered. As I went down, I found a ſpring of water in the ſide of the hill, with which I refreſhed myſelf; having eaten or drunk but little ſeveral days before.</p>
                  <p>At night we came to an inn, and declared truth to the man of the houſe, and wrote a paper to the prieſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, declaring <q>the day of the Lord, and that Chriſt was come to teach people himſelf, by his power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their hearts, and to bring people off from all the world's ways and teachers, to his own free teaching who had bought them, and was the Saviour of all them that believed in him.</q> The man of the houſe ſpread the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per abroad, and was himſelf mightily affected with the truth. Here the Lord opened unto me, and let me ſee a great people in white raiment by a river-ſide, coming to the Lord. The place that I ſaw them in was about Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerdale and Sedbergh.</p>
                  <p>

The next day we travelled on, and at night got a little fern to put under us, and lay upon a common. Next morning we reached a town, where Richard Farnſworth parted from me; and then I travelled alone again. I came up Wentzerdale, and at the market-town in that dale there was a lecture on the market-day. I went into the ſteeple-houſe; and after the prieſt had done, <q>proclaimed the day of the Lord to the prieſt and people; warning them to turn from the darkneſs to the light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might come to know God and Chriſt aright, and to receive his teaching, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth freely.</q> Largely and freely did I declare the word of life unto them, and had not much perſecution there. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I paſſed up the dales, warning people to fear God; and preaching the everlaſting goſpel. In my way I came to a great houſe, where was a ſchoolmaſter; and they got me into the houſe. I aſked them queſtions about then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and worſhip; and afterwards declared the truth to them. They had me into a parlour, and locked me in, pretending I was mad, and had got away from my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and they would keep me till they could ſend to them. But I ſoon convinced them of their miſtake; and they let me forth, and would have had me to ſtay, but I was not to ſtay there. Having exhorted them to repentance, and directed them to the light of Chriſt Jeſus, that thro' it they might come unto him, and be ſaved, I paſſed from them, and came in the night to a little alehouſe on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, where a company of rude fellows were drinking. Becauſe I would not drink with them, they ſtruck me with their clubs. But I reproved them, and brought them to be ſomewhat cooler; and then walked out of the houſe upon the common in the night. After ſome time one of theſe drunken fellows came out, and would have come cloſe up to me, pretending to whiſper to me; but perceiving he had a knife, I kept off him, and bid him repent, and fear God. So the Lord by his power preſerved me from this wicked man; and he went into the houſe again. Next morning I went through other dales, warning and exhorting people every where, as I paſſed, to repent and turn to the Lord; and ſeveral were convinced. At one houſe, the man of the houſe whom I afterwards ſound to be a kinſman of John Blakelin's, would have given me money, but I would not receive it.</p>
                  <p>As I travelled through the dales, I came to another
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037441_0166_100D7F458D51D5F8"/>man's houſe, whoſe name was Tennant. I was moved to ſpeak to the family, and declare God's everlaſting truth to them; and as I was turning away from them, I was moved to turn again, and ſpeak to the man himſelf; who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, with his family, and lived and died in the truth. Thence I came to major Bousfield's, who received me, as did ſeveral others. Some that were then convinced have ſtool faithful ever ſince. I went alſo through Gryſedale, and ſeveral other of thoſe dales; in which ſome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. In Dent many were convinced alſo. From major Bousfield's I came to Richard Robinſon's and declared the everlaſting truth to him.</p>
                  <p>The next day I went to a meeting at juſtice Benſon's, where met a people that were ſeparated from the publick worſhip. This was the place that I had ſeen, where a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came forth in white raiment. A large meeting it was; the people were generally convinced, and continue a large meeting ſtill of friends near Sedbergh; which was then firſt gathered through my miniſtry in the name of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The ſame week there was a great fair, at which ſervants uſed to be hired. I went and declared the day of the Lord through the fair. After I had done ſo, I went into the ſteeple-houſe yard; and many of the people of the fair came to me, with abundance of prieſts and profeſſors. <q>There I declared the everlaſting truth of the Lord, and the word of life for ſeveral hours; ſhewing, that the Lord was come to teach his people himſelf, and to bring them off from all the world's ways and teachers to Chriſt the true teacher, and the true way to God. I laid open their teachers, ſhewing, that they were like thoſe that were of old condemned by the prophets, by Chriſt, and by the apoſtles. I exhorted the people to come off from the temples made with hands; and wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they might know themſelves to be the temples of God.</q> Not one of the prieſts had power to open his mouth againſt what I declared. At laſt a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaid, <q>Why will you not go into the Church? This is not a fit place to preach in.</q> I told him, I denied their church. Then ſtood up Francis Howgill, who was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a congregation. He had not ſeen me before; yet he undertook to anſwer that captain; and ſoon put him to ſilence. Then ſaid Francis Howgill of me, <q>This man ſpeaks with authority, and not as the ſcribes.</q> After this, I opened to the people, that that ground and houſe was no
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037441_0167_100D8EB6F59909F0"/>holier than another place; and that the houſe is not the church, but the people, whom Chriſt is the head of. After awhile the prieſts came up to me, and I warned them to repent. One of them ſaid, I was mad; ſo they turned away. But many were convinced there that day, who were glad to hear the truth declared, and received it with joy. Amongſt theſe was captain Ward, who received the truth in the love of it, and lived and died in it.</p>
                  <p>The next firſt-day I came to Firbank Chapel in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, where Francis Howgill and John Audland had been preaching in the morning. The chapel was full of people, ſo that many could not get in. Francis ſaid, He thought I looked into the chapel, and his ſpirit was ready to ſail, the Lord': power did ſo ſurprize him: but I did not look in. They made haſte, and had quickly done, and they and ſome of the people went to dinner; but abundance ſtaid till they came again. John Blakelin and others came to me, and deſired me not to reprove them publickly; for they were not pariſh-teachers, but pretty tender men. I could nor tell them whether I ſhould or no, though I had not at that time any drawings to declare publickly againſt them; but I ſaid, They muſt leave me to the Lord's mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. While others were gone to dinner, I went to a brook, got a little water, and then came and ſat down on the top of a rock hard by the chapel. In the afternoon the people gathered about me, with ſeveral of their preachers. It was judged there were above a thouſand people; to whom I declared God's everlaſting truth and word of life freely and largely for about the ſpace of three hours; directing all to the Spirit of God in themſelves; that they might be turned from darkneſs to light, and believe in it, that they might become the children of it, and might be turned from the power of Satan unto God; and by the Spirit of truth might be led into all truth, and ſenſibly underſtand the words of the prophets, of Chriſt, and of the apoſtles; and might all come to know Chriſt to be their teacher to inſtruct them, their counſellor to direct them, their ſhepherd to ſeed them, their biſhop to overſee them, and their prophet to open di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine myſteries to them; and might know their bodies to be prepared, ſanctified, and made ſit temples for God and Chriſt to dwell in. In the openings of heavenly life. I explained unto them the prophets, and the figures and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and directed them to Chriſt, the ſubſtance. Then I opened the parables and ſayings of Chriſt, and things that
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:037441_0168_100D8EB8E5DDF458"/>had been long hid; ſhewing the intent and ſcope of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles writings and that their epiſtles were written to the elect. When I had opened that ſtate, I ſhewed alſo the ſtate of the apoſtacy ſince the apoſtles days; that the prieſts have got the ſcriptures, but are not in the Spirit which gave them forth; and have put them into chapter and verſe, to make a trade of the holy mens words; that the teachers and prieſts now are found in the ſteps of the falſe prophets, chief prieſts, ſcribes and phariſees of old, and are ſuch as the true prophets, Chriſt and his apoſtles cried againſt, and ſo are judged and condemned by the Spirit of the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, of Chriſt, and of his apoſtles; and that none in that Spirit could own them. Many old people went into the chapel, and looked out at the windows; thinking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſtrange thing to ſee a man preach on an hill or mountain, and not in their church, as they called it; whereupon I was moved to inform the people, <q>That the ſteeple-houſe, and the ground whereon it ſtood, were no more holy than that mountain; and that thoſe temples, which they called the dreadful houſes of God, were not ſet up by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God and of Chriſt; nor their prieſts called, as Aaron's prieſthood was; nor their tythes appointed by God, as thoſe amongſt the Jews were: but that Chriſt was come, who ended both the temple and its worſhip, and the prieſts and their tythes; and all now ſhould hearken to him: for he ſaid, "Learn of me:" and God ſaid of him, <q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</q> I declared that the Lord God had ſent me to preach the everlaſting goſpel and word of life amongſt them; and to bring them off from all theſe temples, tythes, prieſts, and rudiments of the world, which had got up ſince the apoſtles days, and had been ſet up by ſuch as had erred from the Spirit and power that the apoſtles were in.</q> Very largely was I opened at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Lord's convincing power accompanied my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and reached home to the hearts of the people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many were convinced, and all the teachers of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (who were many) were convinced of God's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth.</p>
                  <p>After the meeting, I went to John Audland's, and from thence to Preſton Patrick Chapel, where a great meeting was appointed; to which I went, and had a large opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to preach the everlaſting goſpel; acquainting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the end of my coming into that place was not to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037441_0169_100D8EBB51C68980"/>hold it up; no more than the apoſtles going into the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſynagogues and temple was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>From this place I went to Kendal, where a meeting was appointed in the town-hall, in which I declared the word of life amongſt the people, ſhewing them, <q>How they might come to the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, and to have a right underſtanding of the holy ſcriptures; opening to them what it was that would lead them into the way of reconciliation with God; and what would be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</q> After the meeting I ſtaid awhile in the town: ſeveral were convinced there, and many appeared loving. One Cork met me in the ſtreet, and would have given me a roll of tobacco. I accepted his love, but did not receive the tobacco.</p>
                  <p>From thence I went to Under-barrow, to Miles Bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's; and ſeveral going along with me, great reaſonings I had with them, eſpecially with Edward Burrough. At night the prieſt and many profeſſors came to the houſe; and a great deal of diſputing I had with them. Supper being provided for the prieſt and the reſt of the company. I had not freedom to eat with them; but told them, If they would appoint a meeting for the next day at the ſteeple-houſe, and acquaint the people with it, I might meet them. They had a great deal of reaſsoning about it; ſome being for, and ſome againſt it. In the morning, after I had ſpoken to them again concerning the meeting, as I walked upon a bank by the houſe, there came ſeveral poor travellers, aſking relief, who I ſaw were in neceſſity; and they gave them nothing, but ſaid they were cheats. It grieved me to ſee ſuch hard-heartedneſs amongſt profeſſors; whereupon, when they were gone in to their breakfaſt, I ran after the poor people about a quarter of a mile, and gave them ſome money. Mean while ſome that were in the houſe, coming out, and ſeeing me a quarter of a mile off, ſaid, I could not have gone ſo far in ſuch an inſtant, if I had not had wings. Hereupon the meeting was like to have been put by; for they were filled with ſuch ſtrange thoughts concerning me, that many of them were againſt having a meeting with me. I told them. I ran after thoſe poor people to give them ſorme mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:037441_0170_100D8EBDB573E620"/>being grieved at their hard-heartedneſs, who gave them nothing. Then came Miles and Stephen Hubberſty; who, being more ſimple-hearted men, would have the meeting held. So to the chapel I went, and the prieſt came. A great meeting there was, and the way of life and ſalvation was opened; and after awhile the prieſt fled away. Many of Crook and Under-barrow were convinced that day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word of life, and ſtood faſt in it under the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt Jeſus. After I had declared the truth to them for ſome hours, and the meeting was ended, the chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and ſome other profeſſors fell to reaſoning with me in the chapel yard. Whereupon I took a bible and opened the ſcriptures. and dealt tenderly with them, as one would do with a child. They that were in the light of Chriſt and Spirit of God, knew when I ſpake ſcripture, though I did not mention chapter and verſe, after the prieſts for to them.</p>
                  <p>From hence I went with an ancient man, whoſe heart the Lord had opened, and he invited me to his houſe; his name was Jatnes Dickinſon. He was convinced that day, received the truth, and lived and died in it.</p>
                  <p>I came the next day to James Taylor's, of Newton in Cartmel, in Lancaſhire. On firſt-day I went to the chapel, where prieſt Camelford uſed to preach; and after he had done, I began to ſpeak the word of life to the people. But he was in ſuch a rage, did ſo fret, and was ſo peeviſh, that he had no patience to hear; but ſtirred up the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who haled me out, ſtruck, and threw me headlong over a ſtone wall. Yet bleſſed be the Lord, his power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me. He that did this violence to me, was John Knipe, a wicked man, whom afterwards the Lord cut off. There was a youth in the chapel, writing after the prieſt. I was moved to ſpeak to him, and he came to be convinced, and received a part of the miniſtry of the goſpel: his name was John Brathwait.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to an alehouſe, to which many reſorted betwixt the time of their morning and afternoon preaching; and had a great deal of reaſoning with the people, declaring to them, That God was come to teach his people himſelf, and to bring them off from all falſe teachers, ſuch as the prophets. Chriſt, and the apoſtles cried againſt. Many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word of life at that time, and abode in it.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon I went about two or three miles to a ſteeple-houſe or chapel called Lyndal, When the prieſt
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037441_0171_100D8EBF4D5F8DB0"/>had done, I ſpoke to him and the people what the Lord commanded me, and there were great oppoſers; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they came to be convinced. After this I went to captain Sands, who with his wife ſeemed ſomewhat affected with truth, and if they could have held the world and truth together, they would have received it; but they were hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and he a very chaffy light man. Wherefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for his lightneſs and jeſting; telling him, It was not ſeemly in a great profeſſor as he was. Thereupon he told me. He had a ſon, who upon his death-bed had alſo reproved him for it, and warned him of it. But he neither regarded the admonition of his dying ſon, nor the reproofs of God's Spirit in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>From hence I went to Ulverſtone, and to Swarthmore to judge Fell's; whither came one Lampitt, a prieſt, who was an high notioniſt. With him I had a great deal of reaſoning; for he would talk of high notions and perfection, and thereby deceived the people. He would have owned me but I could not own or join with him, he was ſo full of firth. He ſaid. He was above John; and made as though he knew all things. But I told him, <q>Death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Adam to Moſes; and that he was under death, and knew not Moſes: for Moſes ſaw the paradiſe of God; but he knew neither Moſes, nor the prophets, nor John.</q> For that crooked and rough nature ſtood in him, and the mountain of ſin and corruption; and the way was not prepared in him for the Lord. He confeſſed he had been under a croſs in things; but now he could ſing pſalms, and do any thing. I told him, <q>Now he could ſee a thief, and join hand in hand with him: but he could not preach Moſes, nor the prophets, nor John, nor Chriſt, except he were in the ſame Spirit that they were in.</q> Margaret Fell had been abroad in the day-time; and at night her children told her, prieſt Lampitt and I had diſagreed; which ſomewhat troubled her, becauſe ſhe was in profeſſion with him; but he hid his dirty actions from them. At night we had great reaſoning; and I declared the truth to her and her family. Next day Lampitt came again, and I had a great deal of diſcourſe with him before Margaret Fell, who then clearly diſcerned the prieſt. A convincement of the Lord's truth came upon her and her family. Soon after a day was to be obſerved for an humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; and Margaret Fell aſked me to go with her to the ſteeple-houſe at Ulverſtone, for ſhe was not wholly come
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:037441_0172_100D8EC121CDC348"/>off from them: I replied, <q>I muſt do as I am ordered by the Lord.</q> So I left her, and walked into the fields; and the word of the Lord came to me, ſaying, <q>Go to the ſteeple-houſe after them.</q> When I came, Lampitt was ſinging with his people; but his ſpirit was ſo foul, and the matter they ſung ſo unſuitable to their ſtates, that after they had done ſinging, I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to him and the people. The word of the Lord to them was, <q>He is not a Jew that is one outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God.</q> Then, as the Lord opened further, I ſhewed them, <q>That He was come to teach his people by his Spirit, and to bring them off from all their old ways, religions, churches, and worſhips; for all their religions, worſhips, and ways were but talking of other men's words; but they were out of the life and Spirit which thoſe were in who gave them forth.</q> Then cried out one juſtice Sawrey. <q>Take him away;</q> but judge Fell's wife ſaid to the officers, <q>Let him alone; why may he not ſpeak, as well as any other?</q> Lampitt alſo, the prieſt, in deceit, ſaid, "Let him ſpeak." So at length, when I had declared a pretty while, juſtice Sawrey cauſed the conſtable to put me out; and then I ſpoke to the people in the grave-yard.</p>
                  <p>The firſt-day after, I was moved to go to Aldenham ſteeple-houſe, and when the prieſt had done, I ſpoke to him; but he got away. Then I declared the word of life to the people, and warned them to turn to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>From thence I paſſed to Ramſide, where was a chapel, in which Thomas. Lawſon uſed to preach, who was an eminent prieſt. He very lovingly acquainted his people in the morning of my coming in the afternoon; by which means many were gathered together. When I came, I ſaw there was no place ſo convenient as the chapel: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went into the chapel, and all was quiet. Thomas Lawſon went not up into his pulpit, but left all the time to me. The everlaſting day of the eternal God was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that day, and the everlaſting truth was largely declared; which reached and entered into the hearts of the people, and many received the truth in the love of it. This prieſt came to be convinced, left his chapel, threw off his preaching for hire, and came to preach the Lord Jeſus and his kingdom freely. After that ſome rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple caſt ſcandals upon him, and thought to have done him an injury; but he was carried over all, grew in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037441_0173_100D8EC442F9BBE8"/>of God mightily, and proved very ſerviceable in his place.</p>
                  <p>I returned to Swarthmore again, and the next firſt-day went to Dalton ſteeple-houſe; where, after the prieſt had done, I declared the word of life to the people, that they might be turned from darkneſs to light, from the power of Satan to God; and might come off from their ſuperſtitious ways, and from their teachers made by man, to Chriſt the true and living way, to be taught of him.</p>
                  <p>From thence I went into the iſland of Walnah; and after the prieſt had done. I ſpoke to him, but he got away. Then I declared the truth to the people, but they were ſomething rude. I went to ſpeak with the prieſt at his houſe, but he would not be ſeen. The people ſaid, he went to hide himſelf in the hay-mow, and they looked for him there, but could not find him. Then they ſaid, he was gone to hide himſelf in the ſtanding corn, but they could not find him there neither. I went to James Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter's, who was convinced in the iſland, and from thence returned to Swarthmore, where the Lord's power ſeized upon Margaret Fell, her daughter Sarah, and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to Becliſſ, where Leonard Fell was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and became a miniſter of the everlaſting goſpel. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others were convinced there, and came into obedience to the truth. Here the people ſaid, they could not diſpute; and would fain have put ſome other to hold talk with me; but I bid them, <q>Fear the Lord; and not in a light way hold a talk of the Lord's words, but put the things in practice.</q> I directed them to the Divine Light <q>of Chriſt and his Spirit in their hearts, which would let them ſee all the evil thoughts, words, and actions, that they had thought, ſpoken, and acted; by which light they might ſee their ſin, and alſo their Saviour Chriſt Jeſus to ſave them from their ſins. This I told them was their firſt ſtep to peace, even to ſtand ſtill in the light that ſhewed them their ſins and tranſgreſſions; by which they might come to ſee they were in the fall of old Adam, in darkneſs and death, ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe, and without God in the world: and by the ſame light they might ſee Chriſt that died for them to be their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Saviour, and their way to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this I went to a chapel beyond Gleaſton: which was built, but never a prieſt had preached in it. Thither
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:037441_0174_100D8EC64D9A5878"/>the country people came; and a quiet, peaceable meeting it was, in which the word of life was declared, and many were convinced of the truth about Gleaſton.</p>
                  <p>From thence I returned to Swarthmore again. After I had ſtaid a few days, and moſt of the family were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I went into Weſtmoreland, where prieſt Lampitt had been amongſt the profeſſors on Kendal ſide, and had mightily incenſed them againſt me; telling them I held many ſtrange things. I met with thoſe that he had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, ſate up all night with them at James Dickinſon's, and anſwered all their objections. They were both tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſatisfied with the truth I had declared, and diſſatiſfied with him and his lies, ſo that he clearly loſt the beſt of his hearers and followers, who hereby came to ſee his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and forſook him.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed to John Audland's and Gervaſe Benſon's, and had great meetings amongſt thoſe that had been convinced before. I paſſed to John Blakelin's and Richard Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's, where I had mighty meetings, and then towards Griſedale.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, judge Fell being come home, Margaret his wiſe ſent to me, deſiring me to return thither; and I, feeling freedom from the Lord ſo to do, went back to Swarthmore. I found the prieſts and profeſſors, and juſtice Sawrey, had much incenſed judge Fell and captain Sands againſt the truth by their lies; but when I came to ſpeak with him, I anſwered all his objections, and ſo thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied him by the ſcriptures, that he was convinced in his judgment. He aſked me, <q>If I was that George Fox whom juſtice Robinſon ſpoke ſo much in commendation of amongſt many of the parliament men?</q> I told him, I had been with juſtice Robinſon, and juſtice Hotham, in Yorkſhire, who were very civil and loving to me; and that they were convinced in their judgment by the Spirit of God, that the principle which I bore teſtimony to was the truth, and they ſaw beyond the prieſts of the nation; ſo that they and many others were now come to be wiſer than their teachers. After we had diſcourſed a pretty while together, judge Fell himſelf was ſatisfied alſo, and came to ſee, by the openings of the Spirit of God in his heart, over all the prieſts and teachers of the world; and did not go to hear them for ſome years before he died; for he knew it was the truth that I declared, and that Chriſt was the teacher of his people, and their Saviour. He ſometimes
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037441_0175_100D8EC7DEBC0AC0"/>wiſhed that I was awhile with judge Bradſhaw to diſcourſe with him. There came to judge Fell's captain Sands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, endeavouring to incenſe the judge againſt me; for he was an evil-minded man, and full of envy againſt me; yet he could ſpeak high things, uſe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-words, and ſay, "Behold, I make all things new." But I told him, Then he muſt have a new God; for his God was his belly. Beſides him came alſo that envious juſtice John Sawrey. I told him, <q>His heart was rotten, and he was full of hypocriſy to the brim.</q> Several others alſo carne, whoſe ſtates the Lord gave me a diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; and I ſpoke to their conditions. While I was in thoſe parts, Richard Farnſworth and James Nayler came to ſee me and the family; and judge Fell, being ſatisfied that it was the way of truth, notwithſtanding all their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſuffered the meeting to be kept at his houſe; and a great meeting was ſettled there in the Lord's power, which hath continued near forty years, until the year 1690, that a new meeting-houſe was erected near it.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſtaid awhile, and the meeting there was well ſettled, I departed to Under-barrow, where I had a great meeting. From thence I went to Kellet, and had a great meeting at Robert Withers's, to which ſeveral came from Lancaſter, and ſome from York; and many were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. On the market-day I went to Lancaſter, and ſpoke through the market in the dreadful power of God; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day of the Lord to the people, and crying out againſt all their deceitful merchandize. I preached right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs and truth unto them, which all ſhould follow after, walk and live in; directing them how and where they might find and receive the Spirit of God to guide them thereinto. After I had cleared myſelf in the market, I went to my lodging, whither ſeveral people came; and many were convinced, who ſtood faithful to the truth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt-day following, in the forenoon, I had a great meeting in the ſtreet at Lancaſter, amongſt the ſoldiers and people, to whom I declared the word of life, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth. I opened unto them, That all the traditions they had lived in, all their worſhips and religions, and the profeſſion they made of the ſcriptures, were good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, while they lived out of the life and power which thoſe were in who gave forth the ſcriptures. I directed them to the light of Chriſt, the heavenly man, and to the Spirit of God in their own hearts, that they might come to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037441_0176_100D8EC982ACA1A0"/>be acquainted with God and Chriſt, receive him for their teacher, and kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w his kingdom ſet up in them.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon I went to the ſteeple-houſe at Lancaſter, and declared the truth to the prieſt and people; laying open before them the deceit they lived in, and directing them to the power and Spirit of God which they wanted. But they haled me out, and ſtoned me along the ſtreet till I came to John Lawſon's houſe.</p>
                  <p>Another firſt-day I went to a ſteeple-houſe by the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where one Whitehead was prieſt; to whom and to the people I declared the truth in the dreadful power of God. There came a doctor, ſo full of envy, that he ſaid, <q>He could find in his heart to run me through with his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, though he was hanged for it the next day;</q> yet this man came afterwards to be convinced of the truth, ſo far as to be loving to friends. Some were convinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who willingly ſate down under the miniſtry of Chriſt, their teacher; and a meeting was ſettled there in the power of God, which has continued to this day.</p>
                  <p>After this I returned into Weſtmoreland, and ſpoke through Kendal on a market-day. So dreadful was the power of God upon me, that people flew like chaff be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me into their houſes. I warned them of the mighty day of the Lord, and exhorted them to hearken to the voice of God in their own hearts, who was now come to teach his people himſelf. When ſome oppoſed, many others took my part. At laſt ſome fell to fighting about me; but I went and ſpoke to them, and they parted again. Several were convinced.</p>
                  <p>The firſt-day after I had a very large meeting in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow at Miles Bateman's, where I was moved to declare, <q>That all people in the fall were gone from the image of God, righteouſneſs, and holineſs, and were become as wells without the water of life, as clouds without the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rain, as trees without the heavenly fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>; and were degenerated into the nature of beaſts, of ſe pents, of tall cedars, of oaks, of bulls, and of heifers: ſo that they might read the natures of theſe creatures within, as the prophets deſcribed them to the people of old, that were out of truth. I opened to them, how ſome were in the nature of dogs and ſwine, biting and reading; ſome in the nature of briers, thiſtles, and thorns; ſome like the owls and dragons in the night; ſome like the wild aſſes and horſes, ſnuffing up the wind; and ſome like the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037441_0177_100D8ECD21A88FD8"/>mountains and rocks, and crooked and rough ways. Wherefore I exhorted them to read theſe things within in their own natures, as well as without: and that, when they read without of the wandering ſtars, they ſhould look within, and ſee how they have wandered from the bright and morning ſtar. And they ſhould conſider, that as the fallow ground in their fields muſt be plowed up before it would bear ſeed to them, ſo muſt the fallow ground of their hearts be plowed up before they could bear ſeed to God. All theſe names and things I ſhewed were ſpoken of and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>an and woman, ſince they fell from the image of God; but as they come to be renewed again into the image of God, they come out of the natures of theſe things, and ſo out of the names thereof.</q> Many more ſuch things were declared to them, and they were turned to the light of Chriſt, by which they might come to know and receive him, and might witneſs him to be their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, their way, their ſalvation and true teacher. Many were convinced at that time.</p>
                  <p>After I had travelled up and down in thoſe countries, having great meetings. I came to Swarthmore again; and when I had viſited friends awhile in thoſe parts, I heard of a great meeting the prieſts were to have at Ulverſtone on a lecture-day. I went to it, and into the ſteeple-houſe in the dread and power of the Lord. When the prieſt had done, I ſpoke among them the word of the Lord, which was as an hammer, and as a fire amongſt them. And though Lampitt, the prieſt of the place, had been at variance with moſt of the prieſts before, yet againſt the truth they all joined together. But the mighty power of the Lord was over all; and ſo wonderful was the appearance thereof, that prieſt Bennet ſaid, "The church ſhook;" inſomuch that he was afraid and trembled. And after he had ſpoken a few confuſed words, he haſtened out for fear the ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe would fall on his head. There were many prieſts got together, but they had no power as yet to perſecute.</p>
                  <p>When I had cleared my conſcience amongſt them, I went to Swarthmore again. Thither came four or five of the prieſts. In diſcourſe, I aſked them, <q>Whether any one of them could ſay, he ever had the word of the Lord to go and ſpeak to ſuch or ſuch a people?</q> None of them durſt ſay he had; but one of them burſt into a paſſion, and ſaid, <q>He could ſpeak his experiences as well as I,</q> I told him experience was one thing; but to receive
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037441_0178_100D8ECF56C7A270"/>and go with a meſſage, and to have a word from the Lord as the prophets and apoſtles had, and as I had had to them, was another thing. And therefore I put it to them again; <q>Could any one of them ſay, he ever had a command or word from the Lord immediately at any time?</q> But none of them could ſay ſo. Then I told them, The falſe prophets, falſe apoſtles, and antichriſts, could uſe the words of the true prophets, true apoſtles, and of Chriſt, and would ſpeak of other men's experiences, though themſelves never knew nor heard the voice of God and Chriſt: and ſuch as they might get the good words and experiences of others. This puzzled them much, and laid them open. For at another time, when I was diſcourſing with ſeveral prieſts at judge Fell's houſe, and he was by, I aſked them the ſame queſtion, <q>Whether any of them ever heard the voice of God or Chriſt, to bid him to go to ſuch or ſuch a people, to declare his word or meſſage unto them!</q> for any one, I told them, that could but read, might declare the experiences of the prophets and apoſtles, which were recorded in the ſcriptures. Hereupon Thomas Taylor, an ancient prieſt, did ingenuouſly confeſs before judge Fell, <q>That he had never heard the voice of God, nor of Chriſt, to ſend him to any people; but he ſpoke his experiences, and the experiences of the ſaints in former ages, and that he preached.</q> This very much confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judge Fell in the perſuaſion, <q>That the prieſts were wrong;</q> for he had thought formerly, as the generality of people then did, "That they were ſent from God."</p>
                  <p>Thomas Taylor was convinced at this time, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with me into Weſtmoreland. Coming to Croſland ſleeple-houſe, we found the people gathered: and the Lord opened Thomas Taylor's mouth (though he was convinced but the day before) ſo that he declared amongſt them, "How he had been before he was convinced," and, like the good ſcribe converted to the kingdom, he brought forth things new and old to the people, and ſhewed them, <q>how the prieſts were out of the way:</q> which fretted the prieſt. Some little diſcourſe I had with them, but they fled away; and a precious meeting there was, wherein the Lord's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was over all, and the people were directed to the Spirit of God, by which they might come to know God and Chriſt, and to underſtland the Scriptures a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>. After this I paſſed on, viſiting friends, and had very large meetings in Weſtmoreland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="unknown:037441_0179_100D8F8FB7AB1170"/>
Now began the prieſts to rage more and more, and as much as they could to ſtir up perſecution. James Nayler and Francis Howgill were caſt into priſon in Appleby gaol, at the inſtigation of the malicious prieſts; ſome of whom propheſied, <q>That within a month we ſhould be all ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered again, and come to nothing.</q> But bleſſed for ever be the worthy name of the Lord, his work went on and proſpered; for about this time John Audland, Francis Howgill, John Camm, Edward Burrough, Richard Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn, Miles Hubberſty, and Miles Halhead, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, being endued with power from on high, came forth in the work of the miniſtry, and approved themſelves faithful labourers therein; travelling up and down, and preaching the goſpel freely; by means whereof multitudes were convinced, and many effectually turned to the Lord. Amongſt theſe, Chriſtopher Taylor was one, brother to Thomas Taylor before-mentioned, who had been preacher to a people as well as his brother; but after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truth, they ſoon came into obedience thereunto, and left their preaching for hire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and having received a part of the miniſtry of the goſpel, they preached Chriſt freely, being often ſent by the Lord to declare his word in ſteeple-houſes and markets, and great ſufferers they were.</p>
                  <p>After I had viſited friends in Weſtmoreland, I returned into Lancaſhire, and went to Ulverſtone, where Lampitt was prieſt; who though he had preached of a people that ſhould own the teachings of God, and had ſaid, <q>That men and women ſhould come and declare the goſpel:</q> yet when it came to be fulfilled, he perſecuted both it and them. To this prieſt's houſe I went, where abundance of prieſts and profeſſors were got together after their lecture, with whom I had great diſputings concerning Chriſt and the ſcriptures; for they were loth to let their trade go down, which they made of preaching Chriſt's, the apoſtles, and prophets words. But the Lord's power went over the heads of them all, and his word of life was held forth amongſt them; though many of them were exceeding envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deviliſh. Yet after this, many prieſts and profeſſors came to me from far and near. Thoſe that were innocent and ſimple-minded were ſatisfied, and went away refreſhed; but the fat and full were fed with judgment and ſent away empty: for that was the word of the Lord to be divided to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:037441_0180_100D7F5696074C28"/>
When meetings were ſet up, and we met in private houſes, Lampitt began to rage. He ſaid, <q>We forſook the temple, and went to Jeroboam's calves houſes.</q> So many profeſſors began to ſee how he was declined from that which he had formerly held and preached. Hereupon the caſe of Jeroboam's calves was opened to the profeſſors, prieſts, and people. It was manifeſted unto them, <q>That their houſe (called churches) were more like Jeroboam's calves houſes, even the old maſs-houſes, which were ſet up in the darkneſs of popery, which they who called themſelves proteſtants, and profeſſed to be more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened than the papiſts, did ſtill hold up, altho' God had never commanded them; whereas that temple, which God had commanded at Jeruſalem, Chriſt came to end the ſervice of; and thoſe that received and believed in him, their bodies came to be the temples of God, of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt, to dwell in them, and to walk in them. And ſuch were gathered into the name of Jeſus, whoſe Name is above every name, and there is no ſalvation by any other name under the whole heaven but by the name of Jeſus. And they that were thus gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed met together in ſeveral dwelling-houſes, which were not called the temple nor the church; but their bodies were the temples of God, and the believers were the church which Chriſt was the head of. So that Chriſt was not called the head of an old houſe, which was made by mens hands, neither did he come to purchaſe, ſanctify, and redeem with his blood an old houſe, which they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their church; but the people, which he is the head of.</q> Much work I had in thoſe days with prieſts and people, concerning their old maſs-houſes called churches; for the prieſts had perſuaded the people, that they were the houſes of God; whereas the apoſtle ſays, <q>Whoſe houſe we are,</q> &amp;c. Heb. iii. 6. The people in whom he dwells are God's houſe. The apoſtle ſaith, <q>Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed his church with his own blood;</q> and Chriſt calls his church his ſpouſe, his bride, the lamb's wife: ſo that this title church and ſpouſe was not given to an old houſe, but to his people the true believers.</p>
                  <p>On a lecture-day I was moved to go to the ſteeple-houſe at Ulverſtone, where were abundance of profeſſors, prieſts, and people. I went near to prieſt Lampitt, who was bluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering on in his preaching. After the Lord had opened my mouth to ſpeak, John Sawrey the juſtice came to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037441_0181_100D7F59508A63E8"/>me, and ſaid, <q>If I would ſpeak according to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I ſhould ſpeak,</q> I admired at him for ſpeaking ſo to me, and told him, <q>I would ſpeak according to the ſcriptures, and bring the ſcriptures to prove what I had to ſay; for I had ſomething to ſpeak to Lampitt and to them</q> Then he ſaid. I ſhould not ſpeak; contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, who had ſaid juſt before, <q>I ſhould ſpeak, if I would ſpeak according to the ſcriptures.</q> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were quiet, and heard me gladly, till this juſtice Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey (who was the firſt ſtirrer up of cruel perſecution in the north) incenſed them againſt me, and ſet them on to hale, beat, and bruiſe me. But now on a ſudden the people were in a rage, and fell upon me in the ſteeple-houſe before his face, knock'd me down, kick'd me, and trampled upon me. So great was the uproar, that ſome tumbled over their ſeats for fear. At laſt he came and took me from the people, led me out of the ſteeple-houſe, and put me into the hands of the conſtables and other officers; bidding them whip me, and put me out of the town. They led me about a quarter of a mile, ſome taking hold by my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſome by my arms and ſhoulders, who ſhook and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me along. Many friendly people being come to the market, and ſome to the ſteeple-houſe to hear me, divers of theſe they knock'd down alſo, and broke their heads, ſo that the blood ran down from ſeveral; and judge Fell's ſon running after to ſee what they would do with me, they threw him into a ditch of water; ſome of them crying, "Knock the teeth out of his head." When they had haled me to the common moſs ſide, a multitude following, the conſtables and other officers gave me ſome blows over my back with their willow rods, and thruſt me among the rude multitude; who, having furniſhed themſelves with ſtaves, hedge-ſtakes, holm or holly buſhes, fell upon me, and beat me on my head, arms, and ſhoulders, till they had deprived me of ſenſe; ſo that I fell down upon the wet common. When I recovered again, and ſaw myſelf lying in a watery common, and the people ſtanding about me, I lay ſtill a little while, and the power of the Lord ſprang through me, and the eternal refreſhings revived me; ſo that I ſtood up again in the ſtrengthening power of the eternal God, and ſtretching out my arms amongſt them, I ſaid, with a loud voice, "Strike again; here are my arms, my head, and my cheeks." There was in the company a maſon, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, but a rude fellow, who with his walking rule-ſtaff
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037441_0182_100D7F67E6CA86D8"/>gave me a blow with all his might juſt over the back of my hand, as it was ſtretched out; with which blow my hand was ſo bruiſed, and my arm ſo benumbed. that I could not draw it to me again; ſo that ſome of the people cried, <q>He hath ſpoiled his hand for ever having the uſe of it any more.</q> But I looked at it in the love of God (for I was in the love of God to all that perſecuted me) and after awhile the Lord's power ſprang through me again, and through my hand and arm, ſo that in a moment I recovered ſtrength in my hand and arm in the ſight of them all. Then they began to fall out among themſelves: ſome of them came to me, and ſaid, If I would give them money, they would ſecure me from the reſt. But I was moved of the Lord to declare the word of life, and ſhewed them their falſe chriſtianity, and the fruits of their prieſt's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; telling them, They were more like heathens and Jews, than true chriſtians. Then was I moved of the Lord to come up again through the midſt of the people, and go into Ulverſtone market. As I went, there met me a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, with his ſword by his ſide; "Sir," ſaid he to me," I <q>ſee you are a man, and I am aſhamed and grieved that you ſhould be thus abuſed;</q> and offered to aſſiſt me in what he could. I told him, The Lord's power was over all, and I walked through the people in the market, none of whom had power to touch me then. But ſome of the market people abuſing ſome friends in the market, I turned about, and ſaw this ſoldier among them with his naked rapier; whereupon I ran, and, catching hold of the hand his rapier was in, bid him put up his ſword again, if he would go along with me: for I was willing to draw him out from the company leſt ſome miſchief ſhould be done. A few days after, ſeven men fell upon this ſoldier, and beat him cruelly, becauſe he had taken part with friends and me. It was the manner of the perſecutors of that country, for twenty or forty people to run upon one man. They fell ſo upon friends in many places, that they could hardly paſs the highways, ſtoning, beating, and breaking their heads. When I came to Swarthmore, I found the friends there dreſſing the heads and hands of friends and friendly people, which had been broken or hurt that day by the profeſſors and hearers of Lampitt. My body and arms were yellow, black and blue, with the bruiſes I received amongſt them. Now began the prieſts
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:037441_0183_100D8ED0EC166080"/>to propheſy again, That within half a year we ſhould be all put down and gone.</p>
                  <p>About two weeks after this, I went into Walney iſland, and James Nayler with me. We ſtaid one night at a little town on this ſide, called Cockan, and had a meeting there, where one was convinced. After awhile came a man with a piſtol; whereupon the people ran out of doors. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for me; and when I came to him, he ſnapped his piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol at me; but it would not go off. This cauſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make a great buſtle about him; and ſome of them took hold of him, to prevent his doing miſchief. But I was moved in the Lord's power to ſpeak to him; and he was ſo ſtruck by divine power that he trembled for fear, and went and hid himſelf. Thus the Lord's power came over them all, though there was a great rage in the country.</p>
                  <p>Next morning I went in a boat to James Lancaſler's. As ſoon as I came to land, there ruſhed out about forty men, with ſtaves, clubs, and fiſhing-poles; who fell upon me, beating, punching me, and endeavouring to thruſt me backward into the ſea. When they had thruſt me almoſt into the ſea, and I ſaw they would have knocked me down in it, I went up into the middle of them; but they laid at me again, knocked me down, and ſtunned me. When I came to myſelf, I looked up and ſaw James Lancaſter's wife throwing ſtones at my face, and her huſband lying over me, to keep the blows and ſtones from me. For the people had perſuaded James's wife that I had bewitched her huſband; and had promiſed her, That if ſhe would let them know when I came thither, they would be my death; and having got knowledge of my coming, many of the town roſe up in this manner with clubs and ſtaves to kill me; but the Lord's power preſerved me, that they could not take away my life. At length I got upon my feet, but they beat me down again into the boat; which James Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter obſerving, he preſently came into the boat to me, and ſet me over the water from them; but while we were on the water, within their reach, they ſtruck at us with long poles, and threw ſtones after us. By that time we were come to the other ſide, we ſaw them beating James Nayler: for whilſt they had been beating me, he walked into a field, and they never minded him till I was gone; then they fell upon him, and all their cry was <q>Kill him, kill him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:037441_0184_100D8ED2D2AC74E0"/>
When I was come over to the town again, on the other ſide of the water, the townſmen roſe up with pitchforks, flails, and ſtaves, to keep me out of the town, crying, <q>Kill him, knock him on the head; bring the cart, and carry him away to the church-yard.</q> So after they had abuſed me, they drove me a pretty way out of the town, and there left me. Then went James Lancaſter again, to look after James Nayler; and I being now left alone, went to a ditch; and having waſhed myſelf, walked about three miles to Thomas Hutton's, where lodged Thomas Lawſon, the prieſt that was convinced. When I came in, I could hardly ſpeak to them, I was ſo bruiſed; only I told them where I left James Nayler. Whereupon they took each of them a horſe, and went and brought him thither that night. The next day Margaret Fell hearing of it, ſent an horſe for me; but ſo ſore I was with bruiſes, that I was not able to bear the ſhaking of the horſe without much pain. When I was come to Swarthmore, juſtice Sawrey and juſtice Thompſon of Lancaſter granted a warrant againſt me; but judge Fell coming home, it was not ſerved upon me: for he was out of the country all this time that I was thus cruelly abuſed. When he came home, he ſent warrants into the iſle of Walney, to apprehend all thoſe riotous perſons; whereupon ſome of them ſled the country. James Lancaſter's wife was afterwards convinced of the truth, and repented of the evil ſhe had done me; and ſo did ſome others of thoſe bitter perſecutors alſo; but the judgments of God fell upon ſome, and deſtruction is come upon many of them ſince. Judge Fell deſired me to give him a relation of my perſecution; but I told him, They could do no otherwiſe in the ſpirit wherein they were; and that they manifeſted the fruits of their prieſt's miniſtry, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and religion to be wrong. So he told his wife I made nothing of it; and that I ſpake of it as a man that had not been concerned: for indeed the Lord's power heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me again.</p>
                  <p>After I was recovered, I went to Yell and, where was a great meeting. In the evening came a prieſt to the houſe, with a piſtol in his hand, under pretence to light a pipe of tobacco. The maid of the houſe ſeeing the piſtol, told her maſter: who thereupon, clapping his hands on both the door-poſts, told him, He ſhould not come in there. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037441_0185_100D8ED60C8EF740"/>with ſtaves, and one with a muſket. But the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their bloody deſign; ſo that ſeeing themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, they went their way, and did no harm.</p>
                  <p>The time for the ſeſſions at Lancaſter being come, I went thither with judge Fell; who on the way told me, He never had ſuch a matter brought before him, and could not well tell what to do in the buſineſs. I anſwered when Paul was brought before the rulers, and the Jews and prieſts came down to accuſe him, and laid many falſe things to his charge, Paul ſtood ſtill all that while. When they had done, Feſtus the governor and king Agrippa beckoned to him to ſpeak for himſelf; which Paul did, and cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all thoſe accuſations: ſo he might do by me. Being come to Lancaſter, and juſtice Sawrey and juſtice Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon having granted a warrant to apprehend me, though I was not apprehended by it, yet hearing of it, I appeared at the ſeſſions; where there appeared againſt me about forty prieſts. Theſe had choſen one Marſhal, a prieſt of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, to be their orator; and had provided one young prieſt and two prieſts ſons to bear witneſs againſt me, who had ſworn beforehand that I had ſpoken blaſphemy. When the juſtices were ſet, they heard all that the prieſts and their witneſſes could ſay and charge againſt me; their orator Marſhal ſitting by, and explaining their ſayings for them; but the witneſſes were ſo confounded, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves to be falſe witneſſes. For when the court had examined one of them upon oath, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to examine another of them, he was at ſuch a loſs, he could not anſwer directly; but ſaid. The other could ſay it. Which made the juſtices ſay to him, <q>Have you ſworn it, and given it in already upon oath, and now ſay, that he can ſay it? It ſeems, you did not hear thoſe words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken yourſelf, though you have ſworn it?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were then in court ſeveral who had been at that meeting, wherein the witneſſes ſwore I ſpoke thoſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous words which the prieſts accuſed me of; and theſe, being men of integrity and reputation in the country, did declare and affirm in court, That the oath, which the witneſſes had taken againſt me, was altogether falſe; and that no ſuch words as they had ſworn againſt me were ſpoken by me at that meeting. Indeed, moſt of the ſerious men of that ſide of the country, then at the ſeſſions, had been at that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and had heard me both at that and other meetings alſo. This was taken notice of by colonel Weſt, who being a
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037441_0186_100D8ED823216498"/>juſtice of the peace, was then upon the bench; and having long been weak in body, bleſſed the Lord, and ſaid, The Lord had healed him that day; adding, That he never ſaw ſo many ſober people and good faces together in all his life. Then turning himſelf to me, he ſaid in the open ſeſſions, <q>George, if thou haſt any thing to ſay to the people, thou mayeſt freely declare it.</q> I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak: and as ſoon as I began, prieſt Marſhal, the orator for the reſt of the prieſts, went his way. That which I was moved to declare, was this: <q>That the holy ſcriptures were given forth by the Spirit of God; and all people muſt firſt come to the Spirit of God in themſelves, by which they might know God and Chriſt, of whom the prophets and apoſtles learnt; and by the ſame Spirit know the holy ſcriptures; for as the Spirit of God was in them that gave forth the ſcriptures, ſo the ſame Spirit muſt be in all them that come to underſtand the ſcriptures. By which Spirit they might have fellowſhip with the Father, with the Son, with the ſcriptures, and with one another: and without this Spirit they can know neither God, Chriſt, nor the ſcriptures, nor have a right fellowſhip one with another.</q> I had no ſooner ſpoken theſe words, but about half a dozen prieſts, that ſtood behind me, burſt into a paſſion. One of them, whoſe name was Jackus, amongſt other things that he ſpake againſt the truth, ſaid, That the Spirit and the letter were inſeparable. I replied, <q>Then every one that hath the letter, hath the Spirit; and they might buy the Spirit with the letter of the ſcriptures.</q> This plain diſcovery of darkneſs in the prieſt moved judge Fell and colonel Weſt to reprove them openly, and tell them. That according to that poſition, they might carry the Spirit in their pockets as they did the ſcriptures. Upon this, the prieſts, being confounded and put to ſilence, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in a rage againſt the juſtices, becauſe they could not have their bloody ends upon me. The juſtices, ſeeing the witneſſes did not agree, and perceiving they were brought to anſwer the prieſts envy, and finding that all their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences were not ſufficient in law to make good their charge againſt me, diſcharged me. And after judge Fell had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to juſtice Sawrey and juſtice Thompſon concerning the warrant they had given forth againſt me, and ſhewing them the errors thereof, he and colonel Weſt granted a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas to ſtop the execution of it. Thus I was cleared in open ſeſſions of thoſe lying accuſations which the malicious
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:037441_0187_100D8ED9B3FCDA68"/>prieſts had laid to my charge: and multitudes of people praiſed God that day, for it was a joyful day to many. Juſtice Benſon of Weſtmoreland was convinced; and major Ripan, mayor of the town of Lancaſter, alſo. It was a day of everlaſting ſalvation to hundreds of people: for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the way to the Father, the free Teacher, was exalted and ſet up; his everlaſting goſpel was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the word of eternal life was declared over the heads of the prieſts, and all ſuch lucrative preachers. For the Lord opened many mouths that day to ſpeak his word to the prieſts, and ſeveral friendly people and profeſſors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them in their inns, and in the ſtreets, ſo that they fell, like an old rotten houſe: and the cry was among the people, That the Quakers had got the day, and the prieſts were fallen. Many were convinced that day, amongſt whom Thomas Briggs was one, who before had been ſo averſe to friends and truth, that diſcourſing with John Lawſon, a friend, concerning perfection, Thomas ſaid to him, "Doſt thou hold perfection?" and lift up his hand, to have given the friend a box on the ear. But Thomas, being convinced of the truth that day, declared againſt his own prieſt Jackus; and afterwards became a faithful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the goſpel, and ſtood ſo to the end of his days.</p>
                  <p>When the ſeſſions were over, James Nayler, who was preſent, gave a brief account of the proceedings thereof in a letter, which ſoon after he wrote to friends, and is here added for the reader's further ſatisfaction:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>DEAR friends and brethren in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, my dear love unto you all, deſiring you may be kept ſteadfaſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in the power of his love, boldly to witneſs forth the truth, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in you by the mighty working of the Father: to him alone be everlaſting praiſe and honour for evermore! Dear friends, the Lord doth much manifeſt his love and power in theſe parts. The ſecond day of the laſt week my brother George and I were at Lancaſter. There were abundance of friends from all parts; and a great many who ſided with the prieſts, giving out, They now hoped to ſee a ſtop put to that great work which had gone on ſo faſt, and with ſuch power, that their kingdom is much ſhaken. We were called before judge Fell, colonel Weſt, juſtice Sawrey, &amp;c. to anſwer what was charged againſt George. There were three witneſſes to eight particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037441_0188_100D8EDB4E6201C0"/>but they were much confuſed in themſelves; which gave much light to the truth: whereby the juſtices did plainly ſee that it was envy; and they divers times told them ſo. One of the witneſſes was a young prieſt, who confeſſed, He had not meddled, had not another prieſt ſent for him, and ſet him on work. The other witneſſes were two prieſts ſons. It was proved there by many, that heard one of them ſay, If he had power, he would make George deny his profeſſion, and that he would take away his life. This was a ſingle witneſs to one of the greateſt untruths charged againſt George. The juſtices told him, They ſaw, becauſe he could not take away his life, he went about to take away his liberty. There was one prieſt choſen out of the whole number, as an orator, to plead againſt us; who ſpared no pains to ſhew his envy againſt the truth: and when he could not prevail, he went down in a rage; and there came a number of them into the room, among whom was one Jackus. George was then ſpeaking in the room (one of the judges having wiſhed, if he had any thing to ſay, that he would ſpeak:) at which prieſt Jackus was in ſuch a rage, that he brake forth into many high expreſſions againſt the truth ſpoken by my dear brother George; amongſt which this was one, That the letter and the Spirit were inſeparable. Hereupon the juſtices ſtood up, and bid him prove that, before he went any further. Then he ſeeing himſelf caught, would have denied it; and when he could not get off ſo, the reſt of the prieſts would have helped him to a meaning for his words: but the juſtices would admit no othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon the prieſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to ſilence, went down in a greater rage than before; and ſome of them, after they were gone down, being aſked what they had done, lied, and ſaid, They could not get into the room; thereby to hide their ſhame, and keep the people in blindneſs. The juſtices, judge Fell, and colonel Weſt, were much convinced of the truth, and did ſet up juſtice and equity; and have much ſilenced the rage of the people. Many bitter ſpirits were at Lancaſter, to ſee the event; but went home, and cried, The prieſts had loſt the day. Everlaſting pralſes be to him who fought the battle for us, who is our King
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037441_0189_100D8EDE9A61C8C0"/>for ever! There were others called, who the witneſſes confeſſed were in the room when the things charged on George were ſaid to have been ſpoken; but they all, as one man, denied that any ſuch words were ſpoken: which gave much light to the juſtices, and they durſt rely on what they witneſſed; for they ſaid, they knew many of them to be honeſt men. There was a warrant granted againſt us at Appleby; but juſtice Benſon told them it was not according to law; and ſo it ceaſed. I hear he is a faithful man to the truth. The prieſts began to preach againſt the juſtices, and ſaid, They were not to meddle in theſe things, but to end controverſy betwixt neighbour and neighbour. They are not pleaſed with the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not in the ſtatute to impriſon us, as the prieſt that pleaded againſt us ſaid. The juſtices bid him go put it into the ſtatute, if he could; he ſaid, It ſhould want no will of his. They are much afraid that they ſhall loſe all. They are much diſcontented in theſe parts; and ſome of them cry, "All is gone." Dear friends, dwell in patience, and wait upon the Lord, who will do his own work. Look not at man, in the work; nor at man, who oppoſeth the work: but reſt in the will of the Lord, that ſo ye may be furniſhed with patience both to do and to ſuffer what ye ſhall be called unto; that your end in all things may be his praiſe. Take up his croſs freely, which keeps low the fleſhly man; that Chriſt may be ſet up and honoured in all things, the light advanced in you, and the judgment ſet up, which muſt give ſentence againſt all that oppoſeth the truth; that the captivity may be led captive, and the priſoner ſet free to ſeek the Lord; that righteouſneſs may rule in you, and peace and joy may dwell in you, wherein conſiſteth the kingdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to whom be all praiſe for ever! Dear friends, meet often together; take heed of what exalteth itſelf above its brother; keep low, and ſerve one another in love for the Lord's ſake. Let all friends know how it is with us, that God may have the praiſe of all.</p>

                  <p>At this time I was in a faſt, and was not to eat until this work of God, which then lay weighty upon me, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. But the Lord's power was wonderfully exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he gave truth and friends dominion therein over
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:037441_0190_100D8EE1868C3D30"/>all. His glory was freely preached that day, over the heads of about forty hireling prieſts. I ſtaid two or three days afterwards in Lancaſter, and had ſome meetings there. The rude and baſer ſort of people plotted together to have drawn me out of the houſe, and to have thrown me over Lancaſter bridge, but the Lord prevented them. Then they invented another miſchief, which was this: After a meeting at Lancaſter, they brought down a diſtracted man, and another with him, having bundles of birchen rods, bound together like beſoms, with which they ſhould have whipped me; but I was moved to ſpeak to them in the Lord's mighty power, which chained down the diſtracted man, and the other alſo; and made them cahn and quiet. Then I bid him throw his rods into the fire, and burn them; which he did. Thus the Lord's power being over then, they departed quietly.</p>
                  <p>The prieſts, fretting to ſee themſelves overthrown at the ſeſſions at Lancaſter, got ſome of the envious juſtices to join with them; and at the following aſſize at Lancaſter informed judge Windham againſt me. Whereupon the judge made a ſpeech againſt me in open court; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded colonel Weſt, who was clerk of the aſſize, to iſſue a warrant for the apprehending of me; but colonel Weſt told the judge of my innocence, and ſpoke boldly in my defence. Yet the judge commanded him again, either to write a warrant, or go from his ſeat. Then he told the judge plainly, that he would not do it; but that he would offer up all his eſtate, and his body alſo for me. Thus he ſtopped the judge, and the Lord's power came over all; ſo that the prieſts and juſtices could not get their envy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. The ſame night I came into Lancaſter, it being the aſſize-time: and hearing of a warrant to be given out againſt me, I judged it better to ſhew myſelf openly, than for my adverſaries to ſeek me. So I went to judge Fell's and colonel Weſt's chambers. As ſoon as I came in, they ſmiled on me; and colonel Weſt ſaid, <q>What! are you come into the dragon's mouth?</q> I ſtaid till the judge went out of town; and I walked up and down the town, but no one meddled with me, nor queſtioned me. Thus the Lord's bleſſed power, which is over all, carried me through and over this exerciſe, gave dominion over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and enabled me to go on in his glorious work and ſervice for his great name's ſake. For though the beaſt

                  <p>From Lancaſter I returned to Robert Withers's. From thence I went to Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> mas Leper's, and a very bleſſed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had there; after which, I walked in the evening to Robert Withers's again. No ſooner was I gone, but there came a company of diſguiſed men to Thomas Leper's, with ſwords and piſtols; who ſuddenly entering the houſe, put out the candles, and ſwung their ſwords about amongſt the people of the houſe, ſo that they were fain to hold up the chairs before them, to ſave themſelves from being cut and wounded. At length they drove all the people out, and then ſearched the houſe for me, who it ſeems was the only perſon they looked for. They had laid wait before in the highway, by which I ſhould have gone if I had rid to Robert Withers's, and not meeting with me on the way, they thought to have found me in the houſe, but the Lord prevented them. Soon after I came to Robert Withers's, ſome friends from the town where Thomas Leper lived gave us a relation of this wicked attempt; and were afraid leſt they ſhould come and ſearch Robert Withers's houſe alſo for me, and do me a miſchief; but the Lord reſtrained them, that they came not. Theſe men were in diſguiſe, yet friends perceived ſome of them were Frenchmen, and ſuppoſed them to be ſervants belonging to one called Sir Robert Bindlas: for ſome of them had ſaid, in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they uſed to tie the proteſtants to trees, and whip and deſtroy them. His ſervants often abuſed friends, both in, and going to and from their meetings. They once took Richard Hubberthorn and ſerveral others out of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, carried them a long way into the fields, bound them, and left them in the winter ſeaſon. Another time one of his ſervants came to Francis Fleming's, and thruſt his naked rapier in at the door and windows; but a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Francis Fleming's, not a friend, came with a cudgel, and bid the ſervant man put up his rapier; which when he would not, but vapoured at him with it, and was rude, he knocked him down, took his rapier from him, and, had it not been for friends, would have run him through with it. So friends preſerved his life, that would have deſtroyed theirs.</p>
                  <p>From Robert Withers's I went to viſit juſtice Weſt, Richard Hubberthorn accompanying me. Not knowing the way, nor the danger of the ſands, we rode where, we
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:037441_0192_100D8EE5951B2ED8"/>were afterwards told, no man ever rode before, ſwimming our horſes over a very dangerous place. When we were come in, juſtice Weſt aſked us, If we did not ſee two men riding over the ſands? "I ſhall have their cloaths anon," ſaid he, <q>for they cannot eſcape drowning; and I am the coroner.</q> But when we told him we were the men, he was aſtoniſhed, and wondered how we eſcaped drowning. Upon this the envious prieſts and profeſſors raiſed a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous report, That neither water could drown me, nor could they draw blood of me; and therefore I was a witch: indeed, ſomtimes when they beat me with great ſtaves, they did not much draw my blood, though they bruiſed my body very ſorely. But all theſe ſlanders were nothing to me with reſpect to myſelf; though I was concerned on the truth's behalf, which I ſaw they endeavoared by theſe means to prejudice people againſt; for I conſidered that their forefathers, the apoſtate Jews, called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub; and theſe apoſtate chriſtians from the life and power of God could do no leſs to his ſeed. But the Lord's power carried me over their ſlanderous tongues, and their bloody murderous ſpirits; who had the ground of witchcraft in themſelves, which kept them from coming to God and to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited juſtice Weſt, I went to Swarthmore, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting friends, and the Lord's power was over all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors there. I was moved to write letters to the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, prieſts, and profeſſors thereabouts, who had raiſed perſecution before. That to juſtice Sawrey was after this manner:</p>

How is thy habitation fallen, and become the habitation of devils! How is thy beauty loſt, and thy glory withered! How haſt thou ſhewed thy evil, that thou haſt ſerved God but with thy lips, and thy heart far from him, and thou in the hypocriſy!

How haſt thou ſtrengthened the hands of evil-doers, and been a praiſe to them, and not to thoſe that do well! How like a madman and a blind man didſt thou turn thy ſword backward againſt the ſaints, againſt whom there is no law! How wilt thou be gnawed and burned one day, when thou ſhalt feel the flame, and have the plagues of God poured upon thee, and thou begin to gnaw thy tongue for pain, becauſe of the plagues! Thou ſhalt have thy reward according to thy works. Thou canſt not eſcape; the Lord's righteous judgment will find thee out, and the witneſs of God in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall anſwer it.

How haſt thou diſcovered thyſelf to be a man more fit to be kept in a place to be nurtured, than to be ſet in a place to nurture! How waſt thou exalted and puffed up with pride! And now art thou fallen down with ſhame, that thou comeſt to be covered with that which thou ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt up and broughteſt forth.

                        <p>THE word of the Lord to thee, O Lampitt! A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, ſurfeited and drunk with the earthly ſpirit, rambling up and down in the ſcriptures, and blending thy ſpirit amongſt the ſaints conditions; who hadſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, as thy father Balaam had, but art erred from it, as thy father did. One whoſe fruit hath withered (of which I am a witneſs) and many who have known thy fruit have ſeen the end of it, that it is withered; and do ſee where thou art, in the blind world, a blind leader of the blind; as a beaſt wallowing and tumbling in the earth, and in the luſt; one that is erred from the Spirit of the Lord, of old ordained to condemnation.

To thee this is the word of God; for in Chriſt's way thou art not, but in that of the Phariſees, as thou mayeſt read, Mat. xxiii, All that own Chriſt's words may ſee thee there. Chriſt, who died at Jeruſalem, cried wo againſt ſuch as thou art; and Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and for ever. The wo remains upon thee, and from under it thou canſt never come, but through judgment, condemnation, and true repentance. To thee this is the word of God.

When thou art in thy torment (though now thou ſwelleſt in thy vanity, and liveſt in wickedneſs) remember thou waſt warned in thy life-time. When the eternal condemnation is ſtretched over thee, thou ſhalt witneſs this to be the word of the Lord God unto thee, and if ever thine eye ſhould ſee repentance, thou wilt witneſs me to have been a friend of thy ſould.</p>

                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>CONSIDER, O people! who are within the pariſh of Ulverſtone, I was moved of the Lord to come into your publick places to ſpeak among you, being ſent of God to direct your minds to him, that you might know where to ſind your teacher; that your minds might be ſtayed alone upon God, and you might not gad abroad without you for a teacher; for the Lord alone will teach his people; he is coming to teach them, and to gather his people from idols temples, and from the cuſtomary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips which all the world is trained up in. God hath given to every one of you a meaſure of his Spirit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your capacity; liars, drunkards, whoremongers, and thieves, and who follow filthy pleaſures, you all have this meaſure in you. This is the meaſure of the Spirit of God that ſhews you ſin, evil, and deceit; which le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore mind your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (for nothing that is unclean ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God) and prize your time while you have it, leſt the time come that you will ſay, with ſorrow, we had
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037441_0196_100D8EED9857E348"/>time, but it is paſt. Oh! why will ye die! Why will ye chooſe your own ways! Why will ye follow the courſe of the world! Why will ye follow envy, malice, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and fooliſh pleaſures! Know ye not in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that all theſe are evil and ſin? and that ſuch as act theſe things ſhall never enter into the kingdom of God? Oh! that ye would conſider and ſee how you have ſpent your time, and mind how ye ſpend your time, and obſerve whom ye ſerve; for the wages of ſin is death. Do not ye know, that whatſoever is more than yea and nay cometh of evil? Oh! ye drunkards, who live in drunkenneſs, do ye think to eſcape the fire, the judgment of God? Though ye ſwell in venom, and live in luſt for awhile, yet God will find you out, and bring you to judgment. Therefore love the light which Chriſt hath enlightened you withal, who ſaith, I am the light of the world, and who enlightens every one that cometh into the world. One loves the light, and brings his works to the light, and there is no occaſion at all of ſtumbling: the other hates the light, becauſe his deeds are evil, and the light will reprove him. Thou that hateſt this light thou haſt it. Thou knoweſt, lying is evil, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs is evil, ſwearing is evil, whoredom, theſt, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs, are evil. Chriſt Jeſus hath given thee light enough to let thee ſee theſe are evil. This light, if thou loveſt it, will teach thee holineſs and righteouſneſs, without which none ſhall ſee God; but if thou hateſt this light, it is thy condemnation. Thus are Chriſt's words found to be true, and fulfilled among you. You that hate this light ſet up hirelings and idols temples, and ſuch prieſts as bear rule by their means; ſuch ſhepherds as hold up ſuch things, ſuch as are called of men maſters and have the chiefeſt place in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, whom Chriſt cried wo againſt, Mat. xxiii. ſuch as go in the way of Cain, in envy, and after the error of Balaam for wages, gifts, and rewards, theſe have been your teachers, and theſe you have held up. But thoſe who love the light are taught of God, and the Lord is coming to teach his people himſelf, and to gather his from the hirelings, from ſuch as ſeek for their gain from their quarter, and from ſuch as bear rule by their means. The Lord is opening the eyes of people, that they ſhall ſee ſuch as bear rule over them. But all, whoſe eyes are ſhut, are ſuch as the prophet ſpoke of <q>That have eyes, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:037441_0197_100D8EF0A28A6840"/>ſee not; but are fooliſh, upholding ſuch things.</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, poor people, as ye love your own ſouls, conſider the love of God to your ſouls while ye have time, and do not turn the grace of God into wantonneſs. That which ſhews you ungodlineſs and worldly luſts ſhould and would be your teacher, if you would hearken to it; for the ſaints of old witneſſed the grace of God to be their teacher, which taught them to live ſoberly and godly in this preſent world. You that are not ſober, this grace of God hath appeared unto you; but you turn it into want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and ſet up teachers without you, who are not ſober, not holy, not godly. Here you are left without excuſe, when the righteous judgment of God ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed upon all who live ungodlily. Therefore to the light in you I ſpeak; and when the book of conſcience ſhall come to be opened, then ſhall you witneſs what I ſay to be true, and you all ſhall be judged out of it. God Almighty direct your minds (ſuch of you eſpecially as love honeſty and ſincerity) that you may receive mercy in the time of need. Your teacher is within you; look not forth: it will teach you both lying in bed, and going abroad, to ſhun all occaſion of ſin and evil.</p>

Ye are ſuch as are turned from the light of Chriſt within, which he hath enlightened you withal: ye are ſuch as follow that which Chriſt cried wo againſt, that go not in Chriſt's way, but in the Phariſees way, as ye may read, Mat. xxiii. which our Lord cried wo againſt.

Wo was unto them who had not the life, ſo wo is unto you who have not the life that gave forth the ſcriptures, as your fruits have made manifeſt. For
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:037441_0198_100D8EF2C0AC2650"/>when the Lord moved ſome to come amongſt you, to preach the truth freely, you knock'd them down, beat, punched, and haled them out of your aſſemblies. Such a people ſerves thee, O Lampitt, to make a prey upon, and theſe are thy fruits. Oh! let ſhame, ſhame ſtrike thee and you all in the faces, who make a profeſſion of Chriſt's words, yet are ſtoners, ſtrikers, mockers, and ſcoffers. Let all ſee, if this be not a cage of unclean birds, which they who had the life of the ſcriptures ſpoke of. Such a company of people thou deceiveſt, feedeſt them with thy fancies, makeſt a trade of the ſcriptures, and takeſt them for thy cloak. But thou art manifeſt to all the children of light, for that cloak will not cover thee, thy ſkirts are ſeen and thy nakedneſs appears. The Lord made one to go naked among you, a figure of thy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of your nakedneſs, and as a ſign amongſt you, before your deſtruction cometh; that you might ſee you were naked and not covered with the truth. To the light in all your conſciences I ſpeak, which Chriſt Jeſus doth enlighten you withal. It will ſhew you the time you have ſpent, and all the evil you have done in that time, who follow ſuch a teacher, that acts contrary to this light, and leads you into the ditch. When you are in the ditch together, both teacher and people, remember ye were warned in your life-time. If ever your eye come to ſee repentance, and you obey the light of Jeſus Chriſt in you, you will witneſs me to have been a friend of your ſouls, and that I have ſought your eternal good, and written this in dear love to you. Then will you own your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; which you muſt all own before you can come into that bleſſed life, of which there is no end. But ye, who hate the light, becauſe your deeds are evil, this light is your condemnation. Oh! that ye would love this light and hearken to it! It would teach you, as you walk up and down about your occaſions, and as you lie upon your beds, and would never let you ſpeak a vain word. In loving it, you love Chriſt; in hating it, you bring the condemnation thereof upon yourſelves. To you this is the word of God, from under which you can never paſs, not ever eſcape the terror of the Lord in the ſtate you are in, who hate the light.</p>

In his way thou art not, but in the way of the Scribes and Phariſees; as thou mayeſt read, Matth. xxiii.

For thou art ſuch a one as ſues men at law for tithes, yet profeſſeſt thyſelf to be a miniſter of Chriſt; which Chriſt never empowered his to do: neither did any of his apoſtles or miniſters ever do ſo. Here I charge thee in the preſence of the Living God as one out of their doctrine, and that thou art one of thoſe evil beaſts the ſcripture ſpeaks of, that mindeſt earthly things which the life of the ſcriptures is againſt.

Therefore ſtop thy mouth for ever, and make no mention of them, nor profeſs thyſelf one of them. With the light thou art ſeen and comprehended; who art light and vain, and ſpeakeſt a divination of thy own brain, and deceiveſt the people. That in thy conſcience will witneſs what I ſay, and will condemn thee, who art one of thoſe that bear rule by their means, which the Lord ſent Jeremiah to cry againſt, Jer. v. and ſo thou holdeſt up the <q>horrible and filthy thing, that is committed in the land.</q> They that do not tremble at the word of the Lord are the fooliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hold thee up, they are ſottiſh children without underſtanding. They are wiſe to do evil, but not to do good, who are deceived by thee. Thou art one of thoſe that ſeek their gain from their quarter; a greedy dumb dog that never hath enough, as thy practice makes manifeſt; ſuch the Lord ſent Iſaiah to cry againſt, Iſa. lvi. 11, 12. Thou art ſuch a one as the Lord ſent Ezekiel to cry againſt, who feedeſt of the fat, and clotheſt with the wool, and makeſt a prey of the people. But the Lord is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his ſheep from thy mouth, that to thee they ſhall be a prey no longer. Thou enemy of God, here this prophecy is fulfilled upon thee, Ezek. xxxiv. and thou art one of them. I charge it upon thee in the preſence of the Living God. A hireling thou art, and thoſe that put not into thy mouth, thou prepareſt war againſt. Thou hateſt the good, and loveſt the evil; which the Lord ſent Micah to cry againſt, Mic. iii. Cover thy lips, and ſtop thy mouth for ever, thou child of darkneſs; for with the light thou art comprehended, and ſeen to be among them which the holy men of God cried wo againſt; and by the Spirit of the Living God thou art judged. In the light, which is thy condemnation, thou art comprehended. Thy
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:037441_0201_100D8EFA2403B618"/>race is ſeen, and thy compaſs known, who art out of the commands of Chriſt, and out of the doctrine and life of the apoſtles. Thou art proved and tried. To thee this is the word of the Loard; to thee it ſhall be as an hammer, a fire, and a ſword; and from under it thou ſhalt never come, unleſs thou repent; who art with the light to be condemned, in that ſtate wherein thou ſtandeſt. If ever thine eye ſee repentance, this thy condemnation thou muſt own.</p>

                  <p>I wrote alſo to—Burton, prieſt of Sedberg, to the ſame purpoſe, he being in the ſame evil ground, nature, and practice. Many other epiſtles alſo and papers I wrote about that time, as the Lord moved me thereunto, which I ſent among the prieſts, profeſſors, and people of all ſorts, for the laying their evil ways open before them, that they might ſee and forſake them; and opening the way of truth unto them, that they might come to walk therein; which are too many and large to be inſerted in this place.</p>
                  <p>After I had cleared my conſcience to the prieſts and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near Swarthmore, I went again into Weſtmoreland. A company of men with pikes and ſlaves laid wait for me at a bridge a the way; and they met with ſome friends, but miſſed me. Afterwards they came to the meeting with their pikes and ſtaves; but juſtice Benſon being there, and many conſiderable people beſides, they were prevented from doing that miſchief they intended. So they went away in a great rage, without hurting any body.</p>
                  <p>I went from the meeting to Grayrigg, and held a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Alexander Dickſon's; to which the prieſt, who was a baptiſt and a chapel-prieſt, came to oppoſe but the Lord confounded him by his power. Some of the people tumbled down ſome milk-pails which ſtood upon the ſide of the houſe (which was much crowded) whereupon the prieſt, after he and his company were gone, raiſed a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <q>That the devil frighted him, and took away a ſide of the houſe, while he was in the meeting.</q> And though this was a known falſehood, yet it ſerved the prieſts and profeſſors to feed on for awhile; and ſo ſhameleſs they were, that they printed and publiſhed it.</p>
                  <p>Another time this prieſt came to a meeting, and fell to jangling. Firſt he ſaid, <q>The ſcriptures were the word of God.</q> I told him, they were the words of God, but not
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:037441_0202_100D8EFC3A6C0248"/>Chriſt, the Word; and bid him prove by ſcripture what he ſaid. Then he ſaid, it was not the ſcripture that was the word; and ſetting his foot upon the bible, ſaid, it was but copies bound up together. Many unſavory words came from him, but after he was gone we had a bleſſed meeting; the Lord's power and preſence was preciouſly mainfeſted and felt among us. Soon after he ſent me a challenge to meet him at Kendal. I ſent him word he need not go ſo far as Kendal, for I would meet him in his own pariſh. The hour being fixed, we met, and abundance of rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gathered together (beſides the baptized people who were his own members) with intent to do miſchief, but God prevented-them. I declared the day of the Lord to them, and directed them to Chriſt Jeſus. Then the prieſt out with his bible, and ſaid, It was the word of God. I told him it was the words of God, but not God the Word. His anſwer was, He would prove the ſcriptures to be the word before all the people. I let him go on, having a man there that could take down in writing both what he and I ſaid. When he could not prove it (for I kept him to ſcripture-proof, chapter and verſe for it) the people gnaſhed their teeth for anger, and ſaid, He would have me anon: but in going about to prove that one error, he ran into many. And when at length he ſaw he could not prove it, he ſaid, he would prove it a God: ſo he toiled himſelf afreſh, till he ſweat again; but could not prove what he had affirmed. And he and his company were full of wrath: for I kept his aſſertions on the head of him and them all; and told them, I owned what the ſcriptures ſaid of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, namely, that they were the words of God, but Chriſt was the Word. So the Lord's power came over all, and they being confounded went away. The Lord diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their miſchievous intentions againſt me; friends were eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, and many of the prieſt's followers ſaw the folly of their teacher.</p>
                  <p>After this, prieſt Bennet, of Cartmel, ſent a challenge to diſpute with me. I came to his ſteeple-houſe on a firſt-day, and found him preaching. When he had done, I ſpoke to him and his people; yet the prieſt would not ſtand the trial, but went his way. After he was gone, I had a great deal of diſcourſe with the people: and when I was come into the ſteeple-houſe yard, diſcourſing further with the profeſſors and declaring truth unto them, one of them ſet his foot behind me, and two of them ran againſt
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:037441_0203_100D8EFDD0A82900"/>my breaſt, and threw me down backwards againſt a grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, wickedly and maliciouſly ſeeking to have hurt me: but I got up again, and was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to them. Then I went to the prieſt's houſe, and deſired him to come forth that I might diſcourſe with him, ſeeing he had challenged me; but he would not be ſeen. So the Lord's power came over them all, which was greatly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt at that time. There was amongſt the prieſt's hearers one Richard Roper, one of the bittereſt profeſſors the prieſt had, who was very fierce and hot in contention; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he came to be convinced of God's eternal truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a miniſter thereof, and continued faithful to his death.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of the year 1653 I returned to Swarthmore, and going to a meeting at Gleaſton, a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor challenged a diſpute with me. I went to the houſe where he was, and called him to come forth; but the Lord's power was over him, ſo that he durſt not meddle. I departed thence, viſited the meetings of friends in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and came back to Swarthmore. Great openings I had from the Lord, not only of divine and ſpiritual matters, but alſo of outward things relating to the civil government. Being one day in Swarthmore-hall, when judge Fell and juſtice Benſon were talking of the news, and of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ſitting (called the long parliament) I was moved to tell them, Before that day two weeks the parliament ſhould be broken up and the ſpeaker plucked out of his chair; and that day two weeks juſtice Benſon told judge Fell, that now he ſaw George was a true prophet; for Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had broken up the parliament.</p>
                  <p>About this time I was in a faſt for about ten days, my ſpirit being greatly exerciſed on truth's behalf: for James Milner and Richard Myer went out into imaginations, and a company followed them. This James Milner and ſome of his company had true openings at the firſt; but getting up into pride and exaltation of ſpirit, they ran out from truth. I was ſent for to them, and was moved of the Lord to go and ſhew them their out-goings: and they were brought to ſee their folly, and condemned it, and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of truth again. After ſome time I went to a meeting at Arnſide, where Richard Myer was, who had been long lame of one of his arms. I was moved of the Lord to ſay unto him amongſt all the people, <q>Stand up upon thy legs,</q> for he was ſitting down; and he ſtood up, and ſtretched out his arm that had been lame a long
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:037441_0204_100D8F0080579DB0"/>time, and ſaid, <q>Be it known unto you, all people, that this day I am healed.</q> Yet his parents could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; but after the meeting was done, had him aſide, took off his doublet, and then ſaw it was true. He came ſoon after to Swarthmore meeting, and there declared how the Lord had healed him. Yet after this the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go to York with a meſſage from him; which he diſobeyed, and the Lord ſtruck him again, ſo that he died about three quarters of a year after.</p>
                  <p>Now were great threatenings given forth in Cumberland, That if ever I came there, they would take away my life. When I heard it. I was drawn to go into Cumberland; and went to Miles Wennington's, in the ſame pariſh from which thoſe threatenings came: but they had not power to touch me.</p>
                  <p>About this time Anthony Pearſon was convinced, who had been an oppoſer of friends. He came to Swarthmore; and I being then at colonel Weſt's, they ſent for me. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Weſt ſaid, <q>Go, George, for it may be of great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the man.</q> So I went, and the Lord's power reached him.</p>
                  <p>About this time alſo the Lord opened ſeveral mounths to declare the truth to prieſts and people, and divers were caſt into priſon. I went again into Cumberland; and Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pearſon and his wife, and ſeveral friends, went along with me to Bootle, where Anthony left me, and went to Carliſle ſeſſions: for he was a juſtice of the peace in three counties. Upon the firſt-day I went into the ſteeple-houſe at Bootle; and when the prieſt had done, I began to ſpeak. The people were exceeding rude, and beat me in the ſteeple-houſe yard. One gave me a very great blow over my wriſt, ſo that the people thought he had broken my hand to pieces. The conſtable was very willing to have kept the peace, and would have ſet ſome of thoſe by the heals that ſtruck me, if I would have given way to it. After my ſervice amongſt them was over, I went to Joſeph Nicholſon's, and the conſtable accompanied us, to keep off the rude multitude. In the afternoon I went up again; and then the prieſt had got another prieſt to help him, that came from London, who was highly accounted of. Before I went into the ſteeple-houſe, I ſat a little upon the croſs, and friends with me; but they were moved to go into the ſteeple-houſe, and I went in after them. The London prieſt was preaching, who gathered up all the ſcriptures he
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:037441_0205_100D8F02A2AF5948"/>could think of, that ſpake of falſe prophets, antichriſts, and deceivers, and threw them upon us. When he had done, I recollected all thoſe ſcriptures, and brought them back upon himſelf. Then the people fell upon me in a rude manner; but the conſtable charged them to keep the peace, and made them quiet again. Then the prieſt began to rage; and ſaid, I muſt not ſpeak there. I told him, He had his hour-glaſs, by which he had preached; and he having done, the time was free for me, as well as for him: for he was but a ſtranger there himſelf. So I opened the ſcriptures to them, and let them ſee, <q>That thoſe ſcriptures, which ſpake of the falſe prophets, antichriſts, and deceivers, deſcribed them and their generation, and belonged to them who were found walking in their ſleps, and bringing forth their fruits; and not unto us, who were not guilty of ſuch things.</q> I manifeſted to them, that they were out of the ſteps of the true prophets and apoſtles; and ſhewed them clearly, by the fruits and marks, that they, and not we, were ſuch as thoſe ſcriptures ſpoke of. And I declared the truth and the word of life to the people, and directed them to Chriſt their teacher. All was quiet while I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when I had done, and was come forth; the prieſts were in ſuch a fret and rage, that they foamed at the mouth for anger againſt me. The prieſt of the place made an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people in the ſteeple-houſe yard, ſaying, <q>This man hath gotten all the honeſt men and women in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire to him, and now he come here to do the ſame.</q> Then ſaid I to him, <q>What wilt thou have left? And what have the prieſts left them, but ſuch as themſelves? For if they be the honeſt that receive the truth and are turned to Chriſt, then they muſt be the diſhoneſt that follow thee, and ſuch as thou art.</q> Some alſo of the prieſt's people began to plead for their prieſt, and for tythes. I told them, It were better for them to plead for Chriſt, who had ended the tything prieſthood with the tythes, and had ſent forth his miniſters to give freely, as they had received freely. So the rude people, that they could not do the miſchief they intended. When I came down again to Joſeph Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's houſe, I ſaw a great hole in my coat, which was cut with a knife, but it was not cut through my waiſtcoat for the Lord had prevented their miſchief. The next day there was a rude wicked man would have done violence to a friend, but the Lord's power ſtopped him.</p>

Now was I moved to ſend James Lancaſter to appoint a meeting at John Wilkinſon's ſteeple-houſe near Cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; a preacher in great repute, who had three pariſhes under him; wherefore I ſtaid at Milholm in Bootle till he came back again. In the mean time ſome of the gentry of the country had formed a plot againſt me, and had given a little boy a rapier to do me a miſchief with. They came with the boy to Joſeph Nicholſon's to ſeek me; but the Lord had ſo ordered it, I was gone into the fields. They met with James Lancaſter, but did not much abuſe him; and not finding me in the houſe, went away again. So I walked up and down in the fields that night, and did not go to bed as very often I uſed to do. We came the next day to the ſteeple-houſe, where James Lancaſter had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the meeting. There were at this meeting twelve ſoldiers and their wives, from Carliſle; and the country people came in, like as it had been to a fair. I lay at an houſe ſomewhat ſhort of the place, ſo that many friends were got thither before me. When I came, I found James Lancaſter ſpeaking under a yew-tree; which was ſo full of people, I feared they would break it down. I looked about for a place to ſtand upon, to ſpeak unto the people: for they lay all up and down, like people at a leaguer. After I was diſcovered, a profeſſor aſked, If I would not go into the church? I ſeeing no place abroad convenient to ſpeak to the people from, told him, Yes: whereupon the people ruſhed in; ſo that when I came, the houſe and pulpit was ſo full, I had much ado to get in. Thoſe that could not get in, ſtood abroad about the walls. When the people were ſettled, I ſtood up on a ſeat. <q>And the Lord opened my mouth to declare his everlaſting truth and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting day; and to lay open their teachers, with the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, traditions, and inventions they had been under in the night of apoſtacy ſince the apoſtles days. I turned them to Chriſt the true teacher, and to the true ſpiritual worſhip; directing them where to find the Spirit and truth, that they might worſhip God therein. I explained Chriſt's parables unto them, and directed them to the Spirit of God in themſelves, that would open the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unto them. I ſhewed them, how all might come to know their Saviour, fit under his teaching, come to be heirs of the kingdom of God, and know God's and Chriſt's voice, by which they might diſcover all the falſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and teachers they had been under, and be gathered
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:037441_0207_100D8F06EECF1010"/>to the true Shepherd, Prieſt, Biſhop, and Prophet Chriſt Jeſus, whom God commanded all to hear.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I had largely declared the word of life unto them for about the ſpace of three hours, I walked from amongſt the people, who paſſed away well ſatisfied. Among the reſt a profeſſor followed me, praiſing and commending me; but his words were like a thiſtle to me. At laſt I turned about, and bid him 'Fear the Lord;' whereupon prieſt Larkham of Cockermouth (for ſeveral prieſts were got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the way, who came after the meeting was done) ſaid to me, <q>Sir, why do you judge ſo? you muſt not judge.</q> I turned to him, and ſaid, <q>Friend, doſt thou not diſcern an exhortation from a judgment? I admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him to fear God; and doſt thou ſay I judge him?</q> So this prieſt and I falling into diſcourſe, I mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted him to be amongſt the falſe prophets and covetous hirelings; and ſeveral being moved to ſpeak to them, he and two other of the prieſts ſoon got away. When they were gone, John Wilkinſon, preacher of that pariſh, and of two other pariſhes in Cumberland, began to diſpute againſt his own conſcience for ſeveral hours, till the people generally turned againſt him: for he thought to have tired me out; but the Lord's power tired him out, and the Lord's truth came over him and them all. Many hundreds were convinced that day, who received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his free teaching with gladneſs; of whom ſome have died in the truth, and many ſtand faithful witneſſes thereof. The ſoldiers alſo were convinced and their wives, and continued with me till firſt-day.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day I went to the ſteeple-houſe at Cockermouth, where prieſt Larkham lived. When he had done, I began to ſpeak, and the people began to be rude; but the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers told them, we had broken no law, and they became quiet. Then I turned to the prieſt, and laid him open among the falſe prophets and hirelings; at which word he went his way, ſaying, 'He calls me hireling;' which was true; all the people knew it. 'Some great men of the town ſaid,' 'Sir, we have no learned men to diſpute with you.' I told them, I came not to diſpute, but to ſhew the way of ſalvation to them, the way of everlaſting life. I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red largely the way of life and truth to them, and directed them to Chriſt their teacher, who died for them, and bought them with his blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:037441_0208_100D8F08873F7030"/>
When I had done, I went about two miles to another great ſteeple-houſe of John Wilkinſon's, called Brigham; where the people, having been at the other meeting, were mightily affected, and would have put my horſe into the ſteeple-houſe yard: but I ſaid, <q>No; the prieſt claims that; have him to an inn.</q> When I came into the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſe yard, I ſaw the people coming in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as to a fair; and abundance were already gathered in the lanes and about the ſteeple-houſe. I was very thirſty, and walked about a quarter of a mile to a brook, where I got ſome water, and refreſhed myſelf. As I came up again, I met Wiſkinſon; who, as I paſſed by him, ſaid, 'Sir, will you preach to-day? If you will,' ſaid he, <q>I will not oppoſe you in word or thought.</q> I replied, <q>Oppoſe, if thou wilt; I have ſomething to ſpeak to the people. And,</q> ſaid I, <q>thou carriedſt thyſelf fooliſhly the other day, and ſpakeſt againſt thy conſcience and reaſon, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that thy hearers cried out againſt thee.</q> So I left him, and went on; for he ſaw it was in vain to oppoſe, the people were ſo affected with the Lord's truth. When I came into the ſteeple-houſe yard, a profeſſor aſked, If I would not go into the church? And I ſeeing no convenient place abroad, went in; and ſtood up on a ſeat, after the people were ſettled. The prieſt came in alſo, but did not go up to his pulpit. <q>The Lord opened my mouth, and I declared his everlaſting truth and word of life to the people; directing them to the Spirit of God in themſelves, by which they might know God, Chriſt, and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and come to have heavenly fellowſhip in the Spirit. I declared to them, that every one that cometh into the world was enlightened by Chriſt the life; by which light they might ſee their ſins, and Chriſt, who was come to ſave them from their ſins, and died for them. And if they came to walk in this light, they might therein ſee Chriſt to be the author of their faith, and the finiſher thereof; their Shepherd to feed them, their Prieſt to teach them, their great Prophet to open divine myſteries unto them, and to be always preſent with them. I explained alſo to them, in the openings of the Lord, the firſt convenant, ſhewing them the figures, and the ſubſtance of thoſe figures; bringing them on to Chriſt, the new covenant. I alſo manifeſted to them, that there had been a night of apoſtacy ſince the apoſtles days; but that now the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goſpel was preached again, which brought life and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:037441_0209_100D8F0BF03C28E8"/>immortality to light; and the day of the Lord was come, and Chriſt was come to teach his people himſelf by his light, grace, power, and ſpirit.</q> A fine opportunity the Lord gave me to preach truth that day for about three hours, and all was quiet. Many hundreds were convinced; and ſome of them praiſed God, and ſaid, <q>Now we know the firſt ſtep to peace.</q> The preacher alſo ſaid privately to ſome of his hearers, that I had broken them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown them.</p>
                  <p>After this I went to a village, and many people accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me. As I was ſitting in an houſe full of people, declaring the word of life unto them, I caſt mine eye upon a woman, and diſcerned an unclean ſpirit in her. I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak ſharply to her; and told her, ſhe was under the influence of an unclean ſpirit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the woman went out of the room. I being a ſtranger there, and knowing nothing of the woman outwardly, the people wondered, and told me afterwards, I had diſcovered a great thing: for all the country looked upon her to be a wicked perſon. The Lord had given me a Spirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, by which I many times ſaw the ſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of people, and could try their ſpirits. Not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I was going to a meeting, I ſaw ſome women in a field, and diſcerned an evil ſpirit in them; and I was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go out of my way into the field to them, and declare unto them their conditions. Another time there came one into Swarthmore hall in the meeting-time, and I was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak ſharply to her, and told her ſhe was under the power of an evil ſpirit; and the people ſaid afterwards, ſhe was generally accounted ſo to be. There came alſo another time a woman, and ſtood at a diſtance from me. I caſt mine eye upon her, and ſaid, 'Thou haſt been an harlot:' for I perfectly ſaw the condition and life of the woman. She anſwered, Many could tell her of her outward ſins, but none could tell her of her inward. I told her, Her heart was not right before the Lord; and that from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came the outward. This woman was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of God's truth, and became a friend.</p>
                  <p>From the aforeſaid village we came to Thomas Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ley's, near Coldbeck; and from thence, having had ſome ſervice for the Lord there, I paſſed to a market-town, where I had a meeting at the croſs; and all was pretty quiet. When I had declared the truth unto them, and directed them to Chriſt their teacher, ſome received the truth. We had
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:037441_0210_100D8F0D9A8379C0"/>another meeting upon the borders, in a ſteeple-houſe yard, to which many profeſſors and contenders came; but the Lord's power was over all; and when the word of life had been declared amongſt them, ſome received the truth there alſo.</p>
                  <p>From thence we travelled to Carliſle, and the paſtor of the baptiſts, with moſt of his hearers, came to the abbey, where I had a meeting, and declared the word of life amongſt them. Many of the baptiſts and of the ſoldiers were convinced. After the meeting, the paſtor of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, an high notioniſt, and a flaſhy man, aſked me, <q>What muſt be damned?</q> I was moved immediately to tell him, 'That which ſpoke in him was to be damned.' This ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his mouth; and the witneſs of God was raiſed up in him. I opened to him the ſtates of election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that he ſaid, He never heard the like in his life. He came afterwards to be convinced.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to the caſtle among the ſoldiers; who beat a drum, and called the garriſon together. I preached the truth amongſt them, <q>directing them to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be their teacher, and to the meaſure of his Spirit in themſelves, by which they might be turned from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. I warned them all, that they ſhould do no violence to any man, but ſhould ſhew forth a chriſtian life: telling them, that be who was to be their teacher, would be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner, if they were diſobedient to him.</q> So I left them, having no oppoſition from any of them, except the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, who afterwards came to be convinced.</p>
                  <p>On the market-day I went to the croſs. The magiſtrates had both threatened, and ſent their ſerjeants; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates wives had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> If I came there, they would pluck the hair off my head; and the ſerjeants ſhould take me up. Nevertheleſs I obeyed the Lord God, went upon the croſs, and declared unto them, <q>That the day of the Lord was coming upon all their deceitful ways and doings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful merchandize; that they ſhould put away all cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cheating, and keep to Yea and Nay, and ſpeak the truth one to another: ſo the truth and the power of God was ſet over them.</q> After I had declared the word of life to the people, the throng being ſo great that the ſerjeants could not reach me, nor the magiſtrates wives come at me, I paſſed away quietly. Many people and ſoldiers came to me, and ſome baptiſts, that were bitter contenders; amongſt
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037441_0211_100D8F0FDC720F08"/>whom one of their deacons, an envious man, finding the Lord's power was over them, cried out for very anger. Whereupon I ſet my eyes upon him, and ſpoke ſharply to him in the power of the Lord: and he cried, <q>Do not pierce me ſo with thy eyes, keep thy eyes off me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt-day following I went into the ſteeple-houſe: and after the prieſt had done, I preached the truth to the people, and declared the word of life amongſt them. The prieſt got away; and the magiſtrates deſired me to go out of the ſteeple-houſe. But I ſtill declared the way of the Lord unto them, and told them, I came to ſpeak the word of life and ſalvation from the Lord amongſt them. The power of the Lord was dreadful amongſt them, ſo that the people trembled and ſhook; and they thought the ſteeple-houſe ſhook; ſome of them feared it would have fallen down on their heads. The magiſtrates wives were in a rage, and ſtrove mightily to have been at me: but the ſoldiers and friendly people ſtood thick about me. At length the rude people of the city roſe, and came with ſtaves and ſtones into the ſteeple-houſe, crying, <q>Down with theſe round-headed rogues:</q> and they threw ſtones. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the governor ſent a file or two of muſqueteers into the ſteeple-houſe to appeaſe the tumult; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the other ſoldiers out. So thoſe ſoldiers took me by the hand in a friendly manner, and ſaid, they would have me along with them. When we came into the street, the city was in an uproar; the governor came down; and ſome of thoſe ſoldiers were put in priſon for ſtanding by me againſt the town's-people. A lieutenant, who had been convinced, came and brought me to his houſe, where there was a baptiſt meeting, and thither came friends alſo. We had a very quiet meeting; they heard the word of life glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and many received it. The next day, the juſtices and magiſtrates of the town being gathered together in the town-hall, they granted a warrant againſt me; and ſent for me before them. I was then gone to a baptiſt's; but hearing of it, I went up to the hall, where many rude people were: ſome of whom had ſworn ſtrange falſe things againſt me. I had a great deal of diſcourſe with the magiſtrates, wherein I laid open the fruits of their prieſts preaching; ſhewed them how they were void of Chriſtianity; and that, though they were ſuch great profeſſors (for they were independents and preſbyterians) they were without the poſſeſſion of that which they profeiſed. After a large examination, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer; though they could not juſtly charge any ſuch thing againſt me. The gaol at Carliſle had two gaolers, an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and an under, who looked like two bear-wards. When I was brought in, the upper gaoler had me up into a great chamber, and told me, I ſhould have what I would in that room. But I told him, he ſhould not expect any money from me, for I would neither lie in any of his beds, nor eat any of his victuals. Then he put me into another room; where after awhile I got ſomething to lie upon. There I lay till the aſſizes came; and then all the talk was, that I was to be hanged. The high ſheriff, Wilfred Lawſon, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them much up to take away my life; and ſaid, He would guard me to my execution himſelf. They were in a rage, and ſet three muſqueteers for guard upon me; one at my chamber-door, another at the ſtairs-foot, and a third at the ſtreet-door; and they would let none come at me, except one ſometimes, to bring me ſome neceſſary things. At night they would bring up prieſts to me, ſometimes as late as the tenth hour; who were exceeding rude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh. There were a company, of bitter Scotch prieſts, preſbyterians, made up of envy and malice, who were not ſit to ſpeak of the things of God, they were ſo foul-mouthed; but the Lord by his power gave me dominion over them all, and I let them ſee both their fruits and their ſpirits. Great ladies alſo (as they were called) came to ſee the man that they ſaid was to die. While the judge, juſtices, and ſheriff were contriving together how they might put me to death, the Lord diſappointed their deſigns by an unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way. For the judge's clerk, as I was informed, ſtarted a queſtion among them, which confounded all their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; after which, they had not power to call me before the judge.</p>
                  <p>Anthony Pearſon being then in Carliſle, and perceiving they did not intend to bring me upon my trial, wrote a letter to the judges, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>To the judges of aſſize and gaol-delivery for the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts, ſitting at Carliſle.</salute>

                        <p>YOU are raiſed up to do righteouſneſs and juſtice, and ſent forth to puniſh him that doth evil, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him that doth well, and to ſet the oppreſſed free. I am therefore moved to lay before you the condition of
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037441_0213_100D8F1490354EA8"/>GEORGE FOX, whom the magiſtrates of this city have caſt into priſon for words that he is accuſed to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which they call blaſphemy. He was ſent to the gaol, till he ſhould be delivered by due courſe of law; and it was expected he ſhould have been proceeded againſt in the common law-courſe at this aſſizes. The informations againſt him were delivered into court, and the act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and appoints that way of trial. How hardly and unchriſtianly he hath been hitherto dealt with, I ſhall not now mention; but you may conſider, that nothing he is accuſed of is nice and difficult. And, to my knowledge, he utterly abhors and deteſts every particular which by the act againſt blaſphemous opinions is appointed to be puniſhed, and differs as much from thoſe people againſt whom the law was made, as light from darkneſs. Though he be committed, judgment is not given him, nor have his accuſers been face to face, to affirm before him what they have informed againſt him; nor was he heard as to the particulars of their accuſation, nor doth it appear that any word they charge againſt him is within the act. But indeed I could not yet ſo much as ſee the information, no not in court, though I deſired it both of the clerk of the aſſizes and of the magiſtrate's clerk; nor hath he had a copy of them. This is very hard; and that he ſhould be ſo cloſe reſtrained, that his friends may not ſpeak with him, I know no law nor reaſon for. I do therefore claim for him a due and lawful hearing, and that he may have a copy of his charge, and freedom to anſwer for himſelf; and that rather before you, than to be left to the rulers of this town, who are not competent judges of blaſphemy, as by their mittimus appears; who have committed him upon an act of parliament, and mention words as ſpoken by him at his examination which are not within the act, and which he utterly denies. The words mentioned in the mittimus he denies to have ſpoken, and hath neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed nor avowed them.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding this letter, the judges were reſolved not to ſuffer me to be brought before them; but reviling and ſcoffing at me behind my back, left me to the magiſtrates of the town: giving them what encouragement they could to exerciſe their cruelty upon me. Whereupon (though I had been kept ſo cloſe in the gaoler's houſe that friends
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037441_0214_100D8F16CD0845F0"/>were not ſuffered to come at me, and colonel. Benſon and juſtice Pearſon were denied to ſee me, yet) the next day, after the judges were gone out of town, an order was ſent to the gaoler to put me down into the priſon amongſt the moſs-troopers, thieves, and murderers; which accordingly he did. A filthy, naſty place it was, where men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were put together in a very uncivil manner, and never a houſe of office to it; and the priſoners ſo louſy, that one woman was almoſt eaten to death with lice. Yet as bad as the place was, the priſoners were all made very loving and ſubject to me, and ſome of them were convinced of the truth, as the publicans and harlots were of old; ſo that they were able to confound any prieſt that might come to the grates to diſpute. But the gaoler was cruel, and the under-gaoler very abuſive both to me and to friends that came to ſee me; for he would beat friends with a great cudgel, who did but come to the window to look in upon me. I could get up to the grate, where ſometimes I took in my meat; at which the gaoler was often offended. Once he came in a great rage, and beat me with his cudgel, though I was not at the grate at that time; and as he beat me, he cried, come out of the window, though I was then far from it. While he ſtruck me, I was moved to ſing in the Lord's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which made him rage the more. Then he fetched a fiddler, and ſet him to play, thinking to vex me; but while he played, I was moved in the everlaſting power of the Lord God to ſing; and my voice drowned the noiſe of the fiddle, ſtruck and confounded them, and made them give over fiddling and go their way.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice Benſon's wife was moved of the Lord to come to viſit me, and to eat no meat but what ſhe eat with me at the bars of the priſon window. She was afterwards her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf impriſoned at York, when ſhe was great with child, for ſpeaking to a prieſt; and was kept in priſon, and not ſuffered to go out when the time of her travail was come: ſo ſhe was delivered of her child in the priſon. She was an honeſt, tender woman, and continued faithful to the truth until ſhe died.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was in priſon at Carliſle, James Parnel, a little lad about ſixteen years of age, came to ſee me, and was convinced. The Lord quickly made him a powerful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the word of life, and many were turned to Chriſt by him, though he lived not long. For travelling into Eſſex in the work of the miniſtry, in the year 1655, he
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037441_0215_100D8F18F6C053B0"/>was committed to Colcheſter caſtle, where he endured very great hardſhips and ſufferings; being put by the cruel gaoler into a hole in the caſtle wall, called the oven, ſo high from the ground that he went up to it by a ladder, which being ſix feet too ſhort, he was obliged to climb from the ladder to the hole by a rope that was faſtened above. And when friends would have given him a cord and a baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket to have drawn up his victuals in, the inhuman gaoler would not ſuffer them, but forced him to go down and up by that ſhort ladder and rope to fetch his victuals (which for a long time he did) or elſe he might have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in the hole. At length his limbs being much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed with lying in that place, yet being obliged to go down to take up ſome victuals, as he came up the ladder again with his victuals in one hand, and catched at the rope with the other, he miſſed the rope and fell down from a very great height upon the ſtones; by which fall he was ſo wounded in his head, arms, and body, that he died in a ſhort time after. When he was dead the wicked profeſſors, to cover their cruelty, wrote a book of him, and ſaid, "He faſted himſelf to death!" which was an abominable falſehood, and was manifeſted ſo to be by another book, wrote in anſwer to that, called, <q>The Lamb's Defence againſt Lies.</q>

                  <p>When I ſaw that I was not like to be brought to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hearing and trial (although I had before anſwered in writing the particular matters charged againſt me at the time of my firſt examination and commitment) I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſend the following paper, as a publick challenge to all thoſe that belied the truth and me behind my back, to come forth and make good their charge.</p>

                  <p>While I thus lay in priſon, the report raiſed at the time of the aſſizes, "That I ſhould be put to death," was gone far and near; inſomuch that the parliament then ſitting, which I think was called the little parliament, hearing that a young man at Carliſle was to die for religion, cauſed a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſent to the ſheriff and magiſtrates concerning me.

Unlike men; as though you had never read the ſcriptures, or had not minded them! Is this the end of Carliſle's religion? Is this the end of your miniſtry? Is this the end of your church, and of your profeſſion of chriſtianity? You have ſhamed it by your folly, madneſs, and blind zeal. Was it not always the work of the blind guides, watchmen, leaders, and falſe prophets, to prepare war againſt them that could not put into their mouths? Have not you been the prieſts pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes and executioners? When they ſpur you up to bear the ſword againſt the juſt, do not you run on againſt thoſe that cannot hold up ſuch as the ſcriptures always teſtified againſt? Yet will you lift up your unholy hands, and call upon God with your polluted lips, and pretend a faſt, who are full of ſtrife and debate. Did your hearts never burn within you? Did you never come to queſtion your
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037441_0217_100D8F1CB5F93AF0"/>conditions? Are you wholly given up to do the devil's luſts, to perſecute? Where is your loving enemies? Where is your entertaining ſtrangers? Where is your overcoming evil with good? Where are your teachers, that can ſtop the mouths of gain-ſayers, convince gain-ſayers, and ſuch as oppoſe themſelves? Have you no miniſters of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, no ſoldiers with ſpiritual weapons, diſplaying Chriſt's colours? But all the dragon's, the murderer's, the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor's, arm of fleſh, Cain's weapons, chief prieſts taking counſel, Judas and the multitude with ſwords and ſtaves, Sodom's company raging about Lot's houſe, like the prieſts and princes againſt Jeremiah, like the dragon, beaſt, and great whore, and the falſe church, which John ſaw ſhould caſt into priſon, kill, and perſecute? Whoſe weapons are you bearing? Doth not the falſe church, the whore, make merchandize of cattle, corn, wine, and oil, even to the very ſouls of men? Hath not all this been ſince the true church went into the wilderneſs? Read Revelations the 12th, with the 18th: do you not read and ſee what a ſpirit you are of, and what a bottomleſs pit you are in? Have not you diſhonoured the place of juſtice and authority? What! turned your ſword back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, like madmen, who are a praiſe to the evil-doer, and would be a terror to the good, with all force and might to ſtop the way of juſtice! Doth not the Lord, think you, behold your actions? How many have you wronged? How many have you impriſoned, perſecuted, and put out of your ſynagogues? Are you they that muſt fulfil the prophecy of Chriſt, Matth. xxiii. John xvi. Read the ſcriptures, ſee how unhke you are to the prophets, Chriſt, and his apoſtles, and what a viſage you have, like unto them that perſecuted the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. You are found in their ſteps, wreſtling with fleſh and blood, not with principalities and powers, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedneſs; your teachers impriſoning and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting for outward things, you being their executioners; the like whereof hath not been in all the nations. The havork that hath been made, the ſpoiling of people's goods, taking away their oxen and fatted beeves, their ſheep, corn, wool, and houſhold goods, and giving them to the prieſts that have done no work for them. More like moſs-troopers than miniſters of the goſpel, they take them from friends; ſuing them in your courts, and fining them becauſe they will not break the command of Chriſt;
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:037441_0218_100D8F1F93AA5510"/>that is, becauſe they will not ſwear. Thus you act againſt them that do not lift up a hand againſt you, and as much as you turn againſt them you turn againſt Chriſt. But he is riſen that will plead their cauſe, and you cannot be hid. Your works are come to light, and the end of your miniſtry is ſeen, what it is for; for means. You have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured the truth, the goſpel; and are of thoſe that make it chargeable. You have loſt your glory. You have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured yourſelves. Perſecution was ever blind and mad. Read the apoſtle, what he ſaith of himſelf, when he was in your nature. Exaltation and pride, and your lifting up yourſelves, hath brought you to this; not being humble, not doing juſtice, not loving mercy. When ſuch as have been beaten and bruiſed by your rude company to whom you are a praiſe and encouragement, have come and laid things before you, that you might have done juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, preſerved and kept peace, you knowing they could not ſwear, have put an oath to them. This hath been your trick and cover, that ye might not do juſtice to the juſt; but by this means go on ſtill further to encourage the evil-doer. But the Lord ſees your hearts! If ye were not men paſt feeling, ye would fear and tremble before the God of the whole earth; who is riſen, and will ſtain your glory, mar your pride, deface your beauty, and lay it in the duſt. Though for a time you may ſwell in your pride, glory in your ſhame, and make a mock of God's meſſengers, who, for reproving ſin in the gate, are become your prey; you will feel the heavy hand of God and his judgments at the laſt. This is from a lover of the truth, of righteouſneſs, and of your ſouls; but a witneſs againſt all ſuch as make a trade of the prophets, Chriſt's, and the apoſtles words, and are found in the ſteps of them who perſecuted the prophets, Chriſt's and the apoſtles life; who perſecute thoſe that will not hold you up, put into your mouths, and give you means. Tithes were before the law, and tithes were in the law; but tithes ſince the days of the apoſtles have been only ſince the falſe church got up. Chriſt, who is come to end the law, and to end war, redeems men out of the tenths, and out of the nines alſo. The redeemed of the Lord ſhall reign upon the earth, and know the election which was before the world began. Since the days of the apoſtles, tithes have been ſet up by the papiſts, and by them that went from the apoſtles into the world; ſet up by the falſe church that
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:037441_0219_100D8F219C46EFF8"/>made merchandize of the people, ſince the true chutch went into the wilderneſs. But now is the judgment of the great whore come; the beaſt and falſe prophet (the old dragon) ſhall be taken and caſt into the fire, and the Lamb and his ſaints ſhall have the victory. Now it Chriſt come who will make war in righteouſneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy with the ſword of his mouth all theſe inventors and inventions that have been ſet up ſince the days of the apoſtles, and ſince the true church went into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. and the everlaſting goſpel, which is the power of God, ſhall be preached again to all nations, kindreds, and tongues in this the Lamb's day; before whom you ſhall appear to judgment. You have no way to eſcape. For he hath appeared who is the Firſt and the Laſt, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the Ending, the Alpha and the Omega: he that was dead is alive again, and lives for evermore!</p>

And all perſecutors ſhall partake of the plagues of the whore, who hath made the kings of the earth and the great men drunk with the wine of her fornications, and hath drunk the blood of the ſaints; and therefore ſhall you be partakers of her plagues. We are not ſuffered to ſee our friend in priſon, whom we witneſs to be a meſſenger of the Living God. Now, all people, mind whether this be according to law, or from the wicked, perverſe, envious will of the envious rulers and magiſtrates, who are of the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that perſecuted Jeſus Chriſt; for the ſaid, <q>as they have done to me, ſo will they do to you.</q> And as he took the love, the kindneſs, and ſervice that was ſhewed and performed to any of his afflicted ones in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſtreſs, as done unto himſelf; ſo the injuries and wrongs that were done by any to any of his little ones, he reſented as done unto himſelf alſo. Therefore you, who are ſo far from viſiting him yourſelves in his ſuffering ſervant that ye will not ſuffer his brethren to viſit him, ye muſt depart, ye workers of iniquity, into the lake that burns with fire. The Lord is coming to threſh the mountains, and will beat them to duſt; and all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt rulers, corrupt officers, and corrupt laws, the Lord will take vengeance on, by which the tender conſciences of his people are oppreſſed. He will give his people his law, and will judge his people himſelf, not according to the ſight of the eye and hearing of the ear, but with righteouſneſs and equity. Now are your hearts made manifeſt to be full of envy againſt the living truth of God. which is made manifeſt in his people, who are contemned and deſpiſed of the world, and ſcornfully called Quakers. You are worſe than the heathens that put Paul in priſon,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:037441_0221_100D8F25AA96B5C0"/>for none of his friends or acquaintance were hindered to come to him by them: therefore they ſhall be witneſſes againſt you. Ye are made manifeſt to the ſaints to be of the ſame generation that put Chriſt to death, and that put the apoſtle in priſon, on the ſame pretence as you act under; in calling truth error, and the miniſters of God blaſphemers, as they did. But the day is dreadful and terrible that ſhall come upon you, ye evil magiſtrates, prieſts, and people, who profeſs the truth in words out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and yet perſecute the power of truth and them that ſtand in and for the truth. While ye have time, prize it, and remember what is written, Iſa. liv. 17.</p>

                  <p>Not long after this the Lord's power came over the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they were made to ſet me at liberty. But ſome time before the governor and Anthony Pearſon came down into the priſon to ſee the place where I was kept, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what uſage I had. They found the place ſo bad, and the favour ſo ill, that they cried ſhame of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates for ſuffering the gaoler to do ſuch things. They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the gaolers into the priſon, and required them to find ſureties for their good behaviour; and the under-gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who had been ſuch a cruel fellow, they put into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with me amongſt the moſs-troopers.</p>
                  <p>After I was ſet at liberty I went to Thomas Bewley's, where came a baptiſt-teacher to oppoſe me; who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. Robert Widders being with me was moved to go to Coldbeck ſteeple-houſe, and the baptiſt-teacher went along with him the ſame day. The people fell upon them, almoſt killed Robert Widders, and took the baptiſt's ſword from him and beat him ſorely. This baptiſt had the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of an impropriation of tithes, and he went home and gave it up freely. Robert Widders was ſent to Carliſle gaol, where having lain awhile he was ſet at liberty. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dewſbury alſo went to a ſteeple-houſe hard by, and the people almoſt killed him, they beat him ſo; but the Lord's power was over all and healed them again. In that day many friends went to the ſteeple-houſes to declare the truth to the prieſts and people; and great ſufferings they underwent, but the Lord's power ſuſtained them.</p>
                  <p>Now I went into the country, and had mighty great
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:037441_0222_100D8F27A4F31370"/>meetings. The everlaſting goſpel and word of life flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, thouſands were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and to his teaching. Several who had taken tithes as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators denied the receiving of them any longer, and delivered them up freely to the pariſhioners. Paſſing into Weſtmoreland I had many great meetings. At Strickland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bead I had a large meeting, where Henry Draper, a juſtice of peace out of Biſhoprick, came, and many contenders were there. The prieſts and magiſtrates were in a great rage againſt me in Weſtmoreland, and had a warrant to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me; which they renewed from time to time. Yet the Lord did not ſuffer them to ſerve it upon me. I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled amongſt friends, viſiting meetings till I came to Swarthmore, where I heard the baptiſts and profeſſors in Scotland had ſent to have a diſpute with me. I ſent them word, I would meet them in Cumberland at Thomas Bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's, whither accordingly I went, but none of them came. Some dangers at this time I underwent in my travels. Going through Wigton on a market-day, the people of the town had ſet a guard with pitch-forks; and though ſome of their own neighbours were with us, they kept us out of the town and would not let us paſs through it, under a pretence of preventing the ſickneſs, which there was no occaſion for. However, they fell upon us, and had like to have ſpoiled us and our horſes; but the Lord reſtrained them, that they did not much hurt; and we paſſed away. Another time, as we were paſſing between two friends houſes, ſome rude fellows lay in wait in a lane, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtoned and abuſed us; but at laſt, through the Lord's aſſiſtance, we got through them, and had not much hurt. But this ſhewed the fruits of the prieſt's teaching, which ſhamed their profeſſion of chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>After I had viſited friends in that county. I went into Biſhoprick, having large meetings by the way. A very large meeting I had at Anthony Pearſon's, where many were convinced. From thence I paſſed through Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to Derwentwater, where we had great meetings; and the prieſts threatened they would come, but no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> came. The everlaſting word of life was freely preached, and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; hundreds being turned to Chriſt, their teacher.</p>
                  <p>In Northumberland many came to diſpute. Some pleaded againſt perfection; to whom I declared, <q>That Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell: and all that God made was perfect; and that the imperfection came
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:037441_0223_100D8F29C2612180"/>by the devil and the fall: but Chriſt, who came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the devil,</q> ſaid, "Be ye perfect." One of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors alledged that Job ſaid, <q>Shall mortal man be more pure than his Maker? The heavens are not clean in his ſight. God charged his angels with folly.</q> I ſhewed him his miſtake, and let him ſee, <q>it was not Job that ſaid ſo, but one of thoſe that contended againſt him; for Job ſtood for perfection, and held his integrity; and they were called miſerable comforters.</q> Theſe profeſſors ſaid, The outward body was the body of death and ſin. I diſcovered their miſtake in that alſo, ſhewing them, <q>That Adam and Eve had each of them an outward body, before the body of death and ſin got into them; and that man and woman will have bodies, when the body of ſin and death is put off again; when they are renewed up into the image of God again by Chriſt Jeſus, which they were in before they fell.</q> They ceaſed at that time from oppoſing, and glorious meetings we had in the Lord's power.</p>
                  <p>Then paſſed we to Hexam, where we had a great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing atop of an hill. The prieſt threatened he would come and oppoſe us, but he came not; ſo all was quiet: And <q>the everlaſting day and renowned truth of the everliving God was ſounded over thoſe dark countries, and his Son exalted over all. It was proclaimed amongſt the people, that the day was now come, wherein all that made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Son of God, might receive him; and that to as many as would receive him, he would give power to become the ſons of God, as he had done to me.</q> It was further declared, <q>That he who had the Son of God, had life eternal; but he that had not the Son of God (though he profeſſed all the ſcriptures, from the firſt of Geneſis to the laſt of the Revelations) had no life.</q> So after all were directed to the light of Chriſt, by which they might ſee him, receive him, and know where their true teacher was, and the everlaſting truth had been largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared amongſt them, we paſſed through Hexam peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and came into Gil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>land, a country noted for thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Here a friend ſpying the prieſt, went to ſpeak to him; wherenpon he came to our inn, and the town's-people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about us. The prieſt ſaid, He would prove us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>vers out of the bible, but could find no ſcripture for his purpoſe. Then he went into the inn, and after awhile came out again, and brought ſome broken ſentences of ſcripture,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:037441_0224_100D8F2B9E6186E0"/>that mention the doctrines and commandments of men, &amp;c. and Touch not. Taſte not. &amp;c. for they periſh with the uſing. All which, poor man! was his own condition; whereas we were perſecuted becauſe we would not taſte, nor touch, nor handle their doctrines and traditions which we knew periſhed with uſing. I aſked him, What he called the ſteeple-houſe? 'Oh,' ſaid he, <q>the dreadful houſe of God, the temple of God.</q> I ſhewed him, and the poor, dark people, <q>That their bodies ſhould be the temples of God, and that Chriſt never commanded theſe temples, but ended that temple at Jeruſalem which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</q> While I was ſpeaking, the prieſt got away: and afterwards the people made as if they feared we would take their purſes, or ſteal their horſes; judging us like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are naturally given to thieving.</p>
                  <p>The next day we came into Cumberland again, where we had a general meeting of thouſands of people atop of an hill near Langlands. A glorious and heavenly meeting it was; for the glory of the Lord did ſhine over all; and there were as many as one could well ſpeak over the multitude was ſo great. Their eyes were turned to Chriſt their teacher; and they came to ſit under their own vine; inſomuch that Francis Howgill, coming afterwards to viſit them, ſound they had no need of words; for they were ſitting under their teacher Chriſt Jeſus; in the ſenſe whereof he ſat down amongſt them, without ſpeaking any thing. A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement there was in Cumberland, Biſhoprick, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland. Weſtmoreland, Lancaſhire, and Yorkſhire; and the plants of God grew and flouriſhed, the heavenly rain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending. and God's glory ſhining upon them: many mouths were opened by the Lord to his praiſe; yea, to babes and ſucklings he ordained ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>After my releaſe from Carliſle priſon, I was moved to go to prieſt Wilkinſon's ſteeple-houſe again: and being got in before him, when he came, I was declaring the truth to the people, though they were but few; for the moſt and beſt of his hearers were turned to Chriſt's free teaching; and we had a meeting of friends hard-by, where Thomas Stubbs was declaring the word of life amongſt them. As ſoon as the prieſt came in he oppoſed me: and there we ſtaid moſt part of the day: for when I began, he oppoſed me ſo if any law was broken, he broke it. When his people would be haling me out, I manifeſted his fruits to be ſuch as Chriſt ſpake of, when he ſaid. <q>They ſhall hale you out of
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:037441_0225_100D8F2DCB618360"/>their ſynagogues:</q> and then he would be aſhamed, and they would let me alone. There did he ſtand, till it was almoſt night, jangling, and oppoſing me; and would not go to his dinner, for he thought to have wearied me out. But at laſt the Lord's power and truth came ſo over him, that he packed away with his people. When he was gone, I went to the meeting of friends, who were turned to the Lord, and eſtabliſhed by his power upon Chriſt, the rock and foundation of the true prophets and apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>About this time the prieſts and profeſſors fell to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying againſt us afreſh. They had ſaid long before, That we ſhould be deſtroyed within a month; after that, they prolonged the time to half a year: but that time being long expired, and we mightily increaſed in number, they now gave out, That we would eat out one another. For after meetings, many tender people, having a great way to go, tarried at friends houſes by the way, and ſometimes more than there were beds to lodge in; ſo that ſome have lain on the hay-mows: hereupon fear poſſeſſed the profeſſors and world's people. For they were afraid, that when we had eaten one another out, we would all come to be maintained by the pariſhes, and be chargeable to them. But after awhile, when they ſaw that the Lord bleſſed and increaſed friends, as he did Abraham, both in the field and in the baſket, at their goings forth and comings in, at their riſings up and lyings down, and that all things proſpered with them; then they ſaw the falſehood of all their prophecies againſt us; and that it was in vain to curſe where God had bleſſed. At the firſt convincement, when friends could not put off their hats to people, nor ſay You to a ſingle perſon, but Thou and Thee, or could not bow, nor uſe flattering words in ſalutations, nor go into the faſhions and cuſtoms of the world; many friends, that were tradeſmen, loſt their cuſtomers; for the people were ſhy of them, and would not trade with them; ſo that for a time ſome could hardly get money enough to buy bread. But afterwards, when people came to have experience of friends honeſty and faithfulneſs and found that their Yea was Yea, and their Nay was Nay; that they kept to a word in their dealings, and that they would not cozen and cheat them; but that if they ſent a child to their ſhops for any thing, they were as well uſed as if they had come themſelves; the lives and converſations of friends did preach, and reached to the witneſs of God in the people. Then things altered ſo, that all the inquiry
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:037441_0226_100D8F3094E3B3B8"/>was. <q>Where was a draper, or ſhopkeeper, or taylor, or ſhoemaker, or any other tradeſman, that was a Quaker?</q> Inſomuch that friends had more buſineſs than many of their neighbours; and if there was any trading, they had a great part of it. Then the envious profeſſors altered their note, and began to cry out. 'If we let theſe Quakers' one, they 'will take the trade of the nation out of our hands.' This hath been the Lord's doings to and for his people! which my deſire is, that all who profeſs his holy truth may be truly kept ſenſible of; and that all may be preſerved in and by his power and Spirit, faithful to God and man: firſt to God, in obeying him in all things; and then in doing unto all men that which is juſt and righteous, in all things that they have to do or deal with them in: that the Lord God may be glorified in their practiſing truth, holineſs, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and righteouſneſs amongſt people, in their lives and converſations.</p>
                  <p>Friends being grown very numerous in the northern parts of this nation, and divers young convinced ones com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily in among us, I was moved of the Lord to write the following epiſtle, and ſend it amongſt them, for the ſlitting up the pure mind, and raiſing an holy care and watchfulneſs in them over themſelves, and one another, for the honour of truth.</p>

                  <p>While friends abode in the northern parts, a prieſt of Wrexham in Wales, named Morgan Floyd, having heard reports concerning us, ſent two of his congregation into the north to inquire concerning us, to try us, and bring him an account of us. When theſe triers came amongſt us, the power of the Lord ſeized on them, and they were both convinced of the truth. So they ſtaid ſome time with us, and then returned to Wales; where afterwards one of them departed from his convincement; but the other named John-ap-John, abode in the truth, and received a part of the miniſtry, in which he continued faithful.</p>
                  <p>Now were the prieſts greatly diſturbed at Newcaſtle, Kendal, and in moſt of the northern counties. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Gilpin, who had ſometimes come amongſt us at Kendal, and ſoon ran out from the truth into vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; they made what evil uſe they could of him againſt us; but the Lord's power confounded them all. And the Lord God cut off two of thoſe perſecuting juſtices at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle; and the other, after a time, was turned out of his place, and left the town.</p>

And the Lord's power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him out of the hands of the papiſts, though many times he was in great danger of the inquiſition.

We paſſed through Haliſax, a rude town of profeſſors, and came to Thomas Taylor's, who had been a captain, where we met with ſome janglers: but the Lord's power was over all; for I travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the motion of God's power. When I came to Synde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-hill-green, there was a mighty meeting; ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of people, as it was judged, and many perſons of note were there, captains, and other officers; and there was a general convincement; for the Lord's power and truth was ſet over all, and there was no oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>About this time did the Lord move upon the ſpirits of many whom he had raiſed up, and ſent forth to labour in his vineyard, to travel ſouthwards, and ſpread themſelves in the ſervice of the goſpel to the eaſtern, ſouthern, and weſtern parts of the nation: Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough to London; John Camin and John Audland to Briſtol; Richard Hubberthorn and George Whitehead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Norwich; Thomas Holmes into Wales, and many others different ways: for above ſixty miniſters had the Lord raiſed up, and did now ſend abroad out of the north country. The ſenſe of their ſervice being very weighty upon me, I was moved to give forth the following paper:</p>

                        <p>ALL friends every where, Know the Seed of God, which bruiſeth the ſeed of the ſerpent, and is atop of the ſeed of the ſerpent; which Seed ſins not, but bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſerpent's head that doth ſin, and tempts to ſin: which Seed God's promiſe and bleſſing is to; and which is one in the male and in the female. Where it is head, and hath bruiſed the head of the other, to the beginning you are come; and the younger is known, and he that is ſervant to the younger; and the promiſe of God, which is to the Seed, is fulfilled and fulfilling; and the ſcriptures come to be opened and owned; and the fleſh of Chriſt
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:037441_0230_100D8F38DABB0098"/>known, who took upon him the ſeed of Abraham accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh; the everlaſting prieſthood known, and everlaſting covenant. Chriſt takes upon him the ſeed of Abraham, and is a prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck; without father, without mother, without beginning of days or end of life: this is the prieſt that ever lives; the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life, light, and peace. The everlaſting offering here is known once for all, which offering overthrows that nature which offered; out of which the prieſthood aroſe, that could not continue by reaſon of death. And here is the other offering known, the everlaſting offering; which perfects for ever them that are ſanctified: which offering blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, triumphs over them, and aſcends above all principalities and powers. He that hath the Spirit of Jeſus, ſees this; and here is the love of God received, that doth not rejoice in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but leads to repent of it. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, friends every where ſcattered abroad, Know the power of God in one another, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice; for then you rejoice in the croſs of Chriſt, who is not of the world; which croſs is the power of God to all them that are ſaved. You, that know and feel the power, you feel the croſs of Chriſt, you feel the goſpel, which is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. He that believes in the light, believes in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, in the one offering, comes to the life of the prophets and Moſes, comes to ſee Chriſt the hope, the myſtery, which hope periſheth not; lets you ſee the hope that periſheth, which is not that myſtery: and the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that periſhing hope fades. Where this never-failing hope is witneſſed, the Lord comes to be ſanctified in the heart, and you come to the beginning, to Chriſt the hope, which periſheth not; but the other hope, the other expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation periſheth. So all of you, know the periſhing of the other, and the failing of the expectation therein; and know that which periſheth not: that you may be ready to give a reaſon of this hope with meekneſs and fear, to every man that aſketh you. Chriſt the hope, the myſtery, periſheth not; the end of all periſhing things, the end of all changeable things, the end of the decaying covenant, the end of that which waxeth old; the end of the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of Moſes, and of the prophets; the righteouſneſs of God. Chriſt Jeſus the Son: his throne ye will know, heirs with him ye will be; who makes his children kings
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:037441_0231_100D8F3A6A6BF858"/>and prieſts to him, and brings them to know his throne, and his power. There is no juſtification out of the light, out of Chriſt; juſtification is in the light, in Chriſt. Here is the doer of the will of God; here is the entering into the kingdom. He that believes in the light, becomes a child of light; and here the wiſdom is received, that is juſtified of her children. Here believing in the light, you ſhall not abide in darkneſs; but ſhall have the light of life; and come every one to witneſs the light that ſhines in your hearts, which will give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. With this light you will ſee him reign, who is the prince of life and peace; which light turns from him that is out of the truth, and abode not in it; where the true peace is not.</p>
                        <p>Friends. Be not haſty: for he that believes in the light, makes not haſte. Here the grace is received, by which you come to be ſaved; the election is known, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the promiſe; the will is ſeen, that wills; the mind is known. that runs, which obtains not; but ſtops and dulls. Now, that with the light being ſeen, and judged, and ſtopped, the patience is here known, which obtains the crown; and the immortality is brought to light. So all who act contrary to the light, and do not believe in it, do not come to juſtification. And all friends, if you go from the light, from wanting to have the promiſe of God fulfilled to the Seed, whereby you may know Chriſt reign, you thereby bring on yourſelves changeable garments, and come to wear the changeable garments, and the ſtrange fleſh, which leads to adultery, which the law goes upon; which ſhuts out of the kingdom: and out of this will doth proceed the work or building that is for the fire; whereby you may come to ſuffer loſs. Therefore love the light, which doth condemn that; and receive the power from the Lord, with which you ſtand over that, and condemn it; feeling and ſeeing that which gives you victory over the world, and to ſee out of time, to before time. Again, friends, Know Abraham, that muſt obey the voice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, that bears ſeed; which caſts forth the bond-woman and her ſon. Do not go forth, there will the wildneſs lodge. Know that which bears the wild ſon, and its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is not Sarah; for the promiſe is to the Seed, not of many, but one; which ſeed is Chriſt: and this ſeed now you come to witneſs ſtands on the top of all,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:037441_0232_100D8F3C00C5C4E8"/>yea, on the head of the ſerpent. And ſo all, as I ſaid before, who come to feel and witneſs this, come to the beginning: and this to all the ſeed of God, the church, that it you may all come to know, where there is no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, nor ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing. This is that which is purchaſed by the blood of Jeſus, and to the Father preſented out of all that defiles; which is the pillar and ground of truth. None attain to this, but ſuch who come to the light of Chriſt, who purchaſed this church. They who go from the light, are ſhut out and condemned, though they profeſs all the ſcriptures declared from it. Therefore walk in the light, that you may have fellowſhip with the Son, and with the Father; and come all to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his image, his power, and his law, which is his light, that hath converted your ſouls, and brought them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the higher power, above that which is out of the truth: that you may know here the mercy and truth, and the faith that works by love, which Chriſt is the author of; who lighteth every one of you: which faith gives the victory. That which gives the victory, is perfect; and that which the miniſters of God received from God, is that which is perfect; and that which they are to miniſter, is for the perfecting of the ſaints; till they all come in the unity of the faith unto a perfect man. This is the word of the Lord to you all: Every one in the meaſure of life wait. that with it all your minds may be guided up to the Father of life, the Father of ſpirits: to receive power from him, and wiſdom, that with it you may be ordered to his glory: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>o whom be all glory for ever! All keep in the light and life, that judgeth down that which is contrary to the light and life. So the Lord God Almighty be with you all. And keep your meetings every-where, being guided by that of God; by that you may ſee the Lord among you, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; that men who are come into the world might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. He that believeth not, the light condemns him he that believeth, cometh out of condemnation. This light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, which they that hate it ſtumble at, is the light of men.</p>
                        <p>All friends that ſpeak in publick, ſee that it be in the life of God; for that begets to God; the fruits of that ſhall never wither. This ſows to the Spirit which is in priſon, and of the Spirit reaps life; and the other ſows to the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:037441_0233_100D8F3EAF1AC6E0"/>fleſh, and of the fleſh reaps corruption. This you may ſee all the world over amongſt theſe ſeeds-men, what may be reaped in the field, that is the world. Therefore in the Spirit of the Lord wait, which cuts down and caſts out all this, the root and branches of it. So in that wait to receive power, and the Lord God Almighty preſerve you in it; whereby you may come to ſeel the light, that comprehends time and the world, and fathoms it: which, believed in, gives you victory over the world. Here the power of the Lord is received, which ſubdues all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and puts off the garments that will ſtain and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. With this light you come to reach the light in every man, which Chriſt enlightens every man that cometh into the world withal; and here the things of Chriſt come to be known, and the voice of Chriſt heard. Therefore keep in the light, the covenant of peace; and walk in the covenant of life. There is that which maketh merry over the witneſs of God, and there is that which maketh merry in the Lord; which rejoiceth over that which hath made merry over it: of that take notice, you who be in the light. Such the Lord doth beautify, whoſe truſt is in his ſtrength; and the Lord doth ſee ſuch, and them that are in his light. But ſuch as be from the light, whoſe eyes are after their abominations and idols, their eyes are to be blinded, their beautiful idols and their abominations to be deſtroyed, and by the light condemned, which they have made from the life in their own ſtrength: which with the light is ſeen, and overthrown by the power of God. <q>If you can change my covenant,</q> faith the Lord, <q>which keeps the day in its ſeaſon, and the night in its ſeaſon (mark, my covenant, the light) if you can change this, then may you change the covenant of God with his ſeed.</q> So all friends that are turned to the light which cometh from him by whom the world was made, who was before it was made, Chriſt Jeſus, the Saviour of your ſouls, abide in the light, and you will ſee your ſalvation to be walls and bulwarks againſt that which the light diſcovers to be contrary to it. Waiting in the light you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the power of God, which is the goſpel of peace, that you may be ſhod with it. Know that in one another which raiſeth up the ſeed of God, ſets it over the world and the earth, and cruciſies the affections and luſts: then the truth comes to reign, which is the guide.</p>

About this time Rice Jones of Nottingham (who had been a Baptiſt and was turned Ranter) and his company began to propheſy againſt me, giving out. That I was then at the higheſt, and after that time I ſhould fall down as faſt. He ſent a bundle of railing papers from Nottingham to Mansfield, Clauſon, and the towns thereabouts, judging friends for declaring the truth in the markets and in the ſteeple-houſes; which papers I anſwered. But their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies came upon themſelves; for ſoon after they fell to pieces, and many of his followers became friends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo. And through the Lord's bleſſed power truth and friends have increaſed, and do increaſe in the increaſe of God; and I by the ſame power have been and am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and kept in the everlaſting ſeed that never fell nor changes. But Rice Jones took the oaths that were put to him, and ſo diſobeyed the command of Chriſt. Many ſuch falſe prophets have riſen up againſt me, but the Lord hath blaſted them, and will blaſt all who riſe againſt the bleſſed ſeed, and me in that. My confidence is in the Lord; for whoſoever did, I ſaw their end, and how the Lord would confound them before he ſent me forth.</p>
                  <p>I was now at Synder-hill-green, where I had a large meeting in the day-time, and another at night in Thomas Stacy's houſe; for the people came from far and could not ſoon depart. The high ſheriff of the county told captain Bradford he intended to come up, with half a dozen of his troopers, to the meeting; but the Lord prevented him. When I had ſtaid ſome meetings thereabouts, I travelled up and down in Yorkſhire as far as Holderneſs, and to the Land's-end that way, viſiting friends and the churches of Chriſt; which were ſinely ſettled under his teaching. At length I reached captain Bradford's houſe, whither many Ranters came from York to wrangle; but they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Thither came ſhe called the lady Montague; who was then convinced, and lived and died in the truth.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to Thomas Taylor's within three miles of Halifax, where was a meeting of about two hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; amongſt which were many rude perſons, and divers butchers, who had bound themſelves with an oath before they came out, that they would kill me (as I was told): one of thoſe butchers had been accuſed for killing a man and a woman. They came in a very rude manner, and made a great diſturbance in the meeting, which being in a cloſe, Thomas Taylor ſtood up and ſaid to them, <q>If you
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:037441_0235_100D8F42E812F110"/>will be civil, you may ſtay; but if not, I charge you to be gone from off my ground.</q> But they grew worſe, and ſaid they would make it like a common; and they yelled and made a noiſe as if they had been at a bear-baiting. They thruſt friends up and down, who being peaceable, the Lord's power came over them. Several times they puſh'd me off from the place I ſtood on, by the crowding of the people together againſt me; but ſtill I was moved of the Lord to ſtand up again as I was thruſt down. At laſt I was moved of the Lord to ſay to them, <q>If they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the things of God, let them come up to me one by one; and if they had any thing to object, I would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them all, one after another;</q> but they were all ſilent, and had nothing to ſay: and then the Lord's power came ſo over them all, and anſwered the divine witneſs in them, that they were bound by the power of God, and a glorious powerful meeting we had, and the minds of the people were turned by the holy Spirit in them to God, and to Chriſt their teacher. The powerful word of life was largely declared that day, and in the life and power of God we broke up our meeting; and that rude company went their way to Halifax. The people aſked them, <q>Why they did not kill me, according to the oath they had ſworn?</q> They maliciouſly anſwered, <q>I had ſo bewitched them they could not do it.</q> Thus was the devil chained at that time. Friends told me, they uſed to come at other times and be very rude, and ſometimes break their ſeats and make frightful work amongſt them; but the Lord's power had now bound them. Shortly after, this butcher, that had been accuſed of killing a man and a woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and who was one of thoſe that had bound himſelf by an oath to kill me, killed another man, and was thereupon ſent to York gaol. Another of thoſe rude butchers, who had alſo ſworn to kill me, having accuſtomed himſelf to thruſt his tongue out of his mouth in deriſion of friends when they paſſed by him, had his tongue ſo ſwollen out of his month that he could never draw it in again, but died ſo. Several ſtrange and ſudden judgments came upon many of theſe conſpirators againſt me, which would be too large to declare here. God's vengeance from heaven came upon the blood-thirſty, who ſoughe after blood; for all ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits I laid before the Lord, and left him to deal with them, who is ſtronger than all, in whoſe power I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and carried on to do his work. The Lord hath
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037441_0236_100D8F455F0FC070"/>raiſed a fine people in thoſe parts, whom he hath drawn to Chriſt, and gathered in his name; who feel Chriſt amongſt them, and ſit under his teaching.</p>
                  <p>After this I came to Balby; from whence ſeveral friends accompanied me into Lincolnſhire, of whom ſome went to the ſteeple-houſe, and ſome to private meetings. There came to the meeting where I was, the ſheriff of Lincoln, and ſeveral with him; who made great contention and jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling for a time: but at length the Lord's power ſtruck him, that he was convinced of the truth, and received the word of life, as did ſeveral others alſo who had oppoſed, and continued amongſt friends till they died. Great meetings there were, and a large convincement in thoſe parts. Many were turned to the Lord Jeſus, and came to ſit under his teaching, leaving their prieſts and their ſuperſtitious ways; and the day of the Lord flouriſhed over all amongſt them that came to our meetings in that country. One called Sir Richard Wrey was convinced; alſo his brother and his brother's wife, who abode in the truth and died therein; though he afterwards ran out.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited thoſe countries, I came into Derbyſhire; the ſheriff of Lincoln, who was lately convinced, being with me. In one meeting we had ſome oppoſition; but the Lord's glorious power gave dominion over all. At night came a company of bailiffs and ſerving-men, and called me out. I went out to them, having ſome friends with me. They were exceeding rude and violent; for they had, it ſeems, plotted together, and intended to have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me away with them in the dark of the evening by force, to have done me a miſchief; but the Lord's power chained them, ſo that they could not effect their deſign; and at laſt they went away. The next day Thomas Aldam, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſerving-men belonged to a knight, who lived not far off, went to his houſe and laid before him the bad carriage of his ſervants. The knight rebuked them, and did not allow of their evil behaviour towards us.</p>
                  <p>After this we came to Skegby, in Nottinghamſhire, where we had a great meeting of divers ſorts; and the Lord's power went over them, and all was quiet. The people were turned to the Spirit of God, by which many came to receive his power, and to ſit under the teaching of Chriſt, their Saviour. A great people the Lord hath in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed towards Kidſley-park, where came many Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037441_0237_100D8F47D7EC09E8"/>but the Lord's power check'd them. From thence I went into the Peak-country to Thomas Hammerſley's where came the Ranters of that country, and many high profeſſors. The Ranters oppoſed me, and fell a ſwearing. When I reproved them for ſwearing, they would bring ſcripture for it, alledging Abraham, Jacob, and Joſeph ſwore; and the prieſts, Moſes, the prophets, and the angels ſwore. <q>I confeſſed all theſe did ſo, as the ſcripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; but ſaid I. Chriſt (who ſaid, Before Abraham was I am) commanded, Swear not at all. Chriſt ends the prophets, the old prieſthood, the diſpenſation of Moſes, and reigns over the houſe of Jacob and Joſeph; and he ſays, Swear not at all. And God, when he bringeth the firſt-begotten into the world, ſaith, Let all the angels of God worſhip him, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaith. Swear not at all. As for the plea that men make for ſwearing to end their ſtrife, Chriſt, who ſays. Swear not at all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the devil and his works, who is the author of ſtrife; for that is one of his works. And God ſaid, <q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</q> So the Son is to be heard who forbids ſwearing. And the apoſtle James, who did hear the Son of God, followed him, and preached him, forbids all oaths, James v. 12.</q> So the Lord's power went over them: and his Son and his doctrine was ſet over them. The word of life was fully and richly preached, and many were convinced that day. This Thomas Hammerſly being ſummoned to ſerve upon a jury, was admitted to ſerve without an oath; and being foreman of the jury, when he brought in the verdict, the judge declared, <q>That he had been a judge ſo many years, but never heard a more upright verdict than that Quaker had then brought in.</q> Much might be written of things of this nature, which time would fail to declare. But the Lord's bleſſed power and truth was exalted over all, who is worthy of all praiſe and glory for ever!</p>
                  <p>Travelling through Derbyſhire. I viſited friends till I came to Swanington, in Leiceſterſhire, where was a general meeting, to which many Ranters, Baptiſts, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors came: for great conteſts there had been with them, and with the prieſts in that town. To this meeting ſeveral friends came from divers parts; John Audland. Francis Howgill, Edward Pyot from Briſtol, and Edward Burrough from London; and ſeveral were convinced in thoſe parts.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:037441_0238_100D8F49F7276280"/>The Ranters made a diſturbance, and were very rude; but at laſt the Lord's power came over them, and they were confounded. The next day Jacob Bottomly, a great Ranter, came from Leiceſter; but the Lord's power ſtopt him, and came over them all. There came a prieſt too; but he alſo was confounded by the mighty power of the Lord. About this time the prieſts, Baptiſts, Ranters, and other profeſſors were very rude, and ſtirred up rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt us. We ſent to the Ranters to come forth, and try their god. Abundance of them came, who ſung, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and danced; but the Lord's power ſo prevailed over them that many of them were convinced.</p>
                  <p>After this I went to Twycroſs, whither came ſome Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who ſung and danced before me; but I was moved in the dread of the Lord to reprove them: and the Lord's power came over them, ſo that ſome of them were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and received the Spirit of God; who are become a pretty people, living and walking ſoberly in the truth of Chriſt. I went to Anthony Brickley's, in Warwickſhire, where there was a great meeting; ſeveral Baptiſts and others came and jangled: but the Lord's power came over them.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to Drayton, in Leiceſterſhire, to viſit my relations. As ſoon as I was come in, Nathaniel Stephens, the prieſt, having got another prieſt, and given notice to the country, ſent to me to come to them; for they could not do any thing till I came. I, having been three years away from my relations, knew nothing of their deſign. But at laſt I went into the ſteeple-houſe yard, where the two prieſts were; and they had gathered abundance of people. They would have had me gone into the ſteeple-houſe. I aſked them, what I ſhould do there? They ſaid, Mr. Stephens could not bear the cold. I told them, he might bear it as well as I. At laſt we went into a great hall, Richard Farnſworth being with me; and a great diſpute we had with theſe prieſts concerning their practice, how contraty they were to Chriſt and his apoſtles. The prieſts would know where tithes were forbidden or ended. I ſhewed them out of the ſeventh chapter to the Hebrews, <q>That not only tithes, but the prieſthood that took tithes, was ended; and the law was ended and diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by which the prieſthood was made, and tithes were commanded to be paid.</q> Then they ſtirred up the people to ſome lightneſs and rudeneſs. I had known Stephens from a child, therefore I laid open his condition and the
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:037441_0239_100D8F4B8D030630"/>manner of his preaching: <q>and how he, like the reſt of the prieſts, did apply the promiſes to the firſt birth which muſt die. But I ſhewed that the promiſes were to the ſeed, not to many ſeeds, but to the one ſeed, Chriſt; who was one in male and female: for all were to be born again, before they could enter into the kingdom of God.</q> Then he ſaid, I muſt not judge ſo. I told him, <q>He that was ſpiritual judged all things.</q> Then he confeſſed, That was a full ſcripture; But, neighbours, ſaid he, this is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; GEORGE FOX is come to the light of the ſun, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> he thinks to put out my ſtar-light. I told him, <q>I would not quench the leaſt meaſure of God in any, much leſs put out his ſtar-light, if it were true light from the morning-ſtar. But I told him, if he had any thing from Chriſt, he ought to ſpeak it freely, and not take tither from the people for preaching; ſeeing Chriſt commanded his miniſters to give freely, as they had received freely.</q> So I charged him to preach no more for tithes or any hire. But he ſaid, he would not yield-to that. After awhile the people began to be vain and rude, whereupon we broke up; yet ſome were made loving to the truth that day. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, I told them. <q>If the Lord would, I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be at the town again that day ſeven-night.</q> In the interim I went into the country, had meetings, and came again that day ſeven-night. Againſt that time this prieſt had got ſeven prieſts to help him; for he had given notice at a lecture on a market-day at Adderſton, that ſuch a day there would be a meeting and a diſpute with me. I knew nothing of it; but only had ſaid I ſhould be in town that day ſeven-night again. Theſe eight prieſts had gathered ſeveral hundreds of people, even moſt of the country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and would have had me into the ſteeple-houſe. I refuſed to go in, and got on a hill, and there ſpoke to them and the people. Thomas Taylor, James Parnel, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other friends were with me. The prieſts thought that day to have trampled down truth; but the truth came over them. Then they grew light and the people rude. The prieſts would not ſtand trial with me; but would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending here and there a little with one friend or other. At laſt one of the prieſts brought his ſon to diſpute with me; but his mouth was ſoon ſtopt. When he could not tell how to anſwer, he would aſk his father, and his father was confounded alſo when he came to anſwer for his ſon. So after they had toiled themſelves, they went in a rage to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:037441_0240_100D8F4DBA1867F0"/>prieſt Stephens's houſe to drink. As they went away I ſaid, <q>I never came to a place where ſo many prieſts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not ſtand the trial with me.</q> Whereupon they and ſome of their wives came about me, laid hold of me, and fawningly ſaid, <q>What might I have been, if it had not been for the Quakers?</q> Then they fell a puſhing of friends to and fro, to thruſt them from me, and to pluck me to themſelves. After awhile ſeveral luſty fellows came, took me up in their arms, and carried me into the ſteeple-houſe porch, intending to have carried me into the ſteeple-houſe by force; but the door being locked, they fell down on an heap, having me under them. As ſoon as I could I got from them to my hill again: then they got me from that place, took me to the ſteeple-houſe wall, and ſet me on a baſs like a ſtool; and all the prieſts, being come back, ſtood under with the people. The prieſs cried, Come, to argument, to argument. I ſaid, <q>I denied all their voices, for they were the voices of hirelings and ſtrangers.</q> They cried, Prove it, prove it. I directed them to the tenth of John, where they might ſee what Chriſt ſaid of ſuch; he declared, <q>He was the true Shepherd that laid down his life for his ſheep, and his ſheep heard his voice and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; but the hireling would fly when the wolf came, becauſe he was an hireling.</q> I offered to prove that they were ſuch hirelings. Then the prieſts plucked me off from the baſs again, and themſelves got all upon baſſes under the ſteeple-houſe wall. Then I felt the mighty power of God ariſe over all, and told them, <q>If they would give audience, and hear me quietly, I would ſhew them by the ſcriptures why I denied thoſe eight prieſts or teachers that ſtood before me, and all the hireling teachers of the world whatſoever, and I would give them ſcriptures for what I ſaid.</q> Whereupon both prieſts and people conſented. Then I ſhewed them out of Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Fzekſel, Micah, Malachi, and other prophets, that they were in the ſteps of ſuch as God ſent his true prophets to cry againſt; for, ſaid I. <q>You are ſuch as the prophet Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah cried againſt, chap. v. when he ſaid, <q>The prophets propheſy falſely, and the prieſts bear rule by their means;</q> which he called an horrible filthy thing. You are ſuch as uſed their tongues, and ſaid. Thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord never ſpoke to them. Such as followed their own ſpirits, and ſaw nothing; but ſpoke a divination of their own brain: and by their lies and their lightneſs
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:037441_0241_100D8F50328D77A0"/>cauſed the people to err, Jer. xiv. You are ſuch as they were that ſought their gain from their quarter; that were as greedy dumb dogs, that could never have enough, whom the Lord ſent his prophet Iſaiah to cry againſt, Iſa. lvi. You are ſuch as they were who taught for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, who ſewed pillows under people's arm-holes, that they might lie ſoft in their ſins. Ezek. xiii. You are ſuch as they that taught for the fleece and the wool, and made a prey of the people, Ezek. xxxiv. But the Lord is gathering his ſheep from your mouths, and from your barren mountain; and is bringing them to Chriſt, the one ſhepherd, whom he hath ſet over his flocks; as by his prophet Ezekiel he then declared he would do. You are ſuch as thoſe that divined for money, and preached for hire; and if a man did not put into their, mouths they prepared war againſt him, as the prophet Micah complained, chap. iii.</q> Thus I went through the prophets too largely to be here repeated. Then coming to the New Teſtament, I ſhewed from thence, that <q>that they were like the chief prieſts, ſcribes, and phariſees, whom Chriſt cried wo againſt, Matth. xxiii. And that they were ſuch falſe apoſtles as the true apoſtles cried againſt, ſuch as taught for filthy lucre; ſuch antichriſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers as they cried againſt, that minded earthly things, and ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: for they that ſerved Chriſt gave freely and preached freely, as he commanded them. But they that will not preach without hire, tithes, or outward means, ſerve their own bellies, and not Chriſt; and through the good words of the ſcriptures, and feigned words of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>n, they made merchandize of the people then, as (ſaid I) ye do now. When I had largely quoted the ſcriptures, and ſhewed them wherein they were like the phariſees, loving to be called of men maſters, to go in long robes, to ſtand praying in the ſynagogues, to have the uppermoſt rooms at feaſts and the like; and when I had thrown them out in the ſight to the people amongſt the falſe prophets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, ſcribes, and phariſees, and ſhewed at large how ſuch as they were judged and condemned by the true prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſstles, I directed them to the light of Jeſus, who enlightens every man that cometh into the world; that by it they might ſee whether theſe things were not true as had been ſpoken.</q> When I appealed to that of God in their conſciences, the light of Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:037441_0242_100D8F52C2BD85D8"/>in them, they could not abide to hear it; they were all quiet till then; but then a profeſſor ſaid, George, what! wilt thou never have done? I told him, I ſhould have done ſhortly. I went on a little longer, and cleared myſelf of them in the Lord's power. When I had done, all the prieſts and people ſtood ſilent for a time; at laſt one of the prieſts ſaid, They would read the ſcriptures that. I had quoted. I told them, with all my heart. They began to read the twenty-third of Jeremiah, where they ſaw the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rks of the falſe prophets that he cried againſt. When the had read a verſe or two, I ſaid, Take notice, people; but the prieſts ſaid, Hold thy tongue, George. I bid them read the whole chapter throughout. for it was all againſt them. Then they ſtopt, and would read no further; but aſked me a queſtion. I told them I would anſwer their queſtion the matter being firſt granted that I had charged them with, viz that they were falſe prophets, falſe teachers, antichriſts, and deceivers, ſuch as the true prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles cried againſt. A profeſſor ſaid Nay to that; but I ſaid, <q>Yea: for you leaving the matter, and going to another thing, ſeem to conſent to the proof of the former charge.</q> Then I anſwered their queſtion, which was this; <q>Seeing thoſe falſe prophets were adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, Whether I did judge prieſt Stephens to be an adulterer?</q> To which I anſwered, <q>He was adulterated from God in his practice, like thoſe falſe prophets and the Jews.</q> They would not ſtand to vindicate him, but broke up the meeting. Then the prieſts whiſpered together; and Stephens came to me, and deſired that my father, brother, and I might go aſide with him, that he might ſpeak to me in private, and the reſt of the prieſts ſhould keep the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from coming to us. I was very loth to go aſide with him; but the people cried, <q>Go, George; do, George, go aſide with him.</q> Being afraid, if I did not go, they would ſay I was diſobedient to my parents, I went, and the reſt of the prieſts were to keep the people off; but they could not, for the people, being willing to hear, drew cloſe to us. I aſked the prieſt, what he had to ſay? He ſaid, <q>If he was out of the way I ſhould pray for him, and if I was out of the way he would pray for me; and he would give me a form of words to pray for him by?</q> I replied, <q>It ſeems thou doſt not know whether thou beeſt in the right way or no; neither doſt thou know whether I am in the right way or no; but I know that I am in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037441_0243_100D8F54561682B0"/>way. Chriſt Jeſus, which thou art out of. Thou wouldſt give me a form of words to pray by yet thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt the Common Prayer Book to pray by as well as I, and I deny thy form of words as well as it. If thou wouldſt have me pray for thee by a form of words, is not this to deny the apoſtle's doctrine and practice of praying by the Spirit, as it gave words and utterance?</q> Here the people fell a laughing; but I was moved to ſpeak more to him. And when I had cleared myſelf to him and them we parted, after I had told them, that I ſhould, God willing, be in town that day ſeven-night again. So the prieſts pack'd away, and many people were convinced that day; for the Lord's power came over all. Many that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced before, were by that day's work confirmed in the truth, and abode in it: and a great ſhake it gave to the prieſts. Yea, my father, though a hearer and follower of the prieſt, was ſo well ſatisfied, that he ſtruck his cane up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and ſaid, <q>Truly I ſee, he that will but ſtand to the truth, it will bear him out.</q> I paſſed about in the country till that day ſeven-night, and then came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: for we had appointed a meeting at my relations houſe. Prieſt Stephens, having notice beforehand thereof, had got another prieſt to him. They had a company of troopers with them; and ſent for me to come to them. But I ſent them word, our meeting was appointed, and they might come to it if they would. The prieſts came not; but the troopers came, and many rude people. They had laid their plot, That the troopers ſhould take every one's name, and then command them to go home; and ſuch as would not go, they ſhould take, and carry away with them. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they began, and took ſeveral names, charging them to go home; but when they came to take my name, my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions told them I was at home already: ſo they could not take me away that time. Nevertheleſs they took my name; but the Lord's power was over them, and they went away, both profeſſors and troopers, croſſed and vexed becauſe they had not their ends. But ſeveral were convinced that day, and admired the love and power of God. This was that prieſt Stephens, who once ſaid of me, <q>Never ſuch a plant was bred in England:</q> yet afterwards he reported, <q>That I was carried up into the clouds, and found again full of gold and ſilver;</q> and many falſe reports he raiſed on me, but the Lord ſwept them all away. The reaſon why I would not go into their ſteeple-houſe was, becauſe I
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:037441_0244_100D8F55F14E21A0"/>was to bear my teſtimony againſt it, and to bring all off from ſuch places to the Spirit of God; that they might know their bodies to be the temples of the Holy Ghoſt; and to bring them off from all the hireling teachers to Chriſt, their free teacher, who died for them, and purchaſed them with his blood.</p>
                  <p>After this I went into the country, had ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and came to Swanington, where the ſoldiers came; but the meeting was quiet, the Lord's power was over all, and the ſoldiers did not meddle. Then I went to Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and from Leiceſter to Whetſtone. There came about ſeventeen troopers of colonel Hacker's regiment, with his marſhal, and took me up before the meeting, though friends were beginning to gather together; for there were ſeveral friends from divers parts. I told the marſhal, <q>He might let all the friends go, I would anſwer for them all.</q> Whereupon he took me, and let all the friends go; only Alexander Parker went along with me. At night they had me before colonel Hacker, his major, and captains, a great company of them; and a great deal of diſcourſe we had about the prieſts, and about meetings; for at this time there was a noiſe of a plot againſt O. Cromwel. Much reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had with them about the light of Chriſt, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth every man that cometh into the world. Col. Hacker aſked, Whether it was not this light of Chriſt that made Judas betray his maſter, and after led him to hang himſelf? I told him, <q>No: that was the ſpirit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hated Chriſt and his light.</q> Then col. Hacker ſaid, I might go home, and keep at home; and not go abroad to meetings. I told him, <q>I was an innocent man, free from plots, and denied all ſuch work.</q> His ſon Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſaid, <q>Father, this man hath reigned too long; it is time to have him cut off.</q> I aſked him, <q>For what? What had I done? or whom had I wronged from a child? for I was bred and born in that country, and who could accuſe me of any evil from a child?</q> Col. Hacker aſked me again, If I would go home, and ſtay at home? I told him, <q>If I ſhould promiſe him ſo, it would manifeſt that I was guilty of ſomething, to make my home a priſon: and if I went to meetings, they would ſay I broke their order. Therefore I told them, I ſhould go to meetings, as the Lord ſhould order me; and could not ſubmit to their requirings: but I ſaid, we were a peaceable people.</q> 'Well then,' ſaid colonel Hacker, <q>I will ſend you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:037441_0245_100D8F597B479150"/>morning by ſix o'clock to my lord protector, by captain Drury, one of his life-guard.</q> That night I was kept priſoner at the Marſhalſea; and the next morning by the ſixth hour I was delivered to captain Drury. I deſired he would let me ſpeak with colonel Hacker before I went; and he had me to his bed-ſide. Colonel Hacker ſet upon me preſently again to go home, and keep no more meetings. I told him, <q>I could not ſubmit to that; but muſt have my liberty to ſerve God, and to go to meetings.</q> 'Then,' ſaid he, 'you muſt go before the protector.' Whereupon <q>I kneeled on his bed-ſide, and beſought the Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; for he was as Pilate, though he would waſh his hands; and when the day of his miſery and trial ſhould come upon him, I bid him, Then remember what I had ſaid to him.</q> But he was ſtirred up and ſet on by Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, and the other prieſts and profeſſors, wherein their envy and baſeneſs was manifeſt; who, when they could not overcome me by diſputes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arguments, not reſiſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord that was in me, they got ſoldiers to take me up.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, when colonel Hacker was impriſoned in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a day or two before his execution, he was, put in mind of what he had done againſt the innocent; and he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered it, and confeſſed it to Margaret Fell; ſaying, He knew well whom ſhe meant; and he had trouble upon him for it. So his ſon, who had told, his father I had reigned too long, and it was time to have me cut off, might obſerve how his father was cut off afterwards, he being hanged at Tyburn.</p>
                  <p>I was carried up priſoner by captain Drury from Leiceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and when we came to Harborough, he aſked me, If I would go home, and ſtay a fortnight? I ſhould have my liberty, he ſaid, if I would not go to nor keep meetings. I told him, I could not promiſe any ſuch thing. Several times upon the road did he aſk, and try me after the ſame manner; and ſtill I gave him the ſame anſwers. So he brought me to London, and lodged me at the Mermaid over againſt the Mews at Charing-Croſs. As we travelled, I was moved of the Lord to warn people at the inns and places, where I came, of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them. William Dewſbury and Marmaduke Storr being in priſon at Northampton, he let me go and viſit them.</p>
                  <p>After captain Drury had lodged me at the Mermaid, he
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:037441_0246_100D8F5B86CA8680"/>went to give the protector an account of me. When he came to me again, he told me, The prorector required that I ſhould promiſe not to take up a carnal ſword or weapon againſt him or the government, as it then was; and that I ſhould write it in what words I ſaw good, and ſet my hand to it. I ſaid little in reply to captain Drury. But the next morning I was moved of the Lord to write a paper <q>To the protector, by the name of Oliver Cromwel; wherein I did in the preſence of the Lord God declare, that I did deny the wearing or drawing of a carnal ſword, or any other outward weapon, againſt him or any man. And that I was ſent of God to ſtand a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all violence, and againſt the works of darkneſs; and to turn people from darkneſs to light; to bring them from the occaſion of war and fighting to the peaceable goſpel; and from being evil-doers, which the magiſtrates ſword ſhould be a terror to.</q> Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> I had written what the Lord had given me to write, I ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time captain Drury brought me before the protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or himſelf at Whitehall. It was in a morning, before he was dreſſed; and one Harvey, who had come a little among friends, but was diſobedient, waited upon him. When I came in, I was moved to ſay, <q>Peace be in this houſe: and I exhorted him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o keep in the fear of God, that he might receive wiſdom from him; that by it he might be ordered, and with it might order all things under his hand unto God's glory.</q> I ſpoke much to him of truth; and a great deal of diſcourſe I had with him about religion: wherein he carried himſelf very moderately. But he ſaid, We quarrelled with the prieſts, whom he called miniſters. I told him, <q>I did not quarrel with them, they quarrelled with me and my friends. But, ſaid I, if we own the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles, we cannot hold up ſuch teachers, prophets, and ſhepherds, as the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles declared againſt; but we muſt declare againſt them by the ſame power and Spirit. Then I ſhewed him, That the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles declared freely, and declared againſt them that did not declare freely; ſuch as preached for filthy lucre, divined for money, and preached for hire, and were covetous and greedy, like the dumb dogs that could never have enough: and that they, who have the ſame Spirit that Chriſt and the prophets, and the apoſtles had, could not but declare
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:037441_0247_100D8F5D1B303C50"/>againſt all ſuch now, as they did then.</q> As I ſpoke he ſeveral times ſaid, It was very good, and it was truth. <q>I told him, That all Chriſtendom (ſo called) had the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but they wanted the power and Spirit that thoſe had who gave forth the ſcriptures; and that was the reaſon they were not in fellowſhip with the Son, nor with the Father, nor with the ſcriptures, nor one with another.</q> Many more words I had with him; but people coming in, I drew a little back. As I was turning, he catched me by the hand, and with tears in his eyes, ſaid, Come again to <q>my houſe; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we ſhould be nearer one to the other;</q> adding, That he wiſhed me no more ill than he did to his own ſoul. I told him, <q>If he did, he wronged his own ſoul; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed him to hearken to God's voice, that he might ſtand in his counſel, and obey it; and if he did ſo, that would keep him from har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>art would be hardened.</q> He ſaid, It was true. Then I went out; and when captain Drury came out after me, he told me, His lord protector ſaid, I was at liberty, and might go whither I would. Then I was brought into a great hall, where the protector's gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were to dine. I aſked them, What they brought me thither for? They ſaid, It was by the protector's order, that I might dine with them. I bid them let the protector know, I would not eat of his bread, nor drink of his drink. When he heard this, he ſaid, <q>Now I ſee there is a people riſen, that I cannot win either with gifts, honours, offices or places; but all other ſects and people I can.</q> It was told him again, <q>That we had forſook our own; and were not like to look for ſuch things from him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being ſet at liberty, I went to the inn where captain Drury at firſt lodged me. This captain, though he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carried it fairly, was an enemy to me and to truth, and oppoſed it. When profeſſors came to me, while I was under his cuſtody, and he was by, he would ſcoff at trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and call us Quakers, as the Independents and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians had nicknamed us before. But afterwards he came and told me, That, as he was lying on his bed to reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the day-time, a ſudden trembling ſeized on him, that his joints knocked together; and his body ſhook ſo that he could not riſe from his bed: he was ſo ſhaken, that he had not ſtrength enough left to riſe. But he felt the power of the Lord was upon him; and he tumbled off his bed, and
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:037441_0248_100D8F5EC885EA50"/>cried to the Lord, and ſaid, He would never ſpeak againſt the Quakers more, ſuch as trembled at the word of God.</p>
                  <p>During the time I was priſoner at Charing-Croſs, there came abundance to ſee me, almoſt of all ſorts, prieſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, officers of the army, &amp;c. Once a company of officers being with me, deſired me to pray with them. I ſat ſtill, with my mind retired to the Lord. At laſt I felt the power and Spirit of God move in me; and the Lord's power did ſo ſhake and ſhatter them, that they wondered, though they did not live in it.</p>
                  <p>Among thoſe that came was colonel Packer, with ſeveral of his officers. While they were with me, came in one Cob. and a great company of Ranters with him. The Ranters began to call for drink and tobacco; but I deſired them to forbear it in my room, telling them, <q>If they had ſuch a mind to it, they might go into another room.</q> One of them cried, 'All is ours:' and another of them ſaid, 'All is well.' I replied, <q>How is all well, while thou art ſo peeviſh, envious, and crabbed?</q> for I ſaw he was of a peeviſh nature. I ſpake to their conditions, and they were ſenſible of it, and looked one upon another, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</p>
                  <p>Then colonel Packer began to talk with a light, chaffy mind, concerning God, Chriſt, and the ſcriptures: it was a great grief to my ſoul and ſpirit, when I heard him talk ſo lightly; ſo that I told him, <q>He was too light to talk of the things of God: for he did not know the ſolidity of a man.</q> Thereupon the officers raged, and ſaid, Would I ſay ſo of their colonel? Packer was a Baptiſt: he and the Ranters bowed and ſcraped to one another very much; for it was the manner of the Ranters to be exceeding compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, ſo that Packer bid them give over their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but I told them, <q>They were fit to go together, for they were both of one ſpirit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This colonel lived at Theobalds near Waltham, and was made a juſtice of peace. He ſet up a great meeting of the Baptiſts at Theobalds Park; for he and ſome other officers had purchaſed it. They were exceeding high, railed againſt friends and truth; and threatened to apprehend me with their warrants, if ever I came there. Yet after I was ſet at liberty, I was moved of the Lord to go to Theobalds, and appoint a meeting hard-by them; to which many of his people came, and divers of his hearers were convinced of the way of truth, received Chriſt the free teacher, and
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:037441_0249_100D8F60C39E6828"/>came off from the Baptiſt; which made him rage the more. But the Lord's power came over him ſo, that he was not able to meddle with me. Then I went to Waltham, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by him, and had a meeting there. The people were very rude, gathered about the houſe, and broke the windows. Whereupon I went out to them, with the bible in my hand, deſired them to come in; and told them, <q>I would ſhew them ſcripture both for our principles and practices.</q> When I had done ſo, I ſhewed them alſo <q>that their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were in the ſteps of ſuch as the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles cried againſt. I directed them to the light of Chriſt, the Spirit of God in their own hearts; that by it they might come to know their free teacher, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q> The meeting being ended, they went away quieted and ſatisfied; and a meeting hath ſince been ſettled in that town. But this was ſome time after I was ſet at liberty by O. Cromwel.</p>
                  <p>When I came from Whitehall to the Mermaid at Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Croſs, I ſtaid not long there: but went into the city of London, where we had great and powerful meetings; ſo great were the throngs of people, that I could hardly get to and from the meetings for the crowds; and the truth ſpread exceedingly. T. Aldam and R. Craven, who had been ſheriffs of Lincoln, and divers friends, came up to London after me: but A. Parker abode with me.</p>
                  <p>After awhile I went to Whitehall again, and was moved to declare <q>the day of the Lord amongſt them; and that the Lord was come to teach his people himſelf:</q> ſo I preached truth both to the officers, and to them that were called Oliver's gentlemen, who were of his guard. But a prieſt oppoſed, while I declared the word of the Lord amongſt them: for Oliver had ſeveral about him, of which this was his news-monger; an envious prieſt, a light, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, chaffy man. I bid him repent; and he put it in his news-paper the next week, that I had been at Whitehall, and had bid a godly miniſter there repent. When I went thither again, I met with him; and abundance of people gathered about me. I manifeſted the prieſt to be a liar in ſeveral things that he had affirmed; and he was put to ſilence. He put in the news, that I wore ſilver buttons; which was falſe; for they were but ochimy. Afterwards he put in the news, that I hung ribands on people's arms, which made them follow me. This was another of his lies; for I never uſed nor wore ribands in my life. Three
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:037441_0250_100D8F63AE903A20"/>friends went to examine this prieſt, that gave forth this falſe intelligence; and to know of him where he had that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? He ſaid, It was a woman that told him ſo; and if they would come again, he would tell them the woman's name. When they came again, he ſaid, It was a man, but would not tell them his name then; but if they would come again, he would tell them his name, and where he lived. They went the third time; and then he would not ſay who told him; but offered, if I would give it under my hand that there was no ſuch thing, he would put that into the news. Thereupon the friends carried it to him under my hand; but when they came, he broke his promiſe, and would not put it in: but was in a rage, and threatened them with the conſtable. This was the deceitful doing of this forger of lies: and theſe lies he ſpread over the nation in the news, to render truth odious, and to put evil into people's minds againſt friends and truth: of which a more large account may be ſeen in a book printed ſoon after this time, for the clearing of friends and truth from the ſlanders and falſe reports raiſed and caſt upon them. Theſe prieſts, the news-mongers, were of the independent ſect, like them in Leiceſter; but the Lord's power came over all their lies, and ſwept them away; and many came to ſee the naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe prieſts. The God of heaven earried me over all in his power, and his bleſſed power went over the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; inſomuch that many friends about this time were moved to go up and down, to found forth the everlaſting goſpel in moſt parts of this nation, and alſo in Scotland; and the glory of the Lord was felt over all to his everlaſting praiſe. A great convincement there was in London; ſome in the protector's houſe and family. I went to have ſeen him again, but could not get to him, the officers were grown ſo rude.</p>
                  <p>The Preſbyterians, Independents, and Baptiſts were greatly diſturbed; for many of their people turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſat down under his teachings, received his power, and felt it in their hearts; and then they were moved of the Lord to declare againſt the reſt of them.</p>
                  <p>I appointed a meeting in the fields near Acton, in which the word of life, the ſaving truth was declared ſreely. The Lord's power was eminently manifeſted, and his bleſſed day exalted over all.</p>
                  <p>About this time I was moved to write a paper, and ſend it among the profeſſors, on this wiſe:</p>

                        <p>ALL thoſe that profeſſed Jeſus Chriſt in words, and yet heard him not when he was come, ſaid, he was a deceiver and a devil. The chief prieſts called him ſo. The Jews ſaid, <q>He hath a devil and is mad; why do ye hear him?</q> But others ſaid, <q>Theſe are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</q> The Jews then doubted whether he was the Chriſt, or no. So all, like the Jews, in the knowledge, in the notion, that profeſs Chriſt without only, where he is riſen within, do not own him, but doubt of him; though Chriſt be the ſame now and for ever. He ſaid, <q>I and my Father are one; then the Jews took up ſtones to ſtone him;</q> and where Jeſus Chriſt is now ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually come and made manifeſt, ſuch as are chriſtians in outward profeſſion only, have the ſame hard hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly now as the Jews had then; and caſt ſtones at him, where he is riſen. Jeſus ſaid, <q>For which of theſe good works do ye ſtone me?</q> The Jews anſwered, <q>For thy good works we ſtone thee not; but for blaſphemy, in that thou being a man, makeſt thyſelf God.</q> Jeſus anſwered 'them, <q>Is it not written in your law, I ſaid you are gods? and the ſcripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the world, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God? The Jews ſaid to him, Say we not well, that thou haſt a devil? Jeſus anſwered, I honour my Father, and ye diſhonour me. And they that were in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue roſe up, and thruſt him out of the city; and took him up to the edge of the hill whereon their city was built, to caſt him down headlong. The Phariſees ſaid, He caſteth out devils by the prince of devils.</q> Chriſt was called a glutton and a wine-bibber; a friend of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners; but wiſdom is juſtified of her children. The officers, when the high-prieſts and Phariſees aſked them, "Why have ye not brought him?" ſaid <q>Never man ſpake like this man.</q> The Phariſees ſaid, <q>Are you alſo deceived? Do any of the rulers or of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees believe on him? but this people, which know not the law, are accurſed. Nicodemus ſaid unto them (he that came unto Jeſus by night) doth our law judge any man before it hear him?</q> When Stephen confeſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the ſubſtance of all figures and types, and was
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:037441_0252_100D8F67AE9041F0"/>brought before the chief prieſts to his trial, he told them, <q>The Moſt High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</q> and brought the prophets words to witneſs, and told them, They were ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, and always reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, as their fathers had done. Stephen was full of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſaid, He ſaw Jeſus; and they ran upon him, and ſtoned him to death, as he was calling upon the Lord. When Paul confeſſed Jeſus Chriſt, and his Reſurrection, Feſtus ſaid, He was mad. When Paul preached the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſome mocked. The Jews perſuaded the people, and they ſtoned him, and drew him out of the city, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had been dead. The Jews ſtirred up the Gentiles, to make their minds evil-affected towards the brethren. The Jews ſtirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief of the city: and raiſed perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coaſts: and there was an aſſault made both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to uſe them deſpitefully, and to ſtone them. In like manner all in the nature of thoſe Jews now, whoſe religion ſtands in notions, ſtir up the rulers and the ignorant people, and incenſe them againſt Jeſus Chriſt, to ſtone all with one conſent in whom he is riſen. This is, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, and the blindneſs of the people might be diſcovered. The ſame power now is made manifeſt, and doth overturn the world, as did then overturn the world, to the exalting of the Lord, and the pulling down of the kingdom of Satan and of this world, and ſetting up his own kingdom, to his everlaſting praiſe. The Lord is now exalting himſelf, and throwing down man's ſelf. The proud one's head is aloft, fearing he ſhould loſe his pride and his crown. The prieſts incenſe the ignorant people, for fear their trade ſhould go down; and profeſſors ſhew forth what is in them, being full of rage; which ſhews that Jeſus Chriſt the ſubſtance is not there; but a ſtony heart, to ſtone the precious, where it is riſen. The carnal mind feeds upon the outward letter; earth feeds upon earth; and that vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard is not dreſſed, but is full of briers and nettles; and ravenous beaſts, ſwine, dogs, wolves, and lions, and all venomous creatures lodge in that habitation. That houſe is not ſwept. Theſe are the perſecutors of the juſt, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the truth, and of Chriſt. Theſe are blaſphemers of God and his truth. Theſe call upon God with their
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:037441_0253_100D8F6A5DD1F4F8"/>lips, but their hearts are far from him. Theſe feed on lies; prieſts and people. Theſe incenſe the people, and ſtir up envy; for it begets its own, one like itſelf. Theſe are as the waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame. Theſe have double eyes; whoſe bodies are full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe paint themſelves with the prophets, with Chriſt's, and with the apoſtles words moſt fair. Whited walls, painted ſepulchres, murderers of the juſt you are, Your eyes are double, your minds are double, your hearts are double. Ye flatterers, repent and turn from your carnal ends, who are full of miſchief; pretending God and godlineſs, taking him for your cloak; but he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you, and he hath uncovered you to his children. He will make you bare, diſcover your ſecrets, take off your crown, take away your mantle and your veil, and ſtrip you of your cloathing; that your nakedneſs may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and how you ſit deceiving the nations. Your abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and your falſehood is now made manifeſt to thoſe who are of God; who in his power triumph over you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over you, the beaſt, the dragon, the falſe prophet, the ſeducer, the hypocrite, the mother of all harlots. Now thou muſt have thy cup double. Give it to her double. Sing over her, ye righteous ones, ſing over them all, ye ſaints; triumph in glory, triumph over the deceit: ſing the ſong of the lamb; triumph over the world, ſpread the truth abroad. Come ye captives out of priſon; rejoice with one accord, for the joyful days are coming. Let us be glad, and rejoice for ever! Singleneſs of heart is come; pureneſs of heart is come; joy and gladneſs is come. The glorious God is exalting himſelf: truth hath been talked of, but now it is poſſeſſed. Chriſt hath been talked of; but now he is come and poſſeſſed. The glory hath been talked of; but now it is poſſeſſed, and the glory of man is defacing. The Son of God hath been talked of; but now he is come, and hath given us an underſtanding. Unity hath been talked of; but now it is come. Virgins have been talked of; but now they are come with oil in their lamps. He will be glorified alone. Where pride is thrown down, earth and the fleſhly will is thrown down, and the pure is raiſed up; there alone is the Lord exalted. Let the heavens bow down to him, and the earth reel to and fro, and ſtagger up and down. The Lord is ſetting up his throne and his crown, and throwing down the crown of man; he alone will be glorified: to whom be
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:037441_0254_100D8F6CACFE5B38"/>all honour and glory, all praiſes and all thanks! He gives his children wiſdom and ſtrength, knowledge and virtue, power and riches, bleſſings and durable ſubſtance; an eye to diſcern, and an ear to hear things ſingly; brings down the pride of man's heart, and turns the wicked out of the kingdom. The righteous inherit righteouſneſs; the pure, pureneſs; the holy, holineſs. Praiſes, praiſes be to the Lord, whoſe glory now ſhines, whoſe day is broken forth; which is hid from the world, hid from all worldly-wiſe ones, from all the prudent of this world; from the fowls of the air; from all vultures eyes, all venomous beaſts, all liars, all dogs, and all ſwine. But to them that fear his name, the ſecrets of the Lord are made manifeſt, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom are opened, and the fulneſs of knowledge: for thou, O Lord! doſt make thyſelf manifeſt to thy children.</p>

                        <p>WHAT a world is this! how doth the devil gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf! how obedient are people to do his will and mind! They are altogether carried away with fooleries and vanities, both men and women. They have loſt the hidden man of the heart, the meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which with the Lord is of great price. They have loſt the adorning of Sarah; they are putting on gold and gay apparel; women plaiting the hair, men and women powdering it; making their backs look like bags of meal. They look ſo ſtrange, that they can ſcarce look at one another; they are ſo lifted up in pride. Pride is flown up into their head; and hath ſo lifted them up, that they ſnuff up, like wild aſſes, and like Ephraim: they feed upon wind, and are got to be like wild heifers, who feed upon the mountains. Pride hath puffed up every one of them. They are out of the fear of God; men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Young and old; one puffs up another. They muſt be in the faſhion of the world, elſe they are not in eſteem; nay they ſhall not be reſpected, if they have not gold or ſilver upon their backs, or if the hair be not
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:037441_0255_100D8F6E5099CD38"/>powdered. But if one have ſtore of ribands hanging about his waiſt, at his knees, and in his hat, of divers colours, red, white, black, or yellow, and his hair pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; then he is a brave man, then he is accepted, then he is no Quaker. He hath ribands on his back, belly, and knees, and his hair powdered. This is the array of the world. But is not this from the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, or the pride of life? Likewiſe the women having their gold, their patches on their faces, noſes, cheeks, foreheads, their rings on their fingers, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gold, their cuffs double under and above, like a butcher with his white ſleeves; their ribands tied about their hands, and three or four gold laces about their cloaths; this is no Quaker, ſay they. This attire pleaſeth the world; and if they cannot get theſe things, they are diſcontented. But this is not the attire of Sarah, whoſe adorning was in the hidden man of the heart, of a quiet and meek ſpirit. This is the adorning of the heathen; not of the apoſtle, nor of the ſaints, whoſe adorning was, not wearing of gold, nor plaiting of hair, but that of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is of great price with the Lord. Here was the ſobriety and good ornament which was accepted of the Lord. This was Paul's exhortation and preaching. But we ſee, the talkers of Paul's words live out of Paul's command, and out of the example of Sarah, and are found in the ſteps of the great heathen, who comes to examine the apoſtles in his gorgeous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. Are not theſe, that have got ribands hanging about their arms, hands, back, waiſts, knees, hats, like fiddlers boys? This ſhews, that they are got into the baſeſt and moſt contemptible life, who are in the faſhion of fiddlers boys and ſtage-players, quite out of the paths and ſteps of ſolid men; in the very ſteps and paths of the wild heads, who give themſelves up to every invention and vanity of the world that appears, and are inventing how to get it upon their backs, heads, feet, and legs; and ſay, If it be out of the faſhion, it is nothing worth. Are not theſe ſpoilers of the creation, who have the fat and the beſt of it, and waſte and deſtroy it? Do not theſe incumber God's earth? Let that of God in all conſciences anſwer, and who are in the wiſdom judge. And further; if one get a pair of breeches like a coat, and hang them about with points, and up almoſt to the middle, a pair of double cuffs upon his hands, and
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:037441_0256_100D8F6FEDA0B9A0"/>a feather in his cap, here's a gentleman; bow before him, put off your hats, get a company of fiddlers, a ſet of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and women to dance. This is a brave fellow. Up in the chamber; up in the chamber without, and up in the chamber within. Are theſe your fine Chriſtians? Yea, ſay they, They are Chriſtians; but ſay the ſerious people, They are out of Chriſt's life, out of the apoſtle's command, and out of the ſaints ornament. To ſee ſuch as are in the faſhions of the world before-mentioned, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of them playing at bowls, or at tables, or at ſhovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, or each taking his horſe, with bunches of ribands on his head, as the rider hath on his own, perhaps a ring in his ear too, and ſo go to horſe-racing to ſpoil the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Oh! theſe are gentlemen indeed, theſe are bred up gentlemen, theſe are brave fellows, they muſt take their recreation; for pleaſures are lawful. Theſe in their ſports, ſet up their ſhouts like wild aſſes. They are like the kine or beaſts, when they are put to graſs, lowing when they are full. Here is the glorying of thoſe before-mentioned; but it is in the fleſh, not in the Lord. Theſe are bad chriſtians, and ſhew that they are gluttoned with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and then the fleſh rejoiceth. Here is evil breeding of youth and young women, who are carried away with the vanities of the mind in their own inventions, pride, arrogance, luſt, gluttony, uncleanneſs. They eat and drink, and riſe up to play. This is the generation which God is not well pleaſed with; for their eyes are full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, who cannot ceaſe from evil. Theſe be they that live in pleaſures upon earth theſe be they who are dead while they live; who glory not in the Lord, but in the fleſh: theſe be they that are out of the life that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were given forth from, who live in the faſhions and vanities of the world, out of truth's adorning in the devil's adorning (who is out of the truth) not in the adorning of the Lord, which is a meek and quiet ſpirit, and is with the Lord of great price. But this ornament and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning is not put on by them that adorn themſelves, and have the ornament of him that is out of the truth. That is not accepted with the Lord which is accepted in their eye.</p>

Take heed of approving ſuch as he diſapproved; for ſince the apoſtles days, ſuch as he diſapproved have had their liberty; and they have told us, The tongues were their original, that they were ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox men, and that the ſteeple-houſe, with a croſs on the top of it, was the church (the Papiſts maſs-houſe, you may look on the top of it and ſee the ſign.)

The Lord ſent his prophets of old to cry againſt the ſhepherds that ſought for the fleece, Ezek. xxxiv. and to cry againſt ſuch ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds as ſeck for their gain from their quarter, and never have enough, Iſa. v. 6. and to cry againſt the prophets that propheſied falſely, and the prieſts that bore rule by their means; which was the filthy and horrible thing, Jer. v. And if you would forbear to give them means, you would ſee how long they would bear rule. There was in old time a ſtorehouſe for the fatherleſs, ſtrangers, and widows, to come to and be filled; and thoſe did not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then who did not bring their tithes to the ſtorehouſe. But did not Chriſt put an end to that prieſthood, tithes, temple, and prieſts? Doth not the apoſtle ſay, The prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is changed, the law is changed, and the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſannulled? Might not they have pleaded the law
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:037441_0260_100D8F79DD096D08"/>of God, that gave them tithes? Was not the firſt author of them ſince Chriſt's time the pope, or ſome of his church? Did the apoſtles caſt men into priſon for tithes, as your miniſters do now? As inſtance: Ralph Holling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, prieſt of Phillingham, for petty tithes, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix ſhillings, hath caſt into Lincoln priſon a poor thatcher, Thomas Bromby; where he hath been about eight and thirty weeks, and ſtill remains priſoner: and the prieſt petitioned the judge, that the poor man might not labour in the city to get a little money towards his maintenance in priſon. Is this a good ſavour amongſt you that are in commiſſion to chooſe miniſters? Is this glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings? to caſt in priſon a man that is not his hearer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not put into his mouth? Can ſuch as are in the fear of God, and in his wiſdom, own ſuch things? the miniſters of Chriſt are to plant a vineyard, and then eat of the fruit; to plow, ſow, and threſh, and get the corn; and then let them reap: but not caſt them into priſon for whom they do no work. Chriſt, when he ſent forth his miniſters, bid them give freely as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived freely; and into what city or town ſoever they came, inquire who were worthy and there abide; and what they ſet before you, ſaid he, that eat. And when theſe came back again to Chriſt, and he aſked them, If they wanted any thing? they ſaid, No. They did not go to a town, and call the people together, to know how much they might have by the year, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>After I had made ſome ſtay in the city of London, I was moved of the Lord to go into bedfordſhire to John
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:037441_0261_100D8F7BE8202FB0"/>Crook's; where there was a great meeting, and people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally convinced of the Lord's truth. When I was come thither. John Crook told me, that the next day ſeveral of thoſe called the gentlemen of the country would come to dine with him, and to diſcourſe with me. They came, and I declared to them God's eternal truth. Several friends went to the ſteeple-houſes that day. And there was a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the country, which Alexander Parker went to; and towards the middle of the day it came upon me to go to it, though it was ſeveral miles off. John Crook went with me. When we came there, there was one—Gritton, who had been a Baptiſt, but he was got higher than they, and called himſelf a trier of ſpirits. He uſed to tell people their fortunes, and pretended to diſcover when goods were ſtolen, or houſes broken up, who the perſons were that did it: by which he had got into the affections of many thereabouts. This man was in that meeting ſpeaking, and making an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noiſe over the young convinced friends, when I came in; and he bid Alexander Parker give a reaſon of his hope. Alexander Parker told him, Chriſt was his hope; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not anſwer him ſo ſoon as he expected, he boaſtingly cried, His mouth is ſtopped. Then Gritton directed his ſpeech to me; for I ſtood ſtill and heard him expreſs many things not agreeable to ſcripture. I aſked him, <q>Whether he could make thoſe things out by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he had ſpoken?</q> He ſaid, Yes, yes. Then I bid the people take out their bibles and ſearch the places he ſhould quote for proof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his aſſertions; but he could not make good by ſcripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat he had ſaid. So he was aſhamed, and fled out of the houſe, and his people were generally convinced; for his ſpirit was diſcovered, and he came no more amongſt them. When they were ſettled in God's truth, they publiſhed a book againſt him, denying his ſpirit and his falſe diſcoveries. Many were turned to Chriſt that day, and came to ſit under his teaching; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the judges were in a great rage, and many of the magiſtrates in Bedfordſhire, becauſe ſo many were turned from the hireling prieſts to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's free teaching. But John Crook was kept by the power of the Lord; yet he was diſcharged from being a juſtice.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time I returned to London again; where friends were finely eſtabliſhed in the truth, and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings-in there were. About this time ſeveral friends went beyond ſea, to declare the everlaſting truth of God. When
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:037441_0262_100D8F7E886A4FE8"/>I had ſtaid awhile in the city, I went into Kent. When we came into Rocheſter, there was a guard kept to examine paſſengers; but we paſſed by, and were not ſtopped. So I went to Cranbrook, where there was a great meeting; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſoldiers were at it, and many were turned to the Lord that day. After the meeting ſome of the ſoldiers were ſomewhat rude; but the Lord's power came over them. Thomas Howſigoe, an Independent preacher, who lived not far from Cranbrook, was convinced, and became a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſter for the Lord Jeſus. Some friends had travelled into Kent before, as John Stubbs and William Caton; and the prieſts and profeſſors had ſtirred up the magiſtrates at Maidſtone to whip them for declaring God's truth unto them; as may be ſeen in the journal of William Caton's life. Captain Dunk was alſo convinced in Kent. He went with me to Rye, where we had a meeting; to which the mayor, officers, and ſeveral captains came. They took what I ſaid in writing, which I was well pleaſed with. All was quiet, and the people affected with the truth.</p>
                  <p>From Rye I went to Rumney, where the people had notice of my coming ſome time before. There was a very large meeting. Thither came Samuel Fiſher, an eminent preacher among the Baptiſts, who had a parſonage reputed worth two hundred pounds a year; which for conſcience ſake he had given up. There was alſo the paſtor of the Baptiſts, and abundance of their people. The power of the Lord was ſo mightily over the meeting, that many were reached, and one greatly ſhaken; and the life ſprang up in divers. One of the paſtors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Baptiſts, being amazed at the work of the Lord's power, bid one of our friends that was ſo wrought upon, Have a good conſcience. Whereupon I was moved of the Lord to bid him, Take heed of hypocriſy and deceit; and he was ſilent. A great convincement there was that day. Many were turned from darkneſs to the divine light of Chriſt, and came to ſee their teachers errors, and to ſit under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's teaching; to know him their way, and the covenant of light, which God had given to be their ſalvation; and they were brought to the one Baptiſm, and to the one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizer, Chriſt Jeſus. When the meeting was done, Samuel Fiſher's wife ſaid, <q>We may diſcern this day betwixt fleſh and Spirit, and diſtinguiſh ſpiritual teaching from fleſhly.</q> The people were generally well ſatisfied with what had been declared; but the two Baptiſt teachers and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:037441_0263_100D8F801A2121F8"/>when they were gone from the meeting, fell to reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the people. Samuel Fiſher, with divers others, reaſoned for the word of life, which had been declared that day, and the other paſtor and his party reaſoned againſt it; ſo it divided them aſunder and cut them in the midſt. A friend came and told me, <q>That the Baptiſts were diſputing one with another, and deſired me to go to them.</q> I ſaid, 'Let them alone, the Lord will divide them, and they that 'reaſon for truth will be too hard for the other: and ſo it was. Samuel Fiſher received the truth in the love of it, became a faithful miniſter, preached Chriſt freely, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much; being moved of the Lord to go and declare the word of life at Dunkirk, in Holland, and in divers parts of Italy, as Leghorn, and Rome itſelf; yet the Lord preſerved him and his companion John Stubbs out of their inquiſitions.</p>
                  <p>From Rumney I paſſed to Dover, and had a meeting, where ſeveral were convinced. Near Dover a governor and his wife were convinced, who had been Baptiſts. The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts thereabouts were much offended, and grew very envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but the Lord's power came over all. Luke Howard of Dover was convinced ſome time before, and became a faithful miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Returning from Dover I went to Canterbury, where a few honeſt-hearted people were turned to the Lord; who ſate down under Chriſt's teaching. Thence I paſſed to Cranbrook again, where I had a great meeting. A friend went to the ſteeple-houſe, and was caſt into priſon; but the Lord's power was manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ted, and his truth ſpread.</p>
                  <p>From thence I paſſed into Suſſex, and lodged near Horſham, where was a great meeting; and many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. Alſo at Steyning we had a great meeting in the market-houſe, and ſeveral were convinced there and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away; for the Lord's power was with us. Several meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I had thereabouts; amongſt the reſt a meeting was appointed at a great man's houſe, and he and his ſon went to fetch ſeveral prieſts who had threatened to come and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But none of them came, for the Lord's power was mighty in us. A glorious meeting we had. The man of the houſe and his ſon were vexed, becauſe none of the prieſts would come. So the hearts of the people were opened by the Spirit of God, and they were turned from the hirelings to Chriſt Jeſus, their ſhepherd, who had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them without money, and would ſeed them without
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:037441_0264_100D8F81F29DA440"/>money or price. Many that came, expecting to hear a diſpute, were convinced; amongſt whom Nicholas Beard was one.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord's power came over all, and his day many came to ſee. There were abundance of Ranters in thoſe parts, and profeſſors, who had been ſo looſe in their lives that they began to be weary of them, and had thought to have gone into Scotland to have lived privately; but the Lord's net catched them, and their underſtandings were opened by his light, Spirit, and power, through which they came to receive the truth, and to be ſettled upon the Lord; and ſo became very ſober men, and good friends in the truth. Great bleſſing and praiſing the Lord there was amongſt them, and great admiration in the country.</p>
                  <p>Out of Suſſex I travelled till I came to Reading; where I found a few that were convinced of the way of the Lord. I ſtaid till the firſt-day, and had a meeting in George Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boll's orchard; and a great part of the town came to it. A glorious meeting it proved; great convincement there was, and the people were mightily ſatisfied. Thither came two of judge Fell's daughters to me, and George Biſhop, of Briſtol, with his ſword by his ſide, for he was a captain. After the meeting many Baptiſts and Ranters came privately, reaſoning and diſcourſing; but the Lord's power came over them. The Ranters pleaded, that God made the devil: I denied it, and told them, <q>I was come into the power of God, the ſeed Chriſt, which was before the devil was, and bruiſed his head; and he became a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by going out of truth; and ſo became a murderer and a deſtroyer. I ſhewed them, that God did not make him a devil; for God is a God of truth, and made all things good, and bleſſed them; but God did not bleſs the devil. And the devil is bad, and was a liar and a murderer from the beginning, and ſpoke of himſelf, and not from God.</q> So the truth ſtopt and bound them, and came over all the higheſt notions in the nation, and confounded them. For by the power of the Lord I was manifeſt, and ſought to be made manifeſt to the Spirit of God in all, that by it they might be turned to God; as many were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by the holy Spirit, and were come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it under his teaching.</p>
                  <p>After this I paſſed to London, where I ſtaid awhile, and had large meetings: then went into Eſſex, and came to Cogſhall, where was a meeting of about two thouſand
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:037441_0265_100D8F84EEE0CB20"/>people, as it was judged, which laſted ſeveral hours, and a glorious meeting it was; for the word of life was freely declared, and people were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their teacher and Saviour, the way, the truth, and the life.</p>
                  <p>On the ſixth-day I had a large meeting near Colcheſter, to which many profeſſors and the Independent teachers came. After I had done ſpeaking, and was ſtept down from the place on which I ſtood, one of the Independent teachers began to make a jangling; which Amor Stoddart perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid, Stand up again, George; for I was going away, and did not at the firſt hear them. But when I heard the Independent, I ſtood up again, and after awhile the Lord's power came over him and his company; who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and the Lord's truth went over all. A great flock of ſheep hath the Lord in that country, that feed in his paſtures of life. On the firſt-day following we had a very large meeting not far from Colcheſter, wherein the Lord's power was eminently manifeſted, and the people were very well ſatisfied; for being turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's free teaching, they received it gladly. Many of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were of the ſtock of the martyrs.</p>
                  <p>As I paſſed through Colcheſter, I went to viſit James Parnel in priſon; but the gaoler would hardly let us come in, or ſtay with him. Very cruel they were to him. The gaoler's wife threatened to have his blood; and in that gaol they did deſtroy him, as the reader may ſee in a book printed ſoon after his death, giving an account of his life and death; and alſo in an epiſtle printed with his collected books and writings.</p>
                  <p>From Colcheſter I went to Ipſwich, where we had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meeting, and very rude; but the Lord's power came over them. After the meeting, I ſaid, <q>If any had a deſire to hear further, they might come to the inn;</q> and there came in a company of rude butchers that had abuſed friends: but the Lord's power ſo chained them they could not do miſchief. Then I wrote a paper and gave it forth to the town, <q>warning them of the day of the Lord, that they might repent of the evils they lived in; directing them to Chriſt, their teacher and way; and exhorting them to forſake their hireling-teachers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We paſſed from Ipſwich to Mendleſham, in Suffoll, where Robert Duncon lived. There we had a large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was quiet, and the Lord's power was preciouſly

Then we paſſed to a meeting at captain Lawrence's, in Norfolk; where, it was judged, were above a thouſand people; and all was quiet. Many perſons of note were preſent, and a great convincement there was. They were turned to Chriſt, and many of them received him, and ſate down under him, their vine. Here we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Amor Stoddart and others, who intended to meet us again in Huntingdonſhire.</p>
                  <p>About the ſecond hour in the morning we took horſe for Norwich, where Chriſtopher Atkins, that dirty man, had run out, and brought diſhonour upon the bleſſed truth and the name of the Lord. But he had been denied by friends, and afterwrads he gave forth a paper of condemnation of his ſin and evil. We came to Yarmouth, and ſtaid awhile; where there was a friend, Thoms Bond, in priſon, for the truth of Chirſt. There we had ſome ſervice; ſome being turned to the Lord in that town. From thence we rode to another town about twenty miles off, where were many tender people. I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to the people as I ſat upon my horſe, in ſeveral places as I paſſed along. We went to another twon about five miles from thence, and ſet upon my horſe, in ſeveral places as I paſſed along. We went to another town about five miles from thence, and ſet upon my horſes as an inn; Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn annd I having travelled five-and-forty miles that day. There were ſome friendly people in the town; and we had a tender, broken meeting amongſt them, in the Lord's power, to his paiſe.</p>
                  <p>We bid the hoſtler have our horſes ready by three in the morning; for we imended to tide to Lynn, about three-and-thirty miles, next morning. But when we were in bed, about elevent at night came the conſtable and officers, with a great rabble of people into the inn, and ſaid, They were come with an hue and cry from a juſtice of peace, that lived near the town where I had ſpoken to the people in the ſtreets as I rode along, to ſearch for two horſemen that rode upon grey horſes, and in grey cloaths; an houſe having been broken upon the ſeventh-day before at night. We told them, <q>We were honeſt innocent men, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>horred ſuch things;</q> yet they apprehended us, and ſet a guard with halberds and pikes upon us that night; making ſome of thoſe friendly people, with others, watch us. Next morning we were up betime, and the conſtable with is guard carried us bofore a juſtice of peace about five miles off. We took two or three of the ſufficient men of the twon with us, who had been at the meeting at captain
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:037441_0267_100D8F88D2B5DB20"/>Lawrence's, and could teſtify that we lay both the ſeventh-day night and the firſt-day night at captain Lawrence's; and it was the ſeventh-day night that they ſaid the houſe was broken up. The reader is to be informed, that during the time I was priſoner at the Mermaid at Charing-Croſs, this captain Lawrence brought ſeveral Independent juſtices to ſee me there, with whom I had a great deal of diſcourſe; which they took offence at. For they pleaded for imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſin as long as they lived; but did not like to hear of Chriſt's teaching his people himſelf, and making people as clear whilſt here upon the earth as Adam and Eve were before they fell. Theſe juſtices had plotted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this miſchief againſt me in the country, pretending an houſe was broken up; that they might ſend their hue and cry after me. They were vexed alſo and troubled to hear of the great meeting at John Lawrence's; for a colonel was convinced there that day, who lived and died in the truth. But Providence ſo ordered, that the conſtable carried us to a juſtice about five miles onward in our way towards Lynn, who was not an Independent juſtice, as the reſt were. When we were brought before him, he began to be angry, becauſe we did not put off our hats to him. I told him, I had been before the protector, and he was not offended at my hat; and why ſhould he be offended, who was but one of his ſervants? Then he read the hue and cry; and I told him, <q>That night, wherein the houſe was ſaid to be broken up, we were at captain Lawrence's houſe; and that we had ſeveral men preſent could teſtify the truth thereof.</q> Thereupon the juſtice, having examined us and them, ſaid, <q>He believed we were not the men that had broken the houſe; but he was ſorry,</q> he ſaid, <q>that he had no more againſt us.</q> We told him, <q>He ought not to be ſorry for not having evil againſt us, but rather to be glad; for to rejoice when he got evil againſt people, as for houſe-breaking or the like, was not a good mind in him.</q> It was a good while yet before he could reſolve, whether to let us go, or ſend us to priſon; and the wicked conſtable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>irred him up againſt us, telling him, <q>We had good horſes; and that if it pleaſed him, he would carry us to Norwich gaol.</q> But we took hold of the juſtice's confeſſion, <q>That he believed we were not the men that had broken the houſe;</q> and after we had admoniſhed him to fear the Lord in his day, the Lord's power came over him, that he let us go; ſo their ſnare was broken. A great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:037441_0268_100D8F8AEF5C7B30"/>were afterwards gathered to the Lord in that town, where I was moved to ſpeak to them in the ſtreet, from whence the hue and cry came.</p>
                  <p>Being ſet at liberty, we travelled to Lynn; to which we came about the third hour in the afternoon. Having ſet up our horſes, we met with Joſeph Fuce, who was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. We deſired him to ſpeak to as many of the people of the town as he could, that feared God; and the captains and officers to come together: which he did. We had a very glorious meeting amongſt them, and turned them to the Spirit of God, by which they might know God and Chriſt, and underſtand the ſcriptures; and learn of God and of Chriſt, as the prophets and apoſtles did. Many were convinced there; and a fine meeting there is, of them that are come off from the hirelings teaching, and ſit under the teaching of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Lynn being then a garriſon, we deſired Joſeph Fuce to get us the gate opened by the third hour next morning; for we had forty miles to ride next day. By that means getting out early, we came next day by the eleventh or twelfth hour to Sutton, near the iſle of Ely, where Amor Stoddart, and the friends with him, met us again. A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people was gathered thither, and no leſs than four prieſts. The prieſt of the town made a great jangle; but the Lord's power ſo confounded him, that he went away. The other three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>id; and one of them was convinced. One of the other two, whilſt I was ſpeaking, came to lean upon me: but I bid him ſit down, ſeeing he was ſo ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. A great convincement there was that day. Many hundreds were turned from darkneſs to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and from the ſpirit of error to the Spirit of truth, to be led thereby into all truth. People came to this meeting from Huntingdon, and beyond; the mayor's wife of Cambridge was there alſo. A glorious meeting it was; many were ſettled under Chriſt's teaching, and knew him their Shepherd to feed them: for the word of life was freely declared, and gladly received by them. The meeting ended in the power of the Lord, and in peace; and after it was done, I walked into a garden: where I had not been long, before a friend came and told me, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral juſtices were come to break up the meeting. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the people were gone away; ſo they miſſed of their deſign; and after they had ſtaid awhile, they departed alſo in a fret.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="unknown:037441_0269_100D8F8D48EB4788"/>
That evening I paſſed to Cambridge. When I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the town, the ſcholars, hearing of me, were up, and were exceeding rude. I kept on my horſe's back, and rode thro' them in the Lord's power; but they unhorſed Amor Stoddart before he could get to the inn. When we were in the inn, they were ſo rude in the courts and in the ſtreets, that the miners, colliers, and carters could never be ruder. The people of the houſe aſked us, What we would have for ſupper? 'Supper!' ſaid I, <q>were it not that the Lord's power is over them, theſe rude ſcholars look as if they would pluck us in pieces, and make a ſupper of us.</q> They knew I was ſo againſt the trade of preaching, which they were there as apprentices to learn, that they raged as bad as ever Diana's craftſmen did againſt Paul. At this place John Crook met us. When it was within night, the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the town, being friendly, came and fetched me to his houſe; and as we walked through the ſtreets, there was a buſtle in the town; but they did not know me, it being darkiſh. They were in a rage not only againſt me, but againſt the mayor alſo; ſo that he was almoſt afraid to walk the ſtreets with me, for the tumult. We ſent for the friendly people, and had a fine meeting in the power of God; and I ſtaid there all night. Next morning, having ordered our horſes to be ready by the ſixth hour, we paſſed peaceably out of town; and the deſtroyers were diſappointed: for they thought I would have ſtaid long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Then we rode to Biſhop-Stortford, where ſome were convinced; and to Hertford, where alſo ſome were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and where now there is a large meeting.</p>
                  <p>From thence we returned to London, where friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us gladly; the Lord's power having carried us through many ſnares and dangers. Great ſervice we had, for many hundreds were brought to ſit under the teaching of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt their Saviour, and to praiſe the Lord through him. James Nayler alſo was come up to London; and Richard Hubberthorn and I ſtaid ſome time in the city, viſiting friends, and anſwering gainſayers: for we had great diſputes with profeſſors of all ſorts. Many reproaches they caſt upon truth, and lying ſlanderous books they gave forth againſt us; but we anſwered them, cleared God's truth, ſet it over them, and the Lord's power was over all.</p>

                     <pb n="193" facs="unknown:037441_0270_100D7F5510CBAEC0"/>
Amongſt other ſervices for the Lord, which then lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me in the city, I was moved to give forth a paper to thoſe that made a ſcorn at trembling and quaking:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>THE word of the Lord to you all, that ſcorn trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and quaking, who ſcorn, throw ſtones at, and belch forth oaths againſt thoſe who are trembling and quaking, threatening and beating them. Strangers ye are to all the apoſtles and prophets; and are of the generation that ſtoned them and mocked them in thoſe ages. Ye are of the ſcoffers which they ſpake of, that are come in the laſt times. Be ye witneſſes againſt yourſelves. To the light in all your conſciences I ſpeak, that with it you may ſee yourſelves to be out of the life of the holy men of God.</p>
                        <p>Moſes, who was judge over all Iſrael, trembled, feared, and quaked, when the Lord ſaid unto him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; then he trembled, and durſt not behold. This, which makes to tremble now, ye teachers and people ſcoff at, and ſcorn thoſe in your ſtreets who witneſs the power of the Lord. Moſes forſook the pleaſures of the world, which he might have enjoyed for a ſeaſon. He might have been called the ſon of Pharaoh's daughter; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and forſook Pharaoh's houſe; yet was no vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond. David, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ing, trembled. He was mocked; they made ſongs on him; they wagged their heads at him. Will you profeſs David's words, and Moſes's words, who are in the generation of your fathers, mockers, ſcoffers, wonderers and deſpiſers, which are to periſh? O bluſh! Be aſhamed of all your profeſſion, and be confounded! Job trembled, his fleſh trembled, and they mocked him; ſo do you now mock them in whom the ſame power of God is made manifeſt; yet you profeſs Job's words. O deceitful hypocrites! will ye not own ſcripture? O for ſhame! Never profeſs ſcripture words, and deny the power, which, according to the ſcripture, makes the keepers of the houſe to tremble, and the ſtrong man to bow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Theſe things prieſts, magiſtrates, and people ſcoff at; but with the power ye are judged, and by the power and life condemned.</p>
                        <p>The prophet Jeremiah trembled, he ſhook, his bones quaked, he reeled to and fro, like a drunken man, when he ſaw the deceit of the prieſts and prophets who were
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:037441_0271_100D8F9151B59D78"/>turned from the way of God; and they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh. Such were gone from the light; and ſuch were they that ruled over the people. But he was brought to cry, O fooliſh people! that had eyes, and could not ſee; that had ears, and could not hear; that did not fear the Lord, and tremble at his preſence, who placed the ſands for bounds to the ſea by a perpetual decree, that the waves thereof cannot paſs! And be ſaid. <q>A horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets propheſy falſely, and the prieſts bear rule by their means. Shall not I viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? Shall not my ſoul be avenged upon ſuch a nation as this?</q> They were ſuch as did not tremble at the word of the Lord; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called them a fooliſh people. Hear all ye the word of the Lord, ye fooliſh people, who ſcorn trembling and quaking. Give over profeſſing the prophet Jeremiah's words, and making a trade of them; for with his words you are judged to be among the ſcoffers, ſcorners, and ſtockers. For he was ſtocked by your generation; and you now ſtock them that tremble at the word of the Lord, at the power of the mighty God, which raiſes up the Seed of God, and throws down the earth which hath kept it down. So you that are in the fall, where death reigneth, enemies of the truth, deſpiſing the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, as thoſe of your generation ever did wo and miſery is your portion, except y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> ſpeedily repent. Iſaiah ſaid, <q>Hear the word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his word.</q> And he ſaid, <q>This was the man that God did regard, who was of a broken and contrite heart, and trembled at his word. When their brethren hated and perſecuted them, ſaying, Let the Lord be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; he ſhall appear to your joy, but they ſhall be aſhamed,</q> Iſa. lxvi. 5. Now all ye ſcoffers and ſcorners, that deſpiſe trembling, you regard not the word of the Lord; they are not regarded by you, that tremble at the word; who are regarded by the Lord: therefore you are contrary to Iſaiah's words. Profeſs him and his words no more for ſhame, nor make a trade of his words. Ye that ſeek for your gain from your quarter, ye greedy, dumb dogs, that never have enough, ye are they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe trembling; ye are ſuch as Iſaiah cried againſt, who himſelf witneſſed trembling. Here therefore be ye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt yourſelves, that with the light in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ye may ſee ye are out of the prophet Iſaiah's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:037441_0272_100D8F92E5E8A6A0"/>and are haters of them that tremble, whom the Lord regards; but ſuch you regard not, but hate, perſecute, mock, and rail againſt. It is manifeſt you walk in the ſteps of your forefathers, that perſecuted the prophets. Habakkuk, the prophet of the Lord, trembled. Joel, the prophet of the Lord, ſaid, <q>Blow the trumpet in Zion, and let all the inhabitants of the earth tremble.</q> The people ſhall tremble, and all faces ſhall gather blackneſs; and the people ſhall be much pained. And now this trembling is witneſſed by the power of the Lord. This power of the Lord is come; the trumpet is ſounding, the earth is ſhaking; the inhabitants of the earth are trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; the dead is ariſing; and the living is praiſing God: the world is raging; the ſcoffers are ſcorning; and they that witneſs trembling and quaking wrought in them by the power of the Lord, can ſcarce paſs up and down the ſtreets but with ſtones and blows, fiſts and ſticks, or dogs ſet at them, or they are purſued with mockings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. Thus you vent your malice againſt them that witneſs the power of the Lord, as the prophets did; who are come to the broken heart and contrite ſpirit; who tremble at the word of the Lord, and whom the Lord regards: theſe you ſtone, ſtock, ſet your dogs at; theſe you ſcoff and ſcorn; theſe you revile and reproach; but theſe reproaches are our riches; praiſed be the Lord who hath given us p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If you ſee one, as Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk, whoſe lips quivered, whoſe belly ſhook; who ſaid, "Rottenneſs was entered into his bones," and who trembled in himſelf; if you ſee ſuch an one in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, ye ſay he is bewitched. Here again you ſhew yourſelves ſtrangers to that power, to that life which was in the prophet: therefore, for ſhame, never make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his words, nor a trade of his words; nor of Joel's, who witneſſed trembling, which ye ſcorn and ſcoff at. Ye proud ſcorners, miſery is your end, except you ſpeedily repent. Daniel, a ſervant of the moſt high God, trembled; his ſtrength and his breath were gone. He was priſoned, he was hated, he was perſecuted. They laid baits and ſnares for him, in whom the holy Spirit of God was. For ſhame, you that make a profeſſion of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel's words, give over your profeſſion, prieſts and people, who ſcoff and ſcorn at trembling: with the light you are ſeen to be out of Daniel's life, and by the ſame power you are judged, at which you ſcorn and ſcoff <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Paul, a miniſter of God, made by the will of God a meſſenger of the Lord Jeſus, a veſſel of the Lord, to carry his name abroad into ſeveral nations, when the dark, blind world have got ſome of his words and epiſtles, you teachers make a trade of them, and get great ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for it, ſo you deſtroy ſouls for diſhoneſt gain; making a trade of his words, and of the reſt of the apoſtles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of Chriſt's words, but denying the Spirit and life that they were guided by, and that power which ſhook the fleſh and the earth; which the apoſtle witneſſed, who ſaid, <q>When he came among the Corinthians, he was with them in weakneſs and fear, and in much trembling, that their faith might not ſtand in the wiſdom of words, but in the power of God;</q> in that power which made him to tremble. This power it is that the world, and all the ſcoffing teachers, ſcoff at and ſcorn at in your towns, in your villages, in your aſſemblies, in your alchouſes. For ſhame, lay aſide all your profeſſions of the apoſtle's words and conditions! Some that ſcoff at this power, call it the power of the devil.

Here you may ſee you are in the ſteps of your forefathers, who perſecuted the apoſtles, and acted ſo againſt them; ſtocked them, mocked them, priſoned them, ſtoned them, whipped them, haled them out of the ſynagogues, reproached them, and ſhamefully treated them. Do not you here fulfil the ſcripture and Chriſt's ſaying, who ſaid, <q>If they kill you, they will think they do God ſervice?</q> Yet you make a profeſſion of Chriſt's words, of the prophets and apoſtles words, and call your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves churches, and miniſters of the goſpel. I charge you, in the preſence of the living God, to be ſilent who act ſuch things! Mind the light in your conſciences, ye ſcoffers and ſcorners, which Chriſt hath enlightened you withal; that with it ye may ſee yourſelves, what ye act, and what ye have acted; for who act ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God: all ſuch things are by the light condemned.</p>

That power we own, and our faith ſtands in it, which all the world ſcoffs at; the lofty, the proud, the preſumptuous, who live in preſumption, and yet make a profeſſion of the ſcriptures, as your fathers the Phariſees did, who were painted ſepulchres and ſerpents; and as the Scribes did, who had the chieſeſt places in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, ſtood praying in the ſynagogues, and were called of men, Maſters, whom Chriſt cried wo againſt. Theſe are not come ſo far as the trembling of devils, who believed and trembled. Let that judge you.

With the light now they are ſeen, where the light, life, and power of God is made manifeſt; for as they did unto them, ſo will they do unto you. Here is our joy; the ſcripture is fulfilled, and fulfilling; with the light which was before the world was, which is now made manifeſt in the children of light, they ſee the world, comprehend it, and the actions of it: for he that loves the world, and turns from the light is an enemy to God; he turneth into wickedneſs: for the whole world lieth in wickedneſs. He who turns from the light, turns into the works of evil, which the light of Chriſt teſtifies againſt.

And ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings increaſing upon friends, by reaſon that envious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates made uſe of that oath as a ſnare to catch them in, who the knew could not ſwear at all; I was moved to write to the Protector as followeth:</p>

                        <p>THE magiſtrate is not to bear the ſword in vain, who ought to be a terror to the evil-doers; but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate that bears the ſword in vain, as he is not a terror to evil-doers, ſo he is not a praiſe to them that do well. Now hath God raiſed up a people by his power, whom people, prieſts, and magiſtrates, out of the fear of God,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:037441_0279_100D9059D4E8E7C0"/>ſcornfully call Quakers, who cry againſt drunkenneſs (for drunkards deſtroy God's creatures) and cry againſt oaths (for becauſe of oaths the land mourns) and theſe drunkards and ſwearers, to whom the magiſtrate's ſword ſhould be a terror, are, we ſee, at liberty; but for crying againſt ſuch, many are caſt into priſon, and for crying againſt their pride and filthineſs, their deceitful merchandize in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. their cozening, their cheating, their exceſs and naughtineſs, their playing at bowls and ſhovel-boards, at cards and at dice, and their other vain and wanton plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Who live in pleaſures are dead while they live, and who live in wantonneſs kill the juſt. This we know by the Spirit of God which gave forth the ſcriptures, which God the Father hath given to us, and hath placed his righteous law in our hearts; which law is a terror to evil-doers, and anſwers that which is of God in every man's conſcience. They who act contrary to the meaſure of God's Spirit in every man's conſcience, caſt the law of God behind their backs, and walk deſpitefully againſt the Spirit of Grace. The magiſtrate's ſword, we ſee, is borne in vain, whilſt evil-doers are at liberty to do evil, and they that cry againſt ſuch are, for ſo doing, puniſhed by the magiſtrate, who hath turned his ſword backward againſt the Lord. Now the wicked one fenceth himſelf, and perſecutes the innocent, as vagabonds and wanderers, for crying againſt ſin, unrighteouſneſs, and ungodlineſs openly, in the markets and in the highways; or as railers, becauſe they tell them what judgment will come upon thoſe that follow ſuch practices. Here they that depart from iniquity are become a prey, and few lay it to heart. But God will threſh the mountains, beat the hills, cleave the rocks, and caſt into his preſs which is trodden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the city, and will bathe his ſword in the blood of the wicked and unrighteous. You that have drunk the cup of abominations, an hard cup have you to drink, you who are the enemies of God, of you he will be avenged. You in whom ſomething of God is remaining, conſider; If the ſword was not borne in vain, but turned againſt evil-doers, the righteous would not ſuffer, and be caſt into holes, dungeons, corners, priſons, and houſes of correction, as peace-breakers, for crying againſt ſin openly, as they are commanded of the Lord, and for crying againſt the covetouſneſs of the prieſts and their falſe worſhips; who exact money of poor people, whom they do no work for.
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:037441_0280_100D7F61C239C360"/>Oh! where will you appear in the day of the Lord? How will you ſtand in the day of his righteous judgment? How many gaols and houſes of correction are now made places to put the lambs of Chriſt in, for following him and obeying his commands! The royal law of Chriſt, "To do as ye would be done by," is trodden down under foot; ſo that men can profeſs him in words, but crucify him whereſoever he appears, and caſt him into priſon, as the talkers of him always did in generations and ages paſt. The labourers, which God, the maſter of the harveſt, hath ſent into his vineyard, do the chief of the prieſts and the rulers now take counſel together againſt to caſt them into priſon: here are the fruits of prieſts, people, and rulers, without the fear of God. The day is come and coming that every man's work doth and ſhall appear; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be to the Lord God for ever! See and conſider the days you have ſpent, and the days you do ſpend; for this is your day of viſitation. Many have ſuffered great fines, becauſe they could not ſwear, but abide in Chriſt's doctrine, who ſaith, Swear not at all: and by that means are they made a prey upon for abiding in the command of Chriſt. Many are caſt into priſon and made a prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they cannot take the oath of abjuration, tho' they denied all that is abjured in it; and by that means many of the meſſengers and miniſters of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt are caſt into priſon, becauſe they will not ſwear nor go out of Chriſt's command. Therefore, O man! conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; to the meaſure of the life of God in thee I ſpeak. Many alſo lie in gaols, becauſe they cannot pay the prieſts tithes; many have their goods ſpoiled, and treble dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges taken of them; many are whipped and beaten in the houſes of correction, who have broken no law. Theſe things are done in thy name, in order to protect them in theſe actions. If men fearing God bore the ſword, and covetouſneſs was hated, and men of courage for God were ſet up, then they would be a terror to evil-doers and a praiſe to them that do well; and not cauſe ſuch to ſuffer. Here equity would be heard in our land, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would ſtand up and take place; which giveth not place to the unrighteous, but judgeth it. To the meaſure of God's Spirit in thee I ſpeak, that thou mayeſt conſider and come to rule for God: that thou mayeſt anſwer that which is of God in every man's conſcience; for that is it which bringeth to honour all men in the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="206" facs="unknown:037441_0283_100D8FA4AE6E13F0"/>were Peter Price and Walter Jenkin; who came both to be miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I went from thence to Sileby, to William Smith's, where was a great meeting, to which ſeveral Baptiſts came; one of them, a Baptiſt teacher, was convinced, and came to ſit under the Lord's teaching by his Spirit and Power. This Baptiſt ſaid. He had baptized thirty in a day.</p>
                  <p>From thence I went to Drayton, my native town, where ſo many prieſts and profeſſors had formerly gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt me; but now never a prieſt nor profeſſor did appear.

Thus was the Lord's day proclaimed, and ſet over all their heads. People began to ſee the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy and ſlavery they had been under to their hireling teachers, and came to know their teacher the Lord Jeſus, who had purchaſed them, and made their peace betwixt God and them.

I had a meeting at Birmingham, where ſeveral were convinced, and turned to the Lord. I came to one Cole's houſe near Chattan. This Cole had given an Independent preacher a meeting-place, who came to be convinced; after which he laid aſide his preaching; whereupon the old man— Cole gave him an hundred pounds a year. I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; a very great one it was, inſomuch that the meeting-place would not hold the people. Many were turned to the Lord that day. Afterwards, when the time of trials came, this Independent did not ſtand to that which had convinced him; but turned back: whereupon the old man took away his 100<abbr>l.</abbr> a year from him again. But Cole himſelf died in God's truth.</p>
                  <p>I heard that at Eveſham the magiſtrates had caſt ſeveral friends into divers priſons; and that, hearing of my coming, they made a pair of high ſtocks. I ſent for Edward Pitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, a friend, who lived near Eveſham, and aſked him the truth of the thing. He ſaid, it was ſo. I went that night with him to Eveſham; and in the evening we had a large, precious meeting, wherein friends and people were refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the word of life, the power of the Lord. Next morning I rode to one of the priſons, and viſited friends there, and encouraged them. Then I rode to the other priſon, where were ſeveral priſoners. Amongſt them was Humphry Smith, who had been a prieſt, but was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a free miniſter of Chriſt. When I had viſited friends at both priſons, and was turned to go out of the town, I eſpied the magiſtrates coming up the town to have ſeized me in priſon. But the Lord fruſtrated their intent, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent eſcaped their ſnare, and God's bleſſed power came over them all. But exceeding rude and envirous were the prieſts and profeſſors about this time in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>I went from Eveſham to Worceſter, and had a precious meeting there, and quiet. After which, coming towards our inn, ſome profeſſors fell to diſcourſe with friends, and were like to have made a tumult in the city. As we went into the inn, they all cluttered into the yard; but I went among them and got them quieted. Next day I walked into the town, and had a great deal of diſcourſe with ſome of the profeſſors concerning Chriſt and the way of truth.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:037441_0285_100D8FA905412378"/>One of them denied, that Chriſt was of Abraham according to the fleſh, and that he was declared to be the Son of God according to the Spirit. I proved from Rom. i. that he was of the ſeed of Abraham, being made of the ſeed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid according to the fleſh; and that according to the Spirit he was declared to be the Son of God. Afterwards I wrote a paper concerning it.</p>
                  <p>From Worceſter we went to Tewkſbury, where in the evening we had a great meeting, to which came the prieſt of the town with a great rabble of rude people. The prieſt boaſted, that he would ſee whether he or I ſhould have the victory. <q>I turned the people to the Divine Light, which Chriſt, the heavenly and ſpiritual man, enlighteneth them withal; that with that Light they might ſee their ſins, and that they were in death and darkneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world; and might alſo ſee Chriſt from whom it cometh, their Saviour and Redeemer, who ſhed his blood and died for them; who is the way to God, the truth, and the life.</q> Here the prieſt began to rage againſt the Light, and denied it; for neither prieſt nor profeſſor could endure to hear the Light ſpoken of. Having railed at the Light the prieſt went away, and left his rude com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany amongſt us; but the Lord's power came over them, though miſchief was in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Leaving Tewkſbury we paſſed to Warwick, where in the evening we had a meeting at a widow-woman's houſe with many ſober people. A precious meeting we had in the Lord's power; ſeveral were convinced, and turned to the Lord. After the meeting, a Baptiſt in the company began to jangle; and the bailiff of the town, with his officers, came in and ſaid. What do theſe people here at this time of night? So he ſecured John Crook, Amor Stoddart, Gerrard Roberts, and me; but we had leave to go to our inn, and to be forth-coming in the morning. The next morning many rude people came into the inn, and into our chambers, deſperate fellows; but the Lord's power gave us dominion over them. Gerrard Roberts and John Crook went to the batliff to know what he had to ſay to us. He ſaid, we might go our ways, for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

One of them took hold of my horſe's bridle, and broke it; but the horſe drawing back threw him under him. Though the bailiff ſaw this, yet he did not ſtop, not ſo much as rebuke the rude multitude; ſo that it was much we had not been ſlain or hurt in the ſtreets; for the people threw ſtones and ſtruck at us as we rode along the town.</p>
                  <p>When we were quite out of the town, I told friends, <q>It was upon me from the Lord that I muſt go back into the town again; and if any one of them felt any thing upon him from the Lord, he might follow me; the reſt that did not, might go on to Dun-cow.</q> So I paſſed through the market in the dreadful power of God, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of life to them; and John Crook followed me. Some ſtruck at me; but the Lord's power was over them, and gave me dominion over all. I ſhewed them their unworthineſs of the name of chriſtians, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of their teachers, that had not brought them into more ſobriety; and what a ſhame they were to chriſtianity!</p>
                  <p>Having cleared myſelf I turned out of the town again, and paſſed to Coventry; where we found the people cloſed up with darkneſs. I went to a profeſſor's houſe I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been at, and he was drunk; which grieved my ſoul ſo, that I did not go into any houſe in the town; but rode into ſome of the ſtreets, and into the market-place. I felt the power of the Lord was over the town.</p>
                  <p>Then I went to Dun-cow, and had a meeting in the evening, and ſome were turned to the Lord by his Spirit, as ſome alſo were at Warwick and Tewkſbury. We lay at Dun-cow that night; where we met with John Camm, a faithful miniſter of the everlaſting goſpel. In the morning there gathered a rude company of prieſts and people, who behaved more like beaſts than men; for ſome of them came riding on horſeback into the room where we were; but the Lord gave us dominion over them.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed into Leiceſterſhire, where we had a great meeting at the place where I had been taken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. After that we came to Badgley, in Warwickſhire. Here William Edmundſon who lived in Ireland, having ſome drawings upon his ſpirit to come into England to ſee me, met with me; by whom I wrote a ſew lines to friends then convinced in the north of Ireland.</p>

                  <p>When theſe few lines were read amo gſt the friends in Ireland at their meeting, the power of the Lord ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all in the room.</p>
                  <p>From Badgley we paſſed to Swanington and Higham, and into Northamptonſhire and Bedfordſhire, having great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Many were turned to the Lord by his Power and Spirit. When we came to Baldock in Hertfordſhire, I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'If there was nothing in that town, no profeſſion?' It was anſwered me, There were ſome Baptiſts, and a Baptiſt woman ſick. John Ruſh of Bedfordſhire went with me to viſit her. When we came in, many tender people were about her. They told me, <q>She was not a woman for this world; but if I had any thing to comfort her concerning the world to come. I might ſpeak to her.</q> I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to her; and he raiſed her up again, to the aſtoniſhment of the town and country. Her huſband's name was Baldock. This Baptiſt woman and her huſband came to be convinced; and many hundreds of people have met at their houſe ſince. Great meetings and convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were in thoſe parts afterwards; many received the word of life, and fat down under the teaching of Chriſt their Saviour.</p>
                  <p>When we had viſited this ſick woman, we returned to our inn; where we found two deſperate fellows fighting ſo furiouſly, that none durſt come nigh to part them. But I was moved in the Lord's power to go to them: and when I had looſed their hands, I held one of them by one hand, and the other by the other, ſheved them the evil of their doings, and reconciled them one to the other; and they were ſo loving and thankful to me, that people admired at it.</p>
                  <p>From thence I paſſed to Market-ſtreet, where God had a people; and through Albans to London, where friends were glad of the proſperity of truth, and the manifeſtation of the Lord's glorious power, which had delivered us, and
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:037441_0288_100D8FAEA1337F18"/>carried us through many dangers and difficulties. I alſo rejoiced to find truth proſper in the city, and all things well amongſt friends there. Only there was one John Toldervey, who had been convinced of truth, and run out from it; and the envirous prieſts took occaſion from thence to write a wicked book againſt friends which they ſtuffed with many lies, to render truth and friends odious. They intituled their book, "The Foot out of the Snare." But this poor man came to ſee his folly, and returned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his backſliding, anſwered the prieſts book, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted all their lies and wickedneſs. Thus the Lord's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came over them; his everlaſting Seed reigned, and reigns to this day.</p>
                  <p>After I had tarried ſome time in London, and had viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friends in their meetings, I went out of town, leaving James Nayler in the city. As I paſſed from him, I caſt my eyes upon him, and a fear ſtruck me concerning him; but I went away, and rode to Ryegate in Surry where I had a little meeting. There friends told me of one Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moore, a juſtice of peace, that lived not far from Rye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, a friendly, moderate man; whereupon I went to viſit him at his houſe, and he came to be a ſerviceable man in truth.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed to Thomas Patchings, of Binſcombe in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalming, where we had a meeting, to which ſeveral friends came from London. John Bolton and his wife came on ſoot in froſt and ſnow. After we had parted with friends there, we went towards Horſham Park; where having viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friends, we went to Arundel and Chicheſter, where we had meetings. At Chicheſter many profeſſors came in, and made ſome jangling: but the Lord's power was over them. The woman of the houſe, where the meeting was, though convinced of truth, yet not keeping her mind cloſe to that which convinced her, ſhe fell in love with a man of the world, who was there that time. When I knew it, I took her aſide, and was moved to ſpeak to her and to pray for her; but a light thing got up in her mind, and ſhe ſlighted it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe married that man; and ſoon after went diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; Then was I ſent for to her; and the Lord was entreated, raiſed her up again, and ſettled her mind by his power. Afterwards her huſband died; and ſhe acknowledged the juſt judgments of God were come upon her, for ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exhortation and counſel I had given he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After we left Chicheſter, we travelled to Portſmouth. There the ſoldiers had us to the governor's houſe. After ſome examination, the Lord's power came over them, and we were ſet at liberty, and had a meeting in the town. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we came to Ringwood, where in the evening we had a meeting. Several were convinced, and turned to the Spirit of the Lord, and to the teaching of Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour.</p>
                  <p>From Ringwood we came to Pool; and, having ſet up our horſes at an inn, we ſent into the town to inquire for ſuch as feared the Lord, and ſuch as were worthy; and we had a meeting there with ſeveral ſober people. William Baily, a Baptiſt teacher, was convinced at that time. The people received truth in the inward parts, and were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their rock and foundation, their teacher and Saviour; and there is become a great ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in the name of Jeſus of a very tender people, who continue under Chriſt's teaching.</p>
                  <p>We went alſo to Southampton, and had a meeting, where ſeveral were convinced. Edward Pyot of Briſtol travelled with me all this weſtern journey.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went to Dorcheſter, and alighted at an inn, a Baptiſt's houſe: we ſent into the town to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, to let us have their meeting-houſe to aſſemble in, and to invite the ſober people to the meeting; but they denied it us. We ſent to them again, to know why they would deny us their meeting-houſe? ſo the thing was noiſed in the town. Then we ſent them word, If they would not let us come to their houſe, they, or any people that feared God, might come to our inn, if they pleaſed; but they were in a great rage. Their teacher, and many of them came up, and flapped their bibles on the table. I aſked them, <q>Why they were ſo angry? were they angry with the bible?</q> But they fell into a diſcourſe about their water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm. I aſked them, <q>Whether they could ſay they were ſent of God to baptize people, as John was? And whether they had the ſame Spirit and power that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had?</q> They ſaid, They had not. Then I aſked them, <q>How many powers there are? Whether there are any more than the power of God, and the power of the devil?</q> They ſaid. There was not any other power than thoſe two. Then ſaid I, <q>If you have not the power of God that the apoſtles had, you act by the power of the devil.</q> Many ſober people were preſent, who ſaid, <q>They
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:037441_0290_100D8FB351E6C768"/>have thrown themſelves on their backs.</q> Many ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial people were convinced that night; a precious ſervice we had there for the Lord, and his power came over all. Next morning, as we were paſſing away, the Baptiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a rage, began to ſhake the duſt off their feet after us. 'What,' ſaid I, <q>in the power of darkneſs! We, who are in the power of God, ſhake off the duſt of our feet againſt you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leaving Dorcheſter, we came to Weymouth; where alſo we inquired after ſober people; and about fourſcore of them gathered together at a prieſt's houſe, all very ſober people. Moſt of them received the word of life, and were turned to their teacher Chriſt Jeſus, who had enlightened them with his divine light, by which they might ſee their ſins, and him who ſaveth from ſin. A bleſſed meeting we had with them, and they received the truth in the love of it, with gladneſs of heart. The meeting held ſeveral hours. <q>The ſtate of their teachers, and the apoſtacy was opened to them; and the ſtate of the apoſtles, and of the church in their days: and the ſtate of the law and of the prophets before Chriſt, and how Chriſt came to fulſil them; that he was their teacher in the apoſtles days; and that he was come now to teach his people himſelf by his power and ſpirit.</q> All was quiet, the meeting broke up peaceably, the people were very loving; and a meeting is continued in that town to this day. Many are added to them; and ſome who had been Ranters came to own the truth, and to live very ſoberly.</p>
                  <p>There was a captain of horſe in the town, who ſent to me, and would fain have had me to have ſtaid longer; but I was not to ſtay. He and his man rode out of town with me about ſeven miles; Edward Pyot alſo being with me. This captain was the fatteſt, merrieſt, cheerfulleſt man, and the moſt given to laughter, that ever I met with: inſomuch that I was ſeveral times moved to ſpeak in the dreadful power of the Lord to him; yet it was become ſo cuſtomary to him, he would preſently laugh at any thing he ſaw. But I ſtill admoniſhed him to come to ſobriety, and the fear of the Lord, and ſincerity. We lay at an inn that night; and the next morning I was moved to ſpeak to him again, when he parred from us. Next time I ſaw him, he told me, When I ſpoke to him at parting, the power of the Lord ſo ſtruck him, that before he got home he was ſerious enough, and had left his laughing. He afterwards was convinced, and became a ſerious good man, and died in the truth.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="unknown:037441_0291_100D8FB61D266700"/>
Parting from him, we went to Honiton; and at our inn inquired, What people were in the town that feared God, and ſent for them. There came to us ſome of the particular Baptiſts, with whom we had a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. I told them, <q>They held their doctrine of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular election in Eſau's, Cain's, and Iſhmael's nature; not in Jacob, the ſecond birth: but they muſt be born again before they could enter the kingdom of God. And that as the promiſe of God was to the Seed, not as many, but as one, which was Chriſt; ſo the election and choice ſtainds in Chriſt; and they muſt be ſuch as walk in his light, grace, Spirit, and truth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed to Topſham, and ſtaid over firſt, day; but the inn-keeper and his people were rude. Next morning we gave forth ſome queries to the prieſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: whereupon ſome rude profeſſors came to our inn; and, had we not gone when we did, they had ſtopped us. I wore a girdle, which through forgetfulneſs I left behind me, and afterwards ſent to the inn-keeper for; but he would not let me have it again. Afterwards, when he was troubled in his mind about it, he burnt it, leſt he ſhould be bewitched by it, as he ſaid; yet when he had burnt it, he was more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled than before. Some, notwithſtanding the rudeneſs of the place, were convinced, and a meeting was afterwards ſettled in that town, which hath continued ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>After this we paſſed to To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes, a dark town. We lodged there at an inn; and that night Edward Pyot was ſick, but the Lord's power healed him, ſo that the next day we got to King's Bridge, and at our inn inquired for the ſober people of the town. They directed us to Nicholas Tripe and his wiſe; and we went to their houſe. They ſent for the prieſt, with whom we had ſome diſcourſe; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confounded, quickly left us. Nicholas Tupe and his wiſe were convinced; and ſince there is a good meeting of friends in that country. In the evening we returned to our inn. There being many people drinking in the houſe, <q>I was moved of the Lord to go amongſt them, and direct them to the light which Chriſt the heavenly man had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened them withal; by which they might ſee all their evil ways, words, and deeds, and by the ſame light they might alſo ſee Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour.</q> The inn-keeper ſtood uneaſy, ſeeing it hindered his gueſts from drinking; and as ſoon as the laſt words were out of my mouth, he ſnatched up the candle, and ſaid, <q>Come, here is a light
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:037441_0292_100D8FB86CE7E920"/>for you to go into your chamber.</q> Next morning, when he was cool, I repreſented to him, <q>What an uncivil thing it was for him ſo to do;</q> then warning him of the day of the Lord, we got ready and paſſed away.</p>
                  <p>We came next day to Plymouth, refreſhed ourſelves at our inn, and went to Robert Cary's, where we had a very precious meeting. At this meeting was Elizabeth Trelaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, daughter to a baronet. She being ſomewhat thick of hearing, came cloſe up to me, and clapped her ear very nigh me, while I ſpake; and ſhe was convinced. After this meeting came in ſome jangling Baptiſts; but the Lord's power came over them, and Elizabeth Trelawny gave teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereto. A ſine meeting was ſettled there in the Lord's power, which hath continued ever ſince; where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faithful friends have been convinced.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed into Cornwall, and came to an inn in the pariſh of Menhenniot. At night we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Edward Hancock's, to which came Thomas Mounce and a prieſt, with a great deal of people. We brought the prieſt to confeſs, That he was a miniſter made by the ſtate, and maintained by the ſtate; and he was confounded and went his way: but many of the people ſtaid. I directed them to the <q>light of Chriſt, by which they might ſee their ſins, and their Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, the way to God, their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to make peace betwixt God and them; their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd to feed them, and their Prophet to teach them. I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to the Spirit of God in themſelves, by which they might know the ſcriptures, and be led into all truth; and by the Spirit might know God, and in it have unity one with another.</q> Many were convinced at that time, and came under Chriſt's teaching; and there are fine gatherings in the name of Jeſus in thoſe parts at this day.</p>
                  <p>We travelled from thence through Penryn, and came to Helſton; but could not get to the knowledge of any ſober people, through the badneſs of the inn-keepers. At length we came to a village, where ſome Baptiſts and ſober people lived, with whom we had diſcourſe. Some of them were brought to confeſs, that they ſtumbled at the light of Chriſt. They would have had us to have ſtaid with them; but we paſſed thence to Market-Jew; and having taken up our lodging at an inn, we ſent over night to inquire for ſuch as feared the Lord. Next morning the mayor and aldermen gathered together, with the high-ſheriff of the county; and lent the conſtables to bid us come before them. We aſked
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:037441_0293_100D8FBA8ED12EB0"/>them for their warrant; and they ſaying they had none, we told them, we ſhould not go along with them without a warrant. Upon the return of the conſtables without us, they ſent their ſergeants, and we aſked them for their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. They ſaid, they had none; but told us, the mayor and aldermen ſtaid for us. We told them, the mayor and his company did not well to trouble us in our inn; and we ſhould not go with them without a warrant. So they went away, and came again; and when we aſked them for their warrant, one of them plucked his mace from under his cloak. We aſked them. Whether it was their cuſtom to moleſt and trouble ſtrangers in their inns and lodgings? After ſome time Edward Pyot went to the mayor and alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a great deal of diſcourſe he had with them; but the Lord's power gave him dominion over them all. When he returned, ſeveral of the officers came to us; and we laid before them the incivility and unworthineſs of their carriage towards us, the ſervants of the Lord God, thus to ſtop and trouble us in our inns and lodgings; and what an unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian act it was. Before we left the town. I wrote a little paper, to be ſent to the ſeven pariſhes at the Land's End.</p>

                        <p>THE mighty day of the Lord is come, and coming, wherein all hearts ſhall be made manifeſt, and the ſecrets of every one's heart ſhall be revealed by the light of Jeſus, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world, that all men through him might believe, and the the world might have life through him, who ſaith, <q>Learn of me;</q> and of whom God ſaith, <q>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.</q> Chriſt is come to teach his people himſelf; and every one that will not hear this Propher, which God hath raiſec up, and which Moſes ſpake of, when he ſaid, <q>Like unto me will God raiſe you up a Prophet, him ſhall you hear:</q> every one, I ſay that will not hear this prophet, is to be cut off. They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Moſes's law, died under the hand of two or three witneſſes; but how much greater puniſhment will come upon them that neglect this great ſalvation. Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaith. <q>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth, and the life;</q> who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and by his light lets him ſee his evil ways and evil deeds. But if you hate that light, and go on in evil, this light will be your condemner. Therefore, now ye have tune, prize it: for this is the day of your viſitation,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:037441_0294_100D8FBC9A0F14E0"/>and ſalvation offered to you. Every one of you hath a light from Chriſt which lets you ſee you ſhould not lie, nor do wrong to any, nor ſwear, nor curſe, nor take God's name in vain, nor ſteal. It is the light that ſhews you theſe evil deeds: which if you love, and come unto it, and follow it, it will lead you to Chriſt, who is the way to the Father, from whom it comes; where no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs enters, nor ungodlineſs. If you hate this light, it will be your condemnation; but if you love it, and come to it, you will come to Chriſt; and it will bring you off from all the world's teachers and ways, to learn of Chriſt, and will preſerve you from the evils of the world, and all the deceivers in it.</p>

                  <p>This paper a friend, then with me, had; and when we were gone three or four miles from Market-Jew towards the weſt, he meeting with a man upon the road, gave him a copy of the paper. This man proved to be a ſervant to Peter Ceely, a major in the army, and a juſtice of peace in that county; and, riding before us to a place called St. Ives, ſhewed the paper to his maſter. When we came to Ives, Edward Pyot's horſe having caſt a ſhoe, we ſtaid to have a ſhoe ſet; and while he was getting his horſe ſhod, I walked to the ſea-ſide. When I came back, I found the town in an uproar. They were haling Edward Pyot and the other friend before major Ceely. I followed them into the juſtice's houſe, though they did not lay hands upon me. When we came in, the houſe was full of rude people; whereupon I aſked, Whether there were not an officer among them, to keep the people civil? Major Ceely ſaid, he was a magiſtrate. I told him, <q>He ſhould ſhew forth gravity and ſobriety then, and uſe his authority to keep the people civil; for I never ſaw any people ruder: the Indians were more like Chriſtians than they.</q> After awhile they brought the paper, and aſked, Whether I would own it? I ſaid, Yes. Then he tendered the oath of abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to us: whereupon I put my hand in my pocket, and produced the anſwer to it, which had been given to the protector. After I had given him that, he examined us ſeverally, one by one. He had with him a ſilly, young prieſt, who aſked us many frivolous queſtions; amongſt the reſt, he deſired to cut my hair, which then was pretty long; but I was not to cut it, though many were offended at it,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:037441_0295_100D8FBE4E0278B8"/>I told them, <q>I had no pride in it; and it was not of my own putting on.</q> At length the juſtice put us under a guard of ſoldiers, who were hard and wild, like the juſtice himſelf: nevertheleſs we <q>warned the people of the day of the Lord, and declared the truth to them.</q> The next day he ſent us guarded by a party of horſe, with ſwords and piſtols, who took us to Redruth. On firſt-day the ſoldiers would have carried us away; but we told them, It was their ſabbath, and it was not uſual to travel on that day. Several of the town's people gathered about us; and whilſt I held the ſoldiers in diſcourſe, Edward Pyot ſpoke to the people; and afterwards Edward Pyot held the ſoldiers in diſcourſe whilſt I ſpoke to the people. In the mean time the other friend got out backwards, and went to the ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to ſpeak to the prieſt and people. The people were exceeding deſperate, in a mighty rage againſt him, and abuſed him. The ſoldiers alſo miſſing him, were in a great rage, and ſeerred ready to kill us; but I declared the day of the Lord, and the word of eternal life to the people. In the afternoon the ſoldiers were reſolved to have us away; ſo we took horſe. When we had rid to the town's end, I was moved of the Lord to go back again, to ſpeak to the old man of the houſe. The ſoldiers drew out their piſtols, and ſwore I ſhould not go back. I heeded them not; but rode back, and they rode after me. So I cleared myſelf to the old man and the people; and then returned with them, and reproved them for being ſo rude and violent.</p>
                  <p>At night we were brought to a town then called Smeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, but ſince Falmouth. It being the evening of the firſt-day, there came into our inn the chief conſtable of the place, and many ſober people; ſome of whom began to inquire concerning us. We told them, We were priſoners for truth's ſake; and a great deal of diſcourſe we had with them concerning the things of God. They were very ſober, and very loving to us. Some of them were convinced, and ſtood faithful ever after.</p>
                  <p>When the conſtable and theſe people were gone, others came in, who alſo were very civil, and went away very loving. When all were gone, we went to our chamber to go to bed; and about the eleventh hour Edward Pyot ſaid. <q>I will ſhut the door, it may be ſome may come to do us a miſchief.</q> Afterwards we underſtood captain Keat, who commanded the party, purpoſed to have done us ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that night; but the door being bolted, he miſſed his
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:037441_0296_100D8FC046C5B808"/>deſign. Next morning captain Keat brought a kinſman of his, a rude, wicked man, and put him into the room; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtanding without. This evil-minded man walked huff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down the room; I bid him fear the Lord. Whereupon he ran upon me, ſtruck me with both his hands; and, clapping his leg behind me, would have thrown me down, if he could; but he was not able, for I ſtood ſtiff and ſtill, and let him ſtrike. As I looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door, I ſaw, captain Keat look on, and ſee his kinſman thus beat and abuſe me. Whereapon I ſaid to him, 'Keat, doſt thou allow this?' He ſaid he did. <q>Is this manly or civil,</q> ſaid I, <q>to have us under a guard, and put a man to abuſe and beat us? Is this manly, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or chriſtian?</q> I deſired one of our friends to ſend for the conſtables, and they came. Then I deſired the captain to let the conſtables ſee his warrant or order, by which he was to carry us; which he did; and his warrant was, to conduct us ſafe to captain Fox, governor of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennis caſtle; and if the governor ſhould not be at home, he was to convey us to Lanceſton gaol. I told him, He had broken his order concerning us; for we, who were his priſoners, were to be ſafely conducted; but he had brought a man to beat and abuſe us: ſo he having broken his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I wiſhed the conſtable to keep the warrant. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he did, and told the ſoldiers, They might go their ways, for he would take charge of the priſoners; and if it coſt twenty ſhillings in charges to carry us up, they ſhould not have the warrant again. I ſhewed the ſoldiers the baſeneſs of their carriage towards us; and they walked up and down the houſe, pitifully blank and down. The conſtables went to the caſtle, and told the officers what they had done. The officers ſhewed great diſlike of captain Keat's baſe carriage towards us; and told the conſtables, major-general Deſborough was coming to Bodmin, and that we ſhould meet him; and it was likely he would free us. Mean-while our old guard of ſoldiers came by way of entreaty to as, and promiſed they would be civil to us, if we would go with them. Thus the morning was ſpent till about the eleventh hour; and then, upon the ſoldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, and promiſe to be more civil, the conſtables gave them the order again; and we went with them. Great was the civility and courteſy of the conſtables and people of that town towards us, who kindly entertained us; and the Lord tewarded them with his truth; for many of them have ſince
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:037441_0297_100D8FC325FD1518"/>been convinced thereof, and are gathered into the name of Jeſus, and ſit under Chriſt, their Teacher and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Captain Keat who commanded our guard, underſtanding that captain Fox, who was governor of Pendennis caſtle, was gone to meet major-general Deſborough, did not carry us thither; but took us directly to Bodmin, in the way to Lanceſton. We met major-general Deſborough on the way. The captain of his troop, that rode before him, knew me, and ſaid, 'Oh, Mr. Fox, what do you here?' I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, 'I am a priſoner.' 'Alack,' ſaid he, 'for what?' I told him, 'I was taken up as I was travelling.' 'Then,' ſaid he, <q>I will ſpeak to my lord, and he will ſet you at liberty.</q> So he came from the head of his troop, and rode up to the coach, and ſpoke to the major-general. We alſo gave him an account how we were taken. He began to ſpeak againſt the light of Chriſt; againſt which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him. Then he told the ſoldiers, They might carry us to Lanceſton; for he could not ſtay to talk with us, leſt his horſes ſhould take cold.</p>
                  <p>To Bodmin we were had that night; and when we came to our inn, captain Keat, who was in before us, put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a room, and went his way. When I was come in, there ſtood a man with a naked rapier in his hand. Whereupon I turned out again, called for captain Keat, and ſaid, <q>What now, Keat, what trick haſt thou played now, to put me into a room where there is a man with his naked ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier? What is thy end in this?</q> 'Oh,' ſaid he, <q>pray hold your tongue; for if you ſpeak to this man, we cannot all rule him, he is ſo deviliſh.</q> 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>doſt thou put me into a room where there is ſuch a man with a naked rapier, that thou ſay'ſt, You cannot all rule him? What an unworthy, baſe trick is this? and to put me ſingle into this room from the reſt of my friends, that were fellow-priſoners with me?</q> Thus his plot was diſcovered, and the miſchief they intended was prevented. Afterward we got another room, where we were together all night; and in the evening we declared the truth to the people: but they were dark and hardened. The ſoldiers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their fair promiſes, were very rude and wicked to us again, and ſat up drinking and roaring all night.</p>
                  <p>Next day we were brought to Lanceſton, where captain Keat delivered us to the gaoler. Now was there no friend, nor friendly people near us; and the people of the town were a dark, hardened people. The gaoler required us to
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:037441_0298_100D8FC4B75C6CA0"/>pay ſeven ſhillings a week for our horſe-meat, and ſeven ſhillings a week for our diet apiece. After ſome time ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſober perſons came to ſee us, and ſome of the town were convinced; and many friendly people out of ſeveral parts of the country came to viſit us, and were convinced. Then got up a great rage among the profeſſors and prieſts againſt us. They ſaid, This people Thou and Thee all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect, and will not put off their hats, nor bow the knee to any man; but we ſhall ſee, when the aſſize comes, whether they will dare to Thou and Thee the judge, and keep on their hats before him. They expected we ſhould be hanged at the aſſize. But all this was little to us; for we ſaw how God would ſtain the world's honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and were commanded not to ſeek that honour, nor give it; but knew the honour that cometh from God only, and ſought that.</p>
                  <p>It was nine weeks from the time of our commitment to the aſſizes, to which abundance of people came from far and near to hear the trial of the Quakers. Captain Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lay with his troop of horſe there, whoſe ſoldiers and the ſheriſf's men guarded us to the court through the multitude that filled the ſtreets; and much ado they had to get us through. Beſides, the doors and windows were filled with people looking upon us. When we were brought into the court, we ſtood a pretty while with our hats on, and all was quiet; and I was moved to ſay, <q>Peace be amongſt you?</q> Judge Glyn, a Welſhman then chief juſtice of England, ſaid to the gaoler, <q>What be theſe you have brought here into the court?</q> 'Priſoners, my lord,' ſaid he. 'Why do you not put off your hats?' ſaid the judge to us. We ſaid nothing. 'Put off your hats.' ſaid the judge again. Still we ſaid nothing. Then ſaid the judge, 'The court commands you to put off your hats.' Then I queried, <q>Where did ever any magiſtrate, king, or judge, from Moſes to Daniel, command any to put off their hats, when they came before them in their courts, either amongſt the Jews (the people of God) or amongſt the heathen? And if the law of England doth command any ſuch things, ſhew me that law either written or print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> The judge grew very angry, and ſaid. <q>I do not carry my law-books on my back.</q> 'But,' ſaid I. <q>tell me where it is printed in any ſtatute-book, that I may read it.</q> Then ſaid the judge, <q>Take him away, prevaricator! I'll ſerk him.</q> So they took us away, and put us among
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:037441_0299_100D8FC73453CC38"/>the thieves. Preſently after he called to the gaoler. <q>Bring them up again! Come,</q> ſaid he, <q>where had they hats from Moſes to Daniel? Come, anſwer me; I have you faſt now.</q> I replied, <q>Thou mayeſt read in the third of Daniel, that the three children were caſt into the fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar's command, with their coats, their hoſe, and their hats on.</q> This plain inſtance ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him; ſo that not having any thing elſe to the point, he cried again, 'Take them away, gaoler.' Accordingly we were taken away, and thruſt in among the thieves; where we were kept a great while; and then, without being called again, the ſheriff's men and the troopers made way for us to get through the crowd, and guarded us to priſon again, a multitude of people following us, with whom we had much diſcourſe and reaſoning at the gaol. We had ſome good books to ſet forth our principles, and to inform people of the truth; which the judge and juſtices hearing of, they ſent captain Bradden for them, who came and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently took our books from us, ſome out of Edward Pyot's hands, and carried them away; ſo we never get them again.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon we were had up again into the chamber by the gaoler, ſheriff's men, and troopers; who had a mighty toil to get us through the crowd of people. When we were in the court, waiting to be called, obſerving the jurymen, and ſuch a multitude of others ſwearing, it griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my life to ſee, that ſuch as profeſſed chriſtianity ſhould ſo openly diſobey and break the command of Chriſt and the apoſtle. And I was moved of the Lord to give forth a paper againſt ſwearing, which I had about me, to the grand and petty juries.</p>

Every one of you have a light from Chriſt, who ſaith, <q>I am the light of the world,</q> and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. He ſaith, "Learn of me," whoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and that of the apoſtle, is not to ſwear; <q>Let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay, in all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; for whatſoever is more cometh of evil:</q> they that go into more than yea and nay go into evil, and are out of the doctrine of Chriſt. If you ſay, <q>That the oath was the end of controverſy and ſtrife;</q> thoſe who are in ſtrife are out of Chriſt's doctrine; for he is the covenant of peace, and who are in that, are in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of peace. The apoſtle brings that but as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: as men ſwearing by the greater, and the oath was the end of controverſy and ſtrife among men; ſaying, Verily, men ſwear by the greater: but God having no greater ſwears by himſelf concerning Chriſt; who, when he was come, taught not to ſwear at all. So thoſe who are in him, and follow him, cannot but abide in his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. If you ſay, <q>They ſwore under the law, and under the prophets;</q> Chriſt is the end of the law, and of the prophets, to every one that believeth for righteouſneſs ſake.

Now if you do believe in the light, as Chriſt commands, "Believe in the light, that you may be children of light;" you believe in Chriſt, and learn of him, who is the way to the Father.

                  <p>When it was read I ſpoke thus to the judge and juſtices, <q>Thou that ſayeſt thou art chief juſtice of England, and you juſtices, know that, if I had put in ſureties, I might have gone whither I pleaſed, and have carried on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (if I had had one) which major Ceely hath charged me with. And if I had ſpoken thoſe words to him, which he hath here declared, judge ye whether bail or mainprize could have been taken in that caſe.</q> Then, turning my ſpeech to major Ceely, I ſaid, <q>When or where did I take thee aſide? Was not thy houſe full of rude people, and thou as rude as any of them, at our examination; ſo that I aſked for a conſtable or ſome other officer to keep the people civil? But if thou art my accuſer, why ſitteſt thou on the bench? It is not the place of accuſers to ſit with the judge. Thou oughteſt to come down and ſtand by me, and look me in the face. Beſides, I would aſk the judge and juſtices, Whether or no major Ceely is not guilty of this treaſon, which he charges againſt me in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it ſo long as he hath done? Does he underſtand his place, either as a ſoldier or a juſtice of the peace? For he tells you here, <q>That I went aſide with him, and told him what a deſign I had in hand, and how ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he might be for my deſign: that I could raiſe forty thouſand men in an hour's time, bring in king Charles,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:037441_0304_100D8FD26330BA60"/>and involve the nation in blood.</q> He ſaith moreover, <q>He would have aided me out of the country, but I would not go; and therefore he committed me to priſon for want of ſureties for the good behaviour,</q> as the mittimus declares. Now do you not ſee plainly, that major Ceely is guilty of this plot and treaſon he talks of, and hath made himſelf a party to it, by deſiring me to go out of the country, demanding bail of me, and not charging me with this pretended treaſon till now, nor diſcovering it? But I deny and abhor his words, and am innocent of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh deſign.</q> So that buſineſs was let fall; for the judge ſaw clear enough, that inſtead of enſnaring me, he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Major Ceely got up again, and ſaid, <q>If it pleaſe you, my lord, to hear me: this man ſtruck me, and gave me ſuch a blow as I never had in my life.</q> At this I ſmiled in my heart, and ſaid, <q>Major Ceely, art thou a juſtice of peace, and a major of a troop of horſe, and telleſt the judge in the face of the court and country, that I, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, ſtruck thee, and gave thee ſuch a blow as thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hadſt the like in thy life? What! art thou not aſhamed? Prithee, major Ceely, ſaid I, where did I ſtrike thee? and who is thy witneſs for that? who was by? He ſaid, It was in the Caſtle-green, and captain Bradden was ſtanding by when I ſtruck him. I deſired the judge to let him produce his witneſs for that; and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again upon major Ceely to come down from the bench, telling him, It was not fit the accuſer ſhould ſit as judge over the accuſed.</q> When I called again for his witneſs, he ſaid captain Bradden was his witneſs. Then I ſaid, <q>Speak, captain Bradden, didſt thou ſee me give him ſuch a blow, and ſtrike him as he ſaith?</q> Captain Bradden made no anſwer, but bowed his head towards me. <q>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ſpeak up, if he knew any ſuch thing; but he only bowed his head again. Nay, ſaid I, ſpeak up, and let the court and country hear; let not bowing of the head ſerve the turn. If I have done ſo, let the law be inflicted on me; I fear not ſufferings, nor death itſelf, for I am an innocent man concerning all his charge.</q> But captain Bradden never teſtified to it. The judge, finding thoſe ſnares would not hold, cried, Take him away, gaoler; and when we were taken away, he fined us twenty marks apiece for not putting off our hats; to be kept in priſon till we paid it; and ſent us back to the gaol.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="unknown:037441_0305_100D8FD4F5A7D700"/>
At night captain Bradden came to ſee us, and ſeven or eight juſtices with him who were very civil to us, and told us, They believed, neither the judge nor any in the court gave credit to thoſe charges which major Ceely had accuſed me of in the face of the country. And captain Bradden ſaid, Major Ceely had an intent to have taken away my life, if he could have got another witneſs. <q>But ſaid I, Captain Bradden, why didſt not thou witneſs for me, or againſt me. ſeeing major Ceely produced thee for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that thou ſaweſt me ſtrike him? When I deſired thee to ſpeak either for me or againſt me, according to what thou ſaweſt or kneweſt, thou wouldſt not ſpeak.</q> Why, ſaid he, when major Ceely and I came by you, as you were walking in the Caſtle-green, he put off his hat to you, and ſaid. How do you, Mr. Fox? your ſervant, Sir, Then you ſaid to him, Major Ceely, take heed of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and of a rotten heart; for when came I to be thy maſter, and thou my ſervant? Do ſervants uſe to caſt their maſters into priſon? This was the great blow he meant that you gave him. Then I called to mind that they walked by us, and that he ſpoke ſo to me, and I to him; which hypocriſy and rotten-heartedneſs he manifeſted openly, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this to the judge in open court, and in the face of the country; whom he would have made believe that I ſtruck him with my hand.</p>
                  <p>Now were we kept in priſon, and divers came from far and nigh to ſee us, of whom ſome were people of account in the world; for the report of our trial was ſpread abroad, and our boldneſs and innocency in our anſwers to the judge and court was talked of in the town and country. Among others Humphry Lower came to viſit us, a grave, ſober, ancient man, who had been a juſtice of peace, and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry we ſhould lie in priſon; telling us, how ſerviceable we ſhould be if we were at liberty. We reaſoned with him concerning ſwearing: and having acquainted him they tendered the oath of abjuration to us as a ſnare, becauſe they knew we could not ſwear; and ſhewed him, that no people could be ſerviceable to God if they diſobeyed the command of Chriſt; and that they that impriſoned us for the hat-honour, which was of men, and which men ſought for, they priſoned the good, and grieved the Spirit of God in themſelves, which ſhould have turned their minds to him. So we directed him to the Spirit of God in his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t, the light of Chriſt Jeſus: and he was thoroughly convinced,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:037441_0306_100D8FD68EA86930"/>and continued ſo to his death, and became very ſerviceable to us.</p>
                  <p>There came alſo to ſee us, one colonel Rouſe, a juſtice of peace, and a great company with him. He was full of words and talk, as ever I heard any man in my life, ſo that without intruding, there was no ſpeaking to him. At length I aſked him, <q>Whether he had ever been at ſchool, and knew what belonged to queſtions and anſwers?</q> (this I ſaid to ſlop him.) At ſchool! ſaid he, yes. At ſchool! ſaid the ſoldiers; Doth he ſay ſo to our colonel, that is a ſcholar? Then ſaid I, <q>If he be ſo, let him be ſtill and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive anſwers to what he hath ſaid.</q> Then I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak the word of life to him in God's dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power; which came ſo over him that he could not open his mouth. His face ſwelled, and was red like a turkey. His lips moved, and he mumbled ſomething; but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought he would have fallen down. I ſtept to him; and then he ſaid, He was never ſo in his life before; for the Lord's power ſtopped the evil power and air in him, ſo that he was almoſt choked. The man was ever after ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loving to friends, but not ſo full of airy words to us; though he was full of pride: but the Lord's power came over him, and the reſt that were with him.</p>
                  <p>Another time there came an officer of the army, a very malicious, bitter profeſſor, whom I had known in London. He was full of airy talk alſo, and ſpoke ſlightly of the light of Chriſt, and againſt the truth, as colonel Rouſe had done, and againſt the Spirit of God being in men, as it was in the apoſtles days, till the power of God that bound the evil in him had almoſt choked him alſo, as it did colonel Rouſe; for he was ſo full of evil air, that he could not ſpeak; but blubbered and ſtuttered. From that time that the Lord's power ſtruck him, and came over him, he was ever after more loving to us.</p>
                  <p>The aſſizes being over, and we ſettled in priſon upon ſuch a commitment that we were not likely to be ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, we broke off from giving the gaoler ſeven ſhillings a week apiece for our horſes, and, ſeven ſhillings a week for ourſelves, and ſent our horſes into the country. Upon which he grew very wicked and deviliſh, and put us down into Doomſdale, a naſty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>linking place, where they uſed to put murderers after they were condemned. The place was ſo noiſome, that it was obſerved few that went in did ever come out again in health. There was no houſe of
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:037441_0307_100D8FD89C4C7608"/>office in it; and the excrement of the priſoners, that from time to time had been put there, had not been carried out (as we were told) for many years. So that it was all like mire, and in ſome places to the top of the ſhoes in water and urine; and he would not let us cleanſe it, nor ſuffer us to have beds or ſtraw to lie on. At night ſome friendly people of the town brought us a candle and a little ſtraw; and we went to burn a little of our ſtraw to take away the ſtink. The thieves lay over our heads, and the head-gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a room by them over our heads alſo. It ſeems the ſmoke went up into the room where the gaoler lay; which put him into ſuch a rage that he took the pots of excrement from the thieves, and poured them through a hole upon our heads in Doomſdale, till we were ſo beſpattered that we could not touch ourſelves nor one another. And the ſlink increaſed upon us; ſo that what with ſtink, and what with ſmoke, we had like to have been choked and ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We had the ſtink under our fect before, now we had it on our heads and backs alſo; and he having quenched our ſtraw with the filth he poured down, had made a great ſmother in the place. Moreover he railed at us moſt hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, calling us hatchet-faced dogs, and ſuch ſtrange names as we had never heard of. In this manner we were obliged to ſtand all night, for we could not ſit down, the place was ſo full of filthy excrement. A great while he kept us after this manner before he would let us cleanſe it, or ſuffer us to have any victuals brought in but what we got through the grate: One time a girl brought us a little meat; and he arreſted her for breaking his houſe, and ſued her in the town-court for breaking the priſon. A great deal of trouble he put the young woman to; whereby others were ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged that we had much ado to get water, drink, or vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals. Near this time we ſent for a young woman, Ann Downer, from London, who could write and take things well in ſhort-hand, to buy and dreſs our meat for us; which ſhe was very willing to do, it being alſo upon her ſpirit to come to us in the love of God; and ſhe was very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us.</p>
                  <p>The head-gaoler, we were informed, had been a thief, and was burnt both in the hand and in the ſhoulder: his wiſe too had been burnt in the hand. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaoler had been burnt both in the hand and in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: his wiſe had been burnt in the hand alſo. Colonel Bennet, a baptiſt-teacher, having purchaſed the gaol and
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:037441_0308_100D8FDA39791E98"/>lands belonging to the caſtle, had placed this head-gaoler there. The priſoners and ſome wild people would be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpirits that haunted Doomſdale, and how many had died in it, thinking perhaps to terrify us therewith. But I told them, <q>That if all the ſpirits and devils in hell were there, I was over them in the power of God, and feared no ſuch thing; for Chriſt, our Prieſt, would ſanctify the walls of the houſe to us, he who bruiſed the head of the devil.</q> The prieſt was to cleanſe the plague out of the walls of the houſe under the law, which Chriſt, our Prieſt, ended; who ſanctifies both inwardly and outwardly the walls of the houſe, the walls of the heart, and all things to his people.</p>
                  <p>By this time the general quarter-ſeſſions drew nigh; and the gaoler ſtill carrying himſelf baſely and wickedly towards us, we drew up our ſuffering caſe, and ſent it to the ſeſſions at Bodmin. Upon the reading of which the juſtices gave order. <q>That Doomſdale-door ſhould be opened, and that we ſhould have liberty to cleanſe it, and to buy our meat in the town.</q> We ſent up a copy alſo of our ſufferings to the Protector, ſetting forth how we were taken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by major Ceely, and abuſed by captain Keat as aforeſaid, and the reſt in order. Whereupon the Protector ſent an order to captain Fox, governor of Pendennis-caſtle; to examine the matter about the ſoldiers abuſing us, and ſtriking me. There were at that time many of the gentry of the country at the caſtle; and captain Keat's kinſman, that ſtruck me, was ſent for before them, and much threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. They told him, <q>If I ſhould change my principle, I might take the extremity of the law againſt him, and might recover ſound damages of him.</q> Captain Keat was alſo check'd for ſuffering the priſoners under his charge to be abuſed. This was of great ſervice in the country; for afterwards friends might have ſpoken in any market or ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſe thereabouts, and none would meddle with them. I underſtood that Hugh Peters, one of the Protector's chaplains, told him, <q>They could not do George Fox a greater ſervice for the ſpreading of his principles in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall than to impriſon him there.</q> And indeed my impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment there was of the Lord, and for his ſervice in thoſe parts; for aftere the aſſizes were over, and it was known we were likely to continue priſoners, ſeveral friends from moſt parts of the nation came into the country to viſit us, Thoſe parts of the weſt were very dark countries at that
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:037441_0309_100D8FDC5381E198"/>time; but the Lord's light and truth broke forth, ſhined over all, and many were turned from darkneſs to light, and from ſatan's power unto God. Many were moved to go to the ſteeple-houſes, ſeveral were ſent to priſon to us, and a great convincement began in the country: for now we had liberty to walk in the Caſtle-green, and divers came to us on firſt-days, to whom we declared the word of life. Great ſervice we had, many were turned to God up and down the country; but great rage got up in the prieſts and profeſſors againſt the truth and us. One of the envious profeſſors had gathered together many ſcripture-ſentences to prove, <q>That we ought to put off our hats to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</q> and he invited the town of Lanceſton to come into the Caſtle-yard to hear him read them. Amongſt other inſtances that he brought, one was, <q>That Saul bowed to the witch of Endor.</q> When he had done we got a little liberty to ſpeak, and ſhewed both him and the people, <q>That Saul was gone from God, and had diſobeyed him, like them, when he went to the witch of Endor: that neither the prophets, nor Chriſt, nor the apoſtles ever taught people to bow to a witch.</q> The man went away with his rude people; but ſome ſtaid with us, and we ſhewed them, That this was not goſpel-inſtruction, to teach people to bow to a witch. For now people began to be affected with the truth, and the devil's rage increaſed; ſo that we were often in great danger.</p>
                  <p>One time there came a ſoldier, and while one of our friends was admoniſhing and exhorting him to ſobriety, &amp;c. I ſaw him begin to draw his ſword. Whereupon I ſtept to him, and repreſented what a ſhame it was to offer to draw his ſword upon a naked man, and a priſoner, and how unfit and unworthy he was to carry ſuch a weapon; and that, if he ſhould have offered ſuch a thing to ſome men, they would have taken his ſword from him and have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it to pieces. So he was aſhamed and went his way; and the Lord's power preſerved us.</p>
                  <p>Another time, about eleven at night, the gaoler being half drunk, came and told me, He had got a man now to diſpute with me (this was when we had leave to go a little into the town.) As ſoon as he ſpoke theſe words, I felt there was miſchief intended to my body. All that night and the next day I lay down on a graſs-plat to ſlumber, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> ſomething ſtill about my body; and I ſtarted up, and ſtruck at it in the power of the Lord, and ſtill it was
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:037441_0310_100D8FDED37500B8"/>about my body. Then I roſe and walked into the Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, and the under-keeper came and told me, There was a maid would ſpeak with me in the priſon. I felt a ſnare in his words too, therefore I went not into the priſon, but to the grate; and looking in, I ſaw a man that was lately brought to priſon for being a conjurer, who had a naked knife in his hand. I ſpoke to him, and he threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to cut my chaps; but being within the gaol he could not come at me. This was the gaoler's great diſputant. I went ſoon after into the gaoler's houſe, and found him at breakfaſt; he had then got his conjurer out with him. I told the gaoler, his plot was diſcovered. Then he got up from the table, and caſt his napkin away in a rage; and I left them, and went away to my chamber; for at this time we were out of Doomſdale. At the time the gaoler had ſaid the diſpute ſhould be, I went down and walked in the court (the place appointed) till about the eleventh hour; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body came. Then I went up to my chamber again; and after awhile heard one call for me. I ſtepped to the ſtairs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where I ſaw the gaoler's wife upon the ſtairs, and the conjurer at the bottom of the ſtairs, holding his hand behind his back, and in a great rage. I aſked him, <q>Man, what haſt thou in thy hand behind thy back?</q> 
                     <q>Pluck thy hand before thee,</q> ſaid I; 'let's ſee thy hand, and 'what thou haſt in it? Then he angrily plucked forth his hand with a naked kniſe in it. I ſhewed the gaoler's wife their wicked deſign againſt me; for this was the man they brought to diſpute of the things of God. But the Lord diſcovered their plot, prevented their evil deſign; and they both raged, and the conjurer threatened. Then I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak ſharply to him in the dreadful power of the Lord; and the Lord's power came over him, and bound him down; ſo that he never after durſt appear before me, to ſpeak to me. I ſaw it was the Lord alone that preſerved me out of their bloody hands; for the devil had a great enmity to me, and ſtirred up his inſtruments to ſeek my hurt. But the Lord prevented them; and my heart was filled with thankſgivings and praiſes to him.</p>
                  <p>Now while I was exerciſed with people of divers ſorts, that came ſome out of good-will to viſit us, ſome out of an envious carping mind to wrangle and diſpute wiſh us, and ſome out of curioſity to ſee us; Edward Pyot, who before his convincement had been a captain in the army, and had a good underſtanding in the laws and rights of the people,

Our books are our goods, our goods are our property, and our liberty it is to have and enjoy our property: and of our liberty and property the law is the defence; which ſaith, <q>No freeman ſhall be diſſeized of his freehold, liberties, or free cuſtoms, &amp;c. nor any way otherwiſe deſtroyed: nor we ſhall not paſs upon him, but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land, Magna Charta, cap. 29.</q> Now, friend, conſider, is not the taking away of a man's goods violently, by force of arms, as aforeſaid, contrary to the law of the land? Is not the keeping of them, ſo taken away, a diſſeizing him of his property, and a deſtroying of it and his liberty, yea, his very being, ſo far as the invading of the guard the law ſets about him is in order thereunto? Calls not the law this a deſtroying of a man? Is there any more than
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:037441_0312_100D8FE3D4F34800"/>one common guard or defence to property, liberty, and life, viz. the law? And can this guard be broken on the former, viz. property and liberty, and the latter, viz. life, be ſure? Doth not he, that makes an invaſion upon a man's property and liberty (which he doth, who, contrary to law, which is the guard, acts againſt either) make an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon a man's life; ſince that which is the ground of the one is alſo of the other? If a penny or penny's worth be taken from a man contrary to law, may not by the ſame rule all a man hath be taken away? If the bond of the law be broken upon a man's property, may it not on the ſame ground be broken upon his perſon? And by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as it is broken on one man, may it not be broken upon all, ſince the liberty, property, and beings of all men under a government are relative, a communion of wealth, as the members in the body, but one guard and defence to all, the law? One man cannot be injured therein, but it redounds to all. Do not ſuch things tend to the ſubverſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of government? Where there is no law, what is become of government? And of what value is the law made, when the miniſters thereof break it at pleaſure upon men's properties, liberties, and perſons? Canſt thou clear thyſelf of theſe things, as to us? To that of God in thy conſcience, which is juſt, do I ſpeak. Haſt thou acted like a miniſter, the chief miniſter of the law, who haſt taken our goods, and yet detaineſt them, without ſo much as going by lawful warrant, grounded upon due information, which in this our caſe thou couldſt not have; for none had peruſed them, whereby to give thee information? Shouldeſt thou exerciſe violence and force of arms on priſoners goods, in their priſon-chamber, inſtead of proceeding orderly and legally, which thy place calls upon thee above any man to tender, defend, and maintain againſt wrong, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve intire the guard of every man's being, liberty, and livelihood? Shouldſt thou, whoſe duty it is to puniſh the wrong-doer, do wrong thyſelf? Who oughteſt to ſee the law be kept and obſerved, break the law, and turn aſide the due adininiſtration thereof? Surely, from thee, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art chief juſtice of England, other things were expected, both by us and by the people of this nation.</p>
                        <p>And friend, when we were brought before thee and ſtood upon our legal iſſue, and no accuſer or accuſation came in againſt us, as to what we had been wrongfully impriſoned for, and in priſon detained for the ſpace of nine weeks,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:037441_0313_100D8FE568050A78"/>ſhouldeſt not thou have cauſed us to have been acquitted by proclamation? Saith not the law ſo? Oughteſt thou not to have examined the cauſe of our commitment, and there not appearing a lawful cauſe, to have diſcharged us? Is it not the ſubſtance of thy office and duty, to do juſtice according to the law and cuſtom of England? Is not this the end of the adminiſtration of the law? of the general aſſizes? of the gaol-deliveries? of the judges go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circuits? Haſt not thou, by doing otherwiſe, acted contrary to all theſe, and to Magna Charta? which, Cap. 29. ſaith, <q>We ſhall ſell to no man, we ſhall deny or defer to no man, either juſtice or right.</q> Haſt thou not both deferred and denied to us, who had been ſo long oppreſſed, this juſtice and right? And when of thee juſtice we demanded, ſaidſt thou not, <q>If we would be uncovered, thou wouldſt hear us, and do us juſtice?</q> —<q>We ſhall ſelf to no man, we ſhall deny or defer to no man either juſtice or right,</q> ſaith Magna Charta as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: again, <q>We have commanded all our juſtices, that they ſhall from henceforth do even law, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right to all our ſubjects, rich and poor, without having regard to any man's perſon; and without letting to do right for any letters or commandments which may come to them from us, or from any other, or by any other cauſe, &amp;c. upon pain to be at our will, body, lands and goods, to do therewith as ſhall pleaſe us, in caſe they do contrary,</q> ſaith Stat. 20 Edw. III. Cap. 1. Again, <q>Ye ſhall ſwear, that ye ſhall do even law and execution of right to all, rich and poor, without having regard to any perſon; and that ye deny to no man common right by the king's letters, nor none other man's, nor for none other cauſe. And in caſe any letter come to you contrary to the law, that ye do nothing by ſuch letter; but certify the king thereof, and go ſorth to do the law notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe letters. And in caſe ye be from henc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

III. But none of theſe, nor any other law, hath ſuch an expreſſion or condition in it as this. <q>Provided he will put off his hat to you, or be uncovered.</q> Nor doth the law of God ſo ſay, or that your perſons be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; but the contrary. From whence then comes
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:037441_0314_100D8FE78FAF0F78"/>this new law, <q>If ye will be uncovered, I will hear you, and do you juſtice?</q> This hearing complaint of wrong, this doing of juſtice, upon condition; wherein lies the equity and the reaſonableneſs of that? When were theſe fundamental laws repealed, which were the iſſue of ſo much blood and war; which to uphold, coſt the miſeries and blood of the late wars, that we ſhall now be heard, as to right, and have juſtice done us but upon condition, and that too ſuch a trifling one as the putting off the hat? Doth thy ſaying ſo, who art commanded, as aforeſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal them, and make them of no effect, and all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries undergone, and the blood ſhed for them of old and of late years? Whether it be ſo or not indeed, and to the nation, thou haſt made it ſo to us; to whom thou haſt denied the juſtice of our liberty when we were before thee, and no accuſer nor accuſation came in againſt us, and the hearing of the wrong done to us who are innocent, and the doing us right. And bonds haſt thou caſt and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued upon us until this day, under an unreaſonable and cruel gaoler, for not performing that thy condition, for conſcience ſake. But thinkeſt thou that this thine own conditional juſtice maketh void the law? or can it do ſo? or abſolve thee before God or man? or acquit the penalty mentioned in the laws aforeſaid? unto which haſt thou not conſented and ſworn? viz. <q>And in caſe ye be from henceforth found in default in any of the points aforeſaid, ye ſhall be at the king's will, of body, lands, and goods, thereof to be done as ſhall pleaſe him.</q> And is not thy 'ſaying. <q>If ye will be uncovered (or put off your hats) I will hear you, and do you juſtice;</q> and becauſe we could not put them off for conſcience-ſake, thy denying us juſtice, and refuſing to hear us, as to wrong, who had ſo unjuſtly ſuffered, a default in thee againſt the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe laws, yea, an overthrow thereof, for which things ſake (being of the higheſt importance to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of men) ſo juſt, ſo equal, ſo neceſſary thoſe laws were made, and all the proviſions therein? To make a default in any one point of which proviſions, expoſeth to the ſaid penalty. Doſt not thou by this time ſee where thou art? Art thou ſure thou ſhalt never be made to underſtand and feel the juſtice thereof? Is thy ſeat ſo high, and thy fence ſo great, and art thou ſo certain of thy time and ſtation, above all that have gone before thee, whom juſtice hath cut down, and given them their due,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:037441_0315_100D8FE9846221A0"/>that thou ſhalt never be called to an account, nor with its long and ſure ſtroke be reached? Deceive not thyſelf, God is come nearer to judgment than the workers of iniquity in this age imagine, who perſecute and evil-intreat thoſe that witneſs the Juſt and Holy One, for their witneſſing of him, who is come to reign for ever and ever. Saith he not, he will be a ſwiſt witneſs againſt the falſe ſwearers? God is not mocked.</p>
                        <p>Surely friend, that muſt needs be a very great offence, which deprives a man of juſtice, of being heard as to wrong, of the benefit of the law, and of thoſe laws afore-rehearſed; to defend the juſtice and equity of which, a man hath adven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But to ſtand covered (or with the hat on) in conſcience to the command of the Lord, is made by thee ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (which is none in law) and rendered upon us (who are innocent, ſerving the living God) effectual to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us juſtice; though the laws of God, and of man, and the oath, and equity and reaſon ſay the contrary, and on it pronounceth ſuch a penalty. <q>If ye will be uncovered (Uncovered, ſaidſt thou) I will hear you, and do you juſtice:</q> but juſtice we had not, nor were we heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus, Chriſt, who is the higher power, the lawgiver of his people, in our conſciences commanded us not to reſpect perſons; whom to obey we chooſe rather than man. And for our obedience unto him haſt thou caſt us into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and continueſt us there, till this very day; having ſhewed us neither law for it, not ſcripture, nor inſtances of either, nor examples of heathens or others. Friend, Come down to that of God, that is juſt in thee, and conſider, was there ever ſuch a thing as this heard of in this nation? What is become of ſeriouſneſs, of true judgment, and of righteouſneſs! An unrighteous man, ſtanding before thee with his hat off ſhall be heard; but an innocent man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with his hat on in conſcience to the Lord, ſhall neither he heard, nor have juſtice. Is not this regarding of perſons contrary to the laws aforeſaid, and the oath, and the law of God? Underſtand, and judge. Did we not own authority and government oftentimes before the count? Didſt thou not ſay in the court, Thou waſt glad to hear ſo much from us of our owning magiſtracy? Pleaded we not to the indictment, though it was ſuch a new-found one as England never heard of before? Came we not when thou ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ſt for us? Went we not when thou bidſt us go?
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:037441_0316_100D8FEB44144020"/>And are we not ſtill priſoners at thy command and at thy will? If the hat had been ſuch an offence to thee, couldſt thou not have cauſed it to have been taken off, when thou heardſt us ſo often declare, we could not do it in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of the Lord; and that for that cauſe we forbore it, not in contempt of thee, or of authority, nor in diſreſpect to thine or any man's perſon (for we ſaid, we honoured all men in the Lord, and owned authority, which was a terror to evil-doers, and a praiſe to them that do well; and our ſouls were ſubject to the higher powers for conſcience ſake) as thou cauſedſt them to be taken off, and to be kept ſo, when thou calledſt the jury to find us tranſgreſſors without a law? What ado haſt thou made to take away the righteouſneſs of the righteous from him, and to cauſe us to ſuffer further, whom thou kneweſt to have been ſo long wrongfully in priſon contrary to law? Is not liberty of conſcience a natural right? Had there been a law in this caſe, and we bound up in our conſciences that we could not have obeyed it, was not liberty of conſcience there to take place? For where the law ſaith not againſt, there needs no plea of liberty of conſcience: but the law have we not offended; yet in thy will haſt thou cauſed, and doſt thou yet cauſe us to ſuffer for our conſciences, where the law requires no ſuch thing: and yet for liberty of conſcience hath all the blood been ſpilt, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the late wars undergone, and, as the protector ſaith, this government undertaken, to preſerve it; and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right, he ſaith, it is; and he that would have it, he ſaith, ought to give it. And if it be a natural right, as is undeniable, then to attempt to force it, or to puniſh a man for not doing contrary to it, is to act againſt nature: which as it is unreaſonable, ſo it is the ſame as to offer violence to a man's life. And what an offence that is in the law, thou knoweſt; and how, by the common law of England, all acts, agreements and laws, that are againſt nature, are mere nullities: and all the judges cannot make one caſe to be law, that is againſt nature. But put the caſe, our ſtanding with our hats on had been an offence in law, and we wilfully, and in contempt, and not out of conſcience had ſtood ſo (which we deny) yet that is not a ground wherefore we ſhould be denied juſtice, or to be heard, as to the wrong done to us. <q>If ye will not offend in one caſe, I will do you juſtice in another:</q> this is not the language of the law, or of juſtice, which diſtributes to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:037441_0317_100D8FEDD1993FC0"/>one their right; juſtice, to whom juſtice is due; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to whom puniſhment is due. A man who doth wrong, may alſo have wrong done to him; ſhall he not have right, wherein he is wronged, unleſs he right him whom he hath wronged? The law ſaith not ſo; but the wrong-doer is to ſuffer, and the ſufferer of wrong to be righted. Is not otherwiſe to do, a denying, a letting or ſtopping of even law, and execution of juſtice, and a bringing under the penalties aforeſaid? Mind and conſider.</p>
                        <p>And ſhouldſt thou have accuſed, when no witneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt us, as in the particulars of ſtriking Peter Ceely, and diſperſing books (as thou ſaidſt) againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and miniſtry, with which thou didſt falſely accuſe one of us? Saith not the law, <q>The judge ought not to be the accuſer?</q> much leſs a falſe accuſer. And waſt thou not ſuch an one, in affirming, that he diſperſed books againſt magiſtracy and miniſtry, when the books were violently taken out of our chamber, undiſperſed by him, or any of us? Nor didſt thou make it appear in one particular, wherein thoſe books, thou ſo violently didſt cauſe to be taken away, were againſt magiſtracy or miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; or gaveſt one inſtance or reply, when he denied what thou chargedſt therein; and ſpoke to thee to bring forth thoſe books, and make thy charge appear. Is not the ſword of the magiſtrate of God to paſs upon ſuch evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And according to the adminiſtration of the law, ought not accuſations to be by way of indictment, wherein the offence is to be charged, and the law expreſſed, againſt which it is? Can there be an iſſue without an indictment? Or can an indictment be found, before proof be made of the offence charged therein? And haſt not thou herein gone contrary to the law, and the adminiſtration thereof, and thy duty, as a judge? What juſt cauſe of offence gave George Fox to thee, when, upon thy producing a paper concerning ſwearing, ſent by him (as thou ſaidſt) to the grand jury, and requiring him to ſay, Whether it was his hand-writing? he anſwered, <q>Read it up before the country; and when he heard it read, if it were his, he would own it?</q> Is it not equal, and according to law, that what a man is charged with before the country, ſhould be read in the hearing of him and of the country? When a paper is delivered out of a man's hand, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made in it to his prejudice, which, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den looking over it, may not preſently be diſcerned; but
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:037441_0318_100D8FF03445B2D8"/>by hearing it read up, may be better underſtood whether any ſuch alterations have been made therein? Couldſt thou in juſtice have expected, or required him otherwiſe to do? Conſidering alſo, that he was not inſenſible how much he had ſuffered already, being innocent; and what endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours there were uſed to cauſe him further to ſuffer? Was not what he ſaid a plain and ſingle anſwer, and ſufficient in the law? Though (as hath been demonſtrated) contrary to law thou didſt act, and to thy office, in being his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer therein, and producing the paper againſt him. And in his liberty it was, whether he would have made thee any anſwer at all to what thou didſt exhibit, or demand out of the due courſe of law: for to the law anſwer is to be made; not to thy will. Wherefore then waſt thou ſo filled with rage and fury upon that his reply? Calmly, and in the fear of the Lord conſider: Wherefore didſt thou revile him, particularly with the reproachful names of jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler and prevaricator? Wherein did he juggle? Wherein did he prevaricate? Wherefore didſt thou uſe ſuch threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening language, and ſuch menacings to him and us, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou wouldſt ferk us, with ſuch like? Doth not the law forbid reviling, and rage, and fury, and threatening and menacing of priſoners? Soberly mind; is this to act like a judge, or a man? Is not this tranſgreſſion? Is not the ſword of the magiſtrate of God to paſs on this as evil-doing, which the righteous law condemns, and the higher power is againſt, which judgeth for God? Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: <q>Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed, and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of gifts,</q> ſaid Jehoſhaphat to the judges of Judah. Pride, and fury and paſſion, and rage, and reviling, and threatening are not the Lord's: theſe, and the principle out of which they ſpring, are for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and muſt come under the ſword of the magiſtrate of God; and of an ill favour, eſpecially ſuch an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to threaten to ferk us. Is not ſuch a ſaying more becoming a pedant, or ſchoolmaſter with his rod or ferula in his hand, than thee, who art the chief juſtice of the nation, who ſitteſt in the higheſt ſeat of judgment; who oughteſt to give a good example, and ſo to judge, that others may hear and fear? Weight it ſoberly and conſider, Doth not threatening language demonſtrate an inequality
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:037441_0319_100D8FF22A8400B0"/>and partiality in him who ſits as a judge? Is it not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring of a priſoner from ſtanding to and pleading the innocency of his cauſe? Provides not the law againſt it? Saith it not. That irons and all other bonds ſhall be taken from the priſoner, that he may plead without amazement, and with ſuch freedom of ſpirit as if he were not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner? But when he, who is to judge according to the law, ſhall beforehand threaten and menace the priſoner contrary to the law, how can the mind of the priſoner be free, to plead his innocency before him? or expect equal judgment from him, who before he hears him, threatens what he will do to him? Is not this the caſe between thee and us? Is not this the meaſure we have received at thy hands? Haſt thou herein dealt according to law? or to thy duty? or as thou wouldſt be done unto? Let that of God in thy conſcience judge.</p>
                        <p>And didſt not thou ſay, there was a law for putting off the hat; and that thou wouldſt ſhew a law? and didſt not thou often ſo expreſs thyſelf? But didſt thou produce any law? or ſhew where that law might be found? or any judicial precedent, or in what king's reign, when we ſo often deſired it of thee? having never heard of or known any ſuch law, by which thou didſt judge us. Was not what we demanded of thee reaſonable and juſt? Was that a ſavoury anſwer, and according to law, which thou gaveſt us, <q>I am not to carry the law-books at my back, up and down the country; I am not to inſtruct you?</q> Was ever ſuch an expreſſion heard before theſe days to come out of a judge's mouth? Is he not to be of counſel in the law for the priſoner, and to inſtruct him therein? Is it not for this cauſe that the priſoner, in many caſes, is not allowed counſel by the law? In all courts of juſtice in this nation, hath it not been known ſo to have been? And to the priſoner hath not this been often declared, when he hath demanded counſel, alleging his ignorance in the law, by reaſon of which his cauſe might miſcarry, though it were righteous, viz. <q>The court is of counſel for you?</q> Ought not he, that judgeth in the law, to be expert in the law? Couldſt not thou tell by what act of 'parliament it was made, or by what judicial precedent, or in what king's reign, or when it was adjudged ſo by the common law (which are all the grounds the law of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath) had there been ſuch a law, though the words of the law thou couldſt not remember? Surely, to inform
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:037441_0320_100D8FF4DB1F92B0"/>the priſoner when he deſired it, eſpecially as to a law which was never heard of, by which he proceeds to judge him, that he may know what law it is by which he is to be judged, becomes him who judgeth for God: for ſo the law was read to the Jews, by which they were to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea every ſabbath-day; this was the commandment of the Lord. But inſtead thereof to ſay, <q>I am not to carry the law books at my back up and down the country; I  am not to inſtruct you:</q> To ſay, "There is a law," and to ſay, "Thou wilt ſhew it;" and yet not ſhew it, nor to tell where it is to be found; conſider whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſavourineſs, truth, or juſtice?</p>
                        <p>Have not thy whole proceedings againſt us made it evidently to appear that thy deſire was to cauſe us to ſuffer, not to deliver us, who being innocent, ſuffered; to have us aſperſed and reproached before the country, not to have our innocency cleared and vindicated? Doth not the taking away our books as aforeſaid, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing of them in ſuch haſte before our trial, and thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing us with ſomething which thou ſaidſt was contained in them, make it appear that matter was ſought out of them wherewithal to charge us, when the Et Cetera war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would not ſtand in law by which we were committed, and were then upon our delivery according to the due courſe of law? Doth it not further appear, by thy refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to take from our hands a copy of the ſtrange Et Cetera warrant by which we were committed, and of the paper for which we ſtood apprehended, to read it or cauſe it to be read; that ſo our long ſufferings by reaſon of both might be looked into, and weighed in the law, whether juſt or righteous, and the country might as well ſee our innocency and ſufferings without a cauſe, and the manner of dealing with us, as to hear ſuch reports which went of us as great offenders, when we called upon thee often ſo to do, and which thou oughteſt to have done, and ſaidſt, Thou wouldſt do, but didſt it not; nor ſo much as took notice before the country that we had been falſely impriſoned, and had wrongfully ſuffered? But what might aſperſe and charge us thou broughteſt in thyſelf, contrary to law, and didſt call to have us charged therewith. Is not this further manifeſt, in that thou didſt cauſe us on a ſudden to be withdrawn, and the petty jury to be called in with their verdict; whereupon Peter Ceely's falſely accuſing George Fox <q>with telling him privately of a deſign, and
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:037441_0321_100D8FF77654CC58"/>perſuading him to join therein.</q> was by George Fox made ſo clear to be a manifeſt falſehood, and ſo plainly to be perceived, that the cauſe of our ſufferings was not any evil we had done, or law that we had tranſgreſſed, but malice and wickedneſs? And is it not abundantly clear from thy not permitting us to anſwer, and clear our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the many foul ſlanders charged upon us in the new-found indictment, of which no proof was made? But when we were anſwering thereunto, and clearing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereof, thou didſt ſtop us, ſaying, <q>Thou mindedſt not thoſe things, but only the putting off the hat:</q> when as before the country the new-found indictment charged us with thoſe things, and the petty jury brought in their verdict, <q>Guilty of the creſpaſles and contempts montion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein;</q> of which (except as to the hat) not one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or evidence was produced; and as to the hat, not any law or judicial precedent, upon the tranſgreſſion of which all legal indictments are to be grounded? Now the law ſeeks not for cauſes whereby to make the innocent ſuffer; but helpeth him to right who ſuffers wrong, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth the oppreſſed, and ſearcheth out the matter, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of which a man ſtands accuſed be ſo or no; ſeeking judgment and haſtening righteouſneſs: and it ſaith, "The innocent and the righteous ſlay thou not," But whether thou haſt done ſo to us, or the contrary, let the witneſs of God in thee ſearch and judge; as theſe thy fruits do alſo make maniſeſt.</p>
                        <p>And, friend, conſider how abominably wicked, and how highly to be abhorred, denied, and witneſſed againſt, and how contrary to the laws ſuch a proceeding is, as to charge a man with many offences in an indictment, which they who draw the indictment, they who proſecute, and they who find the bill, know to be falſe, and to be put in purpoſely to reproach and wound his good name; whom, with ſome ſinall matter which they can prove, they charge and indict, as is the common practice at this day. Prove but one particular charge in the indictment, and it muſt ſtand (ſay they) for a true bill; though there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many ſalſehoods and lies therein, on ſet purpoſe to wrong him who is maliciouſly proſecuted: this is known to the judges, and almoſt to every man who hath to do with and attends their courts. How contrary is this to the end and righteouſneſs of the law, which clears the innocent and condemns the guilty, and condemneth not
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:037441_0322_100D8FF90B477768"/>the righteous with the wicked! Much it is cried out of; but what reformation is there thereof? How elſe ſhall clerks of aſſize, and other clerks of courts fill up their bags (out of which perhaps their maſter muſt have a ſecret conſideration) and be heightened in pride and impudence; that even in open court they take upon them to check and revile men without reproof, when a few lines might ſerve inſtead of an hundred? How elſe ſhall the ſpirit that is in men, that luſteth unto envy, malice, ſtrife, and contention, be cheriſhed and nouriſhed, to feed the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and dependants on courts with the bread of men's children and the ruin of their families, to maintain their long ſuits and malicious contentions! For a judge to ſay, <q>I mind not theſe things; I'll not hear you; clear your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of what you are falſely accuſed of: one thing I mind in your charge, the reſt are but matter of form, ſet there to render you ſuch wicked men before the country, as the thing that is to be proved againſt you is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make out.</q> Oh! abominable wickedneſs, and perverting of the righteous end of the law, which is ſo careful and tender of every man's peace and innocency!

And that which was made to preſerve the righteous, and to puniſh the wicked, perverted to the puniſhing of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous and the preſerving of the wicked! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, life for life, burning for burning, wound for wound, a ſtripe for a ſtripe; he that accuſeth a man falſely, to ſuffer the ſame as he ſhould have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who was falſely accuſed, if he had been guilty. This ſaith the righteous law of God; which is agreable to that of God in every man's conſcience. Are not ſuch forms of iniquity to be denied, which are ſo contrary to the law of God and man? Which ſerve for the gender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtrife, and the kindling of contention? And of this nature was not that, with which thou didſt cauſe us to be indicted? And this form didſt not thou uphold, in not permitting us to anſwer to the many foul ſlanders therein; ſaying, "Thoſe things thou mindedſt not?" Will not the wrath of God be revealed from heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs; who are ſo far from the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that they have not the form, but the form of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which is ſet up and held up inſtead of and as a
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:037441_0323_100D8FFA9F98DA18"/>law, to overthrow and deſtroy the righteouſneſs of the righteous, and ſo to ſhut him up as by the law he can never get out? Is not the cry, thinkeſt thou, gone up? <q>It is time for thee to ſet to thine hand, O Lord, for thine enemies have made void thy law!</q> Draws not the hour nigh? Fills not up the meaſure of iniquity apace? Surely the day is coming, and haſteneth. Warned ye have been from the preſence, and by the mouth of the Lord; and clear will he be when he cometh to judgment, and upright when he giveth ſentence.

                        </p>
                        <p>And, friend, ſhouldſt thou have given judgment againſt us (wherein thou didſt fine us twenty marks a-piece, and impriſonment till payment) without cauſing us, being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, to be brought before thee, to hear the judgment, and to move what we had to ſay in arreſt of judgment? Is not this contrary to the law, as is manifeſt to thoſe who underſtand the proceedings thereof? Is not the priſoner to be called before judgment be given? And is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment to be read? and the verdict thereupon? And is not liberty to be given him to move in arreſt of judgment? And if it be a juſt exception in the law, ought not there to be an arreſt of judgment? For the indictment may not be drawn up according to law, and may be wrong placed, and the offence charged therein may not be a crime in law; or the jury may have been corrupted or menaced, or ſet on by ſome of the juſtices; with other particulars, which are known to be legal and juſt exceptions. And the judgment ought to be in the priſoner's hearing, not behind his back; as if the judge were ſo conſcious of the error thereof, that he dares not give it to the face of the priſoner. But theſe privileges of the law, this juſtice we
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:037441_0324_100D8FFD2FBB3D00"/>(who had ſo long and ſo greatly ſuffered contrary to law) received not, nor could have at thy hands; no, not ſo much as a copy or ſight of that long and new-found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment (which in England was never heard of before, nor that the matter contained therein was an offence in law, nor ever was there any law or judicial precedent that made it ſo) though two friends of ours, in our names and behalfs, that night, the next day, and the day following often deſired it of the clerk of the aſſize, and his aſſiſtant and ſervants; but they could not have it, nor ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as to ſee it. And it is like it was not unknown or unperceived by thee, that, had we been called as we ought to have been, or had known when it was to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, three or four words might have made a ſufficient legal arreſt of the judgment given on that new-found indictment, and the verdict thereupon. Therefore as our liberties, who are innocent, have not in thy account been worth the minding, and eſteemed fit for nothing but to be trampled under foot and deſtroyed; ſo, if we find fault with what thou haſt done, thou haſt taken care that no door be left open to us in the law, but a writ of error: the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, and the judgment to be given thereon, is to be had only where thyſelf is chief; of whom ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is to be made, and the error aſſigned for the reverſe of thy judgment. And what the fruit of that may be well expected to be, by what we have already mentioned as having received at thy hands, thou haſt given us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. And here thou mayſt think thou haſt made thyſelf ſecure and ſufficiently barred up our way of relief, againſt whom (though thou kneweſt we had done nothing contrary to the law or worthy of bonds, much leſs of the bonds and ſufferings we had ſuſtained) thou haſt proceeded, as hath been rehearſed; notwithſtanding that thou art, as are all the judges of the nation, intruſted not with a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, but to adminiſter juſtice, and to do <q>even law and execution to all, high and low, rich and poor, without having regard to any man's perſon;</q> and art ſworn ſo to do; and wherein thou doſt contrary art liable to puniſhment, as ceaſing from being a judge, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wrong doer and an oppreſſor; which what it is to be many of thy predeceſſors have underſtood, ſome by death, others by fine and impriſonment.

                  <p>By this letter the reader may obſerve how contrary to law we were made to ſuffer; but the Lord, who ſaw the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our hearts to him, and knew the innocency of our cauſe, was with us in our ſufferings, bore up our ſpirits, and made them eaſy to us; and gave us opportunities of publiſhing his name and truth amongſt the people: ſo that ſeveral of the town came to be convinced, many were made loving to us, and friends from divers parts came to viſit us; amongſt whom were two out of Wales, who had been juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of peace. Judge Hagget's wife, of Briſtol, came to viſit us, who was convinced, with ſeveral of her children; and her huſband was very kind and ſerviceable to friends, and had a great love to God's people, which he retained to his death.</p>
                  <p>In Cornwall, Devonſhire, Dorſetſhire, and Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, truth began mightily to ſpread; many were turned to Chriſt Jeſus and his free teaching: for many friends that came to viſit us were drawn to declare the truth in thoſe
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:037441_0326_100D900112D85B28"/>counties; which made the prieſts and profeſſors rage, and they ſtirred up the magiſtrates to enſnare friends. They ſet up watches in the ſtreets and highways, on pretence of taking up ſuſpicious perſons; under which colour they ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and took up friends coming to viſit us in priſon; which they did, that they might not paſs up and down in the Lord's ſervice. But that which they thought to have ſtopped the truth by, was the means of ſpreading it ſo much the more; for then friends were frequently moved to ſpeak to one conſtable, and t'other officer, and to the juſtices they were brought before; which cauſed the truth to ſpread the more in all their pariſhes. And when friends were got among the watches, it would be a fortnight or three weeks before they could get out of them again; for no ſooner had one conſtable taken and carried them before the juſtices, and they had diſcharged them, but another would take them up and carry them before other juſtices: which put the country to a great deal of needleſs trouble and charges.</p>
                  <p>As Thomas Rawlinſon was coming out of the north to viſit us, a conſtable in Devonſhire took him up; and at night took twenty ſhillings out of his pocket: and after being thus robbed he was caſt into Exeter gaol. They caſt Henry Pollexfen alſo into priſon in Devonſhire, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his being a jeſuit; who had been a juſtice of peace for the moſt part of forty years before. Many friends were cruelly beaten by them; nay ſome clothiers that were but going to mill with their cloth, and others about their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occaſions, they took up and whipped; though men of about eighty or an hundred pounds by the year, and not above four or five miles from their families.</p>
                  <p>The mayor of Lanceſton took up all he could, and caſt them into priſon. He would ſearch ſubſtantial grave wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, their petticoats and their head-cloaths. A young man coming to ſee us, I drew up all the groſs, inhuman, and unchriſtian actions of the mayor, gave it him, and bid him ſeal it up, and go out again the back way; and then come into the town through the gates. He did ſo, and the watch took him up, and carried him before the mayor; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſearched his pockets and found the letter; wherein he ſaw all his actions characterized; which ſhamed him ſo, that from that time he meddled little with the Lord's ſervants.</p>
                  <p>From the ſenſe I had of the ſnare that was laid, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief intended in ſetting up thoſe watches at that time to
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:037441_0327_100D9002A4591978"/>ſtop and take up friends, it came upon me to give forth the following lines, as—</p>

                        <p>ALL ye powers of the earth, Chriſt is come to reign, and is among you, and ye know him not; who doth enlighten every one of you, that ye all through him might believe in him; who is the light, who treads the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alone without the city, and whoſe feet are upon it. Therefore ſee all, and examine with the light what ye are ripe for; for the preſs is ready for you.</p>
                        <p>Before honour is humility. You that would have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour before ye have humility, are ye not as the heathen are? Ye would have honour before ye have humility; did not all the perſecutors that ever were upon the earth want this humility? They wanted the honour, and yet would have the honour before they had the humility, and had learned that. So ye that are out of humility, are out of the honour, and ye are not to have the honour who have not the humility; for before honour is humility: mark, before it.</p>
                        <p>Ye pretend liberty of conſcience, yet one ſhall not carry a letter to a friend, nor men viſit their friends, nor viſit priſoners, nor carry a book about them, either for their own uſe or for their friends. Men ſhall not ſee their friends; but watches are ſet up againſt them to catch and ſtop them: and theſe muſt be well armed too againſt an innocent people, that have not ſo much as a ſtick in their hands, who are in ſcorn called Quakers. Yet by ſuch as ſet up theſe watches is pretended liberty of conſcience; who take up them whoſe conſciences are exerciſed towards God and men, who worſhip God in ſpirit and truth; which they that are out of the light call hereſy. Theſe ſet up watches againſt thoſe they in ſcorn call Quakers, becauſe they confeſs and witneſs the true light, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every one that cometh into the world, amongſt people as they paſs through the country, or among their friends. This is the dangerous doctrine which watchmen are ſet up againſt, to ſubdue error, as they call it, which is the light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world; him by whom the world was made, who was glorified with the Father before the world began. For thoſe whom they in ſcorn call Quakers, have they ſet up their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:037441_0328_100D90054A472E08"/>able men, well armed, to take them up that bear this teſtimony either in words, books, or letters. So that is the light you hate, which enlightens every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world; and theſe that witneſs to this light you put in priſon; and after you have impriſoned them, you ſet up your watches to take all up that go to viſit them, and to impriſon them alſo: ſo that by ſetting up your watches, ye would ſtop all relief from coming to priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Therefore this is the word of the Lord God to you, and a charge to you all, in the preſence of the living God of heaven and earth: every man of you being enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a light that cometh from Chriſt, the ſaviour of people's ſouls; to this light, all take heed, that with it you may ſee Chriſt from whom the light cometh, you may ſee him to be your Saviour by whom the world was made, who ſaith, Learn of me. But if ye hate this light, ye hate Chriſt who doth enlighten you all, that through him you might believe. But not believing in the light, nor bringing your deeds to the light, which will make them manifeſt and reprove them, this becomes your condemner, even the light. Remember you are warned in your life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; for this light is your way to ſalvation, if you walk in it; and this light is your condemner, if you reject and hate it. You can never come to Chriſt, the Second Prieſt, until you come to the light which the Second Prieſt hath enlightened you withal. So ye that come not to the light, ye go to the prieſts that take tithes, as did the firſt prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and ſo hale out of your ſynagogues and temples as that prieſthood did which took tithes: which thoſe of the ſecond prieſthood did not. Was there ever ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration! Or did ever ſuch a generation of men appear as doth now in this age, who are ſo full of madneſs, envy, and perſecution, that they ſtand up in watches, with bills and weapons, againſt the truth, to perſecute it, as the towns and countries declare; which rings as Sodom, and like Gomorrah! And this hath its liberty, and truth is ſtood againſt; to reprove ſin is accounted a breach of the peace, as thoſe ſay who are out of the truth, and ſet up their watches againſt it.</p>

                        <p>WHEREAS there was a warrant granted the laſt ſeſſions holden at Exon, on the eighteenth day of the fifth month, 1656, which warrant is <q>For the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and taking up all ſuch as are Quakers, or call themſelves Quakers, or go under the notion of Quakers;</q> 'and is directed to the chief conſtables, to be ſent by them to the petty conſtables, requiring them to ſet watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, able men with bills, to take up all ſuch Quakers as aforeſaid; and whereas in your ſaid warrant you ſpeak of the Quakers ſpreading ſeditious books and papers; I anſwer, They, whom ye in ſcorn call Quakers, have no ſeditious books or papers; but their books are againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſeditious men, ſeditious books, ſeditious teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſeditious ways. Thus ye have numbered honeſt men, godly men, holy men, men that fear God, among beggars, rogues, and vagabonds; putting no difference between the precious and the vile. You are not fit to judge, who have ſet up your bills, and armed your men to ſtand up together in battle againſt innocent people, the lambs of Chriſt, who have not lifted up an hand againſt you. But if ye were ſenſible of the ſtate of your own country, your cities, your towns, your villages, how the cry of them is like Gomorrah, the ring like Sodom, and the ſound like the old world, where all fleſh had corrupted its way, which God overthrew with the flood; if you did conſider this with yourſelves, you would find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to turn the ſword againſt, and not againſt the lambs of Chriſt, and not make a mock of the innocent, that ſtand a witneſs againſt all ſin and unrighteouſneſs in your towns and ſteeple-houſes. Noah, the eighth perſon, a preacher of righteouſneſs, was grieved with the filthy converſation of the wicked: ſo are we now. Juſt Lot was grieved with their-unmerciful deeds, and the filthy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Sodom. And were not theſe hated of the world, and of them that lived in filthineſs? And whereas you ſpeak of thoſe you in ſcorn call Quakers, that they are a grief to thoſe whom you call pious and religious people, and their religion; ſuch as are in the religion that is vain, whoſe
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:037441_0330_100D90093829BF20"/>tongues are not bridled, I believe the Quakers are a grief to; but are not a grief to ſuch as are in the pure religion, which keepeth unſpotted of the world; which ſets not up bills, nor watches, to maintain it by the world; for they are not of the world, who are in the pure religion, which keeps them unſpotted of the world: mark, the <q>pure religion, which keeps unſpotted of the world.</q> But ſuch as are in the religion that is not pure, who have a form of godlineſs, and not the power, ſuch as you call pious, the truth itſelf to ſuch was always a grief; and ſo it is in this age. And now your fruits appear, the end of your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and profeſſion, and what you poſſeſs; but you are in the error, and have been but in the profeſſion, out of the poſſeſſion of the Spirit, who are not in the Spirit of truth. For where did that ever ſet bounds, and number the juſt and innocent with the wicked? But the wicked ſet bounds and limits to the juſt, and numbered them among the wicked; yea, all manner of evil they ſpoke of them, as ye are doing now of us. According as it was foretold in the ſcripture, ſuch as tremble at the word of God, you caſt out and hate, you that have your temple-worſhip. You ſay, the Quakers come to diſturb you in your churches. Was it not the practice of the apoſtles to go into the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and temples, to witneſs againſt the prieſthood that took tythes? Was it not the practice of the Jews to hale them out, perſecute them, and ſtone them, that witneſſed Chriſt the ſecond prieſt, and went to bring people off from the firſt prieſthood? Was it not the practice of the prophets to go and cry againſt the high places? And was it not the practice of the Jews, when they were back-ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and of the heathen, to impriſon and perſecute the prophets, and ſend after them into other countries? Is not this your practice now, who are holding up your high places erected by the Papiſts, which ye now call your churches; where ye beat and perſecute? What kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people are you, that are filled with ſo much mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Did not Paul confeſs he was mad while he was in your practice, haling, beating, priſoning, putting out of the ſynagogues, having his authority from the chief prieſts? And are not the chief prieſts the cauſe of this? Was there ever ſuch a cry made in any age paſt, as there is now in the pulpits, railing againſt an innocent people, who lift not up an hand againſt you; and who are indeed the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that are of the pure religion, who fear God, and

Do not the miniſters of God ſay, that the ſcriptures are a declaration, which you call the word? Do not you rob Chriſt of his title, and of his honour, and give it to the letter, and ſhew yourſelves out of the doctrine of the miniſters of God, who called the ſcriptures by the name of writings and treatiſes, and declarations; and ſaid, Chriſts name is called the Word of God? Are not you here in the error you ſpeak of, which is common talk among you? There was talk among ſome of you of your goſpel-ſhining. Doth the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel perſecute? Did ever any of thoſe that did poſſeſs it caſt into priſon, and not ſuffer others to viſit them? Are you like Chriſtians in this, or like heathen, who ſet bounds and watches over the land, that they ſhould not paſs to viſit thoſe in priſon? Was ever the like heard in any age? Search and ſee, if you have not outſtript them all in your watches, if not in your manner of perſecution, and in your impriſonments. Oh! never talk that we are a grief to them that are in the pure religion.</p>
                        <p>And whereas in your warrant we are repreſented as diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to government; I ſay, the law, that is a terror to the evil-doer, we own; the higher power, to which the ſoul muſt be ſubject; but we deny the evil-doer, the malicious man reigning, and the envious man ſeeking for his prey, whoſe envy is againſt the innocent; who raiſeth up the country againſt honeſt men, and ſo becomes a trouble to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in raiſing them up to take the innocent: but that we leave to the Lord to judge. Your falſe accuſations of hereſy and blaſphemy we deny. You ſhould have laid them down in particulars, that people might have ſeen them; and not have ſlandered us behind our backs. The law ſaith, The crime ſhould be mentioned in the warrant. Then for your ſaying. <q>We deny the godly miniſters to be a true miniſtry of Chriſt;</q> that is falſe; for we ſay, The godly miniſters are the miniſters of Chriſt. But which of your miniſters dare ſay that they are cruly godly? And for your charging us with ſeducing many weak peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is falſe alſo; we ſeduce none. But you, that deny the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, are ſeduced from the anointing which ſhould teach you; and if ye would be taught by it, ye would not need that any man ſhould teach you. But ſuch as are taught by the anointing which abideth in them, and deny
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:037441_0332_100D900CE4582748"/>man's teaching, theſe ye call ſeducers, quite contrary to John's doctrine, 1. Joh. 2. That which is truth, ye call ſeducing; and that which he calls ſeducing, you call truth. Read the latter part of the chapter. I warn you all from the Lord God of glory, ſet not any bound againſt him. Limit not the Holy One of Iſrael; for the Lord is riſing in power and great glory, who will rule the nations with a rod of iron, which to him are but as the drop of a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. He that meaſures the waters in the hollow of his hand, will daſh nations together as a potter's veſſel. And know, you that are found in this his day blaſpheming his work which he hath brought forth, calling it blaſphemy, fighting againſt it, ſetting up your carnal weapons, making your bonds ſtrong; God will break aſunder that which your carnal policy hath invented, and which by your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons ye would uphold, and make you know there is a God in heaven, who carries his lambs in his arms, which are come among wolves, and are ready to be torn in pieces in every place, yea, in your ſteeple-houſes; where people have appeared without reaſon and natural affection. Therefore all ye petty conſtables, ſheriffs, and juſtices, take warning; take heed what ye do againſt the lambs of Chriſt; for Chriſt is come, and coming, who will give to every one of you a reward according to your works, you that have the letter, which ſpeaks of Chriſt; who are perſecuting that which the ſcripture ſpeaks of: ſo your fruits make you manifeſt. Therefore every one, ſheriffs, juſtices, conſtables, &amp;c. conſider what ye poſſeſs, and what a profeſſion ye are now in, that all theſe carnal weapons are ſet up againſt the innocent, yea, againſt the truth; which ſhews, that ye have not the ſpiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: and that ye want the counſel of Gamaliel, yea, ye want the counſel of ſuch a man among you, who ſaid, <q>Let the apoſtles alone: if it be of God, it will ſtand; if it be not, it will come to nought.</q> But ye may ſee yourſelves, on the contrary, in the ſpirit of them that came with Judas, with ſwords and ſtaves from the chief prieſts againſt Chriſt: ſtill it is againſt Chriſt, where he is made manifeſt. Paul (while Saul) went againſt him, though he and the Jews profeſſed a Chriſt that was to come: yet Paul perſecuted him, where he was manifeſted in his ſaints. So ye profeſs a Chriſt that is come, but perſecute him where he is manifeſt. You that have the letter, the high places, the ſynagogues, you perſecute
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:037441_0333_100D900F33E1E028"/>him where he is made manifeſt in his ſaints, as the Jews did. Thoſe who were in the letter, out of the life, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them that were in the life of that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in the letter: ſo do you perſecute them that are in the life, and are yourſelves ſtrangers to it; as your fruits make appear. You have numbered the people of God amongſt tranſgreſſors; but have you priſoned any of the rogues and tranſgreſſors you ſpeak of? You have priſoned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and let the others go free.</p>

                  <p>When I had ſent abroad the foregoing, ſo great a ſenſe came upon me of the veil of darkneſs that was over the prieſts and profeſſors of chriſtianity, that I was moved to give forth the following, as an awakening warning to them:</p>

                     <body>
                        <p>BLINDNESS hath happened to the profeſſed chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of the letter now-a-days, as blindneſs happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Jews; who profeſſed the letter, but owned not the life, which the letter ſpeaks of: as the chriſtians now, to whom this blindneſs hath happened, who profeſs the ſcripture, but own not the life which the ſcripture ſpeaks of. For againſt the life the Jews ſtood, who profeſſed the letter of the ſcripture; but they were blind, they gathered counſel againſt the life: they were in an uproar, when the babe was born in Bethlehem, Herod and all the chief prieſts. And Herod ſought to deſtroy all the young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Bethlehem, yet miſſed the babe; Herod, that fox, though he put John to death. You may ſee here, how the literal profeſſors ſtood up, not for the truth, but quite againſt it. Furthermore, the chief prieſts conſulted together how they might take Jeſus by ſubtilty, and put him to death; mark, by their ſubtilty. The profeſſors of a Chriſt that was to come, they preached of a Meſſias, of a Chriſt, of a Saviour; but denied the life. When he was made manifeſt, the chief prieſts, who were gathered together with the council, ſaid, His diſciples had ſtolen him away by night; and gave large ſums of money to the ſoldiers to declare this. Likewiſe in the day, when the children of Iſrael were in Egypt, and they with their children began to ſpread and multiply, "Come." ſaid the Egyptians. <q>let us deal wiſely with them to afflict them, and tax them:</q> which held till the Lord overthrew their oppreſſors, and brought his ſeed by his mighty power from under the oppreſſor, and exalted his ſon above all;
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:037441_0334_100D9011206DE528"/>though the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain things. He made his power known, that all might ſee that there was no God upon the earth but himſelf. This power now hath brought forth the work of the Lord! Many, who are turned to the light, Chriſt, have received the power of God, and are thereby become the ſons of God. Now this birth, that is born <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This is the birth that all the wicked world is enraged againſt. Againſt this they ſet their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, this birth, brought forth by the mighty God of Jacob, who rides upon the high places of the earth. This is the birth that the profeſſed chriſtians without the life in our days rage againſt, and lay out all their wiſdom about. Are not the chief prieſts and wiſe men of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting together how they may deſtroy this birth? Is not this the birth that is baniſhed out of your hearts, you that profeſs the ſcripture, and are talkers of it, but do not own the light and life which the ſcripture ſpeaks of, as the Jews would not; and ſo will not have Chriſt to reign over you, as they would not? Do you not hale out of your ſynagogues, and before magiſtrates? Do you not herein fulfil Chriſt's words, who ſaid to his diſciples, They ſhould be haled out of the ſynagogues, and before rulers? Do you not perſecute them from city to city? Do you not almoſt ſill your priſons with them? And now ſet your watches, that none ſhould viſit them, whom you have put into priſon? Is not this an unchriſtian ſpirit? How can you for ſhame ſay, you are upholders of truth? Or how can you for ſhame ſay, that truth hath been profeſſed among you? We grant that you have talked of it. And how can you for ſhame ſay, <q>The goſpel ſhines among you,</q> when you will not own it, the life of it; when you call it error, and the evil ſeed? Yea, the very truth, the very life of truth ye have blaſphemed againſt now, as the Jews did againſt Chriſt, calling him a devil; you now call it error, and the evil ſeed, and ſtand up againſt it, and turn the ſword againſt it. It was the Jews in their days who turned the ſword againſt Chriſt; ſo it is in theſe days the chriſtian profeſſors of the ſcripture, but out of the life that gave it forth; as thoſe were the Jews outward in the fleſh, not the Jews in the Spirit. Is it not a ſhame to the miniſters of the goſpel (as they are called) that they
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:037441_0335_100D9012F6317190"/>'can find no better way to maintain that which they call the truth, and their goſpel, than by carnal weapons, ſtocks, priſons, whips, watches, and wards, and powers of the earth? Were theſe the apoſtles weapons? Carnal watches, ſtocks, priſons, and halings out of the ſynagogues, when they came to ſpeak?

                           </gap>it you have. Never talk of defending truth with that which is againſt truth. For are you not ſetting up the rabble of the world againſt it? Do they not join with you, with ſwords and ſtaves againſt it? Is this the life of chriſtians? Is not this the life of error, and of the evil ſeedſman? Surely ye would find work enough, if ye were in the fear of the Lord, to turn your ſwords againſt the profaneneſs, the oaths and wickedneſs, that are in your ſtreets and highways. How do they ring like Sodom, and give a ſound like Gomorrah! But theſe are become a prey in this age, that reprove in your gate ſin, wickedneſs, and profaneneſs. They are become your by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word. Againſt them your councils are gathered, them you caſt into priſon, and hale them out of your ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues: and caſt them likewiſe into priſon that write and ſpeak againſt it; and ſet your guards to ſtop and hinder any from viſiting them whom you caſt into priſon, and give them the names of vagabonds and wanderers. Was ever the like heard in the days of the heathen againſt the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, who, witneſſed the goſpel? Did they ſet guards and watches in every town, in every city, to take the diſciples, the brethren, the believers, that heard the apoſtles were caſt into priſon, and came to ſee what they wanted? Shew ye not as much rage and fury now in your age, as was in thoſe in that age? How can you talk of the goſpel, and of defending the goſpel, when you are ſetting guards and watches againſt it, are defending that which ſtands againſt it; and the lambs of Chriſt are almoſt torn to pieces amongſt you, who are like wolves? for the Lord hath now ſent his lambs among wolves. Have not you profeſſed the words of Chriſt, the prophets and apoſtles, as the Jews had long profeſſed the ſcriptures, the words of Moſes, and the prophets, that propheſied of Chriſt then to come; and ſtood againſt him when he was come? as you do in this day of his reign, in this day of his glorious goſpel, who are perſecuting the meſſengers of it, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning them, perſecuting them in your ſtreets and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and ſetting up your watches againſt them who bring
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:037441_0336_100D9014E7ABDA70"/>the glad tidings of peace to your ſouls; whoſe feet are beautiful atop of the mountains; mark, atop of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; that againſt which the mountains rage and ſwell; but God will make them to melt; the Sun is riſen, which will make them to melt. God will cleave the rocks and mountains aſunder, and make the hills to bow perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for his Son he will exalt, and his glory he will give to him, and not to another. Therefore be awakened, ye rulers of the earth, and take counſel of the Lord. Take not counſel together againſt him. Make not your bonds ſtrong. Set not yourſelves in battle againſt him: for ye will be found but as briers and thorns before him, which the fire ſhall conſume. Therefore be awakened, all ye talkers of the ſcripture, that gather yourſelves together by your multitudes and meetings, and have had your teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but not having the Spirit that gave forth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Lord God of glory, the Father of ſpirits, will ſcatter you. All your bonds will not hold you together, who are out of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace. The threſhing inſtrument is gone forth, which will beat the hills to pieces. Sion is riſen to threſh. Out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mountain is the trumpet ſounded. Stand not up againſt the Lord: for all nations are to him as the drop of a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. He that meaſures the waters in the hollow of his hand, and weighs the earth in ſcales, the Lord of Hoſts is his name, who is now riſen and riſing, to plead the cauſe of the innocent, and is exalting his Son, and bringing his ſheep to him. Now are they ſeen and known, that feed upon wind, that are lifted up, given up to believe lies; who report, and ſay, "Report, and we will report it." Now are they ſeen, who have a form of godlineſs, but deny the power: ſo Chriſt is denied; for Chriſt is the power of God. And the power being denied by you, that have a form of godlineſs, and the words of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the goſpel is denied: for the goſpel is the power of God. Thus it is among you that have the knowledge and wiſdom that is ſenſual, earthly, and deviliſh. Doth it not appear ſo? Let your gaols and watches witneſs your fruits in every town. Your wiſdom is earthly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and deviliſh. You have a knowledge and wiſdom, but not that which is from above; for that is pure and gentle, ſo is not your knowledge. But to know Chriſt, is life eternal. Your fruits have manifeſted, that you are not of this; and ſo out of the power of God, which
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:037441_0337_100D901736A46F10"/>is the croſs of Chriſt; for you are found in the world, out of the power of God, out of the croſs of Chriſt, perſecuting. So that which doth perſecute, and ſend forth writings and decrees to ſtop and take up all, and ſet watches, and prepare bonds to limit the Lord; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon and perſecute, and ſuffer none to go and viſit them: this ſhews you are not chriſtians, but ſtand againſt the chriſtian life, which brings to love enemies. Where is your love to your enemies who are thus perſecuting your friends? <q>He came to his own, and his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not.</q> Here is a turning the ſword againſt the juſt. Do you ſhew here a chriſtian's life, or yourſelves chriſtians, who are filling your gaols with the chriſtians in the Spirit, you that are in the letter (in ſhadows) as the Jews in the letter did, put the Jews in the Spirit into priſon? Is not this the fruit in our days of chriſtians in the letter, to put chriſtians in the Spirit into priſon? Doth not this ſhew that your decrees, which you have ſent forth, proceed from death, who thus act againſt the life, and them that are in it; which the ſcriptures were given forth from? Is it not here, as it was with Saul, when he went to perſecute, to hale to priſon, and bind all that he could ſind calling upon that name, who were chriſtians in the life, the Spirit, ſuch as you are perſecuting, becauſe they are in the life, though you profeſs their words? Are not your decrees gone forth from the ſame ſpirit of envy, againſt the ſame Spirit of Chriſt they were in? Is it not manifeſt to all that fear God, and to the ſober-minded and honeſt-hearted people, that ſee your practices, your decrees, your letters, to ſtop, to moleſt, to hinder, to impriſon them that are moved of the Lord to do his will, or to go to viſit priſoners whom you have impriſoned? Doth this ſhew you to have a ſpirit like Paul, yea, or nay? Are you not quite contrary, like them that perſecuted Paul? The day hath declared it. To that of God in you all I ſpeak, which ſhall witneſs it at the laſt day, the day of judgment. Perſecution was blind in all ages; and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly led it: yet perſecution got always a form or pretence of godlineſs, a talk of religion, as in the days of Moſes, of Jeremy, of Chriſt, and of the apoſtles. "Come," ſaith the council, <q>let us cruſh them while they are young, they have almoſt overſpread the nation in every corner.</q> This is as much as to ſay. <q>Let us put this birth to death, as Pharaoh and Herod did the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>

For you may read what numbers came out of Egypt! and what multitudes followed Chriſt! Therefore with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration read theſe lines, and not with fury.

                  <p>We were continued in priſon till the next aſſize; before which divers friends, both men and women, were ſent to priſon, who had been taken by the watches. When the aſſize was come, ſeveral of theſe were called before the judge, and indicted: and though the gaoler brought them into court, yet they indicted them, that they came in 'by force of arms, and in an hoſtile manner;' and the judge ſined them, becauſe they would not put off their hats. But we were not called before the judges any more.</p>
                  <p>Great work we had, and ſervice for the Lord, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the aſſizes, and after, amongſt profeſſors and people of all ſorts: for many came to ſee us, and to reaſon with us. Elizabeth Trelawny of Plymouth (daughter of one called a baronet) being convinced, the prieſts, profeſſors, and ſome great perſons of her kindred, were exaſperated, and wrote letters to her. She being a wiſe and tender woman, and fearing to give them any advantage, ſent their letters to me; which I anſwered, and returned them to her again, for her to ſend the anſwers to them. Which ſhe did: till growing in the power, Spirit, and wiſdom of God, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came able to anſwer the wiſeſt prieſt and profeſſor of them
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:037441_0339_100D901AD5AD9750"/>all; and had dominion over them in the truth, through the power of the Lord, by which ſhe was kept faithful to her death.</p>
                  <p>While I was in priſon here, the Baptiſts and Fifth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-man propheſied. That this year Chriſt ſhould come, and reign upon earth a thouſand years. And they looked upon this reign to be outward: when he was come inwardly in the hearts of his people, to reign and rule; where theſe profeſſors would not receive him. So they failed in their prophecy and expectation, and had not the poſſeſſion of him. But Chriſt is come, and doth dwell and reign in the hearts of his people. Thouſands, at the door of whoſe hearts he hath been knocking, have opened to him; and he is come in, and doth ſup with them, and they with him; the heavenly ſupper with the heavenly and ſpiritual man. So many of theſe Baptiſts and Monarchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people turned the greateſt enemies to the followers of Chriſt: but he reigns in the hearts of his ſaints over all their envy.</p>
                  <p>At the aſſize divers juſtices came to us, and were pretty civil, and reaſoned of the things of God ſoberly; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a pity to us. Captain Fox, governor of Pendennis Caſtle, came and looked me in the ſace, and ſaid never a word; but went to his company, and told them, <q>He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</q> ſaw a ſimpler man in his life.

Let all nations hear the ſound by word or writing. Spare no place, ſpare no tongue, nor pen; but be obedient to the Lord God: go through the work; be valiant for the truth upon earth; tread and trample upon all that is contrary. Ye have the power, do not abuſe it; and ſtrength and preſence of the Lord; eye it, and the wiſdom; that with it you may all be ordered to the glory of the Lord God. Keep in the dominion; keep in the power over all deceit; tread over them in that, which lets you ſec to the world's end, and the utmoſt parts of the earth. Reign and rule with Chriſt, whoſe ſceptre and throne are now ſet up, whoſe dominion is over all to the ends of the earth; whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion, his throne an everlaſting throne, his kingdom an everlaſting kingdom, his power above all powers. Therefore this is the word of the Lord to you all: "Keep in the wiſdom of God," that ſpreads over all the earth; the wiſdom of the creation, that is pure from above, not deſtructive. For now ſhall ſalvation go out of Zion, to judge the mount of Eſau; now ſhall the law go forth from Jeruſalem, to anſwer the principle of God in all; to hew down all inventors and inventions. For all the princes of the earth are but as air to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, which you are in, and have taſted of: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore live in it, that is the word of the Lord to you all; do not abuſe it; keep down and low; and take heed of falſe joys, that will change.</p>
                        <p>Bring all into the worſhip of God. Plow up the fallow ground. Threſh and get out the corn; that the ſeed, the wheat, may be gathered into the barn: that to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all people may come; to Chriſt, who was before the
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:037441_0341_100D901F59A59510"/>world was made. For the chaff is come upon the wheat by tranſgreſſion. He that treads it out is out of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, fathoms tranſgreſſion, puts a difference between the precions and the vile, can pick out the wheat from the tares, and gather into the garner; ſo brings to the lively hope the immortal ſoul into God, out of which it came. None worſhip God but who come to the principle of God, which they have tranſgreſſed. None are plowed up but he who comes to the principle of God in him, that he hath tranſgreſſed. Then he doth ſervice as to God; then is the planting, watering, and increaſe from God. So the miniſters of the Spirit muſt miniſter to the Spirit that is in priſon, which hath been in captivity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every one; that with the Spirit of Chriſt people may be led out of captivity up to God, the Father of Spirits, to ſerve him, and have unity with him, with the ſcriptures, and one with another. This is the word of the Lord to you all, a charge to you all in the preſence of the living God; Be patterns, be examples in all countries, places, iſlands, nations, where-eyer you come; that your life and conduct may preach among all ſorts of people, and to them. Then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, anſwering that of God in every one; whereby in them ye may be a bleſſing, and make the witneſs of God in them to bleſs you: then to the Lord God you ſhall be a ſweet ſavour, and a bleſſing.</p>
                        <p>Spare no deceit. Lay the Sword upon it; go over it. Keep yourſelves clear of the blood of all men, either by word or writing, and keep yourſelves clean, that you may ſtand in your throne, and every one have his lot and ſtand in the lot in the Ancient of days. The bleſſing of the Lord be with you, and keep you over all the idolatrous worſhips and worſhippers. Let them know the living God; for teachings, churches, worſhips. muſt be thrown down with the power of the Lord God, ſet up by man's carthly underſtanding, knowledge, and will. All this muſt be thrown down with that which gave forth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and who are in that, reign over it all. That is the word of the Lord to you all. In that is God worſhipped, that brings to declare his will, and brings to the church in God, the ground and pillar of truth: for now is the mighty day of the Lord appeared, and the arrows of the Almighty gene forth; which ſhall ſtick in the hearts of the wicked. Now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:037441_0342_100D902147685CC0"/>to trample and thunder down deceit, which hath long reigned and ſtained the earth. Now will I have my glory out of every one. The Lord God Almighty over all in his ſtrength and power keep you to his glory, that you may come to anſwer that of God in every one. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the mighty day of the Lord of fire and ſword, who will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth; and keep in the life and power of the Lord God, that the inhabitants of the earth may tremble before you: that God's power and majeſty may be admired among hypocrites and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and ye in the wiſdom, dread, life, terror, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion preſerved to his glory; that nothing may rule or reign but power and life itſelf, and in the wiſdom of God ye may be preſerved in it. This is the word of the Lord God to you all. The call is now out of tranſgreſſion, the Spirit bids, Come. The call is now from all falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Gods, from all inventions and dead works, to ſerve the living God. The call is to repentance, to amendment of life, whereby righteouſneſs may be brought forth, which ſhall go throughout the earth. Therefore ye that be choſen and faithful, who are with the Lamb, go through your work faithfully in the ſtrength and power of the Lord, and be obedient to the power; for that will ſave you out of the hands of unreaſonable men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you over the world to himſelf. Hereby you may live in the kingdom that ſtands in power, which hath no where glory and life is.</p>

                  <p>After the aſſizes, the ſheriff. with ſome ſoldiers, came to guard a woman to execution that was ſentenced to die; and we had a great deal of diſcourſe with them. One of them wickedly ſaid, <q>Chriſt was as paſſionate a man as any that lived upon the earth.</q> For which wicked ſaying we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him. Another time we aſked the gaoler, what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there were at the ſeſſions? He ſaid, ſmall matters, only about thirty for baſtardy. We thought it very ſtrange that they, who profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould make ſmall matters of ſuch things. But this gaoler was very bad himſelf. I often admoniſhee him to ſobricty; but he would abuſe people that came to viſit us. Edward Pyot had a cheeſe ſent him by his wife from Briſtol; and the gaoler took the cheeſe from him, and carried it to the mayor, to fearch it for treaſonable letters, as, he ſaid: and though they
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:037441_0343_100D9022DB1C0488"/>found no treaſon in the cheeſe, they kept it from us. This gaoler might have been rich, if he had carried himſelf civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but he fought his own ruin. which ſoon after came upon him: for the next year he was turned out of his place, and for ſome wickedneſs was caſt into the gaol himſelf; and there begged of our friends. And for ſome unrulineſs in his carriage, he was by the ſucceeding gaoler put into Doomſdale, locked in irons, beaten, and bid to <q>remember how he had abuſed thoſe good men, whom he had wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, without any cauſe, caſt into that naſty priſon:</q> and told, <q>That now he deſervedly ſhould ſuffer for his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſame meature he had meted to others, he ſhould have meted out to himſelf.</q> He became very poor, and died in priſon. His wife and family came to miſery.</p>
                  <p>While I was in priſon at Lanceſton, a friend went to Oliver Cromwel, and offered himſelf, body for body, to lie in Doomſdale in my ſtead; if he would take him, and ſet me at liberty. Which thing ſo ſtruck him, that he ſaid, to his great men and council; <q>Which of you would do ſo much for me, if I were in the ſame condition?</q> And though he did not accept of the friend's offer, but ſaid, 'He could not do it, for it was contrary to law;' yet the truth thereby came mightily over him. A good while after this he ſent down major general Deſborow pretending to ſet us at liberty. When he came, he offered, if we would ſay, 'We would go home and preach no more,' we ſhould have our liberty; but we could not promiſe him. Then he urged, that we ſhould promiſe <q>to go home if the Lord permitted:</q> whereupon Edward Pyot wrote him this following letter:</p>

                        <p>THOUGH much might be ſaid as to the liberty of Engliſhmen to travel in any part of England, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Engliſhman's houſe by the law, and he to be protected in any part of it; and if he tranſgreſs the law, the penalty upon the tranſgreſſor is to be inſlicted. And as to the liberty of conſcience, which is a natural right, and a fundamental, and the exerciſe of it by thoſe who profeſs ſaith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, it is to be protected, as by the inſtrument of government it appears, though
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:037441_0344_100D9024CED370D0"/>they differ in doctrine, worſhip, and diſcipline; provided that liberty extend not to property, or prelacy, nor to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. Where theſe rights are denied us, our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are infringed, which are the price of much blood and treaſure in the late wars. Yet in the power of God over all, by which all are to be ruled, are we, and in it dwell, and by it alone are guided to do the will of God; whoſe will is free, and we, in the freedom of his will, walk by the power, either as it commands or permits, without any condition or enforcement thereunto by men; but as the power moves, either by command or permiſſion. And although we cannot covenant or condition to go forth of theſe parts, or to do this or that thing, if the Lord permit (for that were to do the will of man by God's permiſſion) yet it is like we may paſs forth of theſe parts in the liberty of the will of God, as we may be ſeverally moved and guided by the pure power, and not of neceſſity. We who were firſt committed were paſſing homeward when we were apprehended; and, as far as I know, we might paſs, if the priſon doors were commanded to be opened, and we freed of our bonds. Should we ſtay, if the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to go, or ſhould we go if the Lord command us to ſtay; or having no command to ſtay, but being permitted to paſs from hence, the pure power moving thereto, and we yet ſtay; or go, when as before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſtay; we ſhould then be wanderers indeed; for ſuch are wanderers, who wander out from the will and power of God, abroad, at large, in their own wills and earthly minds. And ſo, in the fear of the Lord God, well weigh and conſider, with the juſt weight and juſt balance, that juſtice thou mayſt do to the juſt and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in priſon.</p>

                        <p>WE who are in the power of God, the ruler of all, the upholder of all things, and know and dwell in his power, to it we muſt be obedient; which brings us to
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:037441_0345_100D90271A9ACE68"/>ſtand out of all men's wills, unlimited. To ſay, <q>We will if the Lord permit,</q> in a caſe of buying and ſelling to get gain, if the intent be ſo to do, may be done; but we ſtanding in the power of God to do his will, and to ſtand out of man's will, if man propoſe, <q>We ſhall have our liberty if we will ſay, we will go to our outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the Lord permit, or if it be the will of God;</q> and becauſe we cannot ſay theſe words in this caſe, ſhall not have our liberty, when we know that the will of God is, we ſhall "go to ſpeak at ſome other place:" here we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay theſe words truly. For to ſay, <q>We will go to our outward habitation, if it be according to the will of God,</q> when we know the will of God is otherwiſe; we cannot ſpeak ſo, truly and clearly. Neither can any man ſay ſo to him, that requires it of him; who ſtands in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and knows the power of God to lead him, according to ;God's will, and it leads him to another prace than his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward home. But the Son of God, who came to do and did the will of God, had no place whereon to lay his head: and the apoſtles, and many of the followers of Chriſt, had no certain dwelling-place. Now if theſe ſhould have been reſtrained, becauſe they could not ſay they would go to their outward homes, if it were the will of God, when they knew it was the will of God they ſhould not, and they could not do the will of God in doing ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not ſpeak thoſe words to ſatisfy man's mind and will, would not ſuch reſtraint have been evil? Abraham could not do the will of God, but in going from his native country; and who are of faith are of Abraham, of whom Chriſt came according to the fleſh. Now, if you allege, "This is to let all looſe and at liberty to idleneſs," I ſay, No: ſuch as are in the power of God, who do the will of God, come to receive his wiſdom, by which all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were created, and by which they are uſed to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This I ſhall ſay, whoever are moved by the Lord God of glory and power to go to their outward habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch of us may go to our outward homes; and there be diligent in ſerving the Lord, that they may be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God in their generation; diligently ſerving him in life and doctrine, in manners, in converſation, in all things. And who are moved of the Lord to go to any other place, we ſtanding in his will, and being moved by his power, which comprehends all things, and is not to be limited, we ſhall do his will which we are commanded to
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:037441_0346_100D902907F0C2B8"/>do. So the Lord God open your underſtandings, that you may ſee this great power of the Lord, which he is now manifeſting among his children in this his day; that ye may not withſtand it in our friends, that are come into the power of God, and to God, and know him by whom the world was made, by whom all things were created that were created, and there was not any thing made but what was made for him, and to him, and by him; who is the power of God, and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. Friends being come to this light which cometh from Chriſt, and having received power from him by whom all things were created, to whom all power in heaven and earth is given, who is the wiſdom of God; we have received wiſdom and power from him, by which the Lord doth give us to know how to uſe and order the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the glory of him, the Creator of all things. Friends here are taught of the Lord to be diligent, ſerving him; and who come into the life, the ſcriptures were given forth from, are given up to ſerve the Lord. Of this I have in all your conſciences a witneſs. So, if thou open the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-door, we ſhall not ſtay there.

He told us, <q>He was much troubled in his mind concerning us, and could not reſt at home; but was going to colonel Bennet to ſeek our liberty.</q> When we told him, <q>We were ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and were going to his houſe;</q> he was exceeding glad. To his houſe we went, and had a fine, precious meeting; many were convinced, and turned by the Spirit of the Lord to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's teaching.</p>
                  <p>From his houſe we went to Loveday Hambley's; where we had a fine large meeting. The Lord's power was over all; many were convinced there alſo, and turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their teacher.</p>
                  <p>After we had tarried there two or three days, we came to Thomas Mounce's, where we had a general meeting for the whole county; which, being very large, was held in his orchard. Friends from Plymouth were there, and from many places. The Lord's power was over all, and a great convincement there was in many parts of the county. Their watches were down, and all was plain and open; for the Lord had let me ſee, before I was at liberty, that he would make all the country plain before us. Thomas and Ann Curtis, with an alderman of Reading who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, had come to Lanceſton to ſee us while I was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; and when Ann and the other man returned, Thomas Curtis ſtaid behind in Cornwall, and had good ſervice for the Lord at that time.</p>
                  <p>From Thomas Mounce's we paſſed to Lanceſton again, and viſited the little remnant of friends that had been raiſed up there while we were in priſon; and the Lord's plants
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:037441_0350_100D9031416D47B8"/>grew finely, and were eſtabliſhed on Chriſt, their rock and foundation. As we were going out of town again, the conſtable of Lanceſton came running to us with the cheeſe that had been taken from Edward Pyot; which they had kept from us all this while, and were troubled with it. But we, being now at liberty, would not receive it.</p>
                  <p>From Lanceſton we came to Okington; and lay at an inn, which the mayor of the town kept. He had ſtopped and taken up ſeveral friends, but was very civil to us; and was convinced in his judgment.</p>
                  <p>From thence we came to Exeter, where many friends were in priſon; and amongſt the reſt James Nayler. For a little before we were ſet at liberty, James had run out into imaginations, and a company with him, who raiſed up a great darkneſs in the nation. <note n="*" place="bottom">James Nayler was a monument of human frailty. His gift in the miniſtry was eminent; his experience in divine things truly great. He ſell through unwatchfulneſs, but was reſtored through deep ſufferings and anfeigned repentance. His own writings are the moſt clear and lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the various diſpenſations he underwent: ſome of them deſerve to be tranſmitted to the lateſt poſterity.</note> He came to Briſtol, and made a diſturbance there. From thence he was coming to Lanceſton, to ſee me; but was ſtopped by the way, and impriſoned at Exeter; as were ſeveral others, one of whom, an honeſt, tender man, died in priſon there; whoſe blood lieth on the heads of his perſecutors.</p>
                  <p>The night that we came to Exeter, I ſpoke with James Nayler: for I ſaw he was out, and wrong, and ſo was his company. The next day, being firſt-day, we went to viſit the priſoners, and had a meeting with them in the priſon; but James Nayler, and ſome of them could not ſtay the meeting. There came a corporal of horſe into the meeting, who was convinced, and remained a very good friend. The next day I ſpoke to James Nayler again; and he ſlighted what I ſaid, was dark, and much out; yet he would have come and kiſſed me. But I ſaid, <q>Since he had turned againſt the power of God, I could not receive his ſhew of kindneſs. The Lord moved me to ſlight him, and to ſet the power of God over him.</q> So after I had been war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the world, there was now a wicked ſpirit riſen amongſt friends to war againſt. I admoniſhed him and his company. When he was come to London, his reſiſting the power of God in me, and the truth that was declared to him by me, became one of his greateſt burdens. But
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:037441_0351_100D90333791EBF0"/>he came to ſee his out-going, and to condemn it; and after ſome time he returned to truth again: as in the printed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his repentance, condemnation, and recovery may be more fully ſeen.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed from Exeter through Cullumpton and Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, viſiting friends; and had meetings amongſt them. From thence we came to Puddimoor, to William Beaton's; where on a firſt-day we had a very large meeting. A great convincement there was up and down that country; many meetings we had, and the Lord's power was over all; many were turned, by the power and Spirit of God, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who died for them, and came to ſit under his free teaching.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went to John Dando's, where we had another precious meeting. The Lord's power was over all, and many were convinced of God's eternal truth. Some contention was raiſed by profeſſors and Baptiſts, in ſome places; but the Lord's power came over them. From thence we came to Edward Pyot's, near Briſtol. It was, the ſeventh-day at night that we came thither. It was quickly noiſed over the town that I was come. I had never been there before.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day morning I went to the meeting in Broadmead at Briſtol; which was large and quiet. Notice was given of a meeting to be in the afternoon in the orchard. There was at Briſtol a rude Baptiſt, named Paul Gwin, who had uſed before to make great diſturbance in our meetings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged by the mayor, who, as was reported, would ſometimes give him his dinner to encourage him. Such multitudes of rude people would he gather after him, that it was thought there had been ſometimes ten thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at our meeting in the orchard. As I was going into the orchard, the people told me, That Paul Gwin, the rude, jangling Baptiſt, was going to the meeting. I bid them, "Never heed; it was nothing to me, who went to it." When I was come into the orchard, I ſtood upon the ſtone that friends uſed to ſtand on when they ſpoke: and was moved of the Lord to put off my hat, and to ſtand a pretty while; and let the people look at me; for ſome thouſands of people were there. While I thus ſtood ſilent, this rude Baptiſt began to find fault with my hair; but I ſaid nothing to him. Then he ran on into words; and at laſt, <q>Ye wiſe mon of Briſtol,</q> ſaid he, <q>I ſtrange at you that you will ſtand here, and hear a man ſpeak and affirm that which
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:037441_0352_100D9035B4E467C0"/>he cannot make good.</q> Then the Lord opened my mouth (for as yet I had not ſpoken a word) and I aſked the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <q>Whether they ever heard me ſpeak: or ever ſaw me before?</q> And bid them <q>take notice what kind of man this was that ſhould ſo impudently ſay amongſt them, that I ſpoke and affirmed that which I could not make good; and yet neither he nor they ever heard me or ſaw me before. Therefore that was a lying, envious, malicious ſpirit that ſpoke in him; and it was of the devil, and not of God. I charged him in the dread and power of the Lord to be ſilent; and the mighty power of God came over him, and all his company. A glorious, peaceable meeting we had; the word of life was divided amongſt them; and they were turned from darkneſs to light, and to Jeſus their Saviour. The ſcriptures were largely opened to them; and the traditions, rudiments, ways, and doctrines of men were laid open before the people, and they were turned to the light of Chriſt, that with it they might ſee them, and ſee him to lead them out of them. I opened alſo to them the types, figures, and ſhadows of Chriſt in the time of the law; and ſhewed them, That Chriſt was come, and had ended the types, ſhadows, tythes, and oaths, and put down ſwearing, and had ſet yea and nay inſtead of it, and a free miniſtry: for he was now come to teach people himſelf, and his heavenly day was ſpringing from on high.</q> For many hours did I declare the word of life amongſt them in the eternal power of God; that by him they might come up into the beginning and be reconciled to him. And having turned them to the Spirit of God in themſelves, that would lead into all truth, I was moved to pray in the mighty power of God; and the Lord's power came over all. When I had done, this fellow began to babble again; and John Audland was moved to bid him repent, and fear God. So his own people and followers being aſhamed of him, he paſſed away, and never came again to diſturb the meeting. The meeting broke up qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly. and the Lord's power and glory ſhined over all: a bleſſed day it was, and the Lord had the praiſe. After awhile this Paul Gwin went beyond ſea; and many years after, I met with him again at Barbadoes: of which in its place.</p>
                  <p>From Briſtol we returned to Edward Pyot's, where we had a great meeting. The Lord's power was over all, truth was declared and ſpread abroad, and many were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:037441_0353_100D903818AA8788"/>to Chriſt Jeſus, their life, their Prophet to teach them, their Shepherd to feed them, and their Biſhop to overſee them. After the meeting I had reaſoning with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; and the Lord's truth and power came over them.</p>
                  <p>From Edward Pyot's we paſſed to Slattenford, where we had a very large meeting (Edward Pyot and another friend being ſtill with me;) and a great turning of people there was to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt their teacher. People were glad that they were brought to know their way, their free teacher, and their Saviour Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The firſt-day following we went to Nathaniel Crips's houſe, who had been a juſtice of peace in Wiltſhire; where it was ſuppoſed between two and three thouſand people were at a meeting, and all was quiet. <q>The mighty power of God was manifeſt, and people were turned to the grace and truth in their hearts, that came by Jeſus Chriſt, which would teach them to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly and godly in this preſent world. So that every man and woman might know the grace of God, which had appeared to all men, which was ſaving, and ſufficient to bring their ſalvation. This teacher, the grace of God, would teach them how to live, what to do, and what to deny: it would ſeaſon their words, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their hearts. This was a free teacher to every one of them: ſo that they might come to be heirs of this grace, and of Chriſt, by whom it came; who hath ended the prophets, and the prieſts that took tythes, and the Jewiſh temple. And as for theſe hireling prieſts that take tythes now, and their temples (which prieſts were made at ſchools and colleges of man's ſetting up, and not by Chriſt) they, with all their inventions, were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For the apoſtles denied the true prieſthood and which God had commanded, after Chriſt had put an end thereto. The ſcriptures, and the truths therein contained, were largely opened, and the people turned to the Spirit of God in their hearts; that by it they might be led into all truth, underſtand the ſcriptures, know God and Chriſt, and come to have unity with them, and one with another in the ſame Spirit.</q> The people went away generally ſatisfied, and were glad that they were turned to Chriſt Jeſus, their Teacher and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The next day we went to Marlborough, where we had a little meating. The ſeſſions being held that day, they were granting a warrant to ſend for me; but juſtice Stooks,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:037441_0354_100D9039A9F1C718"/>being at the ſeſſions, ſtopped them, telling them there was a meeting at his houſe yeſterday, at which were ſeveral thouſands. So the warrant was ſtopped, our meeting was quiet; and ſeveral received Chriſt Jeſus their teacher, and came into the new covenant, and abode in it.</p>
                  <p>From hence we went to Newbury, where we had a large bleſſed meeting; ſeveral were convinced. Thence we paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Reading, where we had a large, precious meeting in the Lord's power amongſt the plants of God. Many of other profeſſions came in, were reached, and added to the meeting. All was quiet, and the Lord's power was over all. We went from Reading to Kingſton upon Thames, where a few came to us that were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: but ſince it is become a large meeting.</p>
                  <p>Leaving Kingſton, we rode to London. When we came near Hyde Park, we ſaw a great concourſe of people, and looking towards them, eſpied the protector coming in his coach. Whereupon I rode to his coach ſide. Some of his life-guard would have put me away; but he forbad them. So I rode by his coach ſide with him, <q>declaring what the Lord gave me to ſay to him, of his condition, and of the ſufferings of friends in the nation; ſhewing him, how contrary this perſecution was to Chriſt and his apoſtles, and to chriſtianity.</q> When we were come to James's Park Gate, I left him; and at parting he deſired me to come to his houſe. The next day, one of his wife's maids, whoſe name was Mary Sanders, came to me at my lodging, and told me, Her maſter came to her, and ſaid, he would tell her ſome good news. When ſhe aſked him, What it was? He told her, George Fox was come to town. She replied, That was good news indeed (for ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived truth) but ſhe ſaid, She could hardly believe him; till he told her how I met him, and rode from Hyde Park to James's Park with him.</p>
                  <p>After a little time Edward Pyot and I went to White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall; and when we came before him, Dr. Owen, vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor of Oxford, was with him. We were moved to <q>ſpeak to Oliver Cromwel concerning the ſufferings of friends, and laid them before him: and directed him to the light of Chriſt, who had enlightened every toan that cometh into the world. He ſaid; It was a ratural light; but we ſhewed him the contrary; and manifeſted that it was divine and ſpiritual, proceeding from Chriſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heavenly man; and that which was called the
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:037441_0355_100D903BA0B76D60"/>life in Chriſt the Word, was called the light in us. The power of the Lord God aroſe in me, and I was moved in it to bid him lay down his crown at the feet of Jeſus.</q> Several times I ſpoke to him to the ſame effect. I was ſtanding by the table, and he came and ſat upon the table's ſide by me, ſaying, He would be as high as I was: and ſo continued ſpeaking againſt the light of Chriſt Jeſus; and went his way in a light manner. But the Lord's power came over him, ſo that when he came to his wife and other company, he ſaid, 'I never parted ſo from them before:' for he was judged in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>After he had left us, as we were going out, many great perſons came about us; one of them began to ſpeak againſt the light, and againſt the truth; and I was made to ſlight him, for ſpeaking ſo lightly of the things of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of them told me he was the major-general of Northamptonſhire. 'What!' ſaid I, <q>our old perſecutor, that has perſecuted and ſent ſo many of our friends to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is a ſhame to chriſtianity and religion! I am glad I have met with thee,</q> ſaid I. So I was moved to ſpeak ſharply to him of his unchriſtian carriages; and he ſlunk away: for he had been a cruel perſecutor in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonſhire.</p>
                  <p>After I had viſited the meetings of friends in and about London, I went into Buckinghamſhire, and Edward Pyot was with me; and in ſeveral places in that county many received the truth. Great meetings we had, and the Lord's power was eminently manifeſted. I paſſed through North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonſhire and Nottinghamſhire into Lincolnſhire. After ſeveral meetings in Lincolnſhire, I had at laſt a meeting, where two knights, one called Sir Richard Wrey, the other Sir John Wrey, with their wives, were at the meeting. One of then wives was convinced, received the truth, and died in it. When the meeting was done, we paſſed away; and it being in the evening, and dark, a company of wild ſerving men encompaſſed ine about, with intent, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, to have done me ſome miſchief. But I ſpoke aloud to them, and aſked, 'What are ye? highwaymen? Whereupon ſome friends and friendly people behind came up to us, and knew ſome of them. So I reproved them for their uncivil and rude carriage, exhorted them to fear God, and the Lord's power came over them, and ſtopped their miſehievous deſign; bleſſed be his name for ever.</p>
                  <p>Then I turned into Huntingdonſhire. The mayor of
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:037441_0356_100D903DE81DED90"/>Huntingdon came to viſit me, and was very loving, and his wife received the truth.</p>
                  <p>Thence I paſſed into Cambridgeſhire, and into the Fen Country; where I had many meetings, and the Lord's truth ſpread. Robert Craven (who had been ſheriff of Lincoln) Amor Stoddart, and Alexander Parker were with me. We went to Crowland, a very rude place; for the town's people were got together at the inn we went to, and were half drunk, both prieſt and people. <q>I reproved them for their drunkenneſs, and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all the wicked; exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to leave their drunkenneſs, and turn to the Lord in time.</q> Whilſt I was thus ſpeaking to them, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prieſt the fruits of his miniſtry, the prieſt and the clerk broke out into a rage, and got up the tongs and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhovel at us; ſo that had not the Lord's power preſerved us, we might have been murdered amongſt them. Yet, for all their rudeneſs and violence, ſome received the truth then; and have ſtood in it ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed to Boſton, where moſt of the chief of the town came to our inn, and the people ſeemed to be much ſatisfied. But there was a raging man in the yard; and Robert Craven was moved to ſpeak to him, and told him, He ſhamed chriſtianity; which, with ſome few other words, ſo ſtopped the man, that he went away quiet. Some were convinced there alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thus we had large meetings up and down; for I travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into Yorkſhire, and returned out of Holderneſs, over Humber, viſiting friends; and then going into Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Staffordſhire, Worceſterſhire, and Warwickſhire, among friends. I had a meeting at Edge-hill. There came to it Ranters, Baptiſts, and ſeveral ſorts of rude people; for I had ſent word about three weeks before, to have a meeting there; ſo that hundreds of people were gathered, and many friends came from far to it. The Lord's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth and word of life reached over all; rude and unruly ſpirits were chained down; and many that day were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his power and Spirit, who came to ſit under his bleſſed free teaching, and to be fed with his eternal, heavenly food. All was peaceable; the people paſſed quietly away, and ſome of them ſaid, It was a mighty, powerful meeting: for the preſence of the Lord was felt, and his power and Spirit amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>From hence I paſſed to Warwick, and to Bagley; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:037441_0357_100D90404E5BEB28"/>precious meetings. From thence into Glouceſterſhire, and ſo to Oxford, where the ſcholars were very rude; but the Lord's power came over them, and great meetings we had up and down, as we travelled. Then I went to colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Grimes's, where was a very large meeting; and from thence to Nathaniel Crips's, where came another juſtice to the meeting, who was alſo convinced. At Cirenceſter alſo we had a meeting, which is much increaſed; ſo we came to Eveſham again, where I met John Camm.</p>
                  <p>Thus having travelled over moſt part of the nation, I returned to London, having cleared myſelf of that which lay upon me from the Lord. For after I was releaſed out of Lanceſton gaol, I was moved of the Lord to travel over moſt parts of the nation (the truth being now ſpread, and finely planted in moſt places) that I might anſwer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of the minds of people ſome objections, which envious prieſts and profeſſors had raiſed and ſpread concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. For, what Chriſt ſaid of falſe prophets and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts coming in the laſt days, that they applied to us; and ſaid, We were they.</p>
                  <p>Therefore was I moved to open this through the nation, and to ſhew, 'That they, who ſaid we were the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, antichriſts, and deceivers, that ſhould come in the laſt days, were indeed themſelves they. For when Chriſt told his diſciples in the viith and xxivth of Matthew, that falſe prophets and antichriſts ſhould come in the laſt times, and, if it were poſſible, ſhould deceive the very elect, he ſaid, <q>By their fruits ye ſhall know them: for they ſhould be inwardly ravening wolves, having the ſheeps cloathing. And,</q> ſaid he, <q>do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?</q> as much as to ſay, Their nature and ſpirit ſhould be like a thorn, or like a thiſtle; and he bids his diſciples not go after them. But before the diſciples were deceaſed, the antichriſts, falſe prophets, and deceivers were come. For John in his firſt epiſtle ſaid, <q>Little children, it is the laſt time; and as ye have heard that antichriſt ſhall come, even now are there many antichriſts, whereby we know that it is the laſt time.</q> So here, as Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, They ſhould come; the diſciples ſaw they were come: as may be ſeen at large in Peter. Jude, John, and other places of ſcripture; "whereby," ſays John, "we know it is the laſt time:" and this laſt time began above ſixteen hundred years ſince. John ſaid <q>They went out from us;</q> the falſe prophets, antichriſts, ſeducers, and
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:037441_0358_100D9041E0DE5A38"/>deceivers, went out from the church; "But you," ſaid he to the church, <q>have an anointing which abideth in you; and you need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things; and as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</q> Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, <q>Go not after them, for they are inwardly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening wolves;</q> and John exhorts the ſaints to the anointing within them; and the reſt of the apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the churches to the grace, the light, the truth, the Spirit, the word of faith, and to Chriſt in their hearts, the hope of glory. Chriſt told the ſaints, that the Spirit of truth, the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould be their leader into all truth; and Jude exhorts the church to <q>pray in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</q> and <q>to be built up in their moſt holy faith, which Chriſt was the author of.</q> Chriſt, by his ſervant <q>John, exhorted the ſeven churches to hear what the Spirit ſaid to the churches;</q> and this was an inward ſpiritual hearing. Chriſt ſays, the inwardly ravening wolves ſhould have the ſheeps cloathing. Paul ſpeaks of ſome in his time that had a form of godlineſs, but denied the power. John ſaid, "They went out from us." Jude ſaid, <q>They go in Cain's way, and in Balaam's and Corah's way.</q> By all which it may be clearly ſeen, that the falſe prophets and antichriſts, which Chriſt foretold ſhould come, the apoſtles ſaw were come; and in their day the laſt time was begun. Theſe went from them into the world, and the world went after them! Theſe were the fore-men, the leaders of the world, that brought them into a form of godlineſs, but inwardly ravened from the power and Spirit! Theſe have the ſheeps cloathing, the words of Chriſt, of the prophets, and of the apoſtles; but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened from the power and Spirit that they were in who gave forth the ſcriptures. Theſe have made up the beaſt, and the whore! Theſe have gotten the dragon's power, the murdering, deſtroying, perſecuting, power! And theſe are they that the world wonders after! Theſe have drunk the blood of the martyrs, prophets, and ſaints, and perſecuted the true church into the wilderneſs! Theſe have ſet up the ſalſe, compelling worſhips, and have drunk the blood of the ſaints, that will not drink of their cup! Theſe have made the cage for the unclean birds, that have their ſeveral unclean notes in their cage; which cage is made up by the power of darkneſs, and unclean ghoſt: and the birds of the cage deny the Holy Chofl, and the
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:037441_0359_100D9043747C1C88"/>power of God, which the apoſtles were in, to be now manifeſted in the ſaints! Thus ſince Chriſt ſaid, the falſe prophets and antichriſts ſhould come, and the apoſtle ſaid. They were come, the beaſt's and the dragon's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath been ſet up; the whore is got up with her falſe prophets, her cage hath been made, all nations have drunk of her cup of fornication, the blood of the martyrs and ſaints they have drunk, and the true church hath fled into the wilderneſs. All this ſince the apoſtles days. Yet the blind deceivers of all ſorts, the antichriſts and falſe prophets of our age, would make us and people believe that the falſe prophets, antichriſts, and deceivers are come but now; though John and other of the apoſtles tell us, they began to come above ſixteen hundred years ago. And ye may ſee what work and confuſion they have made in the world; how much blood theſe Cains have drunk, that went in Cain's way: which blood cries to God for vengeance upon Chriſtendom! And how theſe Balaams, who have erred from the power of the Spirit which the apoſtles were in, have coveted after other men's eſtates, the many gaols, courts, and ſpoiling of goods will bear witneſs. And how theſe Corahs have gainſayed the liſe, power, and ſpirit which the apoſtles and true church were in, and the free teaching of Chriſt and of his apoſtles, and the work of their miniſtry, which was <q>to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</q> hath been evident.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the name and power of the Lord Jeſus was I ſent to preach again the everlaſting goſpel, which had been preached before unto Abraham, and in the apoſtles days; and was to go over all nations, and to be preached to every creature. For as the apoſtacy hath gone over all nations ſince the apoſtles days, ſo that the nations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as waters, unſtable, being gone from Chriſt, the foundation; ſo muſt the goſpel, the power of God, go over all nations again. We find the falſe prophets, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts deceivers, whore, falſe church, beaſt, and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the dragon's power, have got up in the times betwixt the apoſtles and us. For Chriſt ſaid, <q>They ſhould come:</q> and the apoſtles ſaw, "They were come," and coming in their days; and that they went forth from them, and the world went after them. And now hath the Lord raiſed us up beyond them, and ſet us over them in the everlaſting goſpel, the power of God: that as all have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="283" facs="unknown:037441_0360_100D90456F1FCFF0"/>ſo the everlaſting goſpel may be preached again by us to all nations, and to every creature, which will bring life and immortality to light in them, that they may ſee over the devil and his falſe prophets, antichriſts, ſeducers and deceivers, and over the whore and beaſt, and to that which was before they were. This meſſage of the glorious, everlaſting goſpel was I ſent forth to declare and publiſh, and thouſands by it are turned to God, having received it; and are come into ſubjection to it, and into the holy order of it. And ſince I have declared this meſſage in this part of the world and in America, and have written books of the ſame, to ſpread it univerſally abroad, the blind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, preachers, and deceivers have given over telling us, the ſalſe prophets ſhould "come in the laſt times;" for a great light is ſprung up and ſhines over their heads: ſo that every child in truth ſees the folly of their ſayings.</p>
                  <p>Then they got other objections againſt us, and invented ſhifts to ſave themſelves from truth's ſtroke. For when we blamed them for taking tithes, which came from the tribe of Levi, and were ſet up here by the Romiſh church, they would plead, <q>That Chriſt told the ſcribes and phariſees, they ought to pay tithes of mint, aniſe, and cummin, though they neglected the weightier matters:</q> and that Chriſt ſaid, <q>the ſcribes and phariſees ſat in Moſes's ſeat, therefore all that they bid you do, that do and obſerve.</q> And when we told them they were envious perſecuting prieſts, they would reply, <q>That ſome preached Chriſt of envy, and ſome of contention, and ſome of good-will.</q> Now theſe ſcriptures and others ſuch-like they would bring to darken the minds of their hearers, and to perſuade them and us, <q>That we ought to do as they ſay, though they themſelves were like the phariſees; and that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice when envious men and men of ſtrife preached Chriſt; and that we ſhould give them the tithes as the Jews did to the tribe of Levi.</q> Theſe were fair gloſſes; here was a great heap of huſks, but no kernel. Now this was their blindneſs; for the Levitical prieſthood Chriſt hath ended, and diſannulled the commandment that gave them tithes, and the law by which thoſe prieſts were made. Chriſt did not come after that order, neither did he ſend forth his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters after that order: for thoſe of that order were to take tithes for their maintenance, but his miniſters he ſent forth freely. And as for hearing the phariſees and the Jews pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tithes of mint, aniſe, and cummin, that was before
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:037441_0361_100D90475E444A80"/>Chriſt was ſacrificed and offered up; the Jews were then to do the law, and perform their offerings and ſacrifices which the Jewiſh prieſts did teach them. But after Chriſt was offered up, he bid them then <q>Go into all nations and preach the goſpel; and lo,</q> ſaid he, <q>I will be with you to the end of the world;</q> and in another place he ſaith, "I will be in you." He did not bid them go to hear the phariſees then, and pay tithe of mint, aniſe, and cummin then; but <q>Go, preach the goſpel, and believe in the Lord Jeſus and be ſaved, and receive the goſpel,</q> which would bring people off from the Jews, the tithes, the Levitical law, and the offerings thereof, to Chriſt, the one Offering, made once for all. O what work had the apoſtle both with the Galatians and the Romans to bring them off the law to the faith in Chriſt!</p>
                  <p>And as for the apoſtle's ſaving, <q>Some preached Chriſt of envy and ſtrife,</q> &amp;c. That was at the firſt ſpreading of Chriſt's name abroad, when they were in danger not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be caſt out of the ſynagogues, but to be ſtoned to death, that confeſſed to the name of Jeſus; as may be ſeen by the uproars that were among the Jews and Diana's worſhippers at the preaching of Chriſt. So the apoſtle might well rejoice if the envious, and men of ſtrife and contention did preach Chriſt at that time; though they thought thereby to add affliction to his bonds. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when Chriſt's name was ſpread abroad, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had got a form of godlineſs, but denied the power thereof, <q>Envious, proud, contentious men, men of ſtrife, covetous men, teachers for filthy lucre,</q> the apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſaints to turn from, and not to have any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them. And the deacons and miniſters were firſt to be proved, to ſee if they were in the power of godlineſs, and the Holy Ghoſt made them overſeers and preachers. So it may be ſeen how the prieſts have abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ſcriptures for their own ends, and have wreſted them to their own deſtruction, to juſtify envious, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions men, and men of ſtrife. Whereas the apoſtle ſays, "The man of God muſt be patient, and apt to teach;" and they were to follow Chriſt, as they had them for their examples. The apoſtle indeed was very tender to people, while he ſaw them walk in ſimplicity, as in the caſe of thoſe that were ſcrupulous about meats and days; but when the apoſtle ſaw, that ſome drew them into the obſervation of days, and to ſettle in ſuch things, he then
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:037441_0362_100D9049A1445B80"/>reproves them ſharply, and aſks them, <q>Who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched them?</q> So in the caſe of marrying he was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leſt their minds ſhould be drawn from the Lord's joining; but when they came to forbid marriage, and to ſet up rules for meats and drinks, he called it a <q>doctrine of devils,</q> and an "erring from the true faith." So alſo he was tender concerning circumciſion, and in tenderneſs ſuffered ſome to be circumciſed; but when he ſaw they went to make a ſect of it, and to ſet up circumciſion as a ſtanding practice, he told them plainly, <q>If they were circumciſed, Chriſt would profit them nothing.</q> In like manner he was tender concerning the baptizing with water; but when he ſaw they began to make ſects about it, ſome crying up Paul, others Apollos, he judged them, and called them carnal, and thanks God he had baptized no more but ſuch and ſuch; declaring plainly, that he was ſent to preach the goſpel, and not to baptize; and brought them to the one baptiſm by the one ſpirit, into the one body which Chriſt, the ſpiritual man, is the head of; and exhorted the church, <q>all to drink into that one Spirit.</q> For he aſſerted in the church the one ſaith, which Chriſt was the author of; and one baptiſm, which was that of the Spirit into the one body; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was the ſpiritual baptizer, who John ſaid ſhould come after him. And further the apoſile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they, who worſhipped and ſerved God in the Spirit, were of the circumciſion of the Spirit, which was "not made with hands;" by which the <q>body of the ſins of the fleſh was put off:</q> which circumciſion Chriſt is the miniſter of.</p>
                  <p>Another great objection they had, <q>That the Quakers denied the ſacrament,</q> as they called it, <q>of bread and wine, which</q> they ſaid, <q>they were to take, and do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt to the end of the world.</q> A great deal of work we had with the prieſts and profeſſors about this, and about the ſeveral modes of receiving it in Chriſt-endom, ſo called: for ſome of them take it lanceling, ſome ſitting; but none of them all, that ever I could ſind, take it as the diſciples took it. For they took it in a chamber after ſupper; but theſe generally take it before dinner and ſome ſay, after the prieſt hath bleſſed it, it is <q>Chriſt body.</q> But as to the matter, Chriſt ſaid, <q>Do this in remembrance of me.</q> He did not tell them how oft they ſhould do it, or how long; neither did he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="286" facs="unknown:037441_0363_100D904B56A35190"/>do it always as long as they lived, or that all believers in him ſhould do it to the world's end. The apoſtle Paul, who was not converted till after Chriſt's death, tells the Corinthians, that he had received of the Lord that which he delivered unto them concerning this matter, and relates Chriſt's words concerning the cup thus; "This do ye," as oft as ye drink it, "in remembrance of me:" and himſelf adds, <q>For [as often as] ye do eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come.</q> So according to what the apoſtle here delivers, neither Chriſt nor he did enjoin people to do this always, but leaves it to their liberty, ["as oft as ye drink it," &amp;c.] The Jews did uſe to take a cup, and to break bread and divide it among them in their ſeaſts; as may be ſeen in the Jewiſh Antiquities; ſo the breaking of bread and drinking of wine were Jewiſh rites, which were not to laſt always. They did alſo baptize with water, which made it not ſeem a ſtrange thing to them, when John the Baptiſt came with his decreaſing miniſtration of water-baptiſm. But as to the bread and wine, after the diſciples had taken it, ſome of them queſtioned whether Jeſus was the Chriſt? For ſome of them ſaid, after he was crucified, <q>We truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,</q> &amp;c. And though the Corinthians had the bread and wine, and were baptized in water, the apoſtle told them they were "reprobates, if Chriſt was not in them;" and bid them "examine themſelves." And as the apoſtle ſaid, <q>As oft as ye do cat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do s;hew forth the Lord's death [till he come;]</q> ſo Chriſt had ſaid before that he was the "bread of life," which "came down from heaven;" and that <q>he would come, and dwell in them;</q> which the apoſtles did witneſs ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; and exhorted others to ſeek for that which <q>comes down from above:</q> but the outward bread and wine, and water, are not from above but from below. Now ye that eat and drink this outward bread and wine in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt's death, and have your fellowſhips in that, will ye come no nearer to Chriſt's death than to take bread and wine in remembrance of it? After ye have eaten in remembrance of his death, ye muſt come into his death, and die with him, as the apoſtles did, if ye will live with him. This is a nearer and further advanced ſtate, to be with him in the fellowſhip of his death, than only to take bread and wine in remembrance of it. You muſt have
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:037441_0364_100D904D8A7E5EF0"/>fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings; if ye will reign with him, ye muſt ſuffer with him; if ye will live with him, ye muſt die with him; and if ye die with him, ye muſt be buried with him; and being buried with him in the true baptiſm, ye alſo riſe with him. Then having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with him, died with him, and been buried with him, if ye are riſen with Chriſt, <q>ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God.</q> Eat the bread which comes down from above, which is not outward bread; and drink the cup of ſalvation which he gives in his kingdom, which is not outward wine. And then there will not be a looking at the things that are ſeen (as outward bread and wine and water are:) for, as ſays the apoſtle, <q>The things that are ſeen are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but the things that are not ſeen are eternal.</q> So here are many ſtates and conditions to be gone through before people come to ſee that, and partake of that which "cometh down from above." For firſt, There was <q>a taking of the outward bread and wine in remembrance of Chriſt's death.</q> This was temporary, and not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; but at their liberty, "As oft as ye do it," &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There muſt be <q>a coming into his death, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with Chriſt;</q> and this is of neceſſity to ſalvation; and not temporary, but continual: there muſt be <q>a dying daily.</q> Thirdly, "a being buried with Chriſt." Fourthly, "a riſing with Chriſt." Fifthly, After they are riſen with Chriſt, then <q>a ſeeking thoſe things which are above, a ſeeking the bread that comes down from heaven,</q> and a <q>feeding on that and having fellowſhip in that.</q> For outward bread, wine, and water are from below, and are viſible and temporal; but, ſaith the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <q>We look not at things that are ſeen, for the things that are ſeen are temporal, but the things that are not ſeen are eternal.</q> So the fellowſhip that ſtands in the uſe of bread, wine, water, circumciſion, outward temple, and things ſeen will have an end: but the fellowſhip which ſtands in the goſpel, the power of God, which was before the devil was, and which brings life and immortality to light, by which people may ſee over the devil that has darkened them, this fellowſhip is eternal, and will ſtand. And all that are in it ſeek that which is heavenly and eternal, which comes down from above, and are ſettled in the eternal myſtery of the fellowſhip of the goſpel, which is hid from all eyes that look only at viſible things. The apoſtle told
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:037441_0365_100D90502DC3BA90"/>the Corinthians, who were in diſorder about water, bread and wine, that he <q>deſired to know nothing amongſt them, but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus were the objections which the prieſts and profeſſors had raiſed againſt friends anſwered, and the ſtumbling-blocks they had laid in the way of the weak removed. And as things were thus opened, people came to ſee over them and through them, and to have their minds ſettled upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their free teacher: which was the ſervice for which I was moved to travel over the nation after my impriſonment in Lanceſton gaol. In this year the Lord's truth was finely planted over the nation, and many thouſands were turned to the Lord; inſomuch that there were ſeldom ſewer than one thouſand in priſon in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for truth;s teſtimony; ſome for tithes, ſome for going to the ſteeple-houſes, ſome for contempts, as they called them, ſome for not ſwearing, and others for not putting off their hats, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>After I had viſited moſt parts of the nation, and was come to London again, finding that evil ſpirit at work which had drawn J. N. and his followers out of the truth, to run friends into heats about him, I wrote a ſhort epiſtle to friends, as followeth:</p>

                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>ALL my dear friends in the noble ſeed of God, who have known his power, life, and preſence among
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:037441_0367_100D9053B9BB7EC8"/>you, let it be your joy to hear or ſee the ſprings of life break forth in any; through which ye have all unity in the ſame, feeling life and power. And above all things take heed of judging any one openly in your meetings, except they be openly prophane or rebellious, ſuch as are out of the truth; that by the power, life, and wiſdom ye may ſtand over them, and by it anſwer the witneſs of God in the world, that ſuch, whom ye bear your teſtimony againſt, are none of you: that therein the truth may ſtand clear and ſingle. But ſuch as are tender, if they ſhould be moved to bubble forth a few words, and ſpeak in the ſeed and Lamb's power, ſuffer and bear that; that is, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And if they ſhould go beyond their meaſure, bear it in the meeting for peace and order's ſake, and that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the world be not moved againſt you. But when the meeting is done, if any be moved to ſpeak to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and them, one or two of you that feel it in the life, do it in the love and wiſdom that is pure and gentle from above, for love is that which edifies, bears all things, ſuffers long, and fulfils the law. In this ye have order and edification, ye have wiſdom to preſerve you all wiſe and in patience; which takes away the occaſion of ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the weak, and the occaſion of the ſpirits of the world to get up: but in the royal feed, the heavy ſtone, ye keep down all that is wrong, and by it anſwer that of God in all. For ye will hear, ſee, and feel the power of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as your faith is wholly in it (when ye do not hear words) to bind, to chain, to limit, to fruſtrate, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall riſe nor come forth but what is in the power; with that ye will hold back, with that ye will let up and open every ſpring, plant, and ſpark; in which will be your joy and refreſhment in the power of God. Ye that know the power of God and are come to it, which is the croſs of Chriſt, that crucifies you to the ſtate that Adam and Eve were in in the fall, and ſo to the world, by this power of God ye come to ſee the ſtate that Adam and Eve were in before they fell: which power of God is the croſs, in which ſtands the everlaſting glory, which brings up into righteouſneſs and holineſs, the image of God, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to unrighteouſneſs and unholineſs, the image of ſatan, that Adam and Eve and their ſons and daughters are in under the fall. Through this power of God ye come to ſee the ſtate they were in before they fell; yea, and I ſay, to an higher ſtate, to the Seed Chriſt, the Second Adam,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:037441_0368_100D90558FF2CB50"/>by whom all things were made. For man hath been driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from God. All Adam and Eve's ſons and daughters, being in the ſtate of the fall in the earth, are driven from God. But it is ſaid. "The church is in God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:" ſo who come to the church, which is in God the Father of Chriſt, they muſt come to God again, out of the ſtate that Adam and his children are in in the ſall, out of the image of God, out of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs; and they muſt come into the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into the true holineſs, the image of God, and out of the earth whither man hath been driven, when they come to the church which is in God. The way to this is Chriſt, the Light, the Life, the Truth, the Saviour, the Redeemer, the Sanctifier, and the Juſtifier, in and through whoſe power, light, and life, converſion, regeneration, and tranſlation is known from death to life, from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan to God again. Theſe are members of the true church, who know the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in the operation and feeling of it; and being come to be members of the church of God, they are indeed members one of another in the power of God, which was before the power of darkneſs was. So they that come to the church that is in God and Chriſt, muſt come out of the ſtate that Adam was in in the fall, driven from God, to know the ſtate that he was in before he fell. But they that live in the ſtate that Adam was in in the fall, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe a poſſibility of coming into the ſtate he was in before he fell, come not to the church which is in God; but are far from that, are not paſſed from death to life, but are onemies to the croſs of Chriſt, which is the power of God. For they mind earthly things, and ſerve not Chriſt; nor love the power which ſhould bring them up to the ſtate that Adam was in before he fell, and crucify them to the ſtate that man is in in the fall; that through this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they might ſee to the beginning, the power that man was in before the heavenly image, holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was loſt: by which power they might come to know the Seed. Chriſt, which brings out of the old things, and makes all things new; in which life eternal is felt. For all the poorneſs, emptineſs, and barrenneſs is in the ſtate that man is in in the fall, out of God's power; by which power he is made rich again, and in winch power he hath ſtrength again: which power is the croſs, in which the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the fellowſhip ſtands; and in which is the true glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:037441_0369_100D90584250F0F8"/>which crucifies to all other glorings. And friends, though ye may have been convinced, and have taſted of the power, and felt the light, yet afterwards ye may feel a winter-ſtorm, tempeſt and hail, froſt and cold, and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in the wilderneſs. Be patient and ſtill in the power and in the light that doth convince you, to keep your minds to God; in that be quiet, that ye may come to the ſummer; that your flight be not in the winter. For if ye ſit ſtill in the patience which overcomes in the power of God, there will be no flying. The huſbandman, after he hath ſown his ſeed, is patient. And ye by the power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in the patience, will come by the light to ſee through and feel over winter-ſtorms and tempeſts, and all the coldneſs, barrenneſs, and emptineſs: and the ſame light and power will go over the tempter's head; which power and light was before he was. So in the light ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, ye will ſee your ſalvation, ye will ſee the Lord's ſtrength, ye will feel the ſmall rain, ye will feel the freſh ſprings, your minds being kept low in the power and light: for that which is out of the power lifts up. But in the power and light ye will feel God, revealing his ſecrets, inſpiring your minds, and his gifts coming in unto you; through which your hearts will be filled with God's love, and praiſes to him that lives for evermore; for in his light and power his bleſſing is received. So in that, the eternal power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſerve and keep you! Live every one in the power of God, that ye may all come to be heirs of that, and know that to be your portion; even the kingdom that hath no end, and the endleſs life which the Seed is heir of. Feel that ſet over all, which hath the promiſe, and bleſſing of God for ever.</p>

                  <p>About this time I received ſome lines from a high-flown profeſſor concerning the way of Chriſt; to which I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following anſwer:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Friend,</salute>

                        <p>IT is not oncumſtances we contend about; but the way of Chriſt and his light, which are but one; though the world hath imagined many ways, and all out of the light which by the light are condemned. He who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this light, ſaid, <q>He that knoweth God, heareth us;
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:037441_0370_100D7F5CC216F150"/>he that is not of God, heareth us not: hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the ſpirit of error.</q> It is the ſame now with them that know the truth; though the whole world lies in wickedneſs. All diſpenſations and differences that are not one in the light we deny; and by the light, that was before ſeparation, do we ſee them to be ſelf-ſeparations in the ſenſual, having not the Spirit. Their fruits and end are weighed in the even balance, and found to be in the dark, the Lo-here. and Lo-there thou telleſt of; and the preſence of Chriſt is not with them, though the blind ſee it not; who ſee not with the pure eye, which is ſingle; but with the many eyes, which lead into the many ways. Nor are any the people of God, 'but who are baptized into this principle of light: which all the faithful ſervants of the Lord were ever guided by in all ages, ſince the apoſtacy and before. For the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy was and is from the light; and all that oppoſe the light are apoſtates. Who conteſt againſt the truth, are enemies to it, and are not actuated by the Spirit; but have another way than the light. All ſuch are in the world, its words, faſhions, and cuſtoms, though of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral forms, as to their worſhip; yet all under the god of this world, oppoſing the light and appearance of Chriſt, which ſhould lead out from under his power, of what form ſoever they are; yet are they all joined againſt the light. All theſe are of the world; and fighting againſt them who are not of the world; but are gathered and gathering out of the world: ſo it ever was againſt the people of God, under what name ſoever. They only are ſaints by calling, who are called into the light; and ſons of Sion, which vary not from the light, to which the Spirit is promiſed, which is not tied to any forms out of the light; wherein all inherit, who are co-heirs with Chriſt; which many talk of who inherit the earthly, inſtead of the heavenly. And whereas thou ſpeakeſt of Chriſt and his apoſtles cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with the ſayings and words of the prophets; and of their being your example in ſo doing; I ſay, wolves will take the ſheeps cloathing; but the light and life finds them out, and judges (not by their ſtolen words, but) by their works. Nor did Chriſt cover himſelf with any words, but what were fulfilled in him: neither do any of Chriſt's boaſt in other men's lines made ready without them; to which rule if ye be obedient, fewer words and more life will be ſeen among you. Then ye will not
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:037441_0371_100D905C0F80CFA0"/>count in ſtraitneſs to ſilence the fleſh; and hear what he ſaith, who ſpeaks peace, <q>that his people turn no more to folly.</q> If ye once know, that what is ſtolen muſt be reſtored fourfold; the mouth of the falſe prophet will be ſtopped, which builds up in deceit, but, not in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And whereas thou ſayeſt, <q>The Spirit of truth affords nothing but endleſs varieties;</q> I ſay, the Spirit of truth thou knoweſt not: for the Spirit of truth ſaid, "There is but one thing needful;" and to ſpeak the ſame thing again is ſafe for the hearers; but that ſpirit which affords nothing but endleſs varieties, is not the Spirit of truth, but is gone out into curious notions; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his names and colours is read no-where but in the unity of the Spirit of truth. All others call truth deceit, and deceit truth, as the blind that oppoſed the light ever did, who are ever learning endleſs varieties, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, nor to an end of their labours: but when they are out of one form get into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo long as they can find a green tree without. Thus ye are kept at work all your life, and to the grave in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as the dumb prieſts, thou telleſt of, have been before you; only ye have got a finer image, but leſs life. And thou, whoſe teaching hath no' end, art in the horſe-mill thou ſpeakeſt of. I have read the epiſtles to Timothy, and to the Hebrews; and there I find, the duty of all believers is to ſee the law of the new covenant written in the heart, whereby all may know God, from the leaſt to-the greateſt. I know the holy ſcriptures are profitable for the man of God; but what is that to the man of ſin, to the firſt-born, who is out of the light, and being unſtable and unlearned, wreſt them to their own deſtruction; but to the life cannot come? And for your two ordinances thou ſpeakell of, I ſay, upon the ſame account ye deny the prieſts of the world therein, we deny you; being both of you not-only out of the life, but out of the form too. That command, Matt. xxviii. 19. ye never had, nor its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which was, <q>To baptize into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</q> What Paul received of the Lord, that body and that bread, ye know as little of, but what ye have found in the chapter; nor of the coming of Chriſt neither, who cannot believe his light. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſpeakeſt of preaching Chriſt of envy, and pleadeſt for it; I ſay, ſuch preachers we have enough of in theſe days. What elſe art thou doing, who ſayeſt, Paul was
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:037441_0372_100D7F5E449AD540"/>ſent to baptize; though Paul ſays, he was not: ſo thou wouldeſt prove him a liar, if any would believe thee before him. Thou ſayeſt alſo, <q>For aught thou knoweſt, he might baptize thouſands.</q> Thou mighteſt as eaſily have ſaid millions, and as ſoon have proved it. Thou mayeſt ſay the ſame of circumciſion alſo, and on the ſame ground. As for the ſigns that followed thoſe that believed. which thou ſayeſt are ceaſed; I ſay, they who cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the light cannot ſee the ſigns, nor could believe them, if they ſhould ſee them to carp at; no more than ſormerly they could do, who oppoſed the light in former ages. They cannot properly be ſaid to ceaſe to ſuch, who never had them; but have only heard or read that others long ago had them. But that the power, and ſigns, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is not the ſame that ever it was, in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wherein he is received in the light, that I deny; and declare it to be falſe, and from a ſpirit that knows not God, nor his power. And as for the goſpel-foundation thou ſpeakeſt of, I ſay, it is to be laid again in all the world. Ye never were on it, ſince the man of ſin ſet up his forms without power. Till ye can own the light of Chriſt, which the ſaints preached, and their life and practice; for ſhame, ceaſe to talk of their foundation, or glorious work, or quakings and tremblings, the faints experiences, which the world knows not, nor can own: though ye cannot read that ever any came aright to declare how they knew God, or received his word, without them. In thy exhortation thou biddeſt me, "Love Chriſt, wherefoever I ſee him." But hadſt thou told me where one might come to ſee him, or how one might know him, thou hadſt ſhewn more of a chriſtian in that than in all thou haſt ſpoken. But it ſeems, ye are not all of one mind. Some of you ſay, "He is gone, and will be no more ſeen till doomſday." But if ever ye come to ſee Chriſt to your comfort, while ye oppoſe his light, then God hath not ſpoken by me. This thou ſhalt remember, when thy time thou haſt ſpent.</p>

                  <p>Great oppoſition did the prieſts and profeſſors make about this time againſt the light of Chriſt Jeſus, denying it to be univerſally given; and againſt the pouring forth of the Spirit, and ſons and daughters propheſying thereby.

<pb n="296" facs="unknown:037441_0373_100D905E00DCF280"/>Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to give forth the following lines, for the opening of the minds and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of people, and to manifeſt the blindneſs and darkneſs of their teachers.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>TO you profeſſors, prieſts, and teachers, who are in darkneſs, and know not the Spirit in priſon, nor the light that ſhines in darkneſs, which the darkneſs doth not comprehend; but are as infidels, whom the god of the world hath blinded, and to whom the goſpel is hid. For though ye have the four books, the goſpel is hid to you; who are now ſtranging at the work of God, and do not believe that Chriſt hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world. To you I offer ſome ſcriptures to read, which will prove your ſpirits, and try them, how contrary they are to the apoſtles ſpirit, the Spirit of Chriſt and of the ſaints. <q>Chriſt went, and preached to the ſpirits in priſon,</q> 1 Pet. iii. 19. He that readeth, let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whether this was a meaſure of the Spirit, yea or nay, or the Spirit without meaſure, which he miniſtered to? <q>For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him,</q> Joh. iii. 34. Here Chriſt had not the Spirit given unto him by meaſure. The apoſtle ſaid, <q>We will not boaſt of things without (or beyond) our meaſure,</q> 2 Cor. x. 13. So here was meaſure, and not by meaſure. Chriſt, who received not the Spirit by meaſure, told his diſciples he would <q>ſend them the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, that he ſhould guide them into all truth: for the ſhould not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak, and he will ſhew you things to come. He ſhall glorify me: for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</q> Joh. xvi. 13, 14. Mind, read, and learn; the Comforter ſhall receive of mine, ſaith Chriſt, and ſhall ſhew it unto you: who hath the meaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of his who hath not by meaſure. The Comforter, when he comes, is to reprove the world of ſin, of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and of judgment, ver. 8. Now mind the great work of God: the Spirit of truth, which leads the ſaints into all truth, which receives of Chriſt's, and ſhews it unto the diſciples, who are in the meaſure, he ſhall reprove the world of ſin, becauſe they do not believe, &amp;c. The Comforter, whom Chriſt will ſend, takes of his, and ſhews it to the diſciples, the ſame reproves the world. Mind
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:037441_0374_100D90604972CED8"/>now, whether this be a meaſure, yea or nay, which comes from him who received not the Spirit by meaſure? He that leads the believer into all truth, reproves the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the world, of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He that is led into all truth, ſees that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, by the Spirit of truth that leads him. Chriſt ſaith, "He ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you." Is 'this a meaſure, yea or nay, from him whom God gave the Spirit not by meaſure unto?</p>
                        <p>Again the Lord ſaid, both by his prophet, Joel ii. 28, and his apoſtle, Acts ii. 17, 18. <q>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh, your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſy, your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams: and on my ſervants and on my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maidens I will pour out in thoſe days of my Spirit, and they ſhall propheſy.</q> Look, ye deceivers; here the Lord ſaith, he will pour of his Spirit: mark the word OF the Lord's Spirit upon all fleſh. What! young men, old men, ſons and daughters, and maids, all theſe to have the Spirit of God poured upon them? Here, ſay they, theſe deny the means then. Nay, that's the means. And the great and notable day of the Lord is coming, wherein it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved. The God of the ſpirits of all fleſh is known: and, ſaith the apoſtle, who would not boaſt of things beyond his meaſure, <q>That which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them,</q> Rom. i. 19. By this which was of God manifeſt in them, they knew covetouſneſs, malice, murder, deceit, and ungodlineſs; knew that the judgments of God were upon ſuch things; and that they were worthy of death; not only that did the ſame, but who had pleaſure in them that did them. Therefore, ſaid the aboſtle, <q>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</q> &amp;c. Now this of God manifeſt in them, which God ſhewed unto them, by which they know unrighteouſneſs, and God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereupon, and that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death; whether this be a meaſure, yea or nay, which is of God, and which he hath ſhewed to them? What was that in them, that <q>did by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the law, which ſhewed the work of the law written in their hearts,</q> Rom. ii. 14, 15. Mark, "writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:"
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:037441_0375_100D906255209D78"/>ſhall not this judge them that have the outward law, but are out of the life of it? The apoſtle ſaith, <q>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</q> 1 Cor. xii. 7. There are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit; the manifeſtation of it is given to <q>every man</q> to profit withal. Mark, <q>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom; to another the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the ſame Spirit: to another faith by the ſame Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the ſame Spirit: to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another diſcerning of ſpirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding to every man ſeverally as he will.</q> Mark that, To every man ſeverally as he will.</p>
                        <p>Again the apoſtle ſaith, <q>The grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world,</q> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Now ye that turn from this grace, which brings ſalvation, into laſciviouſneſs, ye deny it, and ſay, that which teacheth the ſaints, who by grace are ſaved, hath not appeared to all men. Jude ſaith, <q>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his ſaints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him,</q> ver. 15. Here mark again; him that cometh with ten thouſands of his ſaints, to convince all of their ungodly deeds and hard ſpeeches: here it is, ALL of their ungodly deeds; and ALL of their hard ſpeeches; none left out, but ALL to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and judged, the world reproved, by him who comes with ten thouſands of his ſaints, and will reign, and be king and judge. And have not ye all ſomething in you, that doth reprove you for your hard ſpeeches, and your ungodly deeds, the ungodlieſt of you all, who live in your hard ſpeeches againſt him, and againſt his light and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual appearance in his people.</p>
                        <p>Again, the apoſtle, writing to the Gentiles, ſaith, <q>But unto every one of us is given grace, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the gift of Chriſt,</q> Epheſ. iv. 7. Now mark, Here is the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt. <q>who lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</q> Joh. i. 9. <q>that
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:037441_0376_100D9063E6CDAB88"/>all men through him might believe. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned, &amp;c. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,</q> &amp;c. Joh. iii. 18, 19. Now every man that cometh into the world being enlightened, one loveth it, and brings his deeds to the light, that with the light he may ſee whether they be wrought in God: the other hates the light, "becauſe his deeds are evil;" he will not bring his deeds to the light, becauſe he knows the light will reprove him. So he that hates the light, wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened him, knows the light will reprove him for his evil deeds; and therefore he will not come to the light.</p>
                        <p>Again, the Lord by his prophet ſaith concerning Chriſt, <q>I will give him for a light to the Gentiles, that he may be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth,</q> Iſa. xlix. 6. And what is that which the children, that walk according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the <q>ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience,</q> Epheſ. ii. 2. are diſobedient to? Mark, and read yourſelves, who, being diſobedient, walk according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air; Mark, I ſay, what it is that all ſuch are diſobedient to? He that hath an ear, let him hear. The apoſtle ſaith to the Coloſſians, <q>The wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience,</q> Col. iii. 6. Come, ye profeſſors, let us ſee, Is not this ſomething of God that is diſobeyed? Is it not that which is of God manifeſt in them, which God hath ſhewed them, which lets them ſee God's judgments are upon ſuch, when they act unrighteouſly? Is not this the meaſure of God, the Spirit that is in priſon? and the Spirit of God that is grieved?</p>
                        <p>And ye profeſſors, come, let us read the parable of the talents, and reckon with you, and ſee who it is that hath hid the Lord's money in the earth? Come, ye that have gained, enter ye into your maſter's joy. Go, thou that haſt hid the Lord's money in the earth, into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; "take if from him, and give it to him that hath:" every man ſhall have his reward. For the Lord hath given to "every man according to his ſeveral ability," Mat. xxv. 15. Mark that, <q>To every man according to his ſeveral ability:</q> Read this, if you can. Now is the Lord coming to call every man ſeverally to account, to
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:037441_0377_100D9066A4671398"/>'whom he hath given ſeverally, according to their ability. Now the wicked and ſlothful ſervant, who hid the Lord's money in the earth, will be found out; and the Lord's money will be taken from him, although he hath hidden it. To him the Lord's commands have been grievous; but to us they are not, who love God and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. "And," ſaith the apoſtle to the Romans, <q>I ſay, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think: but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith,</q> Rom. xii. 3. Read and mark, here is a meaſure of faith.</p>
                        <p>"And." ſaith another apoſtle, <q>as every man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as ſtewards of the manifold grace of God,</q> 1 Pet. iv. 10. "For the grace of God hath appeared to all men." the good ſtewards can give their account with joy: but ye bad ſtewards, that turn from the grace of God into laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ye will be reckoned withal; ye ſhall have your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. "But," ſay the world, <q>muſt every one miniſter as he hath received the gift?</q> Yea, ſay I, <q>but let him ſpeak as the oracles of God; and let him do it as of the ability which God giveth,</q> ver. 11. John in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſaith, <q>They were judged every man according to their works,</q> Rev. xx. 13. Chriſt ſaith, <q>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgment,</q> Mat. xii. 36. <q>Ye that name the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity,</q> 2 Tim. ii. 19. <q>The Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he ſhall reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works.</q> Mat. xvi. He who is gone into a far country, and hath given talents to every one of you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your ſeveral ability, <q>will render to every man according to his deeds,</q> Rom. ii. 6. <q>And further I ſay unto you, if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin; but the Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſs.</q> Rom. viii. 9, 10. So let the light, which cometh from Chriſt, examine; for the Lord is appearing. Ye that have recoved according to your ability, ſmite not your fellow-ſervant. Think not that the Lord delayeth the time of his coming. Be not as they that ſaid, <q>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we ſhall die.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The apoſtle tells the Epheſians, that unto him <q>this
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:037441_0378_100D906954F1A9F0"/>grace was given—to make all men ſee what is the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the myſtery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt,</q> Eph. iii. 9. Read and underſtand every one with the light which comes from Chriſt, the myſtery; which will be your condemnation, if ye believe not in it. This is to all who ſtumble at the work of the Spirit of God, the manifeſtation of it, <q>which is given to every man to profit withal.</q> Come, ye profeſſors, who ſtumble at it; let us read the parables. <q>A ſower went forth to ſow; and ſome ſeed fell on the highway-ground, and ſome on ſtony ground, and ſome on thorny ground: the ſeed is the Word, the Son of Man is the ſeedſman. He that hath an ear, let him hear,</q> Mat. xiii. Now look, all ye profeſſors, what ground ye are? And what ye have brought forth? And whether the wicked ſeedſman hath not got his ſeed into your ground? <q>He that hath an ear, let him hear it.</q> And come, read another parable of the houſeholder hiring labourers to go into the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and agreeing with every man for a penny, Mat. xx. Every man is to have his penny; the laſt that went in, as well as the firſt; <q>and the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt ſhall be laſt; for many are called, but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.

                        <p>The Lord ſaid, he would make a new covenant, by <q>writing his law in people's hearts, and putting his Spirit in their inward parts,</q> whereby they ſhould all come to know the Lord, by whom the world was made. Now every one of you mind the law written in your hearts, and this Spirit put in your inward parts, that it need not be ſaid to you, "Know the Lord:" but that ye may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the promiſe of God fulfilled in you. But, ſay the world and profeſſors, "If every one muſt come to witneſs
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:037441_0379_100D9113BA4F3B18"/>the law of God written in their hearts, and the Spirit put in the inward parts, "what muſt we do with all our teachers?" As we come to witneſs that, we need not any man to teach us to know the Lord, having his law written in our hearts, and his Spirit put in our inward parts. This is the covenant of life, the everlaſting covenant, which decays not, nor changes not: and here is the way to the Father, without which no man cometh unto the Father. Here is the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting prieſthood, the end of the old prieſthood, whoſe lips were to preſerve knowledge; but now, ſaith Chriſt, "Learn of me:" who is the high-prieſt, of the new prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And, ſaith the apoſtle,— <q>That ye may grow up in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom are hid the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge.</q> So we are brought off from the old prieſthood that did change, to Chriſt, to the new prieſthood that doth not change; off from the firſt covenant that doth decay, to the everlaſting covenant that doth not decay, Chriſt Jeſus, the Covenant of Light, from whom every one of you have a light, that ye might believe in the Covenant of Light. If ye do not believe, ye are condemned; for light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil. "I am come a light into the world," ſaith Chriſt, <q>that whoſoever believeth in me ſhould not abide in darkneſs, but have the light of life,</q> John xii. 46. "Believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light" Ye who do not believe in the light, but hate it becauſe it manifeſts your deeds to be evil, ye are condemned by the light. Therefore while ye have time, prize it. Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is nigh; leſt ye ſay, "Time is paſt:" for the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's time was paſt. Therefore, while time is not quite paſt, conſider, ſearch yourſelves, and ſee if you be not they that hate the light, and ſo are builders that ſtumble at the corner-ſtone; for they that hated the light, and did not believe in the light, did ſo in ages paſt. <q>I am the light of the world,</q> ſaith Chriſt, "who," the apoſtle ſaith, "doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world." Chriſt alſo ſaith, "Learn of me;" and of him God ſaith, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." Here is your Teacher. But ye that hate the light do not learn of Chriſt, will not have him to be your king to reign over you; him, to whom all power in heaven and earth is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, who bears his government upon his ſhoulders, who is
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:037441_0380_100D7F75C470CB88"/>now come to reign, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world, who will give to every man a reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, whether they be good or evil. So every man, with the light that comes from Chriſt, will ſee his deeds, both he that hates it and he that loves it. And he that will not bring his deeds to the light, becauſe the light will reprove him, that is his condemnation; and he ſhall have a reward according to his deeds. For the Lord is come to reckon with you. He looks for fruits; the ax is laid to your root; and every tree of you, that bears not good fruit, muſt be hewn down and caſt into the fire.</p>

                  <p>Having ſtaid ſome time in London, and viſited the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of friends in and about the city, and cleared myſelf of what ſervices the Lord had at the time laid upon me there, I left the town and travelled into Kent, Suſſex, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, viſiting friends; amongſt whom I had great meetings, and often met with oppoſition from Baptiſts and other jangling profeſſors; but the Lord's power went over them.</p>
                  <p>We lay one night at Farnham, where we had a little meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The people were exceeding rude; but at laſt the Lord's power came over them. After meeting we went to our inn, and gave notice, <q>That any who feared God might come to our inn to us.</q> There came abundance of rude people, the magiſtrates of the town, and ſome profeſſors. I declared the truth to them; and thoſe of the people that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves rudely, the magiſtrates put out of the room. When they were gone, another rude company of profeſſors came up, and ſome of the chief of the town. They called for faggots and drink, though we forbad them, and were as rude a people as ever I met withal. The Lord's power chained them, that they had not power to do us any miſchief; but when they went away they left all the faggots and beer, which they had called for into the room, for us to pay for in the morning. We ſhewed the innkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what an unworthy thing it was; but he told us, <q>we muſt pay it;</q> and pay it we did. Before we left the town, I wrote to the magiſtrates and heads of the town, and to the prieſt, ſhewing them how he had taught his people, and laying before them their rude and uncivil carriage to ſtrangers that ſought their good.</p>
                  <p>Leaving that place we came to Baſingſtoke, a very rude town; where they had formerly very much abuſed friends.
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:037441_0381_100D7F784C054540"/>There I had a meeting in the evening, which was quiet; for the Lord's power chained the unruly. At the cloſe of the meeting I was moved to put off my hat, and to pray to the Lord to open their underſtandings; upon which they raiſed a report, <q>That I put off my hat to them, and bid them good night,</q> which was never in my heart. After the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we came to our inn, I ſent for the innkeeper, as I uſed to do; and he came into the room to us, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a very rude man. I admoniſhed him to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and fear the Lord; but he called for faggots and a pint of wine, and drank it off himſelf; then called for another, and called up half a dozen men into our chamber. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I bid him go out of the chamber, and told him he ſhould not drink there; for we ſent for him up to ſpeak to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his eternal good. He was exceeding mad, rude, and drunk. When he continued his rudeneſs and would not be gone, I told him, <q>The chamber was mine for the time I lodged in it;</q> and called for the key. Then he went away in a rage. In the morning he would not be ſeen; but I told his wife of his unchriſtian carriage towards us.</p>
                  <p>After this we came to Bridport, having meetings in the way. We went to an inn, and ſent into the town for ſuch as feared God; and there came a ſhopkeeper, a profeſſor, and put off his hat to us: and ſeeing we did not the like to him again, but ſaid Thou and Thee to him, he told us, 'He was not of our religion;' and after ſome diſcourſe he went away. After awhile he ſent to the inn to us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire us 'to come to his houſe, for ſome would ſpeak with us.' Thomas Curtis went to his houſe; where when he came, the man had got the prieſt and magiſtrates thither, and they boaſted much that they had catched George Fox, taking him for me. When they perceived their miſtake they were very angry; yet the Lord's power came over them, ſo that they let him go again. Mean while I had an opportunity of ſpeaking to ſome ſober people that came to the inn. When Thomas was returned, and we were paſſing out of the town, ſome came to us, and ſaid, <q>The officers were coming to fetch me;</q> but the Lord's power was over them, ſo that they had not power to touch me. There were ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in the town who were turned to the Lord, and have ſtood faithful in their teſtimony to the truth ever ſince, and a ſine meeting is ſettled there.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing from hence we viſited Portſmouth and Pool, where we had glorious meetings; and many were turned to
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:037441_0382_100D7F7ADD295CD0"/>the Lord. At Ringwood we had a large general meeting, where the Lord's power was over all. At Weymouth we had a meeting; and from thence came through Dorcheſter to Lime, where the inn we went to was taken up with mountebanks, ſo that there was hardly any room for us or our horſes. In the evening we drew up ſome queries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ground of all diſeaſes, and the nature and virtues of medicinable creatures, and ſent them to the mountebanks; l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tting them know, <q>If they would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, we would ſtick them on the croſs next day.</q> This brought them down and made them cool, for they could not anſwer them; but in the morning they reaſoned a little with us. We left the queries with ſome friendly people that were convinced in the town, to ſtick upon the market-croſs. The Lord's power reached ſome of the ſober people in that place, who were turned by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt to his free teaching.</p>
                  <p>We then travelled to Exeter; and at the Seven Stars, an inn at the bridge foot, we had a general meeting of friends out of Cornwall and Devonſhire; to which came Humphry Lower, Thomas Lower, and John Ellis from the Land's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, Henry Pollexfen, with friends from Plymouth, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Trelawny, and divers other friends. A bleſſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meeting we had, and the Lord's everlaſting power came over all; in which I ſaw, and ſaid, <q>That the Lord's power had ſurrounded this nation round about as with a wall and bulwark, and his ſeed reached from ſea to ſea.</q> Friends were eſtabliſhed in the everlaſting feed of life, Chriſt Jeſus, their life, rock, teacher, and ſhepherd.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, major Blackmore ſent ſoldiers to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me; but I was gone before they came. As I was riding up the ſtreet, I ſaw the officers going down. So the Lord croſſed their deſign, and friends paſſed away peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and quietly. The ſoldiers examined ſome friends after I was gone, 'What they did there?' but when they told them, <q>They were in their inn, and had buſineſs in the city,</q> they paſſed away without meddling any further with them.</p>
                  <p>From Exeter I took meetings as I went, till I came to Briſtol; and was at the meeting there. After it was done I did not ſtay in the town, but paſſed into Wales, and had a meeting at the Slone. Thence going to Cardiff, a juſtice of peace ſent to me, deſiring, <q>I would come with half a dozen of my friends to his houſe,</q> So I took a friend or
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:037441_0383_100D7F7C61E45888"/>two and went to him, and he and his wife received us very civilly. The next day we had a meeting in Cardiff in the town-hall; to which that juſtice ſent about ſeventeen of his family. There came ſome diſturbers, but the Lord's power was over them; and many were turned to the Lord. To ſome who had run out with James Nayler, and forſook meetings, I had to ſend word, <q>That the day of their viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was over;</q> and they never proſpered after.</p>
                  <p>We travelled from Cardiff to Swanſea, where we had a bleſſed meeting; and a meeting was ſettled there in the name of Jeſus. In our way thither we paſſed over in a paſſage-boat with the high ſheriff of the county. The next day I went to have ſpoken with him, but he refuſed.</p>
                  <p>We went to another meeting in the country; where the Lord's preſence was much with us. From thence we went to a great man's houſe, who received us very lovingly; but the next morning he would not be ſeen: one, that in the mean time came to him, had ſo eſtranged him, that we could not get to ſpeak with him again.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed through the countries, having meetings, and gathering people in the name of Chriſt, their heavenly teacher, till we came to Brecknock; where we ſet up our horſes at an inn. There went with me Thomas Holmes, and John-ap-John, who was moved of the Lord to <q>ſpeak in the ſtreets.</q> I walked out but a little into the fields; and when I returned the town was in an uproar. When I came into the chamber in the inn, it was full of people, and they were ſpeaking in Welch. I deſired them to ſpeak in Engliſh, which they did; and much diſcourſe we had. After awhile they went away. Towards night the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates gathered in the ſtreets with a multitude of people, and they bid them ſhout, and gathered up the town; ſo that, for about two hours together, there was ſuch a noiſe as the like we had not heard; and the magiſtrates ſet them on to ſhout again when they had given over. We thought it looked like the uproar, which we read was amongſt Diana's craftſmen. This tumult continued till it was within night, and if the Lord's power had not limited them, they ſeemed likely to have pulled down the houſe, and us to pieces.</p>
                  <p>At night the woman of the houſe would have had us go to ſupper in another room; but we, diſcerning her plot, refuſed. Then ſhe would have had half a dozen men come into the room to us, under pretence of diſcourſing with us.
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:037441_0384_100D7F81F6BF0B90"/>We told her, <q>No perſon ſhould come into our room that night, neither would we go to them.</q> Then ſhe ſaid, we ſhould 'ſup in another room;' but we told her, we would have no ſupper if we had it not in our own room. At length, when ſhe ſaw ſhe could not get us out, ſhe brought up our ſupper. So ſhe and they were croſſed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for they had an intent to have done us miſchief, but the Lord prevented them. Next morning I wrote a paper to the town concerning their unchriſtian carriage, ſhewing the fruits of their prieſts and magiſtrates; and as I paſſed out of town I ſpoke to the people, and told them, They were a ſhame to Chriſtianity and religion.</p>
                  <p>From this place we went to a great meeting in a ſteeple-houſe yard; where was a prieſt, and Walter Jenkin, who had been a juſtice, and another juſtice. A bleſſed glorious meeting we had. There being many profeſſors, I was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord to open the <q>ſcriptures to them, and to anſwer the objections which they ſtuck at in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (for I knew them very well;) and to turn them to Chriſt, who had enlightened them; with which light they might ſee the ſins and treſpaſſes they had been dead in, and their Saviour who came to redeem them out of them, who was to be their way to God, the truth and the life to them, and their prieſt made higher than the heavens; ſo that they might come to ſit under his teaching.</q> A peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meeting we had; many were convinced, and ſettled in the truth that day. After the meeting, I went with Walter Jenkin to the other juſtice's, who ſaid to me, <q>You have this day given great ſatisfaction to the people, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the objections that were in their minds.</q> For the people had the ſcriptures, but they were not turned to the Spirit, which ſhould let them ſee that which gave them forth, the Spirit of God, which is the key to open them.</p>
                  <p>From hence we paſſed to Richard Hamborow's at Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil, where was a great meeting; to which there came an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other juſtice, and ſeveral great people; whoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were opened by the Lord's Spirit and power, and they were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whence it came. A great convincement there was; a large meeting is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe parts, and ſettled in the name of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>After this returning to England, we came to Shrewſbury, where we had a great meeting; and viſited friends up and down the country in their meetings, till we came to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Gandy's, in Cheſhire, where we had a meeting of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:037441_0385_100D7FD6EF9820B8"/>two and three thouſand people, as it was thought; and the everlaſting word of life was held forth, and received that day. A bleſſed meeting it was; for friends were ſettled by the power of God upon Jeſus Chriſt, the rock and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>At this time there was a great drought; and after this general meeting was ended there fell ſo great a rain, that friends ſaid, They thought we could not travel, the waters would be ſo riſen. But I believed the rain had not gone ſo far as they had come that day to the meeting. The next day in the afternoon, when we turned back into ſome parts of Wales again, the ways were duſty, and no rain had fallen thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>When Oliver Cromwel ſet forth a proclamation for a faſt throughout the nation for rain, in a very great drought, it was obſerved, that as far as truth had ſpread in the north, there were pleaſant ſhowers and rain enough; yet the ſouth, in many places, was almoſt ſpoiled for want of rain. At that time I was moved to write an anſwer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's proclamation; wherein I told him: <q>If he had come to own God's truth, he ſhould have had rain; and that drought was to them a ſign of their barrenneſs, and want of the water of life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the ſame time was wrote the following paper to 'diſtinguiſh betwixt the true and falſe faſts.'</p>

They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the ſpider's web; he that eateth of their eggs, dies, and that which is cruſhed breaks out into a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; their webs ſhall not become garments, neither ſhall they cover themſelves with their works.</q> Mark and take notice: <q>Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands: their feet run to do evil, and they make haſte to ſhed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, waſting and deſtruction are in their paths; the way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in their doings. They have made them a crooked path; whoſoever goes therein ſhall not know peace:</q> mark: Such go from the light, therefore is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment far off, neither doth juſtice overtake. Here is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, here is the walking in darkneſs, here is the grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like blind men, as though they had no eyes, and their ſtumbling at noon-day in deſolate places, like blind men. Here is the roaring like bears, and mourning ſorely like doves; here judgment is looked for, but there is none, and ſalvation is put far off: for the light is denied, which gives to ſee it. But here is the multiplying of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and their ſins teſtifying againſt them, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion that was within them, and their iniquities which they knew in tranſgreſſing and lying againſt the Lord, ſpeaking the things they ſhould not; when they knew by that of God in them, they ſhould not ſpeak it. So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the way of God, ſpeaking oppreſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting, conceiving and uttering forth from the heart words of falſehood; here judgment is turned away backward, and juſtice ſtands afar off: truth is fallen in the ſtreets, and
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:037441_0389_100D906EDD1079B8"/>equity cannot enter. Yea, truth faileth; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from evil, makes himſelf a prey! The Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him. Theſe are ſuch as are in the faſt which God doth not accept; and are not in the true faſt, whoſe "light breaks forth as the morning:" but theſe are ſuch as are in the falſe faſt. who grope like blind men.</p>
                        <p>That which gives to know the true and falſe faſt, is the light, which gives the eye to ſee each faſt; where the true judgment is, and the iniquity ſtandeth not, nor the tranſgreſſor, nor the ſpeaker of lies: but that is judged 'and condemned with the light, which makes it manifeſt. And thoſe who are in this faſt, when they call upon the Lord, the Lord will anſwer them, "Here am I." Here truth is pleaded for and falſehood flies away. But they who are out of this faſt in the perverſeneſs, their tongues uttering perverſe things, are ſtumbling and groping like blind men, out of the light, in the iniquity which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from God, who hides his face from them that he will not hear: going from the light, they go from the Lord and his face. So this is it which muſt be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, for this it is which ſeparates from God: and here comes the reward openly, which condemns all that which is contrary to the light; injuſtice, iniquity, traſgreſſion, vanity, that which brings forth miſchief; which hatcheth the cockatrice-eggs, and weaves the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders web: he that eateth of theſe eggs, dies. Mark, That "which is cruſhed breaks out into a viper." Mark again, <q>Their webs ſhall not become garments, neither ſhall they cover themſelves with their works of vanity: acts of violence are in their hands.</q> This is all from the light, in the wickedneſs. <q>Their ſeet run to do evil, and they make haſte to ſhed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of vanity, waſting and deſtruction is in their path.</q> This is all far from the light. Again. <q>The way of peace they know not, there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths, whoſoever goes therein ſhall not know peace.</q> Mark; who goes in their way, that know not the way of peace, ſhall they know peace? <q>Whoſe path is crooked, where there is no judgment in their goings:</q> take notice, <q>No judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their goings:</q> This is all from the light, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth that which is to be judged; where the covenant of peace is known, where all that which is contrary to it is kept out.

They that be in the true faſt are ſeparated from all theſe; their words, their actions and fruits, and their faſt; but to thoſe whoſe faſt breaks the bonds of iniquity, whom the Lord hears, and to whom righteouſneſs ſprings forth, and goes before them, the glory of the Lord is their rere-ward.</p>

                  <p>We paſſed into Wales through Montgomeryſhire, and ſo into Radnorſhire, where there was a meeting like a leaguer, for multitudes. I walked a little aſide, whilſt the people were gathering: and there came to me John-ap-John, a Welſhman, whom I deſired to go to the people; and if he had any thing upon him from the Lord to them, he might ſpeak in Welſh, and thereby gather more together. Then came Morgan Watkins to me, who was become loving to friends, and ſaid, <q>The people lie like a leaguer, and the gentry of the country are come in.</q> I bade him go up alſo, and leave me; for I had a great travail upon me for the ſalvation of the people. When they were well ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, I went into the meeting, and ſtood upon a chair about three hours. I ſtood a pretty while, before I geban to ſpeak: after ſome time I felt the power of the Lord over the whole aſſembly: and his everlaſting life and truth ſhined over all. <q>The ſcriptures were opened to them, and the objections they had in their minds anſwered. They were directed to the light of Chriſt, the heavenly man; that by it they might ſee their ſins, and Chriſt Jeſus to be their Saviour, their Redeemer, their Mediator, and come to ſeed upon him, the bread of life from heaven. Many were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to his free teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day; and all were bowed down under the power of God; ſo that though the multitude was ſo great that many ſat on horſeback to hear, there was no oppoſition. A prieſt ſat with his wife on horſeback, heard attentively, and made no objection. The people parted peaceably, with great ſatisfaction; many of them ſaying, They never heard ſuch a ſermon before, nor the ſcriptures ſo opened. For the new covenant was opened, and the old, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and terms of each, and the parables were explained. The ſtate of the church in the apoſtles days was ſet forth, the apoſtacy ſince laid open; and the free teaching of
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:037441_0391_100D9072C7FBE648"/>Chriſt and the apoſtles was ſet atop of all the hireling teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and the Lord had the praiſe of all, for many were turned to him that day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went from thence to Leominſter, where was a great meeting in a cloſe; many hundreds of people being gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. There were about ſix congregational preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and prieſts amongſt the people; and Thomas Taylor, who had been a prieſt, but was now become a miniſter of Chriſt Jeſus, was with me. I ſtood up, and declared about three hours; and none of the prieſts were able to open their mouths in oppoſition; the Lord's power and truth ſo reached and bound them. At length one prieſt went off about a bow-ſhot from me; drew ſeveral of the people after him, and began to preach to them. So I kept our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he kept his. After awhile Thomas Taylor was moved to go and ſpeak to him; upon which he gave over: and he, with the people he had drawn off, came to us again; and the Lord's power went over all. At laſt a Baptiſt, that was convinced, ſaid, <q>Where's prieſt Tombs? how chance he doth not come out?</q> This Tombs was prieſt of Leominſter. Hereupon ſome went and told the prieſt; who came with the bailiffs and other officers of the town. When he was come, they ſet him upon a ſtool over againſt me. I was ſpeaking of the heavenly, divine light of Chriſt, which he <q>enlightens every one withal that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world; to give them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour.</q> When prieſt Tombs heard this, he cried out, <q>That is a natural light, and a made light.</q> Then I deſired the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take out their bibles, and aſked the prieſt, <q>Whether he did affirm that was a created, natural, made light, which John, a man ſent from God, bore witneſs to, when he ſaid, <q>In him (to wit, in the Word) was life, and that life was the light of men,</q> John i. 4. Doſt thou affirm and mean, ſaid I, that this light here ſpoken of was a created, natural, made light? He ſaid, Yes. Then I ſhewed by the ſcriptures, that the natural, created, made light is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light in the outward firmament, proceeding from the fun, moon, and ſtars? "And doſt thou affirm," ſaid I, <q>that God ſent John to bear witneſs to the light of the ſun, moon, and ſtars?</q> "Then," ſaid he, "Did I ſay ſo?" I replied, <q>Didſt thou not ſay it was a natural, created, made light, that John bore witneſs unto? If thou doſt not like thy words, take them again, and mend them.</q>
                        <pb n="315" facs="unknown:037441_0392_100D90745B7BFED8"/>Then he ſaid <q>That light, which I ſpoke of, was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, created light.</q> I told him, He had not at all mended his cauſe; for that light, which I ſpoke of, was the very ſame that John was ſent of God to bear witneſs to; which was the life in the Word, by which all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lights, ſun, moon, and ſtars, were made.</q> 
                     <q>In him (to wit, the Word) was life, and that life was the light of men.</q> I directed the people to turn to the place in their bibles, and recited to them the words of John, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The ſame was in the beginning with God: All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</q> (So all natural, created lights were made by Chriſt the Word.) <q>In him was life, and the life was the light of men: and that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</q> And Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, John viii. 12. 'I am the light of the world:' and bids them 'believe in the light,' John xii. 36. And God ſaid of him by the prophet Iſaiah, ch. xlix. 6. <q>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</q> So Chriſt in his light is ſaving. And the apoſtle ſaid, <q>The light, which ſhined in their hearts, was to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</q> which was their treaſure in their earthen veſſels, 2 Cor. iv. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>When I had thus opened the matter to the people, the prieſt cried to the magiſtrates, <q>Take this man away, or elſe I ſhall not ſpeak any more.</q> 'But,' ſaid I, <q>prieſt Tombs, deceive not thyſelf, thou art not in thy pulpit now, nor in thy old maſs-houſe; but we are in the fields.</q> So he was ſhuffling to be gone: and Thomas Taylor ſtood up, and undertook to prove our principle by Chriſt's para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concerning the ſower, Mat. 13. Then ſaid the prieſt, 'Let that man ſpeak, and not the other.' So he got up into jangling for awhile; till the Lord's power catched him again, ſtopped and confounded him. Afterwards a friend ſtood up and told him, He had ſued him for tithe eggs, and other friends for other tithes: for he was an Anabaptiſt preacher, yet had a parſonage at Leominſter, and had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral journeymen under him. He ſaid, <q>He had a wife, and he had a concubine; his wife was the baptized people, and his concubine was the world.</q> But the Lord's power
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:037441_0393_100D90770B6F5670"/>came over all, the everlaſting truth was declared that day, and many were turned by it to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their teacher and way to God. Of great ſervice that meeting was in thoſe parts. The next day Thomas Taylor went to this prieſt, reaſoned with him, and overcame him by the power of the Word.</p>
                  <p>From this place I travelled in Wales, having ſeveral meetings, till I came to Tenby; where as I rode up the ſtreet, a juſtice of peace came out of his houſe, deſired me to alight, and ſtay at his houſe; which I did. On firſt-day the mayor with his wife, and ſeveral others of the chief of the town, came in about the tenth hour, and ſtaid all the time of the meeting. A glorious meeting it was. John-ap-John being then with me, left the meeting, and went to the ſteeple-houſe; and the governor caſt him into priſon. On ſecond-day morning the governor ſent one of his officers to the juſtice's to fetch me; which grieved the mayor and the juſtice; for they were both with me in the juſtice's houſe, when the officer came. The mayor and the juſtice went to the governor before me; and awhile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I went with the officer. When I came in I ſaid, 'Peace be unto this houſe.' And before the governor could examine me, I aſked him, <q>Why he caſt my friend into priſon?</q> He ſaid, <q>For ſtanding with his hat on in the church.</q> I ſaid, <q>Had not the prieſt two caps on his head, a black one and a white one? Cut off the brims of the hat, and then my friend would have but one; and the brims of the hat were but to defend him from weather.</q> 'Theſe are frivolous things,' ſaid the governor. <q>Why then,</q> ſaid I. <q>doſt thou caſt my friend into priſon for ſuch frivolous things?</q> He aſked me, <q>Whether I owned election and reprobation?</q> 'Yes,' ſaid I, <q>and thou art in the reprobation.</q> At that he was in a rage, and ſaid, 'He would ſend me to priſon till I proved it.' I told him, <q>I would prove that quickly, if he would confeſs truth.</q> I aſked him, <q>Whether wrath, fury, rage, and perſecution. were not marks of reprobation? for he that was born of the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born of the Spirit; but Chriſt and his diſciples never perſecuted nor impriſoned any.</q> He fairly confeſſed, That he had too much wrath, haſte, and paſſion in him. I told him, <q>Eſau was up in him, the firſt birth; not Jacob, the ſecond birth.</q> The Lord's power ſo reached the man, and came
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:037441_0394_100D9078FB08C718"/>over him, that he confeſſed to truth; and the other juſtice came, and ſhook me kindly by the hand.</p>
                  <p>As I was paſſing away, I was moved to ſpeak to the governor again; and he invited me to dinner with him; and ſet my friend at liberty. I went back to the other juſtice's houſe: and after ſome time the mayor and his wife, and the juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ice and his wife, and divers other friends of the town, went about half a mile out of town with us, to the water-ſide, when we went away; and there, when we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, I was moved of the Lord to <q>kneel down with them, and pray to the Lord to preſerve them.</q> So after I had recommended them to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Saviour and free teacher, we paſſed away in the Lord's power; and he had the glory. A meeting continues in that town to this day.</p>
                  <p>We travelled to Pembrokeſhire; and in Pembroke town had ſome ſervice for the Lord. From thence we paſſed to Haverford-weſt, where we had a great meeting. All was quiet; the Lord's power came over all, many were ſettled in the new covenant, Chriſt Jeſus, and built upon him, their rock and foundation: and they ſtand a precious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this day. The next day, being their fair-day, we paſſed through the fair, and <q>ſounded the day of the Lord, and his everlaſting truth amongſt them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this we came into another county, and at noon into a great market town; and went to ſeveral inns, before we could get any meat for our horſes. At laſt we came to one, where we got ſome. Then John-ap-John being with me, went, and ſpoke through the town, declaring the truth to the people; and when he came to me again, he ſaid he thought all the town were as people aſleep. After awhile he was moved to go and declare truth in the ſtreets again; then the town was all in an uproar, and caſt him into priſon. Preſently after, ſeveral of the chief of the town came down, with others, to the inn where I was, and ſaid, 'They have caſt your man into priſon.' 'For what?' ſaid I. 'He preached in our ſtreets,' ſaid they. I aſked them, <q>What did he ſay? Had he reproved ſome of the drunkards and ſwearers, and warned them to repent, and leave off their evil doings, and turn to the Lord?</q> I aſked them, 'Who caſt him into priſon?' They ſaid, 'The high-ſheriff, the juſtices, and the mayor.' I aſked their names, and whether they underſtood themſelves? and whether that was their carriage to travellers who paſſed
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:037441_0395_100D907A9239DCF0"/>through their town; and to ſtrangers that admoniſhed them, and exhorted them to fear the Lord, and reproved ſin in their gates? Theſe went and told the officers what I ſaid; and after awhile they brought John-ap-John guarded with halberds, in order to put him out of the town. I being at the inn-door, bid the officers take their hands off of him. They ſaid, <q>The mayor and juſtices had commanded them to put him out of town.</q> I told them, <q>I would talk with their mayor and juſtices anon concerning their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil and unchriſtian carriage towards him.</q> I ſpoke to John to go look after the horſes, and get them ready; and charged the officers not to touch him; and after I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the truth to them, and ſhewed the fruits of their prieſts, and their incivility and unchriſtian-like carriage, they went away and left us. They were a kind of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; a very wicked town, and falſe. We bid the inn-keeper give our horſes a peck of oats; and no ſooner had we turned our backs, but the oats were ſtolen from our horſes. After we had refreſhed ourſelves a little, and were ready, we took horſe, and rode up to the inn, where the mayor, ſheriff, and juſtices were. I called to ſpeak with them, and aſked them the reaſon, <q>Wherefore they had impriſoned John-ap-John, and kept him in priſon two or three hours?</q> But they would not anſwer me a word; only looked out at the windows upon me. I ſhewed them <q>how unchriſtian their carriage was to ſtrangers and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and manifeſted the fruits of their teachers; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the truth to them, and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all the evil-doers: and the Lord's power came over them, that they looked aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</q> but not a word could I get from them in anſwer. So when I had warned them to repent, and turn to the Lord, we paſſed away; and at night came to a little inn, very poor, but very cheap; for our own proviſion, and our two horſes coſt but eight pence: but the horſes would not eat their oats. We declared the truth to the people of the place, and ſounded the day of the Lord thro' the countries.</p>
                  <p>From thence we came to a great town, and went to an inn. Edward Edwards went into the market, and declared the truth amongſt the people; who followed him to the inn, ſilled the inn-yard, and were exceeding rude. Yet a good ſervice we had for the Lord amongſt them. For the life of chriſtianity and the power of it tormented their chaffy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and came over them, ſo that ſome were reached and
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:037441_0396_100D907C8178D0D8"/>convinced; the Lord's power came over all; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were bound, they had no power to meddle with us.</p>
                  <p>After this we came to another great town on a market-day; where John-ap-John declared the everlaſting truth through the ſtreets, and proclaimed the day of the Lord. In the evening many gathered about the inn; and ſome of them, being drunk, would fain have had us into the ſtreet again; but ſeeing their deſign, I told them, <q>If there were any that feared God, and deſired to hear truth, they might come into our inn; or elſe we might have a meeting with them next morning.</q> Some ſervice for the Lord we had amongſt them, both over night and in the morning: and though they were hard to receive the truth, yet the ſeed was ſown; and thereabouts the Lord hath a people gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himſelf. In that inn alſo I turned my back to the man that was giving oats to my horſe; and looking back, he was filling his pockets with the provender. A wicked, thieviſh people, to rob the poor dumb creature of his food! I had rather they had robbed me.</p>
                  <p>Leaving this town, and travelling on, a great man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us on the way. He purpoſed (as he told us afterwards) to have taken us up at the next town for highwaymen. But before we came to the town, I was moved of the Lord to ſpeak to him. What I ſpoke, reached to the witneſs of God in the man; who was ſo affected therewith, that he had us to his houſe, and entertained us very civilly. He and his wife deſired us to give them ſome ſcriptures, both for proof of our principles, and againſt the prieſts. We were glad of the ſervice, and furniſhed him with ſcriptures enough; and he wrote them down, and was convinced of the truth, both by the Spirit of God in his own heart, and by the ſcriptures, which were a confirmation to him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſet us on in our journey; and as we travelled, we came to an hill, which the people of the country ſay is two or three miles high; from the ſide of this hill I could ſee a great way. And I was moved to ſet my face ſeveral ways, and to ſound the day of the Lord there: and I told John-ap-John (a faithful Welſh miniſter) in what places God would raiſe up a people to himſelf, to ſit under his own teaching. Thoſe places he took notice of; and ſince there hath been a great people ariſen there. The like I have been moved to do in many other parts inhabited by rude people: yet I have been moved to declare the Lord had a ſeed in thoſe places: and afterwards there hath been a brave
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:037441_0397_100D907EDC0CE498"/>people raiſed up in the covenant of God, and gathered in the name of Jeſus; where they have ſalvation and free teaching.</p>
                  <p>From this hill we came to Dolegelle: and went to an inn. John-ap-John declared through the ſtreets; and the town's people roſe and gathered about him. There being two Independent prieſts in the town, they came out, and diſcourſed with him both together. I went to them: and finding them ſpeaking in Welſh, I aſked them, <q>What was the ſubject they ſpoke upon, and why they were not more moderate, and ſpoke one by one? For the things of God,</q> I told them, <q>were weighty, and they ſhould ſpeak of them with fear and reverence.</q> Then I deſired them to ſpeak in Engliſh, that I might diſcourſe with them; and they did ſo. They affirmed, <q>That the Light, which John came to bear witneſs of, was a created, natural, made light.</q>I took the bible, and ſhewed them (as I had done to others before) <q>That the natural lights, which were made and created, were the ſun, moon, and ſtars: but this light, which John bare witneſs to, and which he called the true light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, is the life in Chriſt the Word, by which all things were made and created. The ſame that is called the life in Chriſt, is called the light in man. This is an heavenly, divine light, which lets men ſee their evil words and deeds, and ſhews them all their ſins; and (if they would attend to it) would bring them to Chriſt, from whom it comes, that they might know him to ſave them from their ſin, and to blot it out. This light, I told them, ſhined in the darkneſs in their hearts, and the darkneſs in them could not comprehend it; but in thoſe hearts, where God had commanded it to ſhine out of darkneſs, it gave unto ſuch the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour. I opened the ſcriptures largely to them, and turned them to the Spirit of God in their hearts; which would reveal the myſteries in the ſcriptures to them, and would lead them into all truth, as they became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereunto. I directed them to that which would give every one of them the knowledge of Chriſt, who died for them; that he might be their way to God, and might make peace betwixt God and them.</q> The people were attentive, and I deſired John-ap-John to ſtand up, and ſpeak it in Welſh to them; which he did: and they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received it, and with hands lifted up, bleſſed and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:037441_0398_100D9080D5B5E838"/>God. The prieſts mouths were ſtopped, ſo that they were quiet all the while; for I had brought them to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at the firſt, by telling them, <q>when they ſpoke of the things of God and of Chriſt, they ſhould ſpeak with fear and reverence.</q> Thus the meeting broke up in peace in the ſtreet. Many of the people accompanied us to our inn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in the truth that had been declared to them; and that they were turned to the light and Spirit in themſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When we went out of the twon, the people were ſo affected, that they lifted up their hands, and bleſſed the Lord for our coming. A precious ſeed the Lord hath there-away; and a great people in thoſe parts is ſince gathered to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to ſit under his free teaching; and they have ſuffered much for him.</p>
                  <p>From this place we paſſed to Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rnarvon, a town like a caſtle. When we had ſet up our horſes at an inn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed ourſelves, John-ap-John went and ſpoke through the ſtreets; which were ſo ſtraight and ſhort, that one might ſtand in the midſt of the town, and ſee both the gates. I followed John-ap-John, and a multitude were ſoon gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him; amongſt whom a very dark prieſt began to babble; but his mouth was ſoon ſtopped. When John had cleared himſelf, I declared the word of life amongſt the people; <q>directing them to the light of Chriſt in their hearts, that by it they might ſee all their own ways, religions, and teachers, and might come off from them all to Chriſt, the true and living way, and the free teacher.</q> Some of the people were rude, but the greater part were civil; and told us, <q>They had heard how we had been perſecuted and abuſed in many places, but they would not do ſo to us there.</q> I commended their moderation and ſobriety, <q>and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all ſin and wickedneſs; teſtifying unto them, that Chriſt was now come to teach his people himſelf, by his Spirit and power.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we went to Beaumaris, a twon wherein John-ap-John had formerly been a preacher. After we had put up our horſes at an inn, John went and ſpoke through the ſtreet; and there being a garriſon in the town, they took him, and put him into priſon. The inn-keeper's wife came, and told me, <q>That the governor and magiſtrates were ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me, to commit me to priſon alſo.' I told her, They had done more than they could anſwer already;
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:037441_0399_100D9082671D9490"/>and had acted contrary to chriſtianity in impriſoning him for reproving ſin in their ſtreets and gates, and for declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth.</q> Soon after came other friendly people, and told me, <q>If I went into the ſtreet, they would impriſon me alſo; therefore they deſired me to keep within the inn.</q> Upon this I was moved to go and walk up and down in the ſtreets; and told the people, 'What an uncivil, unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an 'thing they had done, in caſting my friend into priſon. And they being high profeſſors, I aſked them, <q>If this was the entertainment they had for ſtrangers? And if they would willingly be ſo ſerved themſelves? And whether they, who looked upon the ſcriptures to be their rule, had any example in the ſcriptures, from Chriſt or his apoſtles, for what they had done?"</q> So after awhile they ſet John-ap-John at liberty.</p>
                  <p>Next day, being market-day, we were to croſs a great water; and not far from the place where we were to take boat, many of the market-people drew to us; amongſt whom we had good ſervice for the Lord, <q>declaring the word of life and everlaſting truth unto them, and proclaiming the day of the Lord amongſt them, which was coming upon all wickedneſs; and directing them to the light of Chriſt, which he, the heavenly man, had enlightened them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; by which they might ſee all their ſins, and all their falſe ways, religions, worſhips and teachers: and by the ſame light might ſee Chriſt Jeſus, who was come to ſave them, and lead them to God.</q> After the truth had been declared to them in the power of God, and Chriſt the free teacher ſet over all the hireling teachers; I bid John-ap-John get his horſe into the boat, which was then ready. But there being a company of wild gentlemen, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, got into it, whom we found very rude, and far from gentleneſs; they, with others, kept his horſe out of the boat. I rode to the boat's ſide, and ſpoke to them, ſhewing them, <q>What an unmanly and unchriſtian carriage it was; and told them, they ſhewed an unworthy ſpirit, below chriſtianity or humanity.</q> As I ſpoke, I leaped my horſe into the boat amongſt them; thinking John's horſe would have followed, when he had ſeen mine go in before him: but the water being pretty deep, John could not get his horſe into the boat. Wherefore I leaped out again on horſeback into the water, and ſtaid with John on that ſide, till the boat returned. There we tarried from the eleventh hour of the forenoon to the ſecond in the afternoon,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:037441_0400_100D90845D4CCF08"/>before the boat came to fetch us; and then had forty-two miles to ride that evening; and by that time we had paid for our paſſage, we had but one groat left between us in money. We rode about ſixteen miles, and then got a little hay for our horſes. Setting forward again, we came in the night to a little ale-houſe, where we thought to have ſtaid and baited. But finding we could have neither oats nor hay there, we travelled all night; and about the fifth hour in the morning got to a place within ſix miles of Wrexham; where that day we met with many friends, and had a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meeting; the Lord's everlaſting power and truth was over all: and a meeting is continued there to this day. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weary we were with travelling ſo hard up and down in Wales; and in many places we found it difficult to get meat either for our horſes or ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>The next day we paſſed from thence into Flintſhire, ſounding the day of the Lord through the towns: and came into Wrexham at night. Here many of Floyd's people came to us; but very rude, wild, and airy they were, and little ſenſe of truth they had: yet ſome were convinced in that town. Next morning one called a lady ſent for me, who kept a preacher in her houſe. I went to her houſe, but found both her and her preacher very light and airy; too light to receive the weighty things of God. In her lightneſs ſhe came and aſked me, 'If ſhe ſhould cut my hair? I was moved to reprove her, and bid her cut down the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in herſelf with the ſword of the Spirit of God; ſo after I had admoniſhed her to be more grave and ſober, we paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away. Afterwards in her frothy mind ſhe made her boaſt, that ſhe, 'came behind me, and cut off the curl of my hair;' but ſhe ſpoke falſely.</p>
                  <p>From Wrexham we came to Weſt-cheſter; and it being the fair-time, we ſtaid there awhile, and viſited friends. For I had travelled through every county in Wales, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the everlaſting goſpel of Chriſt: and a brave people there is now, who have received it, and ſit under Chriſt's teaching. But before I left Wales, I wrote to the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates of Beaumaris concerning their impriſoning John-ap-John; letting them ſee their condition, the fruits of their chriſtianity, and of their teachers. Afterwards I met with ſome of them near London; but oh! how aſhamed they were of their action!</p>
                  <p>From Weſt-cheſter we came to Liverpool, where was at that time a fair; and as I rode through the fair, there ſtood
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:037441_0401_100D9086B71E5618"/>a friend upon the croſs, declaring the truth to the people; who ſeeing me ride by, and knowing I had appointed a meeting to be the next day upon an hill not far off, gave notice to the people, <q>That George Fox, the ſervant of the Lord, would have a meeting next day upon ſuch an hill; and if any feared the Lord, they might come and hear him declare the word of life to them.</q> We went that night to Richard Cubban's, who himſelf was convinced, though not his wife; but at that time ſhe was convinced alſo.</p>
                  <p>Next day we went to the meeting on the top of the hill, which was very large. Some rude people with a prieſt's wife came, and made a noiſe for awhile; but the Lord's power came over them, the meeting became quiet, and the truth of God was declared amongſt them. Many were that day ſettled upon the rock and foundation Chriſt Jeſus, and under his teaching; who made peace betwixt God and them.</p>
                  <p>We had a ſmall meeting with a few friends and people at Malpoth. From thence we came to another place, where we had a meeting. There came a bailiff with a ſword, and was rude; but the Lord's power came over him, and friends were eſtabliſhed in the truth.</p>
                  <p>From thence we came to Mancheſter: and the ſeſſions being there that day, many rude people were come out of the country. In the meeting they threw at me coals, clods, ſtones, and water: yet the Lord's power bore me up over them, that they could not ſtrike me down. At laſt, when they ſaw they could not prevail by throwing water, ſtones, and dirt at me, they went and informed the juſtices in the ſeſſions; who thereupon ſent officers to fetch me before of life to the people, plucked me down, and haled me into their court. When I came there all the court was in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and a noiſe. Wherefore I aſked, <q>Where were the magiſtrates, that they did not keep the people civil?</q> Some of the juſtices ſaid, They were magiſtrates. I aſked them, <q>Why then they did not appeaſe the people, and keep them ſober?</q> For one cried, I'll ſwear, and another cried, I'll ſwear. I declared to the juſtices, <q>How we were abuſed in our meeting by the rude people, who threw ſtones, clods, dirt, and water: and how I was haled out of the meeting and brought thither, contrary to the inſtrument of government,</q> which ſaid, <q>None ſhould be moleſted in
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:037441_0402_100D908949A72160"/>their meetings that profeſſed God, and owned the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</q> which I did.' The truth ſo came over them, that when one of the rude followers cried, <q>He would ſwear;</q> one of the juſtices checked him, ſaying, 'What, will you ſwear? hold your tongue.' At laſt they bid the conſtable, <q>Have me to my lodging, and there I ſhould be ſecured till to-morrow morning that they ſent for me again.</q> So the conſtable had me to my lodging. As we went the people were exceeding rude; but I let them ſee the <q>fruits of their teachers, how they ſhamed chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and diſhonoured the name of Jeſus which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</q> At night we went to a juſtice's in the town, who was pretty moderate, and I had a great deal of diſcourſe with him. Next morning we ſent to the conſtable to know if he had any thing more to ſay to us? He ſent us word, <q>He had nothing to ſay to us, we might go whither we would.</q> The Lord hath ſince raiſed up a people to ſtand for his name and truth in that town over thoſe chaffy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed from Mancheſter, having many precious meetings in ſerveral places, till we came to Preſton; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which and Lancaſter I had a general meeting: from which I went to Lancaſter. There at our inn I met with colonel Weſt, who was very glad to ſee me; who meeting with judge Fell, told him, <q>I was mightily grown in the tuth;</q> when indeed he was come nearer to the truth, and ſo could better diſcern it.</p>
                  <p>We came from Lancaſter to Robert Widders's. On the firſt-day after I had a general meeting near the Sands-ſide, of friends of Weſtmoreland and Lancaſhire, when the Lord's everlaſting power was over all; in which the word of eternal life was declared, and friends were ſettled upon the foundation, Chriſt Jeſus, under his free teaching; and many were convinced, and turned to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Next day I came over the Sands to Swarthmore, where friends were glad to ſee me. I ſtaid there two firſt-days, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting friends in their meetings there-away. They rejoiced with me in the goodneſs of the Lord, who by his eternal power had carried me through and over, many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and dangers in his ſervice; to him be the praiſe for ever!</p>
                  <p>Having got a little reſpite from travel, I was moved to write an epiſtle to friends, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <pb n="326" facs="unknown:037441_0403_100D908ADB8A2008"/>
                        <p>ALL friends of the Lord every where, whoſe minds are turned in towards the Lord, take heed to the light within you, which is the light of Chriſt; which, as you love it, will call your minds inward, that are abroad in the creatures: ſo your minds may be renewed by it, and turned to God in this which is pure, to worſhip the living God, the Lord of hoſts over all the creatures. That which calls your minds out of the luſts of the world, will call them out of the affections and deſires, and turn you to ſet your affections above. The ſame that calls the mind out of the world, will give judgment upon the world's affections and luſts, that which calls out your minds from the world's teachers and the creatures, to have your minds renewed. There is your obedience known and found; there the image of God is renewed in you, and ye come to grow up in it. That which calls your minds out of the earth, turns them towards God, where the pure Babe is born of the virgin; and the Babe's food is known, the children's bread, which comes from the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and nouriſhes up to eternal life: which babes and children receive their wiſdom from above, from the pure living God, and not from the earthly one; for that is trodden under foot by ſuch. All who hate this light, whoſe minds are abroad in the creatures, in the earth, and in the image of the devil, get the words of the ſaints (that received their wiſdom from above) into the old nature and their corrupted minds. Such are murderers of the juſt, enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, in whom the prince of the air lodgeth, ſons of perdition, betrayers of the juſt. Therefore take heed to that light, which is oppreſſed with that nature; which light, as it ariſes, ſhall condemn all that curſed nature, ſhall turn it out, and ſhut it out of the houſe. So ye will come to ſee the candle lighted, and the houſe ſweeping and ſwept. Then the pure pearl ariſeth, then the eternal God is exalted. The ſame light that calls in your minds out of the world (that are abroad) the ſame turns them to God the father of lights. Here in the pure mind is the pure God waited upon for wiſdom from above; the pure God is ſeen night and day, and the eternal peace, of which there is no end, enjoyed. People may have openings, and yet their minds go into the luſts of the fleſh; but there the affections are not mortified. Therefore hearken to that, take heed to that, which calls your minds out of the affections and luſts of the world
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:037441_0404_100D908C6F2C1C60"/>to have them renewed. The ſame will turn your minds to God; the ſame light will ſet your affections above, and bring you to wait for the pure wiſdom of God from on high, that it may be juſtified in you. Wait all in that which calls in your minds and turns them to God; here is the true croſs. That mind ſhall feed upon nothing that is earthly, but be kept in the pure light up to God, to feed upon the living food which comes from the living God. The Lord God Almighty be with you all, dear babes, and keep you all in his ſtrength and power to his glory, over all the world, ye whoſe minds are called out of it, and turned to God, to worſhip the Creator and ſerve him, and not the creature. The light of God which calls the mind out of the creatures, and turns it to himſelf, brings into a being of endleſs joy and peace. Here is always a ſeeing God preſent, which is not known to the world, whoſe hearts are in the creatures whoſe knowledge is in the fleſh, whoſe minds are not renewed. Therefore all friends, the ſeed of God mind and dwell in, to reign over the unjuſt; and the power of the Lord dwell in, to keep you clear in your underſtandings, that the ſeed of God may reign in you all; the Seed of God, which is but one in all, is Chriſt in the male and in the female, which the promiſe is to. Wait upon the Lord for the juſt to reign over the unjuſt for the ſeed of God to reign over the ſeed of the ſerpent, and be the head; and that all that is mortal may die: for out of that will riſe preſumption. So fare ye well, and God Almighty bleſs, guide, and keep you in his wiſdom.</p>

                  <p>About this time friends that were moved of the Lord to go to the ſteeple-houſes and markets, to 'reprove ſin, and 'warn people of the day of the Lord,' ſuffered much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from rude people, and alſo from the magiſtrates; being commonly pulled down, buffeted, beaten, and frequently ſent to priſon.

Doth it not ſhew that ye are out of the truth, and are not ready to inſtruct the gainſayers?

Doth not this ſhew, that ye who are bred up there, who are made teachers by the will of man, and who perſecute for propheſying, are ſtrangers to the Spirit that is <q>poured forth upon ſons and daughters;</q> by which Spirit they come to "miniſter to the ſpirits that are in priſon?"

What pleaſures and ſports in every town are to be ſeen among your flocks, that ſow to the fleſh and are born of it! Whereas the miniſters of the Spirit cried againſt ſuch as "ſported in the day-time," ſuch as "ate and drank, and roſe up to play," ſuch as "lived wantonly upon earth in pleaſures," ſuch as lived in "fulneſs of bread and idleneſs," ſuch as <q>defile the fleſh;</q> ſuch did God overthrow, deſtroy, and ſet forth as examples to all them that after ſhould live ungodly. But are not the fruits of this reaped in every town? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ye from hence ſee, that here is ſowing to the fleſh? Again, what ſcorning, ſcoffing, mocking, deriſion, and ſtrife. What oaths, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, and curſed ſpeaking! What luſt and pride is ſeen in the ſtreets! Theſe fruits we ſee are reaped of the fleſh. So here we ſee the ſeedſman, him that ſows to this fleſh, of which nothing but corruption is reaped, as the countries, towns, cities, and villages make manifeſt. But the miniſters of the Spirit, who ſow to the Spirit, come to reap life eternal. Theſe diſcern the other ſeedſman, who ſows to the fleſh, and of the fleſh reaps corruption. For the day hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted each ſeedſman, and what is reaped from each is ſeen; glory be to the Lord God for ever! The miniſters of the Spirit, born of the Spirit, ſons and daughters which have the Spirit poured upon them, and witneſs the promiſe of God fulfilled in them, by the Spirit of God preach and miniſter to the ſpirit in priſon in every one, in the ſight of God, the Father of ſpirits.

Doth it not appear that the wiſdom which rules in all thoſe, whom the ſeedſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſows to the fleſh ſows for, and who are born of the fleſh, are from below, earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh, their underſtanding brutiſh, and their knowledge natural as the brute beaſts? For men and women in that ſtate have not patience to ſpeak one to the other of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without much corruption and fleſh appearing, yet they have a feigned humility, a will-worſhip, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of ſelf; but they own not the light, which <q>lighteth every man that cometh into the world, Chriſt Jeſus, the righteouſneſs of God:</q> which light being own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſelf, and the righteouſneſs of ſelf, comes to be denied. Here is the humility that is contrary to the light, and that is below and feigned. Here is the wiſdom that is from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh: for people can ſcarce dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from one another without deſtroying one another, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and perſecuting one another, when they ſpeak of the ſcriptures.

<pb n="331" facs="unknown:037441_0408_100D90952F81CDE0"/>Now, happy are they that can ſay, <q>The earth is the Lord's and the fulneſs thereof, and he gives the increaſe;</q> therefore who takes it from you? Is it not the Lord ſtill that ſuffers it? For the Lord can try you as he did Job, whom he made rich, whom he made poor, and whom he made rich again; who ſtill kept his integrity in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Learn Paul's leſſon, In all ſtates to be content; and have his faith, <q>That nothing is able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which we have in Chriſt Jeſus.</q> Therefore be rich in life, and in grace, which will endure, ye who are heirs of life, and born of the womb of eternity, that noble birth that cannot ſtoop to that which is born in ſin, and conceived in iniquity; who are better bred and born, whoſe religion is from God, above all the religions that are from below; and who walk by faith, by that which God hath given you, and not by that which men make, who walk by ſight, from the Maſs-book to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory. Such are ſubject to ſtumble and fall, who walk by ſight and not by faith. Therefore mind him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the original of ſin, the devil and his works, and cuts off the entail of Satan, viz. ſin; who would have by entail an inheritance of ſin in men and women from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation, and pleads for it by all his lawyers and counſellors. For though the law, which made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect, did not cut it off; yet Chriſt being come deſtroys the devil and his works, and cuts off the entail of ſin. This angers all the devil's lawyers and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, that Satan ſhall not hold ſin by entail in thy garden, in thy field, in thy temple, thy tabernacle. So keep your tabernacles, that there ye may ſee the glory of the Lord appear at the doors thereof. Be faithful; for ye ſee what the worthies and valiants of the Lord did attain unto by faith. Enoch by faith was tranſlated. Noah by faith was preſerved over the waters in his ark. Abraham by faith forſook his father's houſe and religion, and all the religions of the world. Iſaac and Jacob by faith followed his ſteps. See how Samuel and other of the Lord's prophets, with David, by faith were preſerved to God over his enemies! Daniel and the three children by faith eſcaped the lions and the fire, and preſerved their worſhip clean, and by it were kept over the worſhips of the world. The apoſtles by faith travelled up and down the world, were preſerved from all the religions of the world, and beld forth the pure religion to the dark world, which they had received
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:037441_0409_100D9097D6ED2018"/>from God; and likewiſe their fellowſhip was received from above, which is in the goſpel that is everlaſting. In this, neither powers, principalities nor thrones, dominions nor angels, things preſent nor things to come, heights nor depths, nor death, mockings, nor ſpoiling of goods, priſons nor fetters were able to ſeparate them from the love of God, which they had in Chriſt Jeſus. And friends, "Quench not the Spirit, nor deſpiſe propheſying," where it moves; neither hinder babes and ſucklings from cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hoſannah; for out of their mouths will God ordain ſtrength. There were ſome in Chriſt's day that were againſt ſuch, whom he reproved; and there were ſome in Moſe's day, who would have ſtopped the prophets in the camp; whom Moſes reproved, and ſaid by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to them, <q>Would God, that all the Lord's people were prophets!</q> So I ſay now to you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye that ſtop it in yourſelves do not quench it in others, neither in babe nor ſuckling; for the Lord hears the cries of the needy, and the ſighs and groans of the poor. Judge not that, nor the ſighs and groans of the Spirit, which cannot be uttered, leſt ye judge prayer; for prayer as well lies in ſighs and groans to the Lord as otherwiſe. Let not the ſons and daughters, nor the handmaids be ſtopped in their propheſyings, nor the young men in their viſions, nor the old men in their dreams; but let the Lord be glorified in and through all, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever! So every one may improve their talents, every one exerciſe their gifts, and every one ſpeak as the Spirit gives them utterance. Thus every one may miniſter, as he hath received the grace, as a good ſteward to him that hath given it him; ſo all plants may bud, and "bring forth fruit" to the glory of God: <q>for the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal.</q> See that every one hath profited in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; male and female, look into your own vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, ſee what fruit ye bear to God; look into your own houſes, ſee how they are decked and trimmed; ſee what odors, myrrh, and frankincenſe ye have therein, and what a ſmell and ſavour ye have to aſcend to God that he may be glorified. Bring your deeds all to the light, which ye are taught to believe in by Chriſt, your head, the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man: and ſee how they are wrought in God. Every male and female, let Chriſt dwell in your hearts by faith (Chriſt in the male and in the female;) and let your
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:037441_0410_100D9099DE665170"/>mouths be opened to the glory of God the Father, that he may rule and reign in you. We muſt not have Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord of Life, put any more in a ſtable amongſt the horſes and aſſes; he muſt now have the beſt chamber, the heart; and the rude, debauched ſpirit muſt be turned out. Therefore let him reign whoſe right it is, who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; by which Holy Ghoſt ye call him Lord in which Holy Ghoſt ye pray, and have comfort and fellowſhip with the Father and with the Son. Therefore know the triumph in it, and in God and his power (which the devil is out of) and in the ſeed which is Firſt and Laſt, the Beginning and Ending, the Top and Corner-ſtone: in which is my love to you, and in which I reſt—</p>

                  <p>After I had tarried two firſt-days at Swarthmore, and viſited meetings thereabouts, I paſſed into Weſtmoreland in the ſame work, till I came to John Audland's, where was a general meeting. The night before I had a viſion of a <q>deſperate creature that was coming to deſtroy me, but I got victory over it.</q> The next day in the meeting-time came one Otway, with ſome rude fellows. He rode round about the meeting with his ſword or rapier, and would fain have got in through the friends to me; but the meeting being great, the friends ſtood thick, ſo that he could not eaſily come at me. When he had rid about ſeveral times raging, and found he could not get in, being alſo limited by the Lord's power, he at length went away. It was a glorious meeting, ended peaceably, and the Lord's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting power came over all. This wild man went home, became diſtracted, and not long after died. I ſent a paper to John Blaykling to read to him while he lay ill, ſhewing him his wickedneſs; and he did acknowledge ſomething of it.</p>
                  <p>From hence I went through Kendal, where a warrant had long lain to apprehend me; and the conſtables ſeeing
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:037441_0411_100D909B6DC32DF0"/>me ran to fetch their warrant as I was riding through the town; but before they could come up with it I was paſt, and ſo eſcaped their hands.</p>
                  <p>I travelled northwards, viſiting meetings, till I came to Strickland-head, where I had a great meeting. Moſt of the gentry of that country being gathered to an horſe-race, not far from the meeting, I was moved to go and declare the truth to them; and a chief-conſtable did alſo admoniſh them. Our meeting was quiet, the Lord was with us; and by his word and power friends were ſettled in the eternal truth.</p>
                  <p>From hence we paſſed into Cumberland, where we had many precious, living meetings. After we had travelled to Gilſland, and had a meeting there, we came to Carliſle, where they uſed to put friends out of the town; but there came a great flood while we were there, that they could n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> put us out of the town; ſo we had a meeting there on the firſt-day. After which we paſſed to Abbey-holm, and had a little meeting there. This is a place where I told friends long before there would be a great people come forth to the Lord; which hath ſince come to paſs, and a large meeting there is gathered to the Lord in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed from hence to a general meeting at Langlands in Cumberland, which was very large; for moſt of the people had ſo forſaken the prieſts, that the ſteeple-houſes in ſome places ſtood empty. And John Wilkinſon, a preacher, that I have often named before, who had three ſteeple-houſes, had ſo few hearers left, that, giving over preaching in the ſteeple-houſes, he firſt ſet up a meeting in his houſe, and preached there to them that were left. Afterwards he ſet up a ſilent meeting (like friends) to which came a few: for moſt of his hearers were come to friends. Thus he held on, till he had not paſt half a dozen left; the reſt ſtill forſaking him, and coming away to friends. At laſt, when he had ſo very few left, he would come to Pardſey-Crag (where friends had a meeting of ſeveral hundreds of people, who were all come to ſit under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's teaching) and he would walk about the meeting on the firſt-days, like a man that went about the commons to look for ſheep. During this time, I came to Pardſey-Crag meeting, and he with three or four of his followers, yet left him, came to the meeting that day; and were all thoroughly convinced. After the meeting. Wilkinſon aſked me two or three queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I anſwered to his ſatisfaction; from that time he came amongſt friends, became an able miniſter, preached the
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:037441_0412_100D909D058010D8"/>goſpel freely, and turned many to Chriſt's free teaching. And after he had continued many years in the free miniſtry of Chriſt Jeſus, he died in the year 1675.</p>
                  <p>I had for ſome time felt drawings on my ſpirit to go into Scotland: and had ſent to colonel William Oſborn of Scotland, deſiring him to meet me; and he, with ſome others, were come out of Scotland to this meeting. After it was over (which, he ſaid, was the moſt glorious meeting that ever he ſaw in his life) I paſſed with him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into Scotland; having Robert Widders with me; a thundering man againſt hypocriſy, deceit, and the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the prieſts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt night we came into Scotland, we lodged at an inn. The inn-keeper told us, an earl lived about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile off, who had a deſire to ſee me; and had left word at his houſe, that if ever I came into Scotland, he ſhould ſend him word. He told us, there were three draw-bridges to his houſe; and that it would be nine o'clock before the third bridge was drawn. Finding we had time in the evening, we walked to his houſe. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us very lovingly; and ſaid, He would have gone with us on our journey, but that he was before engaged to go to a funeral. After we had ſpent ſome time with him we parted very friendly, and returned to our inn. Next morning we travelled on, and paſſing through Dumfries, came to Douglas, where we met with ſome friends; from thence we paſſed to the Heads, where we had a bleſſed meeting in the name of Jeſus, and felt him in the midſt.</p>
                  <p>Leaving Heads, we went to Badcow, and had a meeting there: to which abundance of people came, and many were convinced: amongſt whom was one called a lady. From thence we paſſed towards the Highlands to William Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born's, where we gathered up the ſufferings of friends, and the principles of the Scotch prieſts, which may be ſeen in a book called, "The Scotch Prieſts Principles."</p>
                  <p>Afterwards we returned to Heads, Badcow, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, where the ſaid lady Margaret Hambleton was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; who afterwards went to warn O. Cromwel and Charles Fleetwood of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day we had a great meeting, and ſeveral profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors came to it. Now the prieſts had frighted the people with the doctrine of election and reprobation: telling them, <q>That God had ordained the greateſt part of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:037441_0413_100D909F95195E00"/>for hell; that, let them pray, or preach, or ſing, and do what they could, it was all to no purpoſe, if they were ordained for hell; that God had a certain number, which were elected for heaven; and let them do what they would, as David an adulterer, and Paul a perſecutor, yet elected veſſels for heaven. So the fault was not at all in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, leſs or more; but God had ordained it ſo.' I was led to open to the people the falſeneſs and folly of their prieſts doctrines, and ſhewed them, the prieſts had abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe ſcriptures which they had brought and quoted to them, as in Jude, and other places. For whereas they ſaid, "There was no fault at all in the creature;" I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that they, whom Jude ſpeaks of, to wit, Cain, Core, and Balaam, who, he ſays, were ordained of old to condemnation, the fault was in them. For did not God warn Cain and Balaam, and put the queſtion to Cain, "If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?" And did not the Lord bring Core out of Egypt, and his company? yet did not he gainſay both God and his law, and his prophet Moſes? Here people might ſee that there was a fault in Cain, Corah, and Balaam; and ſo there is in all that go in their ways. For if they, who are called chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, reſiſt the goſpel as Core did the law, err from the Spirit of God as Balaam did, and do evil as Cain did, is not here a fault? which fault is in themſelves, and is the cauſe of their reprobation, and not God. Doth not Chriſt ſay, "Go, preach the goſpel to all nations?" Which is the goſpel of ſalvation. He would not have ſent them into all nations, to preach the doctrine of ſalvation, if the greateſt part of men had been ordained for hell. Was not Chriſt a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, for thoſe that became reprobates, as well as for the ſaints? He died for all men, the ungodly as well as the godly, as the apoſtle bears witneſs, 2 Cor. v. 15. Rom. v. vi. And "he enlightens every man that cometh into the world," that through him they might all believe. And Chriſt bids them believe in the light: but all they that hate the light, which Chriſt bids all believe in, are reprobated. Again, <q>The manifeſtation of the Spirit of God is given to every man to profit withal;</q> but they that vex, quench, and <q>grieve it, are in the reprobation; and the fault is in them, as it is alſo in them that hate his light: The apoſtle ſaith, The grace of God, which brings ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:037441_0414_100D90A221361EF8"/>worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world,</q> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Now all thoſe that live ungodly, and in the luſts of the world, that turn from this grace of God into wantonneſs, and walk deſpitefully againſt it, and ſo deny God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that bought them, the fault is in all ſuch that turn from the grace of God into wantonneſs, and walk deſpitefully againſt that which would bring their ſalvation, and ſave them out of the reprobation. But the prieſts, it ſeems, can ſee no fault in ſuch as deny God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that bought them, ſuch as deny his light, which they ſhould believe in, and his grace, which ſhould teach them to live godly, and which ſhould bring them their ſalvation. Now all that believe in the light of Chriſt, as he commands, are in the election; and ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the teaching of the grace of God, which brings their ſalvation. But ſuch as turn from this grace into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are in the reprobation: and ſuch as hate the light are in the condemnation. Therefore I exhorted all to believe in the light, as Chriſt commands, and own the grace of God their free teacher; and it would aſſuredly bring them their ſalvation: for it is ſufficient.</q> Many other ſcriptures were opened concerning reprobation, and the eyes of the people were opened; and a ſpring of life roſe up among them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things ſoon came to the prieſts ear; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſat under their dark teachings, began to ſee light, and to come into the convenant of light. The noiſe was ſpread over Scotland, among the prieſts, that I was come thither; and a great cry was amongſt them, that all would be ſpoiled; for they ſaid, <q>I had ſpoiled all the honeſt men and women in England already</q> (ſo according to their own account, the worſt were left to them.) Upon this they gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great aſſemblies of prieſts together, and drew up a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of curſes to be read in their ſeveral ſteeple-houſes, that all the people ſhould ſay Amen to. Some few I will here ſet down; the reft may be read in the book before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of "The Scotch Prieſts Principles."</p>
                  <p>The firſt was, <q>Curſed is he that ſaith, Every man hath a light within him ſufficient to lead him to ſalvation: and let all the people ſay, Amen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond, <q>Curſed is he that ſaith, Faith is without ſin: and let all the people ſay, Amen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="unknown:037441_0415_100D90A3B3200EF8"/>
The third, <q>Curſed is he that denieth the ſabbath-day: and let all the people ſay, Amen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this laſt they make the people curſe themſelves; for on the ſabbath-day (which is the ſeventh day of the week, which the Jews kept by the command of God to them) they kept markets and fairs, and ſo brought the curſe upon their own heads.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, concerning the light, Chriſt ſaith, <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the light, that ye may become children of the light:</q> and, <q>he that believeth ſhall be ſaved: he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall have everlaſting life: he that believeth paſſes from death to life, and is grafted into Chriſt.</q> 
                     <q>And ye do well,</q> ſaith the apoſtle, <q>that ye take heed unto the light that ſhines in the dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</q> So the light is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to lead unto the day-ſtar.</p>
                  <p>As concerning faith, it is the gift of God: and every gift of God is pure. The faith, which Chriſt is the author of, is precious, divine, and without ſin. This is the faith which gives victory over ſin, and acceſs to God; in which faith they pleaſe God. But thoſe are reprobates themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this faith, and are in their dead faith, who charge ſin upon this faith under pain of a curſe: which faith gives victory over their curſe, and returns it into their own bowels.</p>
                  <p>There were a company of Scots near Badcow, who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged a diſpute with ſome of our Scotch friends (for with me they would not diſpute:) ſo ſome of the Scotch friends met them at the market-place. The diſpute was to be concerning the ſabbath-day, and ſome other of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before-mentioned; and I having got their principles and aſſertions, ſhewed the friends where they might eaſily be overthrown; and a Scotch friend, a ſmith, overthrew them clearly.</p>
                  <p>There were two Independent churches in Scotland, in one of which many were convinced; but the paſtor of the other was in a great rage againſt truth and friends. They had their elders, who ſometimes would exerciſe their gifts amongſt the church members, and were ſometimes pretty tender: but their paſtor ſpeaking ſo much againſt the light, and us, the friends of Chriſt, he darkened his hearers; ſo that they grew blind and dry, and loſt their tenderneſs. He continued preaching againſt friends, and againſt the light of Chriſt Jeſus, calling it natural; at laſt one day in his
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:037441_0416_100D90A56AD6BC60"/>preaching he curſed the light, and fell down as dead in his pulpit. The people carried him out, laid him upon a grave-ſtone, and poured ſtrong waters into him, which fetched him to life again; and they carried him home, but he was mopiſh. After awhile he ſtripped off his cloaths, put on a Scotch plaid, and went into the country amongſt the dairy-women. When he had ſtaid there about two weeks he came home, and went into the pulpit again. Whereupon the people expected ſome great manifeſtation or revelation from him; but, inſtead thereof, he began to tell them what entertainment he had met with; how one woman gave him ſkimmed milk, another buttermilk, and another good milk: ſo the people were obliged to take him out of the pulpit again, and carry him home. He that gave me this account, was Andrew Robinſon, one of his chief hearers, who came afterwards to be convinced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the truth. He ſaid, he never heard that he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his ſenſes again. By this people may ſee what came upon him that curſed the light, which light is the life in Chriſt, the word; and it may be a warning to all others that ſpeak evil againſt the light of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now were the prieſts in ſuch a rage, that they poſted to Edinburgh, to O. Cromwel's council there, with petitions againſt me. The noiſe was, 'That all was gone;' for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends were come out of England, and ſpread over Scotland, ſounding the day of the Lord, preaching the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goſpel of ſalvation, and turning people to Chriſt Jeſus, who died for them, that they might receive his free teaching. After I had gathered the principles of the Scotch prieſts, and the ſufferings of friends, and had ſeen friends in that part of Scotland ſettled, by the Lord's power, upon Chriſt their foundation, I went to Edinburgh, and in the way came to Linlithgow; where lodging at an inn, the inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper's wife, who was blind, received the word of life, and came under the teaching of Chriſt Jeſus her Saviour. At night came in abundance of ſoldiers, and ſome officers, with whom we had much diſcourſe; ſome were rude. One of the officers ſaid, <q>He would obey the Turk's or Pilate's command, if they ſhould command him to guard Chriſt to crucify him.</q> So far he was from all tenderneſs, or ſenſe of the Spirit of Chriſt, that he would rather crucify the Juſt, than ſuffer for or with the Juſt; whereas many officers and magiſtrates have loſt their places, before they would turn againſt the Lord and his Juſt One.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="unknown:037441_0417_100D90A80A4011B8"/>
When I had ſtaid awhile at Edinburgh, I went to Leith, where many officers of the army came in with their wives; and many were convinced. Edward Billing's wife was one. She brought a great deal of coral in her hand, and threw it on the table before me, to ſee whether I would ſpeak againſt it, or no, I took no notice of it, but declared the truth to her, and ſhe was reached. Many Baptiſts were very rude; but the Lord's power came over them, ſo that they went away confounded. Then there came in another ſort; one of whom ſaid, <q>He would diſpute with me; and, for argument's ſake, would deny there was a God.</q> I told him, <q>He might be one of thoſe fools that ſaid in his heart, There is no God; but he ſhould know him in the day of his judgment.</q> So he went his way, and a fine precious time we had afterwards with ſeveral people of account; and the Lord's power came over all. William Oſborn was with me. Colonel Lidcot's wife, William Welſh's wife, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the officers themſelves were convinced. Edward Billing and his wife at that time lived apart; and ſhe being reached by truth, and become loving to friends, we ſent for her huſband, who came, and the Lord's power reached to them both; they joined together in it, and agreed to live together in love and unity, as man and wife.</p>
                  <p>After this we returned to Edinburgh, where many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were gathered together, with abundance of prieſts among them, about burning a witch; and I was moved to declare the day of the Lord amongſt them; which when I had done, I went from thence to our meeting, whither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rude people and Baptiſts came. The Baptiſts began to vaunt with their logick and ſyllogiſms; but. <q>I was moved in the Lord's power, to threſh their chaffy light minds; and ſhewed the people, that, after that fallacious way of diſcourſing, they might make white ſeem black, and black ſeem white: as, that becauſe a cock had two legs, and each of them had two legs; therefore they were all cocks. Thus they might turn any thing into lightneſs and vanity; but it was not the way of Chriſt, or his apoſtles, to teach, ſpeak, or reaſon after that manner.</q> Hereupon thoſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts went their way; and after they were gone, we had a bleſſed meeting in the Lord's power, which was over all.</p>
                  <p>I mentioned before, that many of the Scotch prieſts being greatly diſturbed at the ſpreading of truth, and the loſs of their hearers thereby, were gone to Edinburgh to petition the council againſt me. When I came from the meeting to
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:037441_0418_100D90A9F1936800"/>the inn where I lodged, an officer belonging to the council brought me the following order:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Thurſday, the 8th of October, 1657, at his Highneſs's Council in Scotland:</p>
                     <p>Ordered,</p>
                     <p>THAT George Fox do appear before the Council on Tueſday the 13th of October next, in the Forenoon.</p>
                     <p>E. Downing, Clerk of the Council.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>When he had delivered me the order, he aſked me, 'Whether I would appear or no?' I did not tell him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would or no; but aſked him, <q>If he had not forged the order?</q> He ſaid, <q>No; it was a real order from the council, and he was ſent as their meſſenger with it.</q> When the time came I appeared, and was had into a great room, where many perſons came and looked at me. After awhile the door-keeper had me into the council-chamber: and as I was going, he took off my hat. I aſked him, <q>Why he did ſo? and who was there, that I might not go in with my hat on? I told him, I had been before the Protector with my hat on.</q> But he hung up my hat and had me in before them. When I had ſtood awhile, and they ſaid nothing to me, I was moved of the Lord to ſay, <q>Peace be amongſt you. Wait in the fear of God, that ye may receive his wiſdom from above, by which all things were made and created; that by it ye may all be ordered, and may order all things under your hands to God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</q> They aſked me, <q>What was the occaſion of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that nation?</q> I told them I came to viſit the <q>ſeed of God, which had long lain in bondage under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; that all in the nation, who profeſſed the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the words of Chriſt, of the prophets and apoſtles, might come to the light, Spirit, and power, which they were in who gave them forth; that in and by the Spirit they might underſtand the ſcriptures, and know Chriſt and God aright, have fellowſhip with them, and one with another.</q> They aſked me, <q>Whether I had any outward buſineſs there?</q> I ſaid, 'Nay.' Then they aſked me. 'How long I intended to ſtay in that country?' I told them, <q>I ſhould ſay little to that; my time was not to be long; yet in my freedom in the Lord I ſtood, in the will of him that ſent me.</q> Then they bid me withdraw; and 'the door-keeper took me by the hand, and led me forth.
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:037441_0419_100D90AB8725A6A0"/>In a little time they ſent for me again, and told me, <q>I muſt depart the nation of Scotland by that day ſevennight.</q> I aſked them. <q>Why? What had I done? What was my tranſgreſſion, that they paſſed ſuch a ſentence upon me to depart out of the nation?</q> They told me, <q>They would not diſpute with me.</q> 
                     <q>I deſired them to hear what I had to ſay to them.</q> They ſaid, <q>They would not hear me.</q> I told them, <q>Pharaoh heard Moſes and Aaron, yet he was an heathen; and Herod heard John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; and they ſhould not be worſe than theſe.</q> But they cried, 'Withdraw, withdraw.' Whereupon the door-keeper took me again by the hand and led me out. I returned to my inn, and continued ſtill in Edinburgh; viſiting friends there and thereabouts, and ſtrengthening them in the Lord. After a little time I wrote a letter to the council, to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them their unchriſtian dealings, in baniſhing me, an innocent man that ſought their ſalvation and eternal good.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>YOU that ſit in council, and bring before your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat the innocent, the juſt, without ſhewing what evil I have done, or convicting me of any breach of law; and afterwards ye baniſh me out of your nation, without telling me for what; though I told you, when ye aſked me How long I would ſtay in the nation?' that my time was not long (I ſpoke it innocently;) yet ye baniſh me. Will not all, think ye, that fear God, judge this to be wickedneſs? Conſider, did not they ſit in council about Stephen, when they ſtoned him to death? Did they not ſit in council about Peter and John, when they haled them out of the temple, put them out of their council for a little ſeaſon, and took counſel together; and then brought them in again, threatened, and charged them to ſpeak no more in that name? Was not this to ſtop the truth from ſpreading in that time? Had not the prieſts an hand in theſe things, with the magiſtrates? and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining Stephen, when he was ſtoned to death? Was not the council gathered together againſt Jeſus Chriſt, to put him to death? and had not the chief prieſts an hand in it? When they perſecute the juſt, and crucify the juſt, do they not then neglect judgment, mercy, and juſtice, and the weighty matters of the law, which are juſt? Was not the apoſtle Paul toſſed up and down and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:037441_0420_100D90AD18DFDBE0"/>by the prieſts and the rulers? Was not John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt caſt into priſon? Are not ye doing the ſame work, ſhewing what ſpirit ye are of? Now, do not ye ſhew the end of your profeſſion, the end of your prayers, the end of your religion, and the end of your teaching, who are now come to baniſh the truth, and him that came to declare it unto you? Doth not this ſhew that ye are but in the words, out of the life of the prophets, Chriſt, and his apoſtles? for they did not uſe ſuch practice, as to baniſh any. How do ye receive ſtrangers, which is a command of God among the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles? Some by that means have entertained angels at unawares; but ye baniſh one that comes to viſit the ſeed of God, and is not chargeable to any of you. Will not all that fear God look upon this to be ſpite and wickedneſs againſt the truth? How are ye like to love enemies, that baniſh your friend? How are ye like to do good to them that hate you, when ye do evil to them that love you? How are ye like to heap coals of fire on their heads that hate you. and to overcome evil with good, when ye baniſh thus? Do ye not manifeſt to all that are in the truth that ye have not the chriſtian ſpirit? How did ye do juſtice to me, when ye could not convict me of any evil, yet baniſh me? This ſhews that truth is baniſhed out of your hearts, and ye have taken part againſt the truth with evil-doers, with the wicked envious prieſts, ſtoners, ſtrikers, and mockers in the ſtreets; with theſe, ye that baniſh have taken part; whereas ye ſhould have been a terror to theſe, and a praiſe to them that do well, and ſuccourers of them that are in the truth; then might ye have been a bleſſing to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not have baniſhed him that was moved of the Lord to viſit the ſeed of God, and thereby have brought your names upon record, and made them ſtink in ages to come, among them that fear God. Were not the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates ſtirred up in former ages to perſecute or baniſh, by the corrupt prieſts? and did not the corrupt prieſts ſtir up the rude multitude againſt the juſt in other ages? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are your ſtreets like Sodom and Gomorrah. Did not the Jews and the prieſts make the Gentiles minds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious againſt the apoſtles? Who were they that would not have the prophet Amos to propheſy at the king's chapel; but bad him fly his way? When Jeremiah was put in the priſon, in the dungeon, and in the ſtocks, had not the prieſts an hand with the princes in doing it? Now
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:037441_0421_100D90AF728F0610"/>ſee all, that were in this work of baniſhing, priſoning, perſecuting, whether they were not all out of the life of Chriſt, the prophets, and apoſtles? To the witneſs of God in you all I ſpeak. Conſider, Whether or no they were not always the blind magiſtrates, which turned their ſword always backward, that knew not their friends from their foes, and ſo hit their friends? Such magiſtrates were deceived by flattery.</p>

                  <p>When this was delivered, and read amongſt them, ſome of them, I heard, were troubled at what they had done; being made ſenſible that they would not be ſo ſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But it was not long before they that baniſhed me were baniſhed themſelves, or glad to get away; who would not do good in the day when they had power, nor ſuffer others that would.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſpent ſome time among friends at Edinburgh, and thereabouts, I paſſed from thence to Heads again, where friends had been in great ſufferings; for the Preſbyterian prieſts had excommunicated them, and given charge, that none ſhould buy or ſell with them, nor eat nor drink with them. So they could neither ſell their commodities, nor buy what they wanted; which made it go very hard with ſome of them; for if they had bought bread or other vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals of any of their neighbours, the prieſts threatened them ſo with curſes, that they would run and fetch it from them again. But colonel Aſhfield, being a juſtice of peace in that country, put a ſtop to the prieſts proceedings. This colonel Aſhfield was afterwards convinced himſelf, had a meeting ſettled at his houſe, and declared the truth, and lived and died in it.</p>
                  <p>After I had viſited friends at and about Heads, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them in the Lord, I went to Glaſgow, where a meeting was appointed; but not one of the town came to it. As I went into the city, the guard at the gates took me before the governor, who was a moderate man. A great deal of diſcourſe I had with him; but he was too light to receive the truth; yet he ſet me at liberty: ſo I paſſed to the meeting. But ſeeing none of the town's people came to the meeting, we declared truth through the town; then paſſed away, viſited friends meetings thereabouts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards Badcow. Several friends declared truth in their ſteeple-houſes, and the Lord's power was with them.
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:037441_0422_100D90B1B99E9088"/>One time, as I was going with William Oſborn to his houſe, there lay a company of rude fellows by the way-ſide, who had hid themſelves under the hedges and in buſhes. I eſpying them, aſked him, 'What they were?' 'Oh!' ſaid he, 'they are thieves.' Robert Widders, being moved to go to ſpeak to a prieſt, was left behind, intending to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo I ſaid to William Oſborn, <q>I will ſtay here in this valley, and do thou go look after Robert Widders.</q> But he was unwilling to go, being afraid to leave me there alone becauſe of thoſe fellows; till I told him, <q>I feared them not.</q> Then I called to them, aſking them, What they lay lurking there for? I bid them come up to me; but they were loth to come. I charged them to come up to me, or elſe it might be worſe with them. Then they came trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to me; for the dread of the Lord had ſtruck them. I admoniſhed them to be honeſt, and directed them to the light of Chriſt in their hearts, that by it they might ſee what an evil it was to follow after theft and robbery; and the power of the Lord came over them. I ſtaid there till William Oſborn and Robert Widders came, and then we paſſed on together. But it is likely, if we two had gone before, they would have robbed Widders when he had come after alone, there being three or four of them.</p>
                  <p>We went to William Oſborn's, where we had a good opportunity to declare the truth to ſeveral people that came in. Then we went among the Highlanders, who were ſo deviliſh they had like to have ſpoiled us and our horſes; for they ran at us with pitchforks; but through the Lord's goodneſs we eſcaped them, being preſerved by his power.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed to Stirling, where the ſoldiers took us up, and had us to the main-guard. After a few words with their officers, the Lord's power coming over them, we were ſet at liberty; but no meeting could we get amongſt them in the town, they were ſo cloſed up in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Next morning there came a man with an horſe that was to run a race, and moſt of the town's people and the officers went to ſee it. As they returned from the race, I had a brave opportunity to declare the day of the Lord and his word of life amongſt them. Some confeſſed to it, and ſome oppoſed; but the Lord's truth and power came over them all.</p>
                  <p>Leaving Stirling we came to Burnt-Iſland, where I had two meetings at Captain Pool's; one in the morning, the other in the afternoon. Whilſt they went to dinner I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:037441_0423_100D90B34E61EA50"/>to the ſea-ſide, not having freedom to eat with them. Both he and his wife were convinced, and became good friends afterward; and ſeveral officers of the army came in and received the truth.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed from thence through ſeveral other places in that country, till we came to Johnſtons; where were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Baptiſts, that were very bitter, and came in a rage to diſpute with us. Vain janglers and diſputers indeed they were. When they could not prevail by diſputing, they went and informed the governor againſt us, and next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they raiſed a whole company of foot, and baniſhed me, Alexander Parker, James Lancaſter, and Robert Widders out of the town. As they guarded us through the town, James Lancaſter was moved to ſing with a melodious ſound in the power of God, and I was moved to proclaim the day of the Lord, and preach the everlaſting goſpel to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the people generally came forth, ſo that the ſitreets were filled with them; and the ſoldiers were ſo aſhamed, that they ſaid, <q>They had rather have gone to Jamaica than have guarded us ſo.</q> But we were put into a boat with our horſes, carried over the water, and there left. The Baptiſts, who were the cauſe of our being thus put out of this town, were themſelves, not long after, turned out of the army: and he that was then governor was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded alſo when the king came in.</p>
                  <p>Being thus thruſt out of Johnſtons we went to another market-town, where Edward Billing and many ſoldiers quartered. We went to an inn, and deſired to have a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the town, that we might preach the everlaſting goſpel amongſt them. The officers and ſoldiers ſaid, <q>We ſhould have it in the town-hall;</q> but the Scotch magiſtrates in ſpite appointed a meeting there that day for the buſineſs of the town. Which when the officers of the ſoldiery under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and perceived that it was done in malice, they would have had us to have gone into the twon-hall nevertheleſs. But we told them, 'No, by no means;' for then the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates might inform the governor againſt them, and ſay, <q>They took the town-hall from them by force, when they were to do their town-buſineſs therein.</q> We told them. 'We would go to the market-place.' They ſaid. <q>It was market-day.</q> We replied, <q>It was ſo much the better; for we would have all people to hear the truth and know our principles.</q> Alexander Parker went and ſtood upon the market-croſs, with a bible in his hand, and declared the
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:037441_0424_100D90B5368A9DB0"/>truth amongſt the ſoldiers and market-people: but the Scots, being a dark, carnal people, gave little heed, nor hardly took notice what was ſaid. After awhile I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord to ſtand up at the croſs, and to declare with a loud voice the everlaſting truth, and the day of the Lord that was coming upon all ſin and wickedneſs. Where-upon the people came running out of the town-hall, and gathered ſo together that at laſt we had a large meeting; for they only ſate in the court for a colour to hinder us from having the hall to meet in. When the people were come away, the magiſtrates followed them. Some walked by, but ſome ſtaid and heard; and the Lord's power came over all and kept all quiet. <q>The people were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who died for them, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened them, that with his light they might ſee their evil deeds, be ſaved from their ſins by him, and might come to know him to be their teacher. But if they would not receive Chriſt, and own him, it was told them, that this light which came from him would be their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several of them were made loving to us, eſpecially the Engliſh, and ſome came afterwards to be convinced. But there was a ſoldier that was very envious againſt us; he hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both us and the truth, ſpoke evil of the truth, and very deſpuefully againſt the light of Chriſt Jeſus, which we bore teſtimony to. Mighty zealous he was for the prieſts and their hearers. As this man was holding his hat before his ſace, while the prieſt prayed; one of the prieſt's hearers ſtabbed him to death. So he, who had rejected the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and cried down the ſervants of the Lord, was murdered amongſt them whom he had ſo cried up, and by one of them.</p>
                  <p>We travelled from this town to Leith, warning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting people as we went, to turn to the Lord. At Leith the innkeeper told me, the council had granted warrants to apprehend me, <q>becauſe I was not gone out of the nation after the ſeven days were expired that they had ordered me to depart the nation in</q> Several friendly people alſo came and told me the ſame. To whom I ſaid; <q>What do ye tell me of their warrants againſt me? If there were a cart load of them I do not regard them; for the Lord's power is over them all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went from Leith to Edinburgh again, where they ſaid the warrants from the council were out againſt me. I went
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:037441_0425_100D90B7862E0800"/>to the inn where I had lodged before, and no man offered to meddle with me. After I had viſited friends in the city, I deſired thoſe that travelled with me to get ready their horſes in the morning; and we rode out of town together. There were with the me Thomas Rawlinſon, Alexander Parker, and Robert Widders. When we were come out of the town, they aſked me, 'Whither I would go?' I told them, <q>It was upon me from the Lord to go back again to Johnſtons (the town out of which we had been lately thruſt) and to ſet the power of God and his truth over them alſo.</q> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Parker ſaid, 'He would go along with me;' and I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other two to ſtay at a town about three miles from Edinburgh till we returned. Then Alexander Parker and I got over the water, which was about three miles over, and rode through the country; but in the afternoon, his horſe being weak and not able to hold up with mine, I put on and got into Johnſtons juſt as they were drawing up the bridges, the officers and ſoldiers never queſtioning me. I rode up the ſtreet to captain Davenport's, from whence we had been baniſhed. There were many officers with him: and when I came amongſt them they lifted up their hands, admiring that I ſhould come again; but I told them, <q>The Lord God had ſent me amongſt them again.</q> They went their way; and the Baptiſts ſent me a letter, by way of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, 'That they would diſcourſe with me the next day.' I ſent them word, <q>I would meet them at ſuch a houſe, about half a mile out of the town, at ſuch an hour.</q> For I conſidered, if I ſhould ſtay in town to diſcourſe with them, they might, under pretence of diſcourſing with me, have raiſed men to put me out of town again, as they had done before. At the time appointed I went to the place, captain Davenport and his ſon accompanying me; where I ſtaid ſome hours, but not one of them came. While I ſtaid waiting for them, I eſpied Alexander Parker coming; who not being able to reach the town, had lain out the night before; and I was exceeding glad that we were met again.</p>
                  <p>Captain Davenport was then loving to friends; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards coming more into obedience to truth, he was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his place, for not putting off his hat, and for ſay-Thou and Thee to them.</p>
                  <p>When we had waited beyond reaſonable ground to expect any of their coming we departed; and Alexander Parker being moved to go again to the town where we had the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the market-croſs, I paſſed alone to licutenant Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:037441_0426_100D90B96EC49090"/>quarters, where I found ſeveral officers that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. From thence I went to the town where I had left the other two friends, and they and I went back to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh together.</p>
                  <p>When we were come to the city, I bid Robert Widders follow me; and in the dread and power of the Lord we came up to the two firſt centries, and the Lord's power came ſo over them, that we paſſed by them without any examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then we rode up the ſtreet to the market-place, and by the main-guard out at the gate by the third centry, and ſo clear out at the ſuburbs, and there came to an inn and ſet up our horſes, it being ſeventh-day. Now I ſaw and felt that we had rode, as it were, againſt the cannon's mouth or the ſword's point; but the Lord's power and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand carried us over the heads of them all. Next day I went to the meeting in the city, friends having notice I would attend it. There came many officers and ſoldiers to it, and a glorious meeting it was; the everlaſting power of God was ſet over the nation, and his Son reigned in his glorious power. All was quiet, and no man offered to meddle with me. When the meeting was ended, and I had viſited friends, I came out of the city to my inn again. The next day, being ſecond-day, we ſet forward towards the borders of England.</p>
                  <p>As we travelled along the country I eſpied a ſteeple-houſe, and it ſtruck at my life. I aſked, what ſteeple-houſe it was? and was anſwered, it was Dunbar. When I came thither, and had ſet up at an inn, I walked to the ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, having a friend or two with me. When we came to the ſteeple-houſe yard, one of the chief men of the town was walking there. I ſpoke to one of the friends that was with me, <q>To go to him, and tell him, that about the ninth hour next morning there would be a meeting there of the people of God called Quakers; of which we deſired he would give notice to the people of the town.</q> He ſent me word, <q>That they were to have a lecture there by the ninth hour; but that we might have our meeting there by the eighth hour if we would.</q> We concluded ſo, and deſired him to give notice of it. Accordingly in the morning both poor and rich came; and there being a captain of horſe quartered in the town, he and his troopers came alſo, ſo that we had a large concourſe: and a glorious meeting it was, the Lord's power being over all. After ſome time the prieſt came, and went into the ſteeple-houſe; but we being in the yard,
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:037441_0427_100D90BB03DCCCD0"/>moſt of the people ſtaid with us. Friends were ſo full, and their voices ſo high in the power of God, that the prieſt could do little in the houſe, but came quickly out again, ſtood awhile, and then went his way. I opened to the people, <q>Where they might find Chriſt Jeſus, turned them to the light, which he had enlightened them withal, that in the light they might ſee Chriſt who died for them, turn to him, and know him to be their Saviour and teacher; let them ſee, that the teachers they had hitherto followed were hirelings, who made the goſpel chargeable; ſhewed them the wrong ways they had walked in, in the night of apoſtacy, directed them to Chriſt, the new and living way to God; manifeſted unto them, how they had loſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and worſhip which Chriſt ſet up in ſpirit and truth, and had hitherto been in the religions and worſhips of men's making and ſetting up; and after I had turned the people to the Spirit of God, which led the holy men of God to give forth the ſcriptures, and ſhewed them that they muſt alſo come to receive and be led by the ſame Spirit in themſelves (a meaſure of which was given unto every one of them) if ever they came to know God and Chriſt and the ſcriptures aright, perceiving the other friends to be full of power and the word of the Lord, I ſtepped down, giving way for them to declare what they had from the Lord to the people.</q> Towards the latter end of the meeting ſome profeſſors began to jangle; whereupon I ſtood up again and anſwered their queſtions, ſo that they ſeemed to be ſatisfied and our meeting ended in the Lord's power, quiet and peaceable. This was the laſt meeting I had in Scotland. The truth and the power of God was ſet over that nation, and many, by the power and Spirit of God were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Saviour and Teacher, whoſe blood was ſhed for them; and there is ſince a great increaſe, and great there will be in Scotland, tho' the time may be far diſtant at preſent. For when firſt I ſet my horſe's feet upon Scottiſh ground, I felt the ſeed of God to ſparkle about me, like innumerable ſparks of fire. Not but that there is abundance of thick, cloddy earth of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and ſalſeneſs atop, and a briery, brambly nature, which is to be burned up with God's word, and plowed up with his ſpiritual plough, before God's ſeed brings forth heavenly and ſpiritual fruit to his glory. But the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to wait in patience.</p>
                  <p>From Dunbar we came to Berwick, where we were queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:037441_0428_100D90BCEC258F38"/>a little by the officers; but the governor was loving towards us, and in the evening we had a little meeting, in which the power of the Lord was manifeſted over all.</p>
                  <p>Leaving Berwick we came to Morpeth, and through the country, viſiting friends, to Newcaſtle, where I had been once before. The Newcaſtle prieſts wrote many books againſt us, and one Ledger, an alderman of the town, was very envious againſt truth and friends. He and the prieſts had ſaid, <q>The Quakers would not come into any great towns, but lived in the fells like butterflies.</q> I took An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Pearſon with me, and went to this Ledger and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others of the aldermen; <q>deſiring to have a meeting amongſt them, ſeeing they had written ſo many books againſt us: for we were now come, I told them, into their great town.</q> But they would not yield we ſhould have a meeting, neither would they be ſpoke with, ſave only this Ledger and one other. I queried, <q>Had they not called friends butterflies, and ſaid, We would not come into any great towns? And now we were in their town, they would not come at us, tho they had printed books againſt us: who are the butterflies now?</q> Then Ledger began to plead <q>for the ſabbath-day. I told him, They kept markets and fairs on that which was the ſabbath-day, for that was the ſeventh day of the week; whereas that day which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed chriſtians now meet, on, and call their ſabbath, is the firſt day of the week.</q> As we could not have a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meeting among them, we got a little meeting among friends and friendly people at the Gate-ſide; where a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is continued to this day in the name of Jeſus. As I was paſſing by the market-place the power of the Lord roſe in me <q>to warn them of the day of the Lord that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them.</q> And not long after, all thoſe prieſts of Newcaſtle and their profeſſion were turned out when the king came in.</p>
                  <p>From Newcaſtle we travelled, having meetings and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends, in Northumberland and Biſhoprick. A very good meeting we had at lieutenant Dove's, where many were turned to the Lord and his teaching. After which I went to viſit a juſtice of peace, a very ſober, loving man, who confeſſed to the truth.</p>
                  <p>From thence we came to Durham, where was a man come from London to ſet up a college to make miniſters of Chriſt, as they ſaid. I went with ſome others to reaſon with the man, and to let him ſee, <q>That to teach men He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:037441_0429_100D90BF46081528"/>Greek, Latin, and the ſeven arts, which were all but the teachings of the natural man, was not the way to make them miniſters of Chriſt. For the languages began at Babel; and to the Greeks, that ſpoke Greek as their mother-tongue, the preaching of the croſs of Chriſt was ſooliſhneſs; and to the Jews, that ſpoke Hebrew as their mother-tongue, Chriſt was a ſtumbling-block. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who had the Latin, perſecuted the Chriſtians; and Pilate, one of the Roman governors, ſet Hebrew, Greek, and Latin atop of Chriſt when he crucified him. So he might ſee the many languages began at Babel, and they ſet them atop of Chriſt, the Word, when they crucified him. John the divine, who preached the Word which was in the beginning, ſaid, <q>That the beaſt and the whore have power over tongues and languages, and they are as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</q> Thus, I told him, he might ſee the whore and the beaſt have power over the tongues and the many languages, which are in myſtery Babylon; for they began at Babel, and the perſecutors of Chriſt Jeſus ſet them over him, when he was crucified by them; but he is riſen over them all, who was before them all. Now (ſaid I to this man) doſt thou think to make miniſters of Chriſt by theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, confuſed languages which ſprung from Babel, are admired in Babylon, and ſet atop of Chriſt, the Life, by a perſecutor? Oh, no!</q> The man confeſſed to many of theſe things. Then we ſhewed him further, <q>That Chriſt made his miniſters himſelf, gave gifts unto them, and bid them <q>Pray to the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend forth labourers.</q> And Peter and John, though unlearned and ignorant as to ſchool-learning, preached Chriſt Jeſus the Word, which was in the beginning, before Babel was. Paul alſo was made an apoſtle, not of man, nor by man, neither received he the goſpel from man, but from Jeſus Chriſt; who is the ſame now, and ſo is the goſpel, as it was at that day.</q> When we had thus diſcourſed with him, he became very loving and tender: and after he had conſidered further of it, declined to ſet up his college.</p>
                  <p>From Durham we went to Anthony Pearſon's, from thence into Cleveland, and paſſed through Yorkſhire to the further and of Holderneſs, and had mighty meetings, the Lord's power accompanying us.</p>
                  <p>After we paſſed from. Anthony Pearſon's, we went by Huſt and Pomſret to George Watkinſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and viſited moſt of the meetings in theſe parts, till we came to Scale houſe,
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:037441_0430_100D90C12CB4B7A8"/>and ſo, to Swarthmore; the everlaſting power and arm of God carrying us through and preſerving us. After I had viſited friends there-away, I paſſed into Yorkſhire and Cheſhire, and ſo through other counties into Derbyſhire and Nottinghamſhire; and glorious meetings we had, the Lord's preſence being with us.</p>
                  <p>At Nottingham I ſent to Rice Jones, deſiring him <q>to acquaint his people that I had ſomething to ſay to them from the Lord.</q> He came and told me, <q>Many of them lived in the country, and he could not tell how to ſend to them.</q> I told him, <q>He might acquaint them about the town of it, and ſend to as many in the country as he could.</q> The next day we met at the caſtle, there being about fourſcore people, to whom I declared the truth for about the ſpace of two hours; and the Lord's power was over them all, ſo that they had not power to open their mouths in oppoſition. When I had done, one of them aſked me a queſtion, which I was loth to have anſwered; for I ſaw it might lead into jangling, and was unwilling to go into jangling, for ſome of the people were tender; yet I could not well tell how to eſcape it. Wherefore I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the queſtion, and was moved forthwith to ſpeak to Rice Jones, and lay before him, <q>That he had been the man who had ſcattered ſuch as had been tender, and ſome that had been convinced and had been led out of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world, which he had formerly judged; but now he judged the power of God in them, and they being ſimple turned to him; ſo he and they were turned to be vainer than the world: for many of his followers were become the greateſt foot-ball players and wreſtlers in the whole country. I told them it was the ſerpent in him that had ſcattered and done hurt to ſuch as were tender towards the Lord. Nevertheleſs, if he waited in the fear of God for the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt Jeſus, to bruiſe the ſerpent's head in him, that had ſcattered and done the hurt; he might come to gather them again by this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed; though it would be an hard work for him, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them again out of thoſe vanities he had led them into.</q> At this Rice Jones ſaid, <q>Thou lieſt, it is not the ſeed of the woman that bruiſes the ſerpent's head.</q> 'No! ſaid I, 'what is it then? "I ſay, it is the law," ſaid he. 'But 'ſaid I, the ſcripture, ſpeaking of the ſeed of the woman, ſaith. "It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bruiſe his "heel" now, hath the law an heel, ſaid I, to be bruiſed?'
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:037441_0431_100D90C2BB95E418"/>Then Rice Jones and all his company were at a ſtand, and I was moved in the power of the Lord to ſay, <q>This ſeed, Chriſt Jeſus, the ſeed of the woman, which ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head, ſhall brurſe thy head, and break you all in pieces.</q> Thus I left on the heads of them the ſeed, Chriſt; and not long after he and his company ſcattered to pieces; ſeveral of whom came to be friends, and ſtand to this day. Many of them had been convinced about eight years before, but had been led aſide by this Rice Jones: for they denied the inward croſs, the power of God, and ſo went into vanity. It was about eight years, ſince I had been formerly amongſt them; in which time I was to paſs over them, and by them, ſeeing they had ſlighted the Lord's truth and power, and the viſitation of his love unto them. But now was the time that I was moved to go to them again, and it was of great-ſervice; for many of them were brought to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and were ſettled upon him, ſitting down under his teaching and feeding, where they were kept freſh and green; and the others that would not be gathered to him ſoon after withered. This was that Rice Jones, who had ſome years before ſaid, <q>I was then at the higheſt, and ſhould fall;</q> but, poor man: he little thought how near his own fall was.</p>
                  <p>We left Nottingham, and went into Warwickſhire, Northamptonſhire, and Leiceſterſhire, viſiting friends, and having meetings as we travelled. We came into Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where we had large gatherings in the name of Jeſus. After ſome time we came to John Crook's, where a general yearly meeting for the whole nation was appointed to be held. This meeting laſted three days, and many friends from moſt parts of the nation came to it; ſo that the inns and towns round thereabouts were filled, for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of people were at it. And although there was ſome diſturbance by ſome rude people that had run out from truth; yet the Lord's power came over all, and a glorious meeting it was. The everlaſting goſpel was preached, and many received it, which goſpel brought life and immortality to light in them, and ſhined over all.</p>
                  <p>I was moved by the Power and Spirit of the Lord to open unto them the <q>promiſe of God, that it was made to the ſeed, not to ſeeds, as many, but to one; which ſeed was Chriſt: and that all people, both male and female, ſhould feel this ſeed in them, which was heir of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that ſo they might all witneſs Chriſt in them, the
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:037441_0432_100D90C450E05BB8"/>hope of glory, the myſtery which had been hid from ages and generations, which was revealed to the apoſtles, and is revealed again now, after the long night of apoſtacy. So that all might come up into this ſeed, Chriſt Jeſus, walk in it, and ſit down together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, who was the foundation of the prophets and apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the rock of ages, and is our foundation now. All ſitting down in him, ſit down in the ſubſtance, the firſt and the laſt, that changes not, the ſeed that bruiſes the ſerpent's head, which was before he was, who ends all the types, figures, and ſhadows, and is the ſubſtance of them all; in whom there is no ſhadow.</q> Now, theſe things were upon me to open unto all, that they might mind and ſee what it is they ſit down in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They that ſit down in Adam in the fall, ſit down in miſery, in death, in darkneſs and corruption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They that ſit down in the types, figures, and ſhadows, and under the firſt prieſthood, law, and covenant, ſit down in that which muſt have an end, and which made nothing perfect.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They that ſit down in the apoſtacy, that hath got up ſince the apoſtles days, ſit down in ſpiritual Sodom and Egypt; and are drinking of the whore's cup, under the beaſt's and dragon's power.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They that ſit down in the ſtate in which Adam was before he fell, ſit down in that which may be ſallen from; for he fell from that ſtate, though it was perfect.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They that ſit down in the prophets, ſit down in that which muſt be fulfilled: and they that ſit down in the fellowſhip of water, bread, and wine, theſe being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, they ſit down in that which is ſhort of Chriſt, and of his baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, To ſit down in a profeſſion of all the ſcriptures, from Geneſis to the Revelations, and not be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Spirit which thoſe were in that gave them forth; that was to be turned away from, by them that came into the power and Spirit which thoſe were in that gave forth the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They that ſit down in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, ſit down in him that never fell, nor ever changed. Here is the ſafe ſitting for all his elect, his church, his ſpiritual members, of which he is the living head, his living ſtones, the houſehold of faith; of which
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:037441_0433_100D90C6A1804758"/>houſe he is the corner-ſtone, that ſtands and abides all weathers. "For", as the apoſtle ſaid, <q>he hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened us, who were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, &amp;c. and made us ſit together in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus; that in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us, through Jeſus Chriſt.</q> Now the ages are come, that his kindneſs and exceeding riches towards us through Jeſus Chriſt is truly manifeſted in us, as it was in the apoſtles days; even in us, who have been dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, as they were; but now are quickened, and made to ſit together in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty places in Chriſt Jeſus, the firſt and the laſt, by whom all things were created; who is aſcended above all, and is over all, and whoſe glorious preſence is now known. All that ſit down here, in Chriſt Jeſus, ſee where all other people ſit, and in what. The promiſe of God being to the ſeed, which is one, Chriſt Jeſus, every man and woman muſt come to witneſs this ſeed, Chriſt in them, that they may be heirs of the promiſe; and inheriting that, they will inherit ſubſtance. Theſe things were largely declared of; the ſtate of the church, and the ſtate of the falſe church ſince the apoſtles days, opened; and how the true church fled into the wilderneſs: and the ſtate of the falſe prophets, which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, and John ſaw were come, and how all the world wondered after them; and how they had filled the world with falſe doctrines, ways, worſhips, and religions: and how the everlaſting goſpel is now preached again to all nations, kindreds, tongues and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people had drunk the whore's cup, and ſhe was over them, and ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. In this night of apoſtacy the pure religion and worſhip in ſpirit, which was in the apoſtles days, the way of life and living faith, and the power and Holy Ghoſt were loſt; but now they came to be ſet up again by Chriſt Jeſus, his meſſengers and miniſters of the goſpel, as in the apoſtles days. For as Chriſt ſent his diſciples to go and preach the goſpel into all the world, and after that, the falſe prophets and antichriſts went over the world, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their falſe doctrines and traditions, and heatheniſh and Jewiſh rudiments, ſo now again the everlaſting goſpel muſt be preached to all nations, and to every creature, that they may come into the pure religion, to worſhip God in the Spirit and truth, and may know Chriſt Jeſus, their way to God, to be the author of their faith, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:037441_0434_100D90C90A4C2778"/>the goſpel from heaven, and not from men; in which goſpel, received from heaven, is the heavenly fellowſhip, which is a myſtery to all the fellowſhips in the world.' After theſe things had been largely opened, with many others concerning Chriſt Jeſus and his kingdom, and the people were turned to the divine light of Chriſt and his Spirit, by which they might come to know God and Chriſt, and the ſcriptures, and to have fellowſhip with them, and one with another in the ſame Spirit, I was moved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and open divers other things to thoſe friends who had received a part of the miniſtry, concerning the exerciſe of their ſpiritual gifts in the church: which, being taken in writing by one preſent, was after this manner;</p>

                        <p>TAKE heed of deſtroying that which ye have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: for that which deſtroys, goes out, and is the caſt-away. And though that be true, yea, and may be the pure truth which ſuch an one ſpeaks, yet if he doth not remain in that, and live in that in his particular, but goes out, the ſame which he is gone out from cometh over him. So that which calms and cools the ſpirits, goes over the world, and brings to the Father, to inherit the life eternal; and reaches to the ſpirits in priſon in all. Therefore in the living, immovable Word of the Lord God dwell, in the renown thereof: and remain on the foundation that is pure, and that is ſure: for whoſoever goes out from the pure, and miniſters not in and from that, he comes to an end, and doth not remain; although he may have had a time, and may have been ſerviceable for a time, while he lived in the thing.</p>
                        <p>Take heed of many words; what reacheth to the life, ſettles in the life. That which cometh from the life, and is received from God, reacheth to the life, and ſettles others in the life: the work is not now as it was at firſt; the work now is, to ſettle and ſtay in the life. For as friends have been led to miniſter in the power, and the power hath gone through, ſo that there hath grown an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding among both people of the world and friends, ſo friends muſt be kept in the life which is pure, that with that they may anſwer the pure life of God in others. If friends do not live in the pure life which they ſpeak of, to anſwer the life in thoſe they ſpeak to, the other part ſteps in; and ſo there comes up an outward acquaintance,
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:037441_0435_100D90CA9DC56620"/>and he lets that come over him. But as every one is kept living in the life of God, over all that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are in their places; then they do not lay hands on any ſuddenly, which is the danger now: for if any one do, he may loſe his diſcerning, may lay hands on the wrong part, ſo let the deceit come too near him; and the deceit will ſteal over, ſo that it will be an hard thing for him to get it down. There is no one ſtrikes his fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but firſt he is gone from the pure in his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; for when he goeth from the light he is enlightened withal, then he ſtrikes; and then he hath his reward: the light, which he is gone from, Chriſt, comes and gives him his reward. This is the ſtate of the evil ſervants. The boiſterous, the haſty and raſh, beget nothing to God; but the life, which doth reach the life, is that which begets to God. When all are ſettled in the life they are in that which remains for ever; and what is received there, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Lord; and what one receiveth from the Lord, he keepeth; ſo he ſitteth ſtill, cool, and quiet in his own ſpirit, and gives it forth as he is moved; but to the harlots, judgment.</p>
                        <p>Friends, This is the word of the Lord to you all, be watchful and careful in all meetings ye come into; for where friends are ſitting together in ſilence, they are many times gathered into their own meaſures. When a man is come newly out of the world, from miniſtering to the world's people, he cometh out of the dirt; and then he had need take heed that he be not raſh. For when he comes into a ſilent meeting, that is another ſtate; then he muſt come, and feel his own ſpirit, how it is when he comes to them that ſit ſilent. If he be raſh, they will judge him; that having been in the world, and amongſt the world, the heat is not yet off him. For he may come in the heat of his ſpirit out of the world; whereas the others are ſtill and cool; and his condition in that, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to theirs, he may rather do them hurt, by begetting them out of the cool ſtate into the heating ſtate; if he be not in that which commands his own ſpirit, and gives him to know it.</p>
                        <p>There is great danger too in travelling abroad in the world. The ſame power, that moves any to go forth, is that which muſt keep them. For it is the greateſt danger to go abroad, except a man be moved of the Lord, and go in the power of the Lord; for then, he keeping in the
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:037441_0436_100D90CC2FA01F98"/>power, is kept by it in his journey, and in his work; it will enable him to anſwer the tranſgreſſed, and keep above the tranſgreſſor. Every one feeling the danger to his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in travelling abroad, there the pure fear of the Lord will be placed and kept in. Though they that travel may have openings when they are abroad, to miniſter to others; yet, for their own particular growth, they muſt dwell in the life which doth open; and that will keep down that which would boaſt. For the miniſter cornes into the death, to that which is in the death and in priſon: and ſo returns up again into the life, into the power, and into the wiſdom, to preſerve him clean.</p>
                        <p>This is the word of the Lord God to you all; feel, that ye ſtand in the preſence of the Lord; for every man's word ſhall be his burden; but the word of the Lord is pure, and anſwers the pure in every one. The Word of the Lord is that which was in the beginning, and brings to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It is an hammer to beat down the tranſgreſſor (not the tranſgreſſed) and as a fire to burn up that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. Friends, come into that which is over all the ſpirits of the world, fathoms all the ſpirits of the world, and ſtands in the patience; with that ye may ſee where others ſtand, and reach that which is of God in every one. Here is no ſtrife, no contention, out of tranſgreſſion: for he that goeth into ſtrife, and into contention, he is from the pure Spirit. For where any goeth into contention, if any thing hath been begotten by him before, that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious nature doth get atop, ſpoileth that which was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and quencheth his own propheſying. So if that be not ſubjected by the power in the particular, which would ariſe into ſtrife, that is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>If any one have a moving to any place, and have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what they were moved of the Lord, let them return to their habitation again, and live in the pure life of God, and in the fear of the Lord; ſo will ye be kept in the life, in the ſolid and ſeaſoned ſpirit, and preach as well in life as with words (none muſt be light or wild.) For the feed of God is weighty, brings to be ſolid, and leads into the wiſdom of God, by which the wiſdom of the creation is known. But if that part be up which runs into the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and that part be ſtanding in which the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations come up, and the pure ſpirit be not thoroughly come up to rule and reign, then that will run out that will glory, boaſt, and vapour; and ſo will ſuch an one
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:037441_0437_100D90CE93F58710"/>ſpoil that which opened to him; this is for condemnation. Let every one mind that which feels through and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his ſpirit, whereby every one may know what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he is of; for he ſhould firſt try his own ſpirit, and then he may try others; he ſhould firſt know his own ſpirit, and then he may know others. Therefore that which doth command all theſe ſpirits, where the heats and burnings come in and get up, in that wait which chains them down and cools: that is the elect, the heir of the promiſe of God. For no haſty, raſh, brittle ſpirits (though they have prophecies) have held out, and gone through, they not being ſubjected in the prophecy. The earthly will not abide, for it is brittle; in that ſtate the miniſtry was another's, not the Son's; for the Son hath life in himſelf, and the Son hath the power, which man being obedient to, he may be ſerviceable: but if he go from the pure power, he falls and abuſeth it. Therefore let your faith ſtand in the pure power of the Lord God, and do not abuſe it; but let that ſearch through, and work through; and let every one ſtand in the power of the Lord, which reacheth the ſeed of God; which is the heir of the promiſe of life without end. Let none be haſty to ſpeak; for ye have time enough, and with an eye ye may reach the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; neither let any be backward when ye are moved; for that brings deſtruction. Truth hath an honour in the hearts of thoſe who are not friends; ſo that all friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in the truth, they are kept in the honour, they are honourable, for that will honour them; but if any loſe the power, loſe the life, they loſe their crown, they loſe their honour, they loſe the croſs which ſhould crucify them, and they crucify the juſt; and by loſing the power, the Lamb comes to be ſlain. And as it is here, ſo will it be in other nations; for all friends, here and there, are as one family: the ſeed, the plants, they are as a family. All being kept in that which ſubjects all, and keeps all under, to wit, the ſeed itſelf, the life itſelf, that is the heir of the promiſe; and that is the bond of peace: for there is the unity in the Spirit with God and with one another. He that is kept in the life hears God, and ſees man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and with that he anſwers the life in others that hear God alſo: thus one friend, that is come into that, comprehends the world. But that which friends ſpeak, they muſt live in; ſo may they expect that others may come into that which they ſpeak, to live in the ſame. For
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:037441_0438_100D90D0D883F870"/>the power of the Lord God hath been abuſed by ſome, and the worth of truth hath not been minded. There hath been a trampling on, and marring with the feet, and that abuſeth the power. But now every friend is to keep in the power, and to take heed to it; for that muſt be kept down which would trample and mar with the feet, and the pure life and power of God is to be lived in over that; that none with the feet might foul or mar, but every one may be kept in the pure power and life of the Lord. Then the water of life cometh in; then he that miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth drinketh himſelf, and giveth others to drink.</p>
                        <p>When any ſhall be moved to go to ſpeak in a ſteeple-houſe or market, turn in to that which moves, and be obedient to it; that that which would not go may be kept down: for that which would not go will be apt to get up. And take heed on the other hand, that the laviſhing part do not get up, for it is a bad ſavour; therefore that muſt be kept down and kept ſubject. Wait in the light of the Lord that ye may be all kept in the wiſdom of God. For when the ſeed is up in every particular, there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but when there is an opening and prophecy, and the power ſtirs before the ſeed comes up, there is ſomething that will be apt to run out raſhly; there's the danger, and there muſt be the patience in the fear. For it is a weighty thing to be in the work of the miniſtry of the Lord God, and to go forth in that. It is not as a cuſtomary preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is to bring people to the end of all outward preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For when ye have declared the truth to the people, and they have received it, and are come into that which ye ſpake of; the uttering of many words, and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations out of the life, may beget them into a form. And if any ſhould run on raſhly into words again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſavour of life, thoſe that are come into the thing he ſpake of will judge him; whereby he may hurt again that which he had raiſed up before. So friends, ye muſt all come into the thing that is ſpoken in the openings of the heavenly life among you, and walk in the love of God, that ye may anſwer the thing ſpoken to.</p>
                        <p>And take heed all of running into inordinate affections; for when people come to own you, there is danger of the wrong part getting up. There was a ſtrife among the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, who ſhould be the greateſt? Chriſt told them, <q>The heathen excrciſe lordſhip, and have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over one another; but it ſhall not be ſo among
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:037441_0439_100D90D26936BC48"/>you.</q> For Chriſt the Seed was to come up in every one of them; ſo then where is the greateſt? That part in the diſciples, which looked to be the greateſt, was the ſame that was in the Gentiles. But who comes here to live in the Word that ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ctified him, having the heart ſanctified, the tongue and lips ſanctified, living in the Word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that makes clean the heart, and reconciles to God, all things being upheld by the Word and power; as there is an abiding in the Word of God, that upholds times and ſeaſons, and gives all things increaſe, here dwelling in the Word of wiſdom, if there be but two or three agreed in this on earth, it ſhall be done for them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So in this muſt all things be ordered by the Word of wiſdom and power, that upholds all things, the times and the ſeaſons, that are in the Father's hands; to the glory of God, whereby his bleſſing may be felt among you; and this brings to the beginning. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, Keep down, keep low, that nothing may rule nor reign in you, but life itſelf.</p>
                        <p>The power being lived in, the croſs is lived in; and where-ever friends come in this, they draw the power and the life over; they leave a witneſs behind them, anſwering the witneſs of God in others. Where this is lived in, there is no want of wiſdom, no want of power, no want of knowledge; he that miniſtereth in this, ſeeth with the eye which the Lord openeth in him, what is for the fire, and what is for the ſword, what muſt be fed with judgment, and what muſt be nouriſhed. This brings all down, and to be low, every one keeping to the power; for let a man get up ever ſo high, he muſt come down again to the power where he left; what he went from, he muſt come down again to that. Before all theſe wicked ſpirits be got down, which are rambling abroad, friends muſt have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, muſt wait in the patience, in the cool life; and who is in this doing the work of the Lord, he hath the taſting and the feeling of the Lamb's power and authority. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all friends, keep cool and quiet in the power of the Lord God; and all that is contrary will be ſubjected; the Lamb hath the victory, in the ſeed, through the patience.</p>
                        <p>If any have been moved to ſpeak, and have quenched that which moved them, let none ſuch go forth afterwards into words, until they feel the power to ariſe and move them thereto again; for after the firſt motion is quenched,
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:037441_0440_100D90D4556A3938"/>the other part will be apt to get up; and if any go forth in that, he goeth forth in his own, and the betrayer will come into that—And all friends, be careful not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the powers of the earth; but keep out of all ſuch things; as ye keep in the Lamb's authority, ye will anſwer that of God in them, and bring them to do juſtice, which is the end of the law. Keep out of all jangling; for all that are in the tranſgreſſion are out from the law of love; but all that are in the law of love come to the Lamb's power, in the Lamb's authority, who is the end of the law outward. For the law being added becauſe of transgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Chriſt, who was glorified with the Father before the world begain, in the end of the law; bringing them that live in the law of life, to live over all tranſgreſſion; which every particular muſt feel in himſelf.</p>

                  <p>More was then ſpoken to many of theſe particulars; which was not taken at large as delivered.</p>
                  <p>After this meeting was over, and moſt of the friends gone away, as I was walking in John Crook's garden, there came a party of horſe, with a conſtable, to ſeize me. I heard them aſk, 'Who was in the houſe?' Somebody made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 'I was there.' They ſaid, <q>I was the man they looked for;</q> and went forthwith into the houſe, where they had many words with John Crook, and ſome few friends that were with him. But the Lord's power ſo confounded them, that they came not into the garden to look for me; but went their way in a rage. When I came into the houſe, friends were very glad to ſee them ſo diſappointed, and that I had eſcaped them. Next day I paſſed from thence: and after I had viſited friends in ſeveral places, came to London, the Lord's power accompanying me, and bearing me up in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>I had not been long in London, before I heard that a Jeſuit, who came over with an embaſſador from Spain, had challenged all the Quakers to diſpute with them at the earl of Newport's houſe; whereupon ſome friends let him know ſome would meet him. Then he ſent us word, <q>He would meet with twelve of the wiſeſt learned men we had.</q> Awhile after he ſent us word, <q>He would meet with but ſix;</q> after that, he ſent us word again, <q>He would have but three to come.</q> We haſtened what we could. leſt, for all his great boaſt, he ſhould put it quite off at laſt. When we were come to the houſe, I bid Nicholas Bond
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:037441_0441_100D90D6A7FD2AD8"/>and Edward Burrough go up, and enter the diſcourſe with him; and I would walk awhile in the yard, and then come up after them. I adviſed them to ſtate this queſtion to him, <q>Whether or no the church of Rome, as it now ſtood, was not degenerated from the true church which was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, from the life and doctrine, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſpirit that they were in?</q> They ſtated the queſtion accordingly: and the Jeſuit affirmed, <q>That the church of Rome now was in the virginity and purity of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive church.</q> By this time I was come to them. Then we aſked him, <q>Whether they had the Holy Ghoſt poured out upon them, as the apoſtles had?</q> He ſaid, 'No.' 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>If ye have not the ſame Holy Ghoſt poured forth upon you, and the ſame power and Spirit that the apoſtles had, ye are degenerated from the power and Spirit which the primitive church was in.</q> There needed little more to be ſaid to that. Then I aſked him, <q>What ſcripture they had for ſetting up cloyſters for nuns, abbeys and monaſteries for men; for all their ſeveral or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for their praying by beads, and to images; for making croſſes; for forbidding of meats and marriages; and for putting people to death for religion? If, (ſaid I) ye are in the practice of the primitive church, in its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and virginity, then let us ſee by ſcriptures where-ever they practiſed any ſuch things?</q> (For it was agreed on both hands, that we ſhould make good by ſcriptures what we ſaid.) Then he told us of a written word, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word? I aſked him what he called his unwritten word? He ſaid, <q>The written word is the ſcriptures, and the unwritten word is that which the apoſtles ſpoke by word of mouth; which (ſaid he) are all thoſe traditions that we practiſe.</q> I bid him prove that by ſcripture. Then he brought that ſcripture where the apoſtle ſays, 2 Theſſ. ii. 5. <q>When I was with you, I told you theſe things. That is,</q> ſaid he, <q>I told you of nunneries and monaſteries, and of putting to death for religion, and of praying by beads, and to images, and all the reſt of the practices of the church of Rome; which,</q> he ſaid, <q>was the unwritten word of the apoſtles, which they told then, and have ſince been continued down by tradition unto theſe times.</q> Then I deſired him to read that ſcripture <q>again, that he might ſee how he had perverted the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles words; for that which the apoſtle there tells the Theſſalonians, "he had told them before," is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:037441_0442_100D90D8C4CBEF90"/>word, but is there written down; namely, That the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, ſhall be revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great and terrible day of Chriſt, which he was writing of, ſhould come: ſo this was not telling them any of thoſe things that the church of Rome practiſes. In like manner the apoſtle, in the third chapter of that epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</q> tells the church of ſome diſorderly perſons, <q>he heard were amongſt them, buſy-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had commanded them by his unwritten word, when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat: which now he commands them again in his written word in this epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</q> 2 Theſſ. iii. So this ſcripture afforded no proof for their invented traditions, and he had no other ſcripture-proof to offer. Therefore I told him, <q>This was another degeneration of their church into ſuch inventions and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as the apoſtles and primitive ſaints never practiſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this he came to his ſacrament of the altar, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the paſchal lamb, and the ſhew-bread, and came to the words of Chriſt, 'This is my body,' and to what the apoſtle wrote of it to the Corinthians; concluding, <q>That after the prieſt had conſecrated the bread and wine, it was immortal and divine, and he that received it, received the whole Chriſt.</q> I followed him through the ſcriptures he brought, till I came to Chriſt's words and the apoſtle's. I ſhewed him, <q>That the ſame apoſtle told the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, after they had taken bread and wine in remembrance of Chriſt's death, that they were reprobates, <q>if Chriſt was not in them;</q> but if the bread they ate was Chriſt, he muſt of neceſſity be in them after they had eaten it. Beſides, if this bread and this wine, which the Corinthians ate and drank, was Chriſt's body, then how hath Chriſt a body in heaven? I obſerved to him alſo, <q>That both the diſciples at the ſupper, and the Corinthians afterwards, were to eat the bread and drink the wine in <q>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt.</q> and to <q>ſhew forth his death till he come;</q> which plainly proves the bread and wine, which they took, was not his body. For if it had been his real body that they ate, then he had been come, and was then there preſent, and it had been improper to have done ſuch a thing in remembrance of him, if he had been then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, as the muſt have been, if that bread and wine which they ate and drank had been his real body.</q> As to thoſe words of Chriſt, 'This is my body,' I told him,
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:037441_0443_100D90DA55790A30"/>
                        <q>Chriſt calls himſelf a vine, and a door, and is called in ſcripture a rock. Is Chriſt therefore an outward rock, door, or vine?</q> O, ſaid the Jeſuit, <q>Thoſe words are to be interpreted;</q> ſo, ſaid I, are thoſe words of Chriſt, "This is my body." Having ſtopped his mouth as to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I made the Jeſuit a propoſal thus; That ſeeing he ſaid, <q>The bread and wine was immortal and divine, and the very Chriſt; and that whoſoever received it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the whole Chriſt;</q> let a meeting be appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome whom the pope and his cardinals ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and ſome of us; let a bottle of wine and loaf of bread be brought, and divided each into two parts, and let them conſecrate which of thoſe parts they would. Then ſet the conſecrated and the unconſecrated bread and wine in a ſafe place, with a ſure watch upon it; and let trial be thus made, Whether the conſecrated bread and wine would not loſe its goodneſs, and the bread grow dry and mouldy, and the wine turn dead and ſour, as well and as ſoon as that which was unconſecrated? By this means, ſaid I, the truth of this matter may be made manifeſt. And if the conſecrated bread and wine change not, but retain their ſavour and goodneſs, this may be a means to draw many to your church: if they change, decay, and loſe their goodneſs, then ought you to confeſs and forſake your error, and ſhed no more blood about it: for much blood hath been ſhed about theſe things; as in queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's days.</q> To this the Jeſuit made this reply, "Take," ſaid he, <q>a piece of new cloth, and cut it into two pieces, and make two garments of it, and put one of them upon king David's back, and the other upon a beggar's, and the one garment ſhall wear away as well as the other.</q> 
                     <q>Is this thy anſwer, ſaid I? Yes, ſaid he. Then, ſaid I, by this the company may all be ſatisfied that your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated bread and wine is not Chriſt. Have ye told peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo long, that the conſecrated bread and wine was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and divine, and that it was the very and real body and blood of Chriſt, and doſt thou now ſay it will wear away or decay as well as the other! I muſt tell thee, "Chriſt remains the ſame to day as yeſterday," and never decays; but is the ſaints heavenly food in all generations, through which they have life.</q> He replied no more to this, being willing to let it fall; for the people that were preſent ſaw his error, and that he could not defend it. Then I aſked him, <q>Why their church did perſecute, and
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:037441_0444_100D90DBE65ACD48"/>put people to death for religion?</q> He replied, <q>It was not the church that did it, but the magiſtrates.</q> I aſked him, <q>Whether thoſe magiſtrates were not counted and called believers and chriſtians?</q> He ſaid, Yes: <q>Why then, ſaid I, are they not members of your church?</q> 'Yes,' ſaid he. Then I left it to the people to judge from his own conceſſions, whether the church of Rome doth not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and put people to death for religion. Thus we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his ſubtilty was conſuted by ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>During the time I was at London, I had many ſervices lay upon me; for it was a time of much ſuffering. I was moved to write to O. Cromwel, and lay before him the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of friends both in this nation and in Ireland. There was alſo a talk about this time of making Cromwel king; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was moved to go to him, and warned him againſt accepting it, and of divers dangers; which if he did not avoid, I told him, <q>He would bring ſhame and ruin upon himſelf and his poſterity.</q> He ſeemed to take well what I ſaid to him, and thanked me; yet afterwards I was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write to him more fully concerning that matter.</p>
                  <p>About this time the lady Claypool (ſo called) was ſick and much troubled in mind, and could receive no comfort from any that came to her; which when I heard of, I was moved to write her the following letter:</p>

When thou art in the tranſgreſſion of the life of God in thy own particular, the mind flies up in the air, the creature is led into the night, nature goes out of its courſe, an old garment goes on, and an uppermoſt clothing: and thy nature being led out of its courſe, it
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:037441_0445_100D90DDE3EA88C8"/>comes to be all on fire in the tranſgreſſion, and that defac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the glory of the firſt body. Therefore be ſtill awhile from thy own thoughts, ſearching, ſeeking, deſires, and imaginations, and be ſtayed in the principle of God in thee, that it may raiſe thy mind up to God, and ſtay it upon God, and thou wilt ſind ſtrength from him, and find him to be a God at hand, a preſent help in the time of trouble and of need. And thou being come to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, which hath been tranſgreſſed, it will keep thee humble; and the humble God will teach his way, which is peace, and ſuch he doth exalt. Now as the principle of God in thee hath been tranſgreſſed, come to it, that it may keep thy mind down low to the Lord God; to deny thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and from thy own will, that is the earthly, thou muſt be kept. Then thou wilt feel the power of God, which will bring nature into its courſe, and give thee to ſee the glory of the firſt body. There the wiſdom of God will be received (which is Chriſt, by which all things were made and created) and thou be thereby preſerved and ordered to God's glory. There thou wilt come to receive and feel the phyſician of value, who clothes people in their right mind, whereby they may ſerve God and do his will. For all diſtractions, unrulineſs, and confuſion are in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; which tranſgreſſion muſt be brought down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the principle of God, which hath been tranſgreſſed againſt, be lifted up; whereby the mind may be ſeaſoned and ſtilled, and a right underſtanding of the Lord may be received; whereby his bleſſings enter, and are felt over all that is contrary in the power of the Lord, which raiſes up the principle of God within, gives a feeling after God, and in time gives dominion. Keep in the fear of the Lord God; that is the word of the Lord unto thee. For all theſe things happen to thee for thy good, and for the good of thoſe concerned for thee, to make you know yearſelves and your own weakneſs, that ye may know the Lord's ſtrength and power, and may truſt in him. Let the time paſt be ſufficient to every one, who in any thing hath been lifted up in tranſgreſſion out of the power of the Lord; for he can bring down and abaſe the mighty, and lay them in the duſt of the earth. Therefore, all keep low in his fear, that thereby ye may receive the ſecrets of God and his wiſdom, may know the ſhadow of the Almighty, and ſit under it in all tempeſts, ſtorms, and heats. For God is a God at hand, and the Moſt High rules in the

This is the word of the Lord God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all; what the light doth make manifeſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, as temptations, diſtractions, confuſions; do not look at theſe temptations, confuſions, corruptions, but at the light which diſcovers them and makes them manifeſt; and with the ſame light you may feel over them, to receive power to ſtand againſt them. The ſame light which lets you ſee ſin and tranſgreſſion, will let you ſee the covenant of God, which blots out your ſin and tranſgreſſion, which gives victory and dominion over it, and brings into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. For looking down at ſin, corruption, and diſtraction, ye are ſwallowed up in it; but looking at the light, which diſcovers them, ye will ſee over them. That will give victory, and ye will find grace and ſtrength; there is the firſt ſtep to peace.

To the light of Chriſt Jeſus in your conſciences. do I ſpeak, which teſtifieth for God every day, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth againſt all ſin and perſecution; which meaſure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a day, but leads to the faſt the Lord requires, which is <q>to looſe, the bonds of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, to break every yoke, and to let the oppreſſed go free,</q> Iſa. lviii. 6, 7. This is the faſt that the Lord requires, and this ſtands not in the tranſmiſſion of times, nor in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men. But this ſtands in that which was before times were, and which leads out of time, and ſhall be when time ſhall be no more. Theſe that teach for doctrine the commandments of men, are they that ever perſecuted the life and power, when it came. And whereas ye mention a decree or edict that was made againſt the ſaid perſecuted proteſtants, all ſuch decrees or edicts proceeded from the ground of the pope's religion and ſupremacy, and therein ſtands his tyranny and his cruelty, acted in that will which is in that nature which exerciſeth lordſhip over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ye may read, Mark x. 42. Luke xxii. 25. as all the heathen do, and ever did; and in the heatheniſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is all the tyranny and perſecution exerciſed by them that are out of the obedience to the light of Chriſt Jeſus in the conſcience, which is the guide and leader of all,
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:037441_0448_100D90E3A6C33F90"/>who are tender of that of God in the conſcience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to ſuffer for conſcience ſake. Now, whereas ye take into your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the ſad perſecution, tyranny, and cruelty exerciſed upon them whom ye call your proteſtant brethren, and contribute and adminiſter to their wants outwardly; this is good in its place, and we own it; and ſee it good to adminiſter to the neceſſities of others, and to do good to all; and we, who are ſufferers by a law derived from the pope, are willing to join and to contribute with you to their outward neceſſities. For <q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof;</q> who is good to all, gracious to all, and willing that all ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth. But in the mean time, while ye are doing this, and taking notice of others cruelty, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and perſecution, turn your eye upon yourſelves, and ſee what ye are doing at home. To the light of Chriſt Jeſus in all your conſciences I ſpeak, which cannot lie, nor err, nor bear falſe witneſs; but doth bear witneſs for God, and cries for equity, juſtice, and righteouſneſs to be executed. See what ye are doing who profeſs the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were given forth by the ſaints in light, who dwelt in the light and in the life of them. For theſe who now witneſs the ſame light, the ſame life, and the ſame power which gave forth the ſcriptures, which ye in words profeſs, them ye perſecute, them ye hale out of your ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues and markets; them ye beat, ſtock and impriſon. Let that of God in your conſciences, which is juſt, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, and equal, examine and try whether ye have any example or precedent to exerciſe this perſecution, which many now in this nation ſuffer under, who are a people harmleſs and innocent, waiting in obedience towards God and man. And though ye account the way of truth they walk in hereſy, yet therein do they exerciſe themſelves, to have always a <q>conſcience void of offence towards God and man;</q> as ye may read the ſaints of old did, Acts xxiv. 14, 15, 16. not wronging any man, neither giving any juſt cauſe of offence, only being obedient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Lord, to declare as they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt: and ſtanding for the teſtimony of a good conſcience, ſpeaking the truth in Chriſt, their conſciences bearing them witneſs that they lie not: for this do they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under you, who in words profeſs the ſame thing for which they ſuffer. Now ſee if any age or generation did
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:037441_0449_100D90E6BAFF8FB8"/>ever perſecute as ye do? For ye profeſs Chriſt Jeſus who reveals the Father, and perſecute thoſe who witneſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Father by Chriſt Jeſus unto them. Ye profeſs Chriſt Jeſus, who is the light of the world, <q>that enlightens every one that cometh into the world;</q> yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them that bear witneſs and give teſtimony to this light. Ye profeſs that the word is become fleſh, yet perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them that witneſs it ſo. Ye profeſs that whoſoever confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is an antichriſt, yet perſecute them that do confeſs him come in the fleſh, and call them antichriſts and deceivers. Ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the kingdom of Chriſt is come, yet perſecute them that witneſs it come. Ye profeſs Chriſt Jeſus the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the life, yet perſecute them that witneſs him to be ſo. If ye ſay, <q>How ſhall we know that theſe people, who ſay they witneſs theſe things, do ſo or no?</q> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Turn your minds to the light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the light, ye ſhall have the light of life; then ye will know and ſee what ye have done, who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Lord of Glory (in his people) in whom is life, and the life is the light of men. To no other touchſtone ſhall we turn you, but into your own conſciences; there may ye find the truth of what we have declared unto you, according to the holy ſcriptures. When the books of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are opened, and all judged out of them, then ſhall ye witneſs us to be of God, and our teſtimony to be true. Though now ye may ſtop your ears, and harden your hearts, while it is called to-day, then ye ſhall know what ye have done, and whom ye have tranſgreſſed againſt; then ye will ſee that no perſecutors, in any age or genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before you, did ever tranſgreſs againſt that light and meaſure of God made manifeſt in ſuch manner as ye have done. For though Chriſt and the apoſtles were perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their time, the Jews for the moſt part did not know that he was the Chriſt when he came, notwithſtanding they had the ſcriptures which propheſied of him, neither did they believe that he was riſen again when the apoſtles preached his reſurrection. But ye ſay, <q>Ye believe he is come, ye believe his reſurrection;</q> yet ye perſecute thoſe that witneſs him come in the fleſh, thoſe that are buried with him in baptiſm, thoſe that are conformable to his death, and know the power of his reſurrection: thoſe ye perſecute, hale before magiſtrates, and ſuffer to be beaten
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:037441_0450_100D90E8ADE78A88"/>in your ſynagogues; thoſe ye cauſe to be whipped and ſtocked, ſhamefully entreated, caſt into priſon, and kept, as many gaols in this nation at this day teſtify to your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Therefore honeſtly conſider what ye are doing while ye are taking notice of others cruelties, leſt ye overlook your own. There is ſome difference in many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the popiſh religion and that which ye call the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but in this perſecution of yours there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for ye will confeſs that the foundation of your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is grounded upon the ſcriptures, yet ye perſecute them that are in the ſame life which they were in who gave forth the ſcriptures, yourſelves being the meanwhile under a profeſſion of the words they ſpoke: this ye ſhall one day witneſs. So ye have a profeſſion and form, and perſecute them that are in the poſſeſſion, life, and power. Know aſſuredly that ye muſt come to judgment; for he is made manifeſt to whom all judgment is committed. To the light of Chriſt Jeſus in your conſciences, which ſearcheth and trieth you, turn your minds; ſtand ſtill, and wait there to receive the righteous law, which is according to that of God in the conſcience, which is now riſing and bearing witneſs againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men; and they whom ye perſecute are manifeſt to God, and that of God in all conſciences ſhall bear witneſs for us that we are of God; this ye ſhall one day witneſs, whether ye will hear or forbear. Our rejoicing is in the teſtimony of our conſciences, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity (not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God) we have had our converſation in the world, not handling the word of God deceitfully, but in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the truth, commending ourſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God; and if our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt. For witneſſing the holding the myſtery of faith in a pure conſcience do we ſuffer, and are ſubject for conſcience ſake. This is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, if a man, for conſcience ſake, endure griefs and ſufferings wrongfully. In this is our joy and rejoicing, having a good conſcience, that whereas we are evil ſpoken of as evil-doers, they may be aſhamed that falſely accuſe our good converſation in Chriſt; which is not only the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. This we witneſs made manifeſt (eternal praiſes to the living God!) and bear teſtimony to that which
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:037441_0451_100D90EA42BED1E0"/>ſpoke it in the apoſtle in life and power. Therefore do we bear witneſs and teſtify againſt thoſe, who being got into a form and profeſſion of it, do perſecute the life and power. To the eternal light of Chriſt Jeſus, the ſearcher and trier of all hearts, turn your minds, and ſee what ye are doing; leſt ye overturn your foundation, whereon ye pretend to ſtand, while ye are profeſſing the ſcriptures, and perſecuting the life, light, and power which thoſe were in who gave them forth. For the ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands is now ſtriking at the feet of the image, the profeſſion which is ſet up, and ſtands in the will of man. Now is that made manifeſt, unto which all muſt anſwer, and appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perſuade men; but we are made manifeſt unto God, and ſhall be made manifeſt in all your conſciences, which ye ſhall witneſs.</p>

                  <p>Divers times, both in the time of the long parliament, and of the protector (ſo called) and of the committee of ſafety, when they proclaimed faſts, I was moved to write to them, and tell them, their faſts, were like unto Jezebel's: for commonly, when they proclaimed faſts, there was ſome miſchief contrived againſt us. I knew their faſts were for ſtrife and debate, to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs; as the New-England profeſſors ſoon after did; who, before they put our friends to death, proclaimed a faſt alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now it was a time of great ſuffering; and many friends being in priſons, many other friends were moved to go to the parliament, to offer themſelves up to lie in the ſame priſons where their friends lay, that thoſe in priſon might go forth, and not periſh in the ſtinking gaols. This we did in love to God and our brethren, that they might not die in priſon; and in love to thoſe that caſt them in, that they might not bring innocent blood upon their own heads; which we knew would cry to the Lord, and bring his wrath, vengeance, and plagues upon them. But little favour could we find from thoſe profeſſing parliaments; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, they would rage, and ſometimes threaten friends that attended them, to whip, and ſend them home. Then commonly ſoon after the Lord would turn them out,
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:037441_0452_100D90EBD3D604A8"/>and ſend them home; who had not an heart to do good in the day of their power. But they went not off without being forewarned; for I was moved to write to them, in their ſeveral turns, as I did to the long-parliament, unto whom I declared, before they were broken up, <q>that thick darkneſs was coming over them all, even a day of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſhould be felt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe the parliament that now ſat was made up moſtly of high profeſſors, who, pretending to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious than others, were indeed greater perſecutors of thoſe that were truly religious, I was moved to ſend them the following lines, as a reproof of their hypocriſy:</p>

                        <p>O FRIENDS, do not cloak and cover yourſelves: there is a God that knoweth your hearts, and that will uncover you. He ſeeth your way. <q>Wo be to him that covereth, but not with my Spirit, ſaith the Lord.</q> Do ye act contrary to the law, and then put it from you! Mercy and true judgment ye neglect. Look, what was ſpoken againſt ſuch. My Saviour ſpoke againſt ſuch; <q>I was ſick, and ye viſited me not: I was hungry, and ye fed me not: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in: I was in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</q> But they ſaid, <q>When ſaw we thee in priſon, and did not come to thee? Inaſmuch as ye did it not unto one of theſe little ones, ye did it not unto me.</q> Friends, ye impriſon them that are in the life and power of truth, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be the miniſters of Chriſt; but if Chriſt had ſens you, ye would bring out of priſon, out of bondage, and receive ſtrangers.

                  <p>After this, as I was going out of town, having two friends with me, when we were little more than a mile out of the City, there met us two troopers belonging to colonel Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's regiment, who took me, and the friends with me, and brought us back to the Mews, and there kept us priſoners a little while; but the Lord's power was ſo over them, that they did not bring us before any officer; but after awhile ſet us at liberty. The ſame day, taking boat, I went to Kingſton, and from thence to Hampton Court, to ſpeak
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:037441_0453_100D90EEB63C56A0"/>with the Protector about the ſufferings of friends. I met him riding into Hampton Court Park; and before I came to him, as he rode at the head of his life-guard, I ſaw and felt a waft (or apparition) of death go forth againſt him; and when I came to him, he looked like a dead man. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had laid the ſufferings of friends before him, and had warned him, as I was moved to ſpeak to him, he bid me come to his houſe. So I returned to Kingſton, and the next day went to Hampton Court, to have ſpoken further with him. But when I came, he was ſick, and—Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, who waited on him, told me, The doctors were not willing I ſhould ſpeak with him. So I paſſed away, and never ſaw him more.</p>
                  <p>From Kingſton I went to Iſaac Penington's, in Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamſhire, where I had appointed a meeting; and the Lord's truth and power were preciouſly manifeſted amongſt us. After I had viſited friends in thoſe parts, I returned to London; and ſoon after went into Eſſex; where I had not been long, before I heard the Protector was dead, and his ſon Richard made Protector in his room. Whereupon I came to London again.</p>
                  <p>Before this time the church faith (ſo called) was given forth, which was ſaid to be made at the Savoy in eleven days. I got a copy of it before it was publiſhed, and wrote an anſwer to it: and when their book of church faith was ſold up and down the ſtreets, my anſwer to it was ſold alſo. This diſpleaſed ſome of the parliament-men; ſo that one of them told me, 'They muſt have me to Smithfield.' I told him, I was over their fires, and feared them not. Reaſoning with him, I wiſhed him to conſider, Had all people been without a faith theſe ſixteen hundred years, that now the prieſts muſt make them one? Did not the apoſtle ſay that Jeſus was the author and finiſher of their faith? And ſince Chriſt Jeſus was the author of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles faith, of the church's faith in the primitive times, and of the martyrs faith, ſhould not all people look unto him to be the author and finiſher of their faith, and not to the prieſts? A great deal of work we had about the prieſts made-faith; for they called us houſe-creepers, leading ſilly women captive, becauſe we met in houſes, and would not hold up their prieſts and temples which they had made and ſet up. I told them, it was they that led ſilly women cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and crept into houſes, who kept people always learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under them, who were covetous, and had got a form
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:037441_0454_100D90F0A5641138"/>of godlineſs, but denied the power and Spirit, which the apoſtles were in. Such began to creep in the apoſtles days; but now they had got the magiſtrates on their ſide, who upheld thoſe houſes for them, which they had crept into, their temples, with their tithes: whereas the apoſtles brought people off from even that temple, and thoſe tithes and offerings, which God had for a time commanded. And the apoſtles met in ſeveral private houſes, being to preach the goſpel in all nations; which they did freely, as Chriſt commanded them. Thus do we, who bring people off from theſe prieſts, temples, and tithes (which God never commanded) to meet in houſes, or on mountains, as the ſaints of old did, who were gathered in the name of Jeſus; and Chriſt was their Prophet, Prieſt and Shepherd.</p>
                  <p>Major Wiggan, a very envious man, was preſent, yet he bridled himſelf before the parliament-men, and ſome others that were there in company. He took upon him to aſſert, <q>Chriſt had taken away the guilt of ſin, but had left the power of ſin remaining in us.</q>I told him, that was ſtrange doctrine; for Chriſt came to deſtroy the devil's works, and the power of ſin, and ſo to cleanſe men from ſin. So major Wiggan's mouth was ſtopped at that time. But next day deſiring to ſpeak with me again, I took a friend or two with me, and went to him. Then he vented a great deal of paſſion and rage, beyond the bounds of a chriſtian, or moral man; whereupon I was made to reprove him; and having brought the Lord's power over him, and let him ſee what condition he was in, left him.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time I paſſed out of London, and had a meeting at ſergeant Birkhead's at Twickenham, to which many people came; ſome of conſiderable quality. A glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meeting it was, wherein the ſcriptures were largely and clearly opened, and Chriſt exalted above all, to the great ſatisaction of the hearers.</p>
                  <p>But there was great perſecution in many places, both by impriſoning and breaking up of meetings. At a meeting about ſeven miles from London, the rude people uſually came out of ſeveral pariſhes round about, to abuſe friends, and often beat and bruiſed them exceedingly. One day they abuſed about eighty friends, that went to that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of London, tearing their coats and cloaks from off their backs, throwing them into ditches and ponds; and, when they had beſmeared them with dirt, they ſaid they looked like witches. The next firſt-day I was moved of
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:037441_0455_100D90F2344BB5E8"/>the Lord to go to that meeting, though I was then very weak. When I came there, I bid friends bring a table, and ſet it in the cloſe, where they uſed to meet, to ſtand upon. According to their wonted courſe, the rude people came; and I, having a bible in my hand, ſhewed them theirs and their teachers fruits; and the people became aſhamed, and were quiet. I opened the ſcriptures to them, and our principles agreeing therewith; and turned them from darkneſs to the light of Chriſt and his Spirit, by which they might underſtand the ſcriptures, ſee themſelves and their ſins, and know Chriſt Jeſus to be their Saviour. So the meeting ended quietly, and the Lord's power came over all, to his glory. But it was a time of great ſufferings; for beſides impriſonments (through which many died) our meetings were greatly diſturbed. They have thrown rotten eggs and wild-fire into our meetings, and brought in drums beating, and kettles, to make noiſes with, that the truth might not be heard; and, among theſe, the prieſts were as rude as any; as may be ſeen in the book of the fighting prieſts, wherein a liſt is given of ſome prieſts that had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beaten and abuſed friends.</p>
                  <p>Many friends were brought priſoners to London, to be tried before the Committee; where Henry Vane, being chairman, would not ſuffer friends to come in, except they would put off their hats; but at laſt the Lord's power came over him, ſo that through the mediation of others, they were admitted. Many of us having been impriſoned upon contempts (as they called them) for not putting off our hats, it was not a likely thing that friends, who had ſuffered ſo long for it from others, ſhould put off their hats to him. But the Lord's power came over all, and wrought ſo, that ſeveral were ſet at liberty by them. Inaſmuch as ſufferings grew very ſharp, I was moved of the Lord to write a few lines, and ſend among friends, to encourage them to go on faithfully and boldly through the exerciſes of the day; of which a copy here follows:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>MY dear friends every where, in priſon or out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Fear not, becauſe of the reports of ſufferings; let not the evil ſpies of the good land make you afraid, if they tell you the walls are high, and Anakims are in the land; for at the blowing of the rams horns did the walls of Jericho fall, and they that brought the evil report periſhed in the wilderneſs. Dwell in faith, patience, and

In that triumph, when ſufferings come, whatever they be. Your faith, your ſhield, your helmet, your armour you have on. You are ready to ſkip over a mountain, a wall, or an hill, and to walk through the deep waters, though they be as heaps upon heaps.

                  <p>After awhile I went to Reading, where I remained under great ſufferings and exerciſes, and in great travail of ſpirit for about ten weeks. For I ſaw there was great confuſion and diſtraction amongſt the people, and that the powers were plucking each other to pieces. And I ſaw how many were deſtroying the ſimplicity, and betraying the truth. A great deal of hypocriſy, deceit, and ſtrife, was got upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the people, ſo that they were ready to ſheath their ſwords in one another's bowels. There had been tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in many of them formerly, when they were low; but when they were got up, had killed, and taken poſſeſſion, they came to be as bad as others: ſo that we had much to do with them about our hats, and ſaying Thou and Thee to them. They turned their profeſſion of patience and moderation into rage and madneſs; many of them were like diſtracted men for this hat-honour. For they had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened themſelves by perſecuting the innocent, and were at this time crucifying the Seed, Chriſt, both in themſelves and others; till at laſt they fell a biting and devouring one another, until they were conſumed one of another; who had turned againſt and judged that which God had wrought in them, and ſhewed unto them. So ſhortly after God overthrew them, turned them upſide down, and brought the king over them, who were often ſurmiſing that the Quakers met together to bring in king Charles, whereas friends did not concern themſelves with the outward powers or government. But at laſt the Lord brought him in, and many of them, when they ſaw he would be brought in, voted for the bringing him in. So with heart and voice praiſe the name of the Lord, to whom it doth belong; who
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:037441_0457_100D90F62EC1CD88"/>over all hath the ſupremacy, and who will rock the nations, for he is over them. I had a ſight and ſenſe of the king's return a good while before, and ſo had ſome others. I wrote to Oliver ſeveral times, and let him know, that while he was perſecuting God's people, they whom he accounted his enemies were preparing to come upon him. When ſome forward ſpirits, that came amongſt us, would have bought Somerſet-houſe, that we might have meetings in it, I forbad them to do ſo: for I then foreſaw the king's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in again. Beſides, there came a woman to me in the Strand, who had a prophecy concerning king Charles's coming in, three years before he came; and ſhe told me, ſhe muſt go to him to declare it. I adviſed her to wait upon the Lord, and keep it to herſelf; for if it ſhould be known that ſhe went on ſuch a meſſage, they would look upon it to be treaſon; but ſhe ſaid, ſhe muſt go and tell him, that he ſhould be brought into England again. I ſaw her prophecy was true, and that a great ſtroke muſt come upon thoſe in power: for they that had then got poſſeſſion were ſo exceeding high, and ſuch great perſecution was acted by them who called themſelves ſaints, that they would take from friends their copyhold lands, becauſe they could not ſwear in their courts. Sometimes, when we laid theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings before Oliver Cromwel, he would not believe it. Wherefore Thomas Aldam and Anthony Pearſon were moved to go through all the gaols in England, and to get copies of friends commitments under the gaolers hands, that they might lay the weight of their ſufferings upon Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwel. And when he refuſed to give order for the releaſing of them, Thomas Aldam was <q>moved to take his cap off his head, and rend it in pieces before him, and to ſay unto him, <q>So ſhall thy government be rent from thee and thy houſe.</q> Another friend alſo, a woman, was moved to go to the parliament (that was envious againſt friends) with a pitcher in her hand, which ſhe broke into pieces before them,</q> and told them, <q>So ſhould they be broken to pieces:</q> which came to paſs ſhortly after. And in my great ſuffering, and travail of ſpirit for the nation, being grievouſly burdened with their hypocriſy, treachery, and falſehood, I ſaw God would bring that atop of them which they had been atop of; and that all muſt be brought down to that which convinced them, before they could get over that bad ſpirit within and without: for it is the pure,
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:037441_0458_100D90F825779938"/>inviſible Spirit, that doth and only can work down all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in people.</p>
                  <p>While I was under that ſore travail at Reading, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of grief and ſorrow of mind, and the great exerciſe that was upon my ſpirit, my countenance being altered, and my body become poor and thin; there came a company of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits to me, and told me, <q>The plagues of God were upon me.</q> I told them, It was the ſame ſpirit ſpoke in them that ſaid ſo of Chriſt, when he was ſtricken and ſmitten; they hid their face from him. But when I had travailed with the witneſs of God, which they had quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had got through with it, over all that hypocriſy which the outſide profeſſors were run into, and ſaw how that would be brought down, and turned under, and that life would riſe over it, I came to have eaſe; and the light, power, and ſpirit, ſhined over all. And then, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. my body and face ſwelled, when I came abroad into the air; then the bad ſpirits ſaid, 'I was grown fat;' and they envied at that alſo. So I ſaw that no condition nor ſtate would pleaſe that ſpirit of theirs: but the Lord preſerved me by his power and Spirit through and over all; and in the Lord's power I came to London again.</p>
                  <p>Now was there a great buſtle about the effigy of Oliver Cromwel lying in ſtate; men ſtanding and ſounding with trumpets over his image, after he was dead. At this my ſpirit was greatly grieved, and the Lord, I found, was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended. Then did I write the following lines, and ſent among them, to reprove their wickedneſs, and warn them to repent.</p>

                  <p>About this time great ſtirs were in the nation, the minds of people being unſettled. Much plotting and contriving there was by the ſeveral factions, to carry on their ſeveral intereſts. And a great care being upon me, leſt any young or raw people, that might ſometimes come amongſt us, ſhould be drawn into that ſnare, I was moved to give forth the following epiſtle, as a warning to ſuch:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>ALL friends every where, keep out of plots and buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling, and the arm of fleſh; for all theſe are amongſt Adam's ſons in the fall, where they are deſtroying men's lives like dogs, beaſts, and ſwine, goring, rending, and biting one another, deſtroying one another, and wreſtling with fleſh and blood. From whence ariſe wars and killing, but from the luſts? Now all this is in Adam in the fall, out of Adam that never fell, in whom there is peace and life. Ye are called to peace, therefore follow it; that peace is in Chriſt, not in Adam in the fall. All that pretend to fight for Chriſt, are deceived; for his kingdom is not of this world, therefore his ſervants do not fight. Fighters are not of Chriſt's kingdom, but are without Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: for his kingdom ſtands in peace and righteouſneſs, but fighters are in the luſt: and all that would deſtroy men's lives are not of Chriſt's mind, who came to ſave men's lives. Chriſt's kingdom is not of this world; it is peaceable: and all that are in ſtrife, are not of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All that pretend to fight for the goſpel, are deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for the goſpel is the power of God, which was before the devil, or fall of man was: and the goſpel of peace was before fighting was. Therefore they that pretend fighting, and talk of ſighting ſo, are ignorant of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. All that talk of fighting for Sion, are in darkneſs: Sion needs no ſuch helpers. All ſuch as profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves miniſters of Chriſt, or chriſtians, and go about to beat down the whore with outward, carnal weapons, the fleſh and the where are got up in themſelves, and they are in a blind zeal: for the whore got up by the inward ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening from the Spirit of God; and the beating down of the whore muſt be by the inward ſtroke of the ſword of the Spirit within. All ſuch as pretend Chriſt Jeſus, and confeſs him, yet run into the uſe of carnal weapons, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:037441_0460_100D90FBABE51750"/>with fleſh and blood, throw away the ſpiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. They that would be wreſtlers with fleſh and blood, throw away Chriſt's doctrine; the fleſh is got upon them, and they are weary of their ſufferings. Such as would revenge themſelves, are out of Chriſt's doctrine. Such as being ſtricken on one cheek, would not turn the other, are out of Chriſt's doctrine. Such as do not love one another, nor love enemies, are out of Chriſt's doctrine. Therefore ye, that are heirs of the bleſſings of God, which were before the curſe and the fall was, come to inherit your portions: and ye that are heirs of the goſpel of peace, which was before the devil was, live in the goſpel of peace, ſeeking the peace and good of all men: and live in Chriſt, who came to ſave men's lives, out of Adam in the fall, where they deſtroy men's lives, and live not in Chriſt. The Jews ſword outwardly, by which they cut down the heathen, was a type of the Spirit of God within, which cuts down the heatheniſh nature within. So live in the peaceable kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus. Live in the peace of God, and not in the luſts, from whence wars ariſe. Live in Chriſt, the prince of peace, the way of God, the ſecond Adam that never fell. Live not in Adam in the fall, in the deſtruction, where they deſtroy one another. Come out of Adam in the fall, into the ſecond Adam that never fell. Live in love and peace with all men; keep out of all the buſtlings in the world; meddle not with the powers of the earth; but mind the kingdom, the way of peace. Ye that are heirs of grace, heirs of the kingdom, heirs of the goſpel, heirs of ſalvation, ſaints of the Moſt High, and children of God, whoſe converſation is in heaven, that is above the combuſtions of the earth; let your converſation preach to all men, and your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent lives, that thoſe who ſpeak evil of you, beholding your godly converſation, may glorify your Father which is in heaven. Friends every where, this I charge you, which is the word of the Lord God unto you all, <q>Live in peace, in Chriſt the way of peace;</q> therein ſeek the peace of all men, and no man's hurt. In Adam in the ſall is no peace; but in Adam out of the fall is the peace: So ye being in Adam which never fell, it is love that overcomes, not hatred with hatred, nor ſtrife with ſtrife. Therefore live all in the peaceable life, doing good to all men, and ſeeking the good and welfare of all men.</p>

Not long after this, George Booth roſe in arms in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Lambert went againſt him. At which time ſome fooliſh raſh ſpirits, that came ſometimes amongſt us, were ready to have taken up arms; but I was moved of the Lord to warn and forbid them, and they were quiet. In the time of the committee of ſafety (ſo called) we were invited by them to take up arms, and great places and commands were offered ſome of us; but we denied them all, and declared againſt it both by word and writing; teſtifying, that our weapons and armour were not carnal, but ſpiritual. And leſt any that came amongſt us, ſhould be drawn into that ſnare, it came upon me from the Lord to write a few lines on that occaſion, and ſend them forth, as a caution to all amongſt us. Of which this is a copy:</p>

                        <p>ALL friends every where, take heed to keep out of the powers of the earth, that run into wars and fightings, which make not for peace, but go from that; ſuch will not have the kingdom. And friends, take heed of joining with this or the other, or meddling with any, or being buſy with other men's matters; but mind the Lord, his power, and his ſervice. Let friends keep out of other men's matters, and keep in that which anſwers the witneſs in them all, out of the man's matters part, where they muſt expect wars, and the diſhonour. Friends every where, dwell in your own, in the power of the Lord, to keep your minds up to God, from falling down to the ſtrength of Egypt, or going thither for ſtrength, after ye are come out of it, like the children of Iſrael, after they were come out of outward Egypt. But dwell in the power of the Lord God, that ye may keep over all the powers of the earth, amongſt whom the juſt hand of God is come: for they have turned againſt the juſt, and diſobeyed the juſt in their own particulars, and ſo gone on in one againſt the juſt; therefore the juſt ſets them one againſt another. Now he that goes to help among them, is from the juſt in himſelf, in the mad and unſtayed ſtate, and doth not know by the All-ſeeing eye (that beholdeth) him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſeth and rewardeth, and lives not in the hand, in the power that mangles and overturns, which vexeth the tranſgreſſors, that come to be blind and zealous for they do not know what.

Therefore ſtand in that (it is the word of the Lord God to you all) in the fear and dread of the Lord God, his power, life, light, ſeed and wiſdom, by which ye may take away the occaſion of wars, and ſo know a kingdom which hath no end, and fight for that with ſpiritual weapons, which takes away the occaſion of the carnal: and there gather men to war, as many as ye can, and ſet up as many as ye can with theſe weapons.</p>

                  <p>After I had ſtaid ſome time in London, and had viſited friends meetings there and thereabouts, and the Lord's power was ſet over all, I travelled into the counties again, paſſing through Suffolk, Eſſex, and Norfolk, viſiting friends, till I came to Norwich, where we had a meeting about the time called Chriſtmas. The mayor of Norwich, having got notice beforehand of the meeting I intended to have there, granted a warrant to apprehend me. Wherefore when I was come thither, and heard of the warrant, I ſent ſome friends to the mayer to reaſon with him about it. His anſwer was, the ſoldiers ſhould not meet; and did we think to meet? he would have had us met without the city: for he ſaid, the town's-people were ſo rude, that he could hardly order them, and he feared that our meeting would make tumults in the town. But our friends told him, we were a peaceable people, and that he ought to keep the peace; for we could not but meet to worſhip God, as our manner was. So he became pretty moderate, and did not ſend his officers to the meeting. A large meeting it was, and abundance of rude people came, with intent to have done miſchief: but the Lord's power came over them, ſo that they were chained by it, though ſeveral prieſts were there, and profeſſors, and Ranters. Among the prieſts, one, whoſe name was Townſend, ſtood up and cried, Error, blaſphemy, and an ungodly meeting! I bad him not burden himſelf with that which he could not make good; and I aſked him, what was our error and blaſphemy? for I told him, he ſhould make good his words, before I had done with him, or be ſhamed. As for an ungodly meeting, I ſaid, I did believe there were many people there that feared God, and therefore it was both unchriſtian and uncivil in him, to charge civil godly people with an ungodly meeting. He ſaid,
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:037441_0463_100D910200865A88"/>My error and blaſphemy was, in that I ſaid, people muſt wait on God by his power and Spirit, and feel his preſence, when they did not ſpeak words: I aſked him then, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the apoſtles and holy men of God did not hear God ſpeak to them in their ſilence, before they ſpake forth the Scripture, and before it was written? He replied, Yes: David and the prophets did hear God, before they did pen the ſcriptures, and felt his preſence in ſilence, before they ſpake them forth. Then ſaid I, All people take notice, he ſaid this was error and blaſphemy in me to ſay theſe words; and now he hath confeſſed it is not more than the holy men of God in former times witneſſed. So I ſhewed the people, that as the holy men of God, who gave forth the Scriptures, were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, did hear and learn of God, before they ſpake them forth, ſo muſt they all heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and hear what the Spirit ſaith, which will lead them into all truth, that they may know God and Chriſt, and may underſtand the Scriptures. O, ſaid the prieſt, this is not that George Fox I would ſpeak withal; this is a ſubtil man, ſaid he. So the Lord's power came over all, the rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were moderate, and were reached by it; and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors called to the prieſts, ſaying, <q>Prove the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and errors, which ye have charged them with: ye have ſpoken much againſt them behind their backs, but nothing ye can prove now to their faces.</q> But the prieſt began to get away: whereupon I told him, we had many things to charge him withal, therefore let him ſet a time and place to anſwer them; which he did and went his way. A glorious day this was: for truth came over all, and people were turned to God by his power and Spirit, and to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their free teacher, who was exalted over all. And as we paſſed away, generally people's hearts were filled with love towards us; yea, the ruder ſort of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired another meeting: for the evil intentions they had againſt us were thrown out of their hearts. At night I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of town to a friend's houſe, and from thence to colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Dennis's, where we had a great meeting: and afterwards travelled on, viſiting friends up and down in Norfolk, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingtonſhire, and Cambridgeſhire. But George Whitehead, and Richard Hubberthorn ſtaid about Norwich, to meet the prieſt, who was ſoon confounded and down, the Lord's power came ſo over him.</p>
                  <p>After I had travelled through many counties in the Lord's ſervice, and many were convinced, notwithſtanding
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:037441_0464_100D9103D172B0A8"/>that in ſome places the people were very rude, I returned to London again, when general Monk was come up thither, and the gates and poſts of the city were pulling down. <q>Long before this I had a viſion, wherein I ſaw the city lie in heaps, and the gates down; and it was then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me, juſt as I ſaw it ſeveral years after, lying in heaps when it was burned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Divers times had I, both by word and writing, forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeveral powers, both in Oliver's time and after, of the day of recompenſe that was coming upon them: but they rejecting counſel, and ſlighting thoſe viſitations of love to them, I was moved now, before they were quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; to lay their backſliding, hypocriſy, and treacherous dealing before them, thus:</p>

                        <p>FRIENDS, Now are the prophecies fulfilled and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling upon you, which have been ſpoken to you by the people of God in your courts, in your ſteeple-houſes, in your towns, cities, markets, highways, and at your feaſts, when ye were in your pleaſures, and puffed up, that ye would neither hear God nor man; when ye were in your height of authority, though raiſed up from a mean ſtate, none might come nigh you without bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the reſpect of perſons, for ye were in the world's way, compliments and faſhions, which for conſcience ſake towards God, they could not go into, being redeemed therefrom: therefore they were hated by you for that cauſe. But how are ye brought low, who exalted yourſelves above your brethren, and threw the juſt and harmleſs from among you, until at laſt God hath thrown you out: and when ye caſt the innocent from amongſt you, then ye fell a biting one another, until ye were conſumed one of another. And ſo the day is come upon you, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was told to you, though ye would not believe it. And are not your hearts ſo hardened, that ye will hardly yet believe, though ready to go into captivity? was it not told you, when ye ſpilt the blood of the innocent in your ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſes, in your markets, in your highways and cities, yea, and even in your courts alſo, becauſe they ſaid the word Thou to you, and could not put off their hats to you, <q>That if ſomething did not riſe up amongſt yourſelves, to avenge the blood of the innocent, there would come ſomething from beyond the ſeas, which lay reſerved there; which being brought by the arin of God, the arm of fleſh
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:037441_0465_100D9106914E38B8"/>and ſtrongeſt mountain cannot withſtand?</q> Yet ye would not conſider, nor regard, nor hear; but cried, peace, peace, and feaſted yourſelves, and ſat down in the ſpoil of your enemies, being treacherous both to God and man; and who will truſt you now? have ye not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken covenants and oaths? and broken covenants and oaths betwixt God and man, and made the nations breakers both of covenants and oaths; ſo that nothing but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and rottenneſs, and falſehood under fair pretence, was amongſt you? When ye pretended to ſet up the old cauſe, it was but yourſelves; for which ye long ſtunk to ſober people, who ſaw that ye would do no good. But it was a joy for any of you to get up into authority, that ye might have praiſe, and honour, and reſpect; and they that were in the ſelf-denial were a deriſion to you; from amongſt whom that was baniſhed. Thus ye became the nations maſters, and not ſervants; whereas the greateſt of all ſhould be the ſervants of all. But there ye loſt your authority, not conſidering your eſtates, from whence ye were, and to what end God had raiſed you up; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Lord, and quenched that which was good in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and perſecuted them that lived in it: and ſo are grown ſo groſs and perverſe, that at laſt ye are fit for neither God nor man.

Was not there a book of examples ſet out unto you, of what ſudden and ſtrange deaths happened upon the perſecutors of the innocent? and yet ye would not take warning, until the overflowing ſcourge is now coming upon you. Are not ye they that have killed like Cain, who have killed about your ſacrifice, and mingled the blood of the innocent with it? Hath not God now vagabonded you, that ye ſhould become a curſe upon the earth, who have perſecuted friends to death? Did not the blood of the righteous cry out of the ground for vengeance? And will not the blood of the righteous be required? Could ye think, that the Lord would ſit always with bloody hands, and fiſts of wickedneſs! Ah! What's become of

                  <p>Being now clear of the city, and finding my ſpirit drawn to viſit friends in the weſtern parts of England, I went out of town; and paſſing firſt into Surry and Suſſex, came to a great town, where there was a large meeting, to which ſeveral frieds from Reading came; and a bleſſed meeting it was. The prieſt of the town was in a great rage, but did not come out of his houſe, wherefore, hearing him make a great noiſe in his houſe, as we were paſſing from the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we bid him come out into the ſtreet, and we would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him; but he would not. So the Lord's power being over all, friends were refreſhed therein. From thence I went to another market-town, where in the evening we had a precious meeting; and the freſh ſenſe of the preſence of the Lord God was ſweetly felt amongſt us. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hampſhire and Dorſetſhire, I went to Ringwood and Pool, viſiting friends in the Lord's power, and had great meetings amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>At Dorcheſter we had a great meeting in the evening at our inn, to which many ſoldiers came, and were pretty civil. But the conſtables and officers of the town came, under pretence to look for a Jeſuit, whoſe head (they ſaid) was ſhaved: and they would have all to put off their hats, or elſe they would take them off, to look for the Jeſuit's ſhaven crown. So they took off my hat (for I was the man they aimed at) and they looked very narrowly; but not finding any bald or ſhaven place on my head, they went away with ſhame; and the ſoldiers, and other ſober people were greatly offended with them. But it was of good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Lord, and all things wrought together for good; for it affected the people: and after the officers were gone, we had a fine meeting; and people were turned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their teacher, who had bought them, and would reconcile them to God.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed into Somerſetſhire, where the preſbyterians and other profeſſors were very wicked, and often diſturbed friends meetings. <q>One time eſpecially (as we were then informed) a very wicked man put a bear's ſkin on his back, and undertook with that to play pranks in the meeting. Accordingly, ſetting himſelf oppoſite to the friend that was ſpeaking, he lolled his tongue out of
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:037441_0467_100D910A10B60F98"/>his mouth, and made ſport to his wicked followers, cauſing great diſturbance in the meeting. But an eminent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment overtook him, and his puniſhment ſlumbered not; for as he went from the meeting there was a bull-baiting in the way, which he ſtayed to ſee; and coming within the bull's reach, he ſtruck h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And the bull's horn running up into the man's head, he ſwung him about upon his horn in a moſt remarkable and fearful manner.

                  <p>We travelled through Somerſetſhire and Devonſhire, till we came to Plymouth, and ſo into Cornwall, viſiting the meetings of friends, to the Land's-end. Many precious and bleſſed meetings we had all along as we went, wherein the convinced were eſtabliſhed, and many others were added to them. At the Land's-end an honeſt fiſherman was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, who became a faithful miniſter of Chriſt. I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him to friends, telling them, 'He was like Peter.'</p>
                  <p>While I was in Cornwall, there were great ſhipwrecks about the Land's-end. It was the cuſtom of that country at ſuch a time, both rich and poor went out to get as much of the wreck as they could, not caring to ſave the people's lives; and in ſome parts of the country they called ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks God's grace. It grieved my ſpirit to hear of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian actions, conſidering how far they were below the heathen at Melita, who received Paul, made him a fire, and were courteous towards him, and thoſe that ſuffered ſhipwreck with him. Wherefore I was moved to write a paper, and ſend it to all the pariſhes, prieſts, and magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, to reprove them for ſuch greedy actions, and to warn and exhort them that, if they could aſſiſt to ſave people's lives and preſerve their ſhips and goods, they ſhould uſe their diligence therein; and conſider, if it had been their own condition, they would judge it hard, if they ſhould be upon a wreck and the people ſhould ſtrive to get what they could from them, and not regard their lives.</p>

                        <p>TAKE heed of greedineſs and covetouſneſs, for that is idolatry; and the idolater muſt not enter into the
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:037441_0468_100D910BCAC20358"/>kingdom of God. Take heed of drunkenneſs, oaths, and curſings, for ſuch are deſtroyers of the creation, and make it to groan. Lay aſide all fighting, quarrelling, brawling, and evil-ſpeaking, which are the works of the fleſh and not of the Spirit, for who follow ſuch things are not like to inherit the kingdom of God. Put away all corrupt words, which are unſavoury, and miſnaming one another, for ye muſt give an account for every idle word. Lay aſide all profeſſion and religion that is vain, and come to the poſſeſſion, the pure religion, which is to viſit the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, the widow, and the ſtranger, and receive them, for ſome thereby may entertain angels or the ſervants of the Lord unawares, as Paul was entertained after the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck at Melita. Do not take people's-goods from them by force out of their ſhips, ſeamen's or others, neither covet after them; but rather endeavour to preſerve their lives and goods for them, for that ſhews a ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and the ſpirit of a chriſtian. But if ye be greedy and covetous after other men's goods, not mattering what becomes of the men, would ye be ſerved ſo yourſelves? If ye ſhould have a ſhip caſt away in other places, and the people ſhould come to tear the goods and ſhip in pieces, not regarding to ſave your lives, but be ready to fight one with another for your goods, do not ye believe ſuch goods would become a curſe to them? May ye not as ſurely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch kind of actions will become a curſe to you? When the ſpoil of one ſhip's goods is idly ſpent and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon the luſts in alehouſes, taverns, and otherwiſe, then ye gape for another. Is this to <q>do as ye would be done by;</q> which is the law and the prophets? Prieſt Hull, are theſe thy fruits? What doſt thou take people's labour and goods for? Haſt thou taught the people no better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and converſation, who are ſo brutiſh and heatheniſh? All ſuch things we judge in whomſoever. But if any friend or others preſerve men's lives, and endeavour to ſave their goods and eſtates, and reſtore what they can ſave of a wreck to the owners, if they conſider them for their labour, doing in that caſe unto them what they would have done to themſelves, that we approve. And if they buy or ſell, and do not make a prey, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of ſtill in the way of <q>doing as ye would be done by,</q> keeping to the law and to the prophets. If you ſhould be wrecked in another country, ye would have other people ſave your lives and goods, and have your
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:037441_0469_100D910E4F864610"/>goods reſtored to you again, and you ought to conſider them for ſo doing. All that do otherwiſe, who wait for a wreck and take the goods for yourſelves, not regarding the lives of the men, but if any eſcape drowning turn them a begging up and down the country, and if any eſcape with a little rob them of it, all that do ſo are not for preſerving the creation, but deſtroying it: and thoſe goods which are ſo got ſhall be a curſe, a plague, and a judgment to them, and the judgments of God will follow them for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things; the witneſs in your conſciences ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. Therefore, all ye who have done ſuch things, "do ſo no more," leſt a worſe thing come unto you. But that which is good, do: preſerve men's lives and eſtates, and labour to reſtore the loſs and breach: that the Lord requires. Be not like a company of greedy dogs, and worſe than heathens, as if ye had never heard of God, nor Chriſt, nor the ſcriptures, nor pure religion. And prieſt Hull, have people ſpent their money upon thee for that which is no bread? for a thing of nought, that thou haſt ſuch fruits? All ſuch teachers, that make a trade of the ſcriptures (which are given forth from the Spirit of God, to be believed, read, and practiſed, and Chriſt, whom they teſtify of, enjoyed) we utterly deny; who own Chriſt, and are come off from your ſteeple-houſes, which were the old maſs-houſes; for there are theſe bad fruits harboured, thoſe are the cages of them. But come to the church which is in God (1 Theſſ. i.) and come all to the light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened you with, which ſhews you all your ungodly words, ungodly thoughts, and ungodly actions. This will be your teacher if ye love it, your condemner if ye hate it. For the mighty day of the Lord is coming upon all wickedneſs and ungodlineſs; therefore lay aſide your whoredoms and fornications. And ye magiſtrates, who are to do juſtice, think ye not that the hand of the Lord is againſt you, and that his judgments will come upon you who do not look after theſe things, and ſtop them with the law, which is, <q>To do unto all men as they would have done unto them,</q> whereby ye might be a good ſavour in your country? Is not the law to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve men's lives and eſtates, <q>Doing unto all men as they would men ſhould do unto them?</q> For all men would have their lives and eſtates preſerved; therefore, ſhould not ye preſerve others, and not ſuffer them to be
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:037441_0470_100D911096D4FC68"/>devoured and deſtroyed? The evil of theſe things will lie upon you, both prieſts and magiſtrates.</p>

                  <p>This paper had good ſervice among people: and friends have endeavoured much to ſave the lives of men in time of wrecks, and to preſerve the ſhips and goods for them. And when ſome, who ſuffered ſhipwreck, have been almoſt-dead and ſtarved, friends have taken them to their houſes to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and recover them, which is an act to be practiſed by all true chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I had many precious, bleſſed, living meetings in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, ſeveral eminent people being convinced in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom neither prieſts nor magiſtrates, by ſpoiling goods or impriſonments, could bring to forſake their ſhepherd, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who bought them; and friends who were turned to Chriſt, their Teacher and Saviour, being ſettled in peace and quietneſs upon him, their Foundation, we left them to the Lord's teaching and ordering, freſh and green. Thomas Lower, who had accompanied me through that county, brought me over Horſe-bridge into Devonſhire again; and after ſeveral meetings in Devonſhire we came to Somerſetſhire, where we had divers large and peaceable meetings, and viſited friends till we came to Briſtol.</p>
                  <p>I entered Briſtol on a ſeventh-day. The day before the ſoldiers came into the meeting, and were exceeding rude, beating and ſtriking friends with their muſkets, and drove them out of the orchard in a great rage, threatening what they would do if they came there again. For the mayor and the commander of the ſoldiers had, if ſeems, combined together to make a diſturbance amongſt us. When friends told me what a rage there was in the town, how they were threatened by the mayor and ſoldiers, and how unruly they
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:037441_0471_100D9112285C7D30"/>had been the day before, I ſent for George Biſhop, Thomas Gouldney, Thomas Speed, and Edward Pyot, and deſired them to go to the mayor and aldermen, and requeſt them, ſeeing they had broke up our meetings, to let us have the town-hall to meet in; and for the uſe of it we would give them twenty pounds a year, to be diſtributed amongſt the poor: and when the mayor and aldermen had buſineſs to do in it, friends would not meet in it, but only on the firſt-days. Thoſe friends were aſtoniſhed at this, and ſaid, The mayor and aldermen would think they were mad. I ſaid, Nay; for they ſhould offer them a conſiderable benefit to the poor. And it was upon me from the Lord to bid them go. At laſt they conſented, and went, though in the croſs to their own wills. When they had laid the thing before the mayor, it came ſo over him, that he ſaid. <q>For his part he could conſent to it, but he was but one.</q> He told them of another great hall they might have, but that they did not accept of, it being inconvenient. So they came away, leaving the mayor in a very loving frame towards them; for they felt the Lord's power had come over him. When they came back, I ſpoke to them to go to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and lay before him the rude carriage of his ſoldiers, how they came armed amongſt naked innocent people, who were waiting upon and worſhipping the Lord; but they were backward to go to him. Next morning, being firſt-day, we went to the meeting in the Orchard, where the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had ſo lately been ſo rude. After I had declared the truth a pretty while in the meeting, there came in many rude ſoldiers and people, ſome with drawn ſwords. The innkeepers had made ſome of them drunk; and one of them had bound himſelf with an oath, <q>to cut down and kill the man that ſpoke.</q> He came preſſing in through the crowd to within two yards of me, and ſtopped at thoſe four friends before-mentioned (who ſhould have gone to the colonel as I would have had them) and fell a jangling with them. On a ſudden I ſaw his ſword was put up and gone; for the Lord's power came over all, and chained him with the reſt. We had a bleſſed meeting, for the Lord's everlaſting power and preſence was felt amongſt us. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe four friends went and ſpoke with the colonel, and he ſent for the ſoldiers, and cut and ſlaſhed ſome of them before the friends faces. Which when I heard of I blamed them for letting him do ſo, and alſo for not going on the ſeventh-day as I would have had them. Which might have
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:037441_0472_100D7F74417BB320"/>prevented this cutting of the ſoldiers, and the trouble they gave at our meeting. Thus the Lord's power came over all thoſe perſecuting, bloody minds, and the meeting was held in peace for a good while after.</p>
                  <p>I had then alſo a general meeting at Edward Pyot's near Briſtol, at which it was judged were ſeveral thouſands of people; for beſides friends from many parts thereabouts, ſome of the Baptiſts and Independents, with their teachers, came to it, and many of the ſober people of Briſtol; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the people who ſtaid behind ſaid, <q>The city looked naked.</q> ſo many were gone out of it to this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It was very quiet, many glorious truths were opened to the people, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ſet up, who is the end of all figures and ſhadows, of the law and the firſt covenant. It was declared to the people, that all figures and ſhadows were given to man after man fell, and that all the rudiments and inventions of men which have been ſet up in Chriſtendom, many of which were Jewiſh and heatheniſh, were not ſet up by the command of Chriſt; and all images and likeneſſes man has made to himſelf or for himſelf, whether of things in heaven or things in earth, have been ſince he loſt the image and likeneſs of God, which God made him in. But now Chriſt is come to redeem, tranſlate, convert, and regenerate man out of all theſe things that he hath ſet up in the fall, out of the true types, figures and ſhadows alſo, and out of death and darkneſs, up into the light, life, and image of God again, which man and woman were in before they fell. Therefore all now ſhould come, and all may come to receive Chriſt Jeſus, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by his light, ſpirit, grace and faith, and ſhould live and walk in him, the Redeemer and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And as we had a great deal of work with prieſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who pleaded for imperfection, I was opened to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and manifeſt to them that Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell, and all that God made he ſaw was good, and he bleſſed it; but the imperfection came in by the fall, through man's and woman's hearkening to the devil who was out of truth. And though the law made nothing perfect, yet it made way for the bringing in of the better hope, which hope is Chriſt, who deſtroys the devil and his works, which made man and woman imperfect. Chriſt ſaith to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <q>Be ye perfect, even as your heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</q> and he, who himſelf was perfect, comes to make man and woman perfect again and brings them again to the
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:037441_0473_100D9116754B8248"/>ſtate which God made them in. So he is the maker up of the breach, and the peace betwixt God and man. That this might the better be underſtood by the loweſt capacities, I uſed a compariſon of two old people who had their houſe broken down by an enemy, ſo that they, with all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were liable to all ſtorms and tempeſts. And there came ſome to them that pretended to be workmen, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to build up their houſe again, if they would give them ſo much a year; but when they had got their money they left their houſe as they found it. After this manner came a ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, and ſixth, each with his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pretence to build up the old houſe, and each got the people's money, and then cried, <q>They could not rear up the houſe, the breach could not be made up; for there is no perfection here.</q> They tell them, the houſe can never be perfectly built up again in this life, though they have taken the people's money for doing it. For all the ſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters in chriſtendom (ſo called) have pretended to build up Adam's and Eve's fallen houſe, and when they have got people's money, tell them the work cannot be perfectly done here; ſo their houſe lies as it did. But I told the people, Chriſt was come to do it freely, who by one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath perfected for ever all them that are ſanctified, and renews them up into the image of God, which man and woman were in before they fell, and makes man's and woman's houſe as perfect again as God made them at the firſt; and this Chriſt, the heavenly Man, doth freely. Therefore all are to look unto him, and all that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him are to walk in him, the Life, the Subſtance, the Firſt, and the Laſt, <q>The Rock of Ages, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Generations.</q> Largely were theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things opened to people, the word of life was preached, which lives and abides, and all were exhorted to hear and obey it, that by it all might be born again of the immortal ſeed, and feed of the milk of the word. A glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meeting there was, wherein the Lord's everlaſting ſeed, Chriſt Jeſus, was ſet over all, and friends parted in the power and Spirit of the Lord, in peace, and in his truth, that is over all.</p>
                  <p>About this time the ſoldiers under general Monk's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand were rude and troubleſome at friends meetings in many places, whereof complaint being made to him, he gave forth the following order, which ſomewhat reſtrained them:</p>

                  <p>After this meeting, I paſſed to Oldeſton, to Nailſworth, and to Nathaniel Criſp's; where was a large meeting, and ſeveral ſoldiers, but quiet. From thence we paſſed to Glouceſter, viſiting meetings. In Glouceſter we had one that was peaceable, though the town was very rude and divided; for one part of the ſoldiers were for the king, and another for the parliament. As I paſſed out of the town over the bridge, Edward Pyot being with me, the ſoldiers there ſaid, 'They were for the king.' After we were paſt them, they were in a great rage that I had eſcaped them, and ſaid, <q>Had they known it they would have ſhot me with hail-ſhot rather than I ſhould have eſcaped.</q> But the Lord prevented their deviliſh deſign, and brought me ſafe to colonel Grimes's, where we had a large general meeting, and the Lord's truth and power was ſet over all; friends were eſtabliſhed upon the Rock, and ſettled under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's teaching.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed from thence to Tewkſbury, and ſo to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, viſiting meetings as we went. And in all my time I never ſaw the like drunkenneſs as then in the towns; for they had been chooſing parliament-men. At Worceſter the Lord's truth was ſet over all, people were finely ſettled therein, and friends praiſed the Lord; nay, I ſaw the very earth rejoiced. Yet great fears and troubles were in many, looking for the king's coming in, and that all things ſhould be altered. They would aſk me what I thought of times and things? I told them the Lord's power was over all, his light ſhined over all, and that fear would take hold only on the hypocrites, ſuch as had not been faithful to God, and on our perſecutors. In my travail and ſufferings at Reading, when people were at a ſtand, and could not tell who might rule, I told them the Lord's power was over all (for I travelled through in it) and his day ſhined whoſoever ſhould come in, and whether the king came in or no, all would be well to them that loved the Lord, and were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:037441_0475_100D9119F363A7A8"/>to him. Therefore I bid all friends fear none but the Lord, and keep in his power that was over all.</p>
                  <p>From Worceſter I viſited friends meetings till I came to Badgely; from thence I went to Drayton, in Leiceſterſhire, to viſit my relations. While I was there, one Burton, a juſtice, hearing I had a good horſe, ſent a warrant to ſearch for me and my horſe; but I was gone before they came, ſo he miſſed of his wicked end. I paſſed to Twycroſs, Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and Derby, where I viſited friends, and found my old gaoler amongſt them, who had formerly kept me in the houſe of correction there, who was now convinced of the truth which I then ſuffered under him for. Paſſing into Derbyſhire and Nottinghamſhire, I came to Synderhill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, viſiting friends meetings; and ſo to Balby in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where our yearly meeting at that time was held, in a great orchard of John Killam's, where it was ſuppoſed ſome thouſands of people and friends were gathered together. In the morning I heard a troop of horſe was ſent from York, about thirty miles off, to break up our meeting, and that the militia newly raiſed was to join them. I went into the meeting, and ſtood up on a great ſtool; and after I had ſpoken ſome time, two trumpeters came, ſounding their trumpets pretty near me, and the captain of the troop cried, 'Divide to the right and left, and make way.' Then they rode up to me. I was declaring the everlaſting truth and word of life, in the mighty power of the Lord. The captain bid me <q>Come down, for he was come to diſperſe our meeting.</q> After ſome time I told him, they all knew we were a peaceable people, and that we uſed to have ſuch great meetings; but if he apprehended we met in an hoſtile way, I deſired him to make ſearch among us, and if he found either ſword or piſtol about any there, let ſuch ſuffer. He told me, <q>He muſt ſee us diſperſed, for he came all night on purpoſe to diſperſe us.</q> I aſked him, What honour it would be to him to ride with ſwords and piſtols amongſt ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="399" facs="unknown:037441_0476_100D911B8813A468"/>himſelf could not ſtay, that he would let a dozen of his ſoldiers ſtay, and ſee the order and peaceableneſs of our meeting. He ſaid, 'He would permit us an hour's time,' and left half a dozen ſoldiers with us. Then he went away with his troop, and friends of the houſe gave the ſoldiers that ſtaid, and their horſes, ſome meat. When the captain was gone, the ſoldiers that were left told us, <q>We might ſtay till night if we would.</q> But we ſtaid but about three hours after, and had a glorious, powerful meeting; for the preſence of the living God was manifeſt amongſt us, and the ſeed, Chriſt, was ſet over all. Friends were built upon him the foundation, and ſettled under his glorious, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaching. After the meeting friends paſſed away in peace, greatly refreſhed with the preſence of the Lord, and filled with joy and gladneſs that the Lord's power had given them ſuch dominion. Many of the militia-ſoldiers ſtaid alſo, much vexed that the captain and troopers had not broke up our meeting, and curſed the captain and his troopers. It was reported they intended evil againſt us that day; but the troopers, inſtead of aſſiſting them, were rather aſſiſtant to us, in not joining them as they expected, but prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from doing the miſchief they deſigned. Yet this captain was a deſperate man; for it was he that ſaid to me in Scotland, <q>He would obey his ſuperior's commands, if it was to crucify Chriſt he would do it, or execute the great Turk's commands againſt the chriſtians if he was under him.</q> So that it was an eminent power of the Lord, which chained both him and his troopers, and thoſe envious militia-ſoldiers alſo, who went away, not having power to hurt any of us, nor to break up our meeting.</p>
                  <p>Next day we had an heavenly meeting at Warmſworth of friends in the miniſtry, with ſeveral others; and then friends parted. As they paſſed through the country ſeveral were taken up; for the day that our firſt meeting was held on, Lambert was routed, and it made great confuſion in the country; but friends were not kept long in priſon at that time. As I went to this meeting there came ſeveral to me at Skegby in Nottinghamſhire, who were going to be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under Lambert, and would have bought my horſe of me; and becauſe I would not ſell him, they were in a great rage againſt me, uſing many threatening words: but I told them, 'God would confound and ſcatter them;' and within two or three days after they were ſcattered indeed.</p>
                  <p>From Warmſworth I paſſed, in the Lord's power, to
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:037441_0477_100D911E07FB26E0"/>Barton-abby, where I had a great meeting; from thence to Thomas Taylor's, and ſo to Skipton, where was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meeting of men friends out of many counties concerning the affairs of the church. <q>A friend went naked through the town, declaring truth, and was much beaten. Some other friends alſo came to me all bloody.</q> As I wakled in the ſtreet, a deſperate fellow had an intent to have done me miſchief; but he was prevented, and our meeting was qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. To this meeting came many friends out of moſt parts of the nation; for it was about buſineſs relating to the church both in this nation and beyond the ſeas. Several years before, when I was in the north, I was moved to recommend to friends the ſetting up of this meeting for that ſervice; for many friends ſuffered in divers parts of the nation, their goods were taken from them contrary to law, and they underſtood not how to help themſelves, or where to ſeek redreſs. But after this meeting was ſet up, ſeveral friends who had been magiſtrates, and others who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſomething of the law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>e thither, and were able to inform friends, and to aſſiſt them in gathering up the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they might be laid before the juſtices, judges, or parliament. This meeting had ſtood ſeveral years, and divers juſtices and captains had come to break it up, but when they underſtood the buſineſs friends met about, and ſaw friends books, and accounts of collections for relief of the poor, how we took care one county to help another, and to help our friends beyond ſea, and provide for our poor that none of them ſhould be chargeable to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, &amp;c. the juſtlices and officers confeſſed that we did their work, and would paſs away peaceably and lovingly, 'commending friends practice.' Sometimes there would come two hundred of the poor of other people, and wait till the meeting was done (for all the country knew we met about the poor) and after the meeting friends would ſend to the bakers for bread, and give every one of thoſe poor people a loaf, how many ſoever there were of them; for we were taught <q>to do good unto all, though eſpecially to the houſehold of ſaith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this meeting, I viſited friends meeting till I came to Lancaſter; from whence I went to Robert Withers's, and ſo to Arnſide, where I had a general meeting for all the friends in the counties of Weſtmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancaſhire. This meeting was quiet and peaceable, and the living preſence of the Lord was amongſt us. I went
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:037441_0478_100D91204D96FD18"/>back with Robert Withers, and friends paſſed away, freſh in the life and power of Chriſt, in which they had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, being ſettled upon him the Heavenly Rock and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Several rude fellows, ſerving-men belonging to Sir George Middleton, a juſtice, that lived not far off, came to have made ſome diſturbance, as it was thought; but the meeting being ended they did nothing there: but lighting on three women friends going homeward, they ſet upon them with impudent ſcoffs, and one of them carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very abuſively and immodeſtly towards them. The ſame man abuſed other friends alſo, and was ſo outrageous that he would have cut ſome with an ax, but that the was reſtrained by ſome of his fellows. At another time the ſame man ſet upon ſix friends that were going to a meeting at Yelland, and beat and abuſed them ſo, that he <q>bruiſed their faces and ſhed much of their blood,</q> wounding them very ſore, and one of them in ſeveral parts of his body; yet they lifted not an hand againſt him, but gave him their backs and cheeks to beat.</p>
                  <p>From Robert Withers's I went next day to Swarthmore, Francis Howgil and Thomas Curtis being with me. I had not been long there before Henry Porter, a juſtice, ſent a warrant by the chief conſtable and three petty conſtables to apprehend me. I had a ſenſe of the thing beforehand; and being in the parlour with Richard Richardſon and Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Fell, ſome of her ſervants came and told her, there were ſome come to ſearch the houſe for arms, and they went up into ſome of the chambers under that pretence. It came upon me to go out to them, and as I was going by ſome of them, I ſpoke to them; whereupon they aſked me my name. I readily told them my name, and they laid hold on me, ſaying, I was the man they looked for, and led me away to Ulverſtone. There they kept me all night at the conſtable's, and ſet a guard of fiſteen or ſixteen men to watch me; ſome of whom ſate in the chimney, for fear I ſhould go up the chimney: ſuch dark imaginations poſſeſſed them. They were very rude and uncivil to me, and would neither ſuffer me to ſpeak to friends nor friends to bring me neceſſaries; but with violence thruſt them out, and kept a ſtrong guard upon me. Very wicked and rude they were, and a great noiſe they made about me. One of the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whoſe name was Aſhburnham, ſaid, <q>He did not think a thouſand men could have taken me.</q> Another of the conſtables, whoſe name was Mount, a very wicked man,
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:037441_0479_100D91580565D600"/>ſaid, <q>He would have ſerved judge Fell himſelf ſo, if he had been alive, and he had a warrant for him.</q> Next morning, about the ſixth hour, I was putting on my boots and ſpurs to go with them before ſome juſtice; but they pulled off my ſpurs, took my knife out of my pocket, and haſted me away along the town, with a party of horſe and abundance of people, not ſuffering me to ſtay till my own horſe came down. When I was gone about a quarter of a mile with them, ſome friends, with Margaret Fell and her children, came towards me, and then a great party of horſe gathered about me in a mad rage and fury, crying out, 'Will they reſcue him! will they reſcue him!' Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſaid, <q>Here is my hair, here is my back, here are my cheeks, ſtrike on!</q> Upon which their heat was a little aſſuaged. Then they brought a little horſe, and two of them took up one of my legs, and put my foot in the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, and two or three lifting over my other leg, ſet me upon the little horſe, behind the ſaddle, and ſo led the horſe by the halter, but I had nothing to hold by. When they were come a pretty way out of the town, they beat the little horſe, and made him kick and gallop; whereupon I ſlipped off him, and told them, <q>They ſhould not abuſe the creature.</q> They were much enraged at my getting off, and took me by the legs and feet, and ſet me upon the ſame horſe behind the ſaddle again, and led the horſe about two miles, till we came to a great water called Carter-ford. By this time my own horſe was come to us, and the water being deep, and their little horſe ſcarce able to carry me through, they let me get upon my own horſe through the perſuaſion of ſome of their own company, they leading him through the water. One wicked fellow <q>kneeled down, and lifting up his hands bleſſed God that I was taken.</q> When I was come over the ſands, I told them I had heard I had liberty to chooſe what juſtice I would go before; but the conſtables cried, 'No, I ſhould not.' They led me to Lancaſter, about fourteen miles, and a great triumph they thought to have had; but as they led me I was moved to <q>ſing praiſes to the Lord, in his triumphing power over all.</q> When I was come to Lancaſter, the ſpirits of the people being mightily up, I ſtood and looked earneſtly upon them, and they cried, 'Look at his eyes!' After a while I ſpoke to them, and they were pretty ſober. Then came a young man who took me to his houſe, and after a little time the officers had me to major Porter's, the juſtice
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:037441_0480_100D7F8F85999800"/>who had ſent the warrant againſt me, who had ſeveral others with him. When I came in, I ſaid, <q>Peace be amongſt you.</q> Porter aſked me, <q>Why I came into the country that troubleſome time?</q> I told him, 'To viſit my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.' But ſaid he, <q>You have great meetings up and down.</q> I told him though we had, our meetings were known throughout the nation to be peaceable, and we were a peaceable people. He ſaid, <q>We ſaw the devil in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's faces.</q> I told him, <q>If I ſaw a drunkard, or a ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or a peeviſh heady man, J could not ſay I ſaw the Spirit of God in him.</q> And I aſked him, <q>If he could ſee the Spirit of God?</q> He ſaid, <q>We cried againſt their miniſters.</q> I told him, While we were as Saul, ſitting under the prieſts, and running up and down with their packets of letters, we were never called peſtilent fellows nor makers of ſects; but when we were come to exerciſe our conſciences towards God and man, we were called peſtilent fellows, as Paul was. He ſaid, We could expreſs ourſelves well enough, and he would not diſpute with me; but he would reſtrain me. I deſired to know, <q>for what, and by whoſe order he ſent his warrant for me;</q> and complained to him of the abuſe of the conſtables and other officers after they had taken me, and in their bringing me thither. He would not take notice of that, but told me, <q>He had an orden but would not let me ſee it; for he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>al the king's ſecrets;</q> and beſides, 'a priſoner,' he ſaid, 'was not to ſee for what he was committed.' I told him, that was not reaſon: for how ſhould he make his defence then? I ſaid I ought to have a copy of it. But he ſaid, There was a judge once, <q>that fined one for letting a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner have a copy of his mittimus; and,</q> ſaid he, <q>I have an old clerk, though I am a young juſtice.</q> Then he called to his clerk, ſaying, 'Is it not ready yet? Bring it;' meaning the mittimus. But it not being ready, he told me I was a diſturber of the nation. I told him, I had been a bleſſing to the nation, in and through the Lord's power and truth, and the Spirit of God in all conſciences would anſwer it. Then he charged me as an <q>enemy to the king, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to raiſe a new war, and imbrue the nation in blood again.</q> I told him, I had never learned the poſtures of war, but was clear and innocent as a child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things; and therefore was bold. Then came the clerk with the mittimus, and the gaoler was ſent for and commanded to take me, put me into the Dark-houſe, and
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:037441_0481_100D7F9113688568"/>let none come at me, but keep me there cloſe priſoner till I ſhould be delivered by the king or parliament. Then the juſtice aſked the conſtables where my horſe was? <q>For I hear,</q> ſaid he, <q>he hath a good horſe; have ye brought his horſe?</q> I told him where my horſe was, but he did not meddle with him. As they had me to the gaol the conſtable gave me my knife again, and then aſked me to give it him: I told him, Nay; he had not been ſo civil to me. So they put me into the gaol, and the under-gaoler, one Hardy, a very wicked man, was exceeding rude and cruel, and many times would not let me have meat brought in, but as I could get it under the door. Many came to look at me, ſome in a rage, and very uncivil and rude. One time there came two young prieſts, and very abuſive they were; the meaneſt people could not be worſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that came in this manner, old Preſton's wife of Howker was one. She uſed many abuſive words to me, telling me, my 'tongue ſhould be cut out,' and that <q>I ſhould be hanged;</q> ſhewing me the gallows. But the Lord God cut her off, and ſhe died in a miſerable condition.</p>
                  <p>Being cloſe priſoner in the common gaol at Lancaſter, I deſired Thomas Cummins and Thomas Green to go to the gaoler, and deſire a copy of my mittimus, that I might know what I ſtood committed for. They went; and the gaoler anſwered,<q>He could not give a copy of it, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other had been fined for ſo doing;</q> but he gave them liberty to read it over. To the beſt of their remembrance, the matters therein charged againſt me were, <q>That I was a perſon generally ſuſpected to be a common diſturber of 'the peace of the nation, an enemy to the king, and a chief upholder of the Quakers ſect; and that I, together with many of my fanatick opinion, have of late endeavoured to raiſe inſurrections in theſe parts of the country, and embroil the whole country in blood. Wherefore the gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was commanded to keep me in ſafe cuſtody, till I ſhould be releaſed by order from the king or parliament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I had thus got the heads of the charge contained in the mittimus, I wrote a plain, downright anſwer, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of my innocency to each particular, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>I AM a priſoner at Lancaſter, committed by juſtice Porter. A copy of the mittimus I cannot get; but ſuch expreſſions I am told are in it as are very untrue. As that I am <q>generally ſuſpected to be a common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turber

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe; and I do, in every part thereof, deny it. For I am not a perſon generally ſuſpected to be a diſturber of the nation's peace, nor have given any cauſe for ſuch ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; for through the nation I have been tried for theſe things formerly. In the days of Oliver I was taken up on pretence of raiſing arms againſt him, which was alſo falſe; for I meddled not with raiſing arms at all. Yet I was then carried up priſoner to London, and brought before him; when I cleared myſelf, and denied the drawing of a carnal weapon againſt him, or any man upon the earth; for my weapons are ſpiritual, which take away the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of war, and lead into peace. Upon my declaring this to Oliver, I was ſet at liberty by him. After this I was taken, and ſent to priſon by major Ceely, in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, who, when I was brought before the judge, informed againſt me, <q>That I took him aſide, and told him, that I could raiſe forty thouſand men in an hour's time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the nation in blood, and bring in king Charles.</q> This alſo was utterly falſe, a lie of his own inventing, as was then proved upon him; for I never ſpoke any ſuch word to him. I never was in any plot, I never took any engagement or oath, nor ever learned war-poſture. As thoſe were falſe charges againſt me then, ſo are theſe now which come from major Porter, who is lately appointed to be juſtice, but wanted power formerly to exerciſe his cruelty againſt us; which is but the wickedneſs of the old enemy. For the peace of the nation I am not a diſturber of, nor ever was; but ſeek the peace thereof, and of all men, and ſtand for all nations peace and men's peace upon the earth, and wiſh that all nations and men knew my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in theſe things.</p>
                        <p>And whereas major Porter ſaith, I am an <q>enemy to the king,</q> this is falſe; for my love is to <q>him and to all men.</q> even though they be enemies to God, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and me. And I can ſay, It is of the Lord that he is come in, to bring down many unrighteouſly ſet up; of which I had a fight three years before he came in. It is much he ſhould ſay I am an enemy to the king; for I have no reaſon ſo to be, he having done nothing againſt me. But I have been often impriſoned and perſecuted theſe eleven or twelve years by thoſe that have been both
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:037441_0483_100D7FD3936316C8"/>againſt the king and his father, even the party that Porter was made a major by and bore arms for; but not by them that were for the king. I was never an enemy to the king, nor to any man's perſon upon the earth. I am in the love that fulfils the law, which thinks no evil, but loves even enemies; and would have the king ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and be brought into the fear of the Lord, to receive his wiſdom from above, by which all things were made and created; that with that wiſdom he may order all things to the glory of God.</p>
                        <p>Whereas he calleth me, <q>A chief upholder of the Quaker's ſect,</q> I anſwer: the Quakers are not a ſect, but are in the power of God, which was before ſects were, and witneſs the election before the world began, and are come to live in the life which the prophets and apoſtles lived in who gave forth the ſcriptures; therefore are we hated by envious, wrathful, wicked, perſecuting men. But God is the upholder of us all by his mighty power, and preſerves us from the wrath of the wicked that would ſwallow us up.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the ſaith, <q>That I, together with others of my fanatick opinion,</q> as he calls it, <q>have of late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to raiſe inſurrections, and to embroil the whole kingdom in blood:</q> This is altogether falſe; to theſe things I am as a child, and know nothing of them. The poſtures of war I never learned; my weapons are ſpiritual and not carnal, for with carnal weapons I do not fight. I am a follower of him who ſaid, <q>My kingdom is not of this world.</q> And though theſe lies and ſlanders are raiſed upon me, I deny drawing of any carnal weapon againſt the king or parliament, or any man upon the earth; for I am come to the end of the law, <q>to love enemies, and wreſtle not with fleſh and blood;</q> but am in that which ſaves men's lives. A witneſs I am againſt all murderers, plotters, and all ſuch as would "imbrue the nation in blood; for it is not in my heart to have any man's life deſtroyed. And as for the word fanatick, which ſignifies furious, fooliſh, mad, &amp;c. he might have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf before he had uſed that word, and have learned the humility which goes before honour. We are not turious, fooliſh, or mad; but through patience and meekneſs have borne lies, ſlanders, and perſecutions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and have undergone great ſufferings. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man, that wreſtles not with fleſh and blood, and the
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:037441_0484_100D7FD518DB3478"/>Spirit that reproves ſin in the gate, which is the Spirit of truth, wiſdom, and ſound judgment, is not mad, fooliſh furious, which fanatick ſignifies; but all are of a mad, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, fooliſh ſpirit, that wreſtle with fleſh and blood, with carnal weapons, in their furiouſneſs, fooliſhneſs, and rage. This is not the Spirit of God, but of error, that perſecutes in a mad, blind, zeal, like Nebuchadnezzar and Saul.</p>
                        <p>Inaſmuch as I am ordered to be kept priſoner till I be delivered by order from the king or parliament, therefore I have written theſe things to be laid before you, the king and parliament, that ye may conſider of them before ye act any thing therein; that ye may weigh, in the wiſdom of God, the intent and end of men's ſpirits, leſt ye act the thing that will bring the hand of the Lord upon you and againſt you, as many have done before you who have been in authority, whom God hath overthrown. In him we truſt whom we fear and cry unto day and night, who hath heard us, doth hear us, and will hear us, and avenge our cauſe. Much innocent blood hath been ſhed. Many have been perſecuted to death by ſuch as were in authority before you, whom God hath vomited out becauſe they turned againſt the juſt. Therefore conſider your ſtanding now that ye have the day, and receive this as a warning of love to you.</p>

Which when juſtice Porter heard of, he vapour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would go and meet her in the gap. But when he came before the king, he having been a zealous man for the parliament againſt the king, ſeveral courtiers ſpoke to him concerning his plundering their houſes; ſo he had quickly enough of the court, and returned into the country. Meanwhile the gaoler ſeemed very fearful, and ſaid, He was afraid major Porter would hang him becauſe he had not put me in the Dark-houſe. But when the gaoler went to wait on him, after he was come from London, he was very blank and down, and aſked 'how I did?' pretending he would find a way to ſet me at liberty. But having overſhot himſelf in his mittimus, by ordering me <q>to be kept priſoner till I ſhould be delivered by the king or parliament,</q>he had put it out of his power to releaſe me if he would. He was the more dejected alſo upon reading a letter which I ſent him; for when he was in the height of his rage and threats againſt me, and thought to ingratiate himſelf into the king's favour by impriſoning me, I was moved to write to him, and put him in mind, <q>How fierce he had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

I aſked him alſo, Whoſe great buck's horns thoſe were that were in his houſe? and where he had them and the wainſcot that he cieled his houſe withal? Had he not them from Hornby caſtle?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time Ann Curtis, of Reading, came to ſee me; and underſtanding how I ſtood committed, it was upon her alſo to go to the king about it. Her father, who had been ſheriff of Briſtol, was hanged near his own door for endeavouring to bring the king in; upon which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhe had ſome hopes the king might hear her on my behalf. Accordingly, when ſhe returned to London, ſhe and Margaret Fell went to the king together; who, when he underſtood whoſe daughter ſhe was, received her kindly. And her requeſt to him being <q>to ſend for me up, and hear the cauſe himſelf,</q> he promiſed her he would, and commanded his ſecretary to ſend an order for bringing me up. But when they came to the ſecretary for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he ſaid, <q>It was not in his power; he muſt go accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law; and I muſt be brought up by an Habeas Corpus before the judges.</q> So he wrote to the judge of the king's bench, ſignifying it was the king's pleaſure I ſhould be ſent up by an Habeas Corpus. Accordingly a writ was ſent, and delivered to the ſheriff; but becauſse it was directed to the chancellor of Lancaſter, the ſheriff put it off to him; on the other hand the chancellor would not make the warrant upon it, but ſaid the ſheriff muſt do that. At length both chancellor and ſheriff were got together; but being both enemies to truth they ſought occaſion for delay, and found an error in the writ, which was, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed to the chancellor, it ſaid, <q>George Fox in priſon under YOUR cuſtody,</q> whereas the priſon I was in was not in the chancellor's cuſtody, but the ſheriff's; ſo the word YOUR ſhould have been HIS. Upon this they returned the writ to London again, only to have that one word altered. When it was altered and brought down again, the ſheriff refuſed to carry me up, unleſs I would ſeal a writing to him, and become bound to pay for the ſealing and the charge of carrying me up: which I denied, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ing them, I would not ſeal any thing to them, nor be bound. So the matter reſted awhile, and I continued in priſon. Meanwhile the aſſize came on; but as there was a writ for removing me up, I was not brought before the
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:037441_0487_100D9125ECAB39F8"/>judge. At the aſſize many came to ſee me. I was moved to ſpeak out of the gaol-window to them, and ſhew them, <q>How uncertain their religion was, and that every ſort, when uppermoſt, had perſecuted the reſt. When popery was uppermoſt, people had been perſecuted for not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the maſs; and thoſe who held it up cried, <q>It was the higher power,</q> and people muſt be ſubject to the higher power. Afterwards they that ſet up the Common Prayer perſecuted others for not following that; ſaying, "It was the higher power, and we muſt be ſubject to that." Since that, the Preſbyterians and Independents cried each of them, <q>We mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So people might ſee how uncertain they are of their religions. But I directed them to Chriſt Jeſus, that they might be built upon him, the Rock and Foundation, that changeth not.</q> Much on this wiſe I declared to them, and they were quiet and very attentive. Afterwards I gave forth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paper concerning True Religion, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>TRUE Religion is the true rule and right way of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. And religion is a pure ſtream of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs flowing from the image of God, and is the life and power of God planted in the heart and mind by the law of life, which bringeth the ſoul, mind, ſpirit, and body to be conformable to God, the Father of Spirits, and to Chriſt; ſo that they come to have fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, and with all his holy angels and ſaints. This religion is pure from above, undefiled before God, leads to viſit the fatherleſs, widows, and ſtrangers, and keeps from the ſpots of the world. This religion is above all the defiled, ſpotted religions in the world, that keep not from defilements and ſpots, but leave their profeſſors impure, below, and ſpotted; whoſe fatherleſs, widows, and ſtrangers, beg up and down the ſtreets.</p>

                  <p>It was long before the ſheriff would yield to remove me to London, unleſs I would ſeal a bond to him, and bear their charges; which I ſtill refuſed to do. Then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted how to convey me up, and firſt concluded to ſend up a party of horſe with me. I told them, <q>If I were ſuch a man as they had repreſented me to be, they had need ſend a troop or two of horſe to guard me.</q> When they conſidered what a charge it would be to them to ſend up a party of horſe with me, they altered their purpoſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſend me up guarded only by the gaoler and ſome bailiffs. But upon farther conſideration they found that would be a great charge to them alſo, and therefore ſent for me to the gaoler's houſe, and told me, if I would put in bail that I would be in London ſuch a day of the term, I ſhould have leave to go up with ſome of my own friends. I told them I would neither put in bail, nor give one piece of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the gaoler; for I was an innocent man, they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned me wrongfully, and laid a falſe charge upon me. Nevertheleſs I ſaid, If they would let me go up with one or two of my friends to bear me company, I might go up and be in London ſuch a day, if the Lord ſhould permit; and, if they deſired it, I or any of my friends that went with me would carry up their charge againſt myſelf. When they ſaw they could do no otherwiſe with me, the ſheriff con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that <q>I ſhould come up with ſome of my friends, without any other engagement than my word, to appear before the judges at London ſuch a day of the term, if the Lord ſhould permit.</q> Whereupon I was let out of priſon, and went to Swarthmore, where I ſtaid two or three
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:037441_0491_100D912DC29F2C50"/>days; and from thence went to Lancaſter, and ſo to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, having meetings amongſt friends till I came into Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, to William Gandy's, where was a large meeting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors, the houſe not being ſufficient to contain it. That day the Lord's everlaſting ſeed was ſet over all, and friends were turned to it, who is the heir of the promiſe. Thence I came into Staffordſhire and Warwickſhire, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Bickliff's, and at Non-caton, at a prieſt's widow's houſe, we had a bleſſed meeting, wherein the everlaſting word of life was powerfully declared, and many ſettled in it. Then travelling on, viſiting friends meetings, in about three weeks time from my coming out of priſon, I reached London, Richard Hubberthorn and Robert Withers being with me.</p>
                  <p>When we came to Charing-croſs, multitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of people were gathered together to ſee the burning of the bowels of ſome of the old king's judges, who had been hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>
                  <p>We went next morning to judge Mallet's chamber, who was putting on his gown to ſit upon more of the king's judges. He was then very peeviſh and froward, and ſaid, I might come another time. We went another time to his chamber, when judge Foſter was with him, who was called Lord Chief Juſtice of England. With me was one called Eſquire Marſh, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of the bed-chamber to the king. When we had delivered to the judges the charge againſt me, and they had read to thoſe words, <q>That I and my friends were embroiling the nation in blood,</q> &amp;c. they ſtruck their hands on the table. Whereupon I told them, <q>I was the man whom that charge was againſt, but I was as innocent of any ſuch thing as a new-born child, and had brought it up myſelf; and ſome of my friends came up with me, without any guard.</q> As yet they had not minded my hat; but now, ſeeing my hat on, they ſaid, <q>What, did I ſtand with my hat on!</q> I told them I did not ſtand ſo in any contempt of them. Then they commanded one to take it off; and when they had called for the maiſhal of the king's bench, they ſaid to him, You muſt take this man and ſecure him, but you muſt let him have a chamber, and not put him amongſt the priſoners. My Lord, ſaid the marſhal, I have no chamber to put him into; my houſe is ſo full that I cannot tell where to provide for him but amongſt the priſoners. Nay, ſaid the judges, you muſt not put him amongſt the priſoners. But whet he ſtill anſwered, he had
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:037441_0492_100D91300E892160"/>no other place to put me in, judge Foſter ſaid to me, <q>Wall you appear to-morrow, about ten of the clock, at the king's bene. bar in Weſtminſter-hall?</q> I ſaid, <q>Yes, if the Lord give me ſtrength.</q> Then ſaid judge Foſter to the other judge, <q>If he ſays yes, and promiſes it, you may take his word.</q> So I was diſmiſſed. The next day I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the king's bench bar at the hour appointed, Robert Withers, Richard Hubberthorn, and Eſquire Marſh going with me. I was brought into the middle of the court, and as ſoon as I came in I was moved to look about, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people, ſaid, 'Peace be among you;' and the power of the Lord ſprang over the court. The charge againſt me was read openly. The people were moderate, and the judges cool and loving; and the Lord's mercy was to them. But when they came to that part of it which ſaid, <q>That I and my friends were embroiling the nation in blood and raiſing a new war, and that I was an enemy to the king,</q> &amp;c. they lifted up their hands. Then, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out my arms, I ſaid, <q>I am the man whom that charge is againſt, but I am as innocent as a child concerning the charge, and have never learned any war poſtures. And, ſaid I, do ye think, that if I and my friends were ſuch men as the charge declares, that I ſhould have brought it up myſelf againſt myſelf? Or that I ſhould be ſuffered to come up with one or two of my friends with me? Had I been ſuch a man as this charge ſets forth, I had need to have been guarded up with a troop or two of horſe. But the ſheriff and magiſtrates of Lancaſhire thought fit to let me and my friends come up with it ourſelves, almoſt two hundred mile, without any guard at all; which, you may 'be ſure they would not have done if they had looked upon me to be ſuch a man.</q> The judge aſked me, Whether it ſhould be filed? or what I would do with it? I anſwered, Ye are judges, and able, I hope, to judge in this matter; therefore do with it what ye will; for I am the man theſe charges are againſt, and here ye ſee I have brought them up myſelf. Do ye what ye will with them, I leave it to you. Then judge Twiſden beginning to ſpeak ſome angry words, I appealed to judge Foſter and judge Mallet, who had heard me over night. Whereupon they ſaid, <q>They did not accuſe me, for they had nothing againſt me.</q> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Thus, after I had been a priſoner ſomewhat more than twenty weeks, I was freely ſet at liberty by the king's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the Lord's power having wonderfully wrought for the clearing of my innocency, and Porter, who committed me, not daring to appear to make good the charge he had falſely ſuggeſted againſt me. But after it was known I was diſcharged, a company of envious, wicked ſpirits were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and terror took hold of juſtice Porter; for he was afraid I would take the advantage of the law againſt him for my wrong impriſonment, and thereby undo him, his wife, and children. And indeed I was preſſed by ſome in authority to have made him and the reſt examples; but I ſaid, I ſhould leave them to the Lord; if the Lord forgave them I ſhould not trouble myſelf with them.</p>
                  <p>Now did I ſee the end of the travail which I had in my ſore exerciſe at Reading; for the everlaſting power of the Lord was over all, and his bleſſed truth, life, and light ſhined over the nation, and great and glorious meetings we had, and very quiet; and many flocked unto the truth. Richard Hubberthorn had been with the king, who ſaid, 'None ſhould moleſt us ſo long as we lived peaceably,' and promiſed this upon the word of a king; telling him, we might make uſe of his promiſe. Some friends were alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the houſe of Lords, to declare their reaſons, why
<pb n="418" facs="unknown:037441_0495_100D913552A70640"/>they could not pay tithes, ſwear, nor go to the ſteeple-houſe-worſhip or join with others in worſhip; and they heard them moderately. There being about ſeven hundred friends in priſon, who had been committed under Oliver's and Richard's government, upon contempts (ſo called) when the king came in he ſet them all at liberty. There ſeemed at that time an inclination and intention in the government to have granted friends liberty, becauſe they were ſenſible we had ſuffered as well as they under the former powers. But when any thing was going forward in order thereunto, ſome dirty ſpirits or other, that would ſeem to be for us, threw ſomething in the way to ſtop it. It was ſaid there was an inſtrument drawn up for confirming our liberty, which only wanted ſigning; when on a ſudden that wicked attempt of the Fifth-monarchy-people broke out, and put the city and nation in an uproar. This was on a firſt-day night, and very glorious meetings we had that day, wherein the Lord's truth ſhined over all, and his power was exalted above all; but about midnight the drums beat, and the cry was, 'Arm, Arm.' I got out of bed, and in the morning took boat, and landing at Whitehall-ſtairs, walked through Whitehall. They looked ſtrangely at me there; but I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through, and went to Pall-mall, whither divers friends came to me, though it was now grown dangerous paſſing the ſtreets; for by this time the city and ſuburbs were up in arms, and exceeding rude the people and ſoldiers were; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fomuch that Henry Fell, going to a friend's houſe, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers knocked him down, and he had been killed if the duke of York had not come by. Great miſchief was done in the city this week; and when firſt-day came, that friends went to their meetings, many were taken priſoners. I ſtaid at Pall-mall, intending to be at the meeting there; but on the ſeventh-day night a company of troopers came and knocked at the door. The maid letting them in, they ſtrait laid hold of me; and there being amongſt them one, that had ſerved under the parliament, he clapped his hand to my pocket, and aſked, 'Whether I had any piſtols?' I told him, He knew I did not uſe to carry piſtols; why did he aſk ſuch a queſtion of me, who he knew to be a peaceable man? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſoldiers ran up into the chambers, and there found in bed 'ſquire Marſh, who, though he was one of the king's bed-chamber, out of his love to me had come and lodged where I did. When they came down again, they ſaid, 'Why ſhould we take this man away with us? We
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:037441_0496_100D9137C6F4A7A8"/>will let him alone, Oh! ſaid the parliament-ſoldier, he is one of the heads and a chief ringleader. Upon this the ſoldiers were taking me away; but 'ſquire Marſh hearing of it, ſent for the commander of the party, and deſired him to let me alone, for he would ſee me forth-coming in the morning. In the morning, before they could fetch me, and before the meeting was gathered, there came a company of foot to the houſe, and one of them, drawing his ſword, held it over my head. I aſked him, <q>Why he drew his ſword at a naked man?</q> At which his fellows being aſhamed bid him put up his ſword. Theſe ſoldiers took me away to Whitehall before the troopers came for me. As I was going out ſeveral friends were coming in to the meeting, whoſe boldneſs and cheerfulneſs I commended, and encouraged them to perſevere therein. When I was brought to Whitehall, the ſoldiers and people were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rude, yet I declared truth to them; but ſome great perſons coming by, who were very full of envy, 'What,' ſaid they, <q>do ye let him preach? Put him into ſuch a place where he may not ſtir.</q> So into that place they put me, and the ſoldiers watched over me. I told them, Tho' they could confine my body and ſhut that up, they could not ſtop up the word of life. Some thereupon came, and aſked me, 'What I was?' I told them, I was a preacher of righteouſneſs. After I had been kept there two or three hours, 'ſquire Marſh ſpoke to lord Gerrard, who came and bid them ſet me at liberty. The marſhal, when I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, demanded fees. I told him, I could not give him any, neither was it our practice. I aſked him, How he could demand fees of me who was innocent? Then I went through the guards, the Lord's power being over them; and after I had declared truth to the ſoldiers, I went up the ſtreets with two Iriſh colonels that came from White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall to an inn, where many friends were priſoners under a guard. I deſired thoſe colonels to ſpeak to the guard to let me go in to viſit my friends that were priſoners there; but they would not. Then I ſtept to the centry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to let me go up; which he did. While I was there the ſoldiers went to Pall-mall again to ſearch for me; but not finding me they turned towards the inn, and bid all come out that were not priſoners; ſo they went out. But I aſked the ſoldiers within, Whether I might not ſtay awhile with my friends? They ſaid, Yes. I ſtaid, and eſcaped their hands again. Towards night I went to Pall-mall, to
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:037441_0497_100D9139AF29FD68"/>ſee how it was with friends there, and after went into the city. Great rifling of houſes there was at that time to ſearch for people. I went to a private friend's houſe and Richard Hubberthorn with me. There we drew up a declaration againſt plots and fightings, to be preſented to the king and council; but when we had finiſhed it, and ſent it to the preſs, it was taken in the preſs.</p>
                  <p>Upon this inſurrection of the Fifth-monarchy-men great havock was made both in city and country, ſo that it was dangerous for ſober people to ſtir abroad ſeveral weeks after; and hardly could either men or women go up and down the ſtreets to buy proviſions for their families without being abuſed. In the country they dragged men and women out of their houſes, and ſome ſick men out of their beds by the legs. Nay, one that was in a fever the ſoldiers dragged out of his bed to priſon; and when he was brought thither he died. His name was Thomas Patching.</p>
                  <p>Margaret Fell went to the king, and told him what ſad work there was in the city and nation, and ſhewed him we were an innocent peaceable people, and that we muſt keep our meetings as we uſed to do whatever we ſuffered; but it concerned him to ſee that peace was kept, that no inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood might be ſhed.</p>
                  <p>Now were the priſons every where filled with friends and others in the city and country, and the poſts were ſo laid for the ſearching of letters, that none could paſs unſearched. We heard of ſeveral thouſands of our friends that were caſt into priſon in ſeveral parts of the nation, and Margaret Fell carried an account of them to the king and council. The next week we had an account of ſeveral thouſands more that were caſt into priſon, and ſhe went and laid them alſo before the king and council. They wondered how we could have ſuch intelligence, ſeeing they had given ſuch ſtrict charge for the intercepting of all letters; but the Lord did ſo order it that we had an account notwithſtanding all their ſtoppings. In the deep ſenſe I had of the grievous ſufferings friends underwent, and of their innocency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man, I was moved to ſend the following epiſtle to them, as a word of conſolation, and to put them upon ſending up their ſufferings.</p>

                        <p>OUR principle is, and our practices have always been to ſeek peace and enſue it; to follow after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the knowledge of God; ſeeking the good and welfare, and doing that which tends to the peace of all. We know that wars and fightings proceed from the luſts of men, as Jam. iv. 1, 2, 3, out of which luſts the Lord
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:037441_0499_100D913DD32D64B0"/>hath redeemed us, and ſo out of the occaſion of war. The occaſion of war and the war itſelf (wherein envious men, who are lovers of themſelves more than lovers of God, luſt, kill, and deſire to have men's lives or eſtates) ariſeth from the luſt. All bloody principles and practices we, as to our own particulars, do utterly deny, with all outward wars, ſtrife, and fighting with outward weapons for any end, or under any pretence whatſoever: this is our teſtimony to the whole world.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is objected: But although you now ſay, <q>That you cannot fight nor take up arms at all; yet if the Spirit move you, then you will change your principle, you will ſell your coat and buy a ſword, and fight for the kingdom of Chriſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this we anſwer, Chriſt ſaid to Peter, <q>Put up thy ſword in his place;</q> though he had ſaid before, he that had no ſword might ſell his coat and buy one (to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law and the ſcripture) yet after, when he had bid him put it up, he ſaid, <q>He that taketh the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword.</q> And Chriſt ſaid to Pilate, <q>Thinkeſt thou, that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</q> And this might ſatisfy Peter, Luke xxii. 36. after he had put up his ſword, when he ſaid to him, <q>He that took it, ſhould periſh by it;</q> which ſatisfieth us, Mat. xxvi. 51, 52, 53. In the Revelations it is ſaid, <q>He that kills with the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword; and here is the faith and the patience of the ſaints.</q> So Chriſt's kingdom is not of this world, therefore do not his ſervants fight, as he told Pilate, the magiſtrate who cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him. And did they not look upon Chriſt as a raiſer of ſedition? and did not he pray, "Forgive them?" But thus it is that we are numbered amongſt tranſgreſſors, and amongſt fighters, that the ſcriptures might be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>That the Spirit of Chriſt, by which we are guided, is not changeable, ſo as once to command us from a thing, as evil, and again to move unto it. We certainly know and teſtify to the world, That the Spirit of Chriſt, which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war againſt any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Chriſt nor for the kingdoms of this world.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Becauſe the kingdom of Chriſt God will exalt, according to his promiſe, and cauſe it to grow and ſlouriſh in righteouſneſs, <q>Not by might, nor by power (of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:037441_0500_100D91402207AB80"/>ſword) but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord,</q> Zech. iv. 6. So thoſe that uſe any weapon to fight for Chriſt, or for the eſtabliſhing of his kingdom or government, their ſpirit, principle, and practice we deny.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We earneſtly deſire and wait, that (by the word of God's power, and its effectual operation in the hearts of men) the kingdoms of this world may become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt; and that he may rule and reign in men by his Spirit and truth; that thereby all people, out of all different judgments and profeſſions, may be brought into love and unity with God, and one with another; and that all may come to witneſs the prophet's words fulfilled, who ſaid, <q>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more,</q> Iſa. ii. 4 Mich. iv. 3.</p>
                        <p>Since we, whom the Lord hath called into the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his truth, have denied wars and fightings, and cannot any more learn them. This is a certain teſtimony unto all the world of the truth of our hearts in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that as God perſuadeth every man's heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo they may receive it. For we have not, as ſome others, gone about cunningly with deviſed fables, nor have we ever denied in practice what we have profeſſed in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; but in ſincerity and truth, and by the word of God, have we laboured to be made manifeſt unto all men, that both we and our ways might be witneſſed in the hearts of all. And whereas all manner of evil hath been falſely ſpoken of us, we hereby ſpeak the plain truth of our hearts, to take away the occaſion of that offence, that ſo we, being innocent, may not ſuffer for other men's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, nor be made a prey of by the wills of men for that of which we were never guilty; but in the uprightneſs of our hearts we may, under the power ordained of God for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well, live a peaceable life in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. For although we have always ſuffered, and do now more abundantly ſuffer, yet we know it is for right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs ſake: <q>For our rejoicing is this, the teſtimony of our conſciences, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</q> 2 Cor. i. 12, which for us is a witneſs for the convincing of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For this we can ſay to all the world, we have wronged no man, we have uſed no force nor violence
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:037441_0501_100D9141B34A8610"/>againſt any man, we have been found in no plots, nor guilty of ſedition. When we have been wronged we have not ſought to revenge ourſelves, we have not made reſiſtance againſt authority; but wherein we could not obey for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, we have ſuffered the moſt of any people in the nation. We have been counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter, perſecuted and deſpiſed, beaten, ſtoned, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtocked, whipped, impriſoned, haled out of the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, caſt into dungeons and noiſome vaults, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have died in bonds, ſhut up from our friends, denied needful ſuſtenance for many days together, with other the like cruelties. And the cauſe of all theſe our ſufferings is not for any evil, but for things relating to the worſhip of our God, and in obedience to his requirings. <q>For which cauſe we ſhall freely give up our bodies a ſacrifice, rather than diſobey the Lord;</q> knowing, as the Lord hath kept us innocent, he will plead our cauſe when there is none in the earth to plead it. So we, in obedience to his truth, do not love our lives unto death, that we may do his will, and wrong no man in our generation, but ſeck the good and peace of all men. He who hath commanded us, "That we ſhall not ſwear at all," Matth. v. 34, hath alſo commanded us, "That we ſhall not kill," Matth. v. So that we can neither kill men, nor ſwear for nor againſt them. This is both our principle and our practice, and hath been from the beginning; ſo that if we ſuffer, as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to take up arms or make war againſt any, it is without any ground from us; for it neither is, nor ever was in our hearts, ſince we owned the truth of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we ever do it, becauſe it is contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt, his doctrine, and the practices of his apoſtles; even contrary to him for whom we ſuffer all things and endure all things.</p>
                        <p>And whereas men come againſt us with clubs, ſtaves, drawn ſwords, piſtols cock'd, and beat, cut, and abuſe us; yet we never reſiſted them, but to them our hair, backs, and cheeks have been ready. It is not an honour to manhood or nobility to run upon harmleſs people, who lift not an hand againſt them, with arms and weapons.</p>
                        <p>Therefore conſider theſe things, ye men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for plotters, raiſers of inſurrections, tumultuous ones, and fighters, running with ſwords, clubs, ſtaves, and piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols, one againſt another; we ſay, theſe are of the world, and have their foundation from this unrighteous world,
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:037441_0502_100D914347E2B510"/>from the foundation of which the Lamb hath been ſlain: which Lamb hath redeemed us from this unrighteous world; we are not of it, but are heirs of a world of which there is no end, a kingdom where no corruptible thing enters. Our weapons are ſpiritual, not carnal, yet mighty through God to the pulling down of the ſtrong holds of ſin and Satan, who is the author of wars, fighting, murder, and plots. Our ſwords are broken into plough-ſhares, and ſpears into pruning-hooks, as propheſied of in Micah iv. Therefore we cannot learn war any more, neither riſe up againſt nation or kingdom with outward weapons, though you have numbered us amongſt the tranſgreſſors and plotters. The Lord knows our innocency herein, and will plead our cauſe with all people upon earth at the day of their judgment, when all men ſhall have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to their works.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in love we warn you for your ſouls good, not to wrong the innocent, nor the babes of Chriſt, which he hath in his hand, and tenders as the apple of his eye; neither ſeek to deſtroy the heritage of God, nor turn your ſwords backward upon ſuch as the law was not made for, i. e. the righteous; but for the ſinners and tranſgreſſors, to keep them down.

If you oppreſs us as they did the children of Iſrael in Egypt, if you oppreſs us as they did when Chriſt was born, and as they did the Chriſtians in the primitive times, we can ſay, "The Lord forgive you;" leave the Lord to deal with you, and not revenge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If you ſay, as the council ſaid to Peter and John, "You muſt ſpeak no more in that name;" and if you ſerve us as they ſerved the three children ſpoken of in Daniel, God is the ſame as he ever was, that lives for ever and ever, who hath the innocent in his arms.</p>
                        <p>Oh! friends! offend not the Lord and his little ones, neither afflict his people; but conſider and be moderate, Run not haſtily into things, but mind and conſider mercy, juſtice, and judgment; that is the way for you to proſper and get the favour of the Lord. Our meetings were ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and broken up in the days of Oliver, under pretence of plotting againſt him; in the days of the Committee of Safety we were looked upon as plotters to bring in king

Oh! that men ſhould loſe their reaſon, and go contrary to their own conſciences; knowing that we have ſuffered all things, and have been accounted plotters all along, though we have always declared againſt them both by word of mouth and printing, and are clear from any ſuch thing! Though we have ſuffered all along, becauſe we would not take up carnal weapons to fight againſt any, and are thus made a prey upon becauſe we are the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent lambs of Chriſt, and cannot avenge ourſelves! Theſe things are left upon your hearts to conſider; for we are out of all thoſe things in the patience of the ſaints, and we know as Chriſt ſaid, <q>He that takes the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword,</q> Matth. xxvi. 52.

                           <p>Though we are numbered amongſt tranſgreſſors, and have been given up to rude, mercileſs men, by whom our meetings are broken up, in which we edified one another in our holy faith, and prayed together to the Lord that lives for ever, yet he is our pleader in this day. The Lord ſaith, "They that feared his name ſpoke often together," as in Malachi; which were as his jewels. For this cauſe, and no evil doing, are we caſt into holes, dungeons, houſes of correction, priſons (ſparing neither old nor young, men nor women) and made a prey of in the ſight of all nations, under pretence of being ſeditious, &amp;c. ſo that all rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple run upon us to take poſſeſſion; for which we ſay, The Lord forgive them that have thus done to us; who doth and will enable us to ſuffer; and never ſhall we lift up hand againſt any man that doth thus uſe us; but that the Lord may have mercy upon them, that they may conſider what they have done. For how is it poſſible for them to requite us for the wrong they have done to us? Who to all nations have ſounded us abroad as ſeditious or plotters, who were never plotters againſt any power or man upon the earth, ſince we knew the life and power of Jeſus Chriſt manifeſted in us, who hath redeemed us from the world
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:037441_0504_100D914803FC1888"/>and all works of darkneſs, and plotters therein, by which we know the election before the world began. So we ſay. The Lord have mercy upon our enemies, and forgive them for what they have done unto us.</p>
                           <p>Oh! do as you would be done by; do unto all men as you would have them do unto you; for this is the law and the prophets.</p>
                           <p>All plots, inſurrections, and riotous meetings, we deny, knowing them to be of the devil, the murderer; which we in Chriſt, who was before they were, triumph over. And all wars and fightings with carnal weapous we deny, who have the ſword of the Spirit; and all that wrong us, we leave to the Lord. This is to clear our innocency from that aſperſion caſt upon us, <q>That we are ſeditious or plotters.</q>

Much blood was ſhed this year, many of the old king's judges being hanged, drawn, and quartered. Amongſt thoſe that ſuffered colonel Hacker was one, who ſent me priſoner from Leiceſter to London in Oliver's time. A ſad day it was, and a repaying of blood with blood. For in the time of O. Cromwel, when ſeveral were hanged, drawn, and quartered for pretended treaſons, I felt from the Lord God that their blood would not be put up, but would be required, and I ſaid as much then to ſeveral, and now alſo upon the king's return, when ſeveral that had been againſt the king were put to death, as the others that were for the king had been before by Oliver. This was ſad work, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying people contrary to the nature of Chriſtians, who have the nature of lambs and ſheep. But there was a ſecret hand in bringing this day upon that hypocritical generation of profeſſors, who being got into power grew proud, haughty, and cruel beyond others, and perſecuted the people of God without pity. Therefore when friends were under cruel perſecutions and ſufferings in the commonwealth's time, I was moved of the Lord to write unto them, to draw up their ſufferings, and lay them before the juſtices at their ſeſſions; and if they would not do them juſtice, then to lay them before the judges at the aſſize; and if they refuſed them juſtice, to lay it before the parliament, and before the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his council, that they might all ſee what was done under their government; and if they would not do juſtice, then to lay it before the Lord, who would hear the cries of the oppreſſed, the widows, and fatherleſs, whom they had made ſo. For that which we ſuffered for, and which our goods were ſpoiled for, was our obedience to the Lord in his Power and in his Spirit, who is able to help and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and we had no helper in the earth but him. And he heard the cries of his people, and brought an overflowing ſcourge over the heads of all our perſecutors, which brought a quaking, a dread, and a fear amongſt and on them all; ſo that thoſe who had nick-named us (who are the children of light) and in ſcorn called us Quakers, the Lord made to quake, and many of them would have been glad to have hid themſelves amongſt us; and ſome of them, through the diſtreſs that came upon them, did at length conſeſs to the truth. Oh! the daily reproaches, revilings, and beatings we underwent amongſt them, even in the highways, becauſe we could not put off our hats to them, and for ſaying Thou and Thee to them! Oh! the havock and ſpoil the prieſts
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:037441_0506_100D914B27200978"/>made of our goods, becauſe we could not put into their mouths and give them tithes! Beſides caſting into priſons, and beſides the great fines laid upon us becauſe we could not ſwear! But for all theſe things did the Lord God plead with them. Yet ſome of them were ſo hardened in their wickedneſs, that when they were turned out of their places and offices, they ſaid, <q>If they had power they would do the ſame again.</q> And when this day of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning was come upon them, they ſaid, <q>It was all along of us.</q>Wherefore I was moved to write to them, and to aſk, <q>Did we ever reſiſt them when they took away our ploughs and plough-gears, our carts and horſes, our corn and cattle, our kettles and platters from us, and whipped us, and ſet us in the ſtocks, and caſt us into priſon, and all this only for ſerving and worſhipping God in ſpirit and truth, and becauſe we could not conform to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, manners, cuſtoms, and faſhions? Did we ever reſiſt them? Did we not give them our backs to beat, our cheeks to pull off the hair, and our faces to ſpit on? Had not their prieſts, that prompted them on to ſuch work, plucked them with themſelves into the ditch? Why then would they ſay, "It was all along of us?" when it was owing to themſelves and their prieſts, their blind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that followed their own ſpirits, and could foreſee nothing of theſe times and things that are come upon them, which we had long forewarned them of; as Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah and Chriſt had forewarned Jeruſalem. They thought to have wearied us out and undone us; but they undid themſelves. Whereas we could praiſe God, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their plundering of us, that we had a kettle, a platter, an horſe, and plough ſtill.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Many ways were theſe profeſſors warned, by word, by writing, and by ſigns; but they would believe none till it was too late. William Sympſon was moved of the Lord to go at ſeveral times for three years naked and bare-footed before them, as a ſign to them, in markets, courts, towns, cities, to prieſts houſes, and to great men's houſes; telling them, <q>So ſhould they be ſtripped naked as he was ſtripped naked!</q> And ſometimes he was moved to put on hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackcloth, and to beſmear his face, and to tell them, <q>So would the Lord God beſmear all their religion as he was beſmeared.</q> Great ſufferings did that poor man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, ſore whippings with horſe-whips and coach-whips on his bare body, grievous ſtoning and impriſonments in three
<pb n="430" facs="unknown:037441_0507_100D914DF283A018"/>years time, before the king came in, that they might have taken warning; but they would not, and rewarded his love with cruel uſage. Only the mayor of Cambridge did nobly to him, for he put his gown about him, and took him into his houſe.</p>
                        <p>Another friend, Robert Huntingdon, was moved of the Lord to go into Carliſle ſteeple-houſe with a white ſheet about him, amongſt the great Preſbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there, to ſhew them that the ſurplice was coming up again; and he put an halter about his neck to ſhew them that an halter was coming upon them; which was fulfilled upon ſome of our perſecutors not long after.</p>
                        <p>Another, Richard Sale, living near Weſtcheſter, being conſtable of the place where he lived, had a friend ſent to him with a paſs (whom thoſe wicked profeſſors had taken up for a vagabond, becauſe he travelled up and down in the work of the miniſtry) and this conſtable, being convinced by the friend thus brought to him, gave him his paſs and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and was afterwards himſelf caſt into priſon. After this, on a lecture-day, Richard Sale was moved to go to the ſteeple-houſe in the time of their worſhip, and to carry thoſe perſecuting prieſts and people a lanthorn and candle, as a figure of their darkneſs; but they cruelly abuſed him, and like dark profeſſors as they were put him into their priſon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Little Eaſe, and ſo ſqueezed his body therein that not long after he died. Many warnings of divers ſorts were friends moved in the power of the Lord to give unto that generation; which they not only rejected, but abuſed friends, calling us giddy-headed Quakers, but God brought his judgments upon thoſe perſecuting prieſts and magiſtrates. For when the king came in, moſt of them were turned out of their places and benefices, the ſpoilers were ſpoiled; and then we could aſk them, Who were the giddy-heads now? Then many confeſſed we had been true prophets to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſaid, Had we cried againſt ſome prieſts only they ſhould have liked us then; but we crying againſt all, that made them diſlike us. But now they ſaw that thoſe prieſts, then looked upon to be the beſt, were as bad as the reſt. For indeed ſome of thoſe that were counted the moſt eminent prieſts were the bittereſt and greateſt ſtirrers up of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to perſecution, and it was a judgment upon them to be denied the free liberty of their conſciences when the king came in, becauſe when they were uppermoſt they would not have liberty of conſcience granted to others. One
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:037441_0508_100D914FDD63E530"/>Hewes, of Plymouth, a prieſt of great note in Oliver's days, when ſome liberty was granted, prayed, <q>That God would put it into the hearts of the chief magiſtrates of the nation to remove this curſed Toleration.</q> Others of them pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it by the name of Intolerable Toleration. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while after, when the king was come in, and prieſt Hewes turned out of his great benefice for not conforming to the Common Prayer, a friend from Plymouth meeting with him, aſked him, <q>Whether he would account Toleration accurſed now? And whether he would not now be glad of a Toleration?</q> To which the prieſt returned no anſwer, ſave by the ſhaking of his head. But as ſtiff as this ſort of men were then againſt Toleration, it is well known many of them petit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oned the king for Toleration and for meeting-places, and paid for licences too. But to return to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, the latter end of the year 1660 and the beginning of 1661.</p>
                        <p>Although thoſe friends, who had been impriſoned upon the riſing of thoſe Monarchy-men, were ſet at liberty, yet meetings were much diſturbed, and great ſufferings friends underwent; for beſides what was done by officers and ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, many wild fellows and rude people often came in. There came one time, when I was at Pall-mall, an ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor with a company of Iriſhmen with rude fellows: the meeting was over before they came, and I was gone up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chamber, where I heard one of them ſay, he would 'kill all the Quakers.' I went down to him, and was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the power of the Lord to ſpeak to him. I told him, the law ſaid, 'An eye for an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>, and a tooth for a tooth;' but thou threateneſt to <q>kill all the Quakers, though they have done thee no hurt.</q> But, ſaid I, here is goſpel for thee: <q>Here's my hair, here's my cheek, here's my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</q> turning it to him. This came ſo over him, that he and his companions ſtood as men amazed, and ſaid, If that was our principle, and if we were as we ſaid, they never ſaw the like in their lives. I told them, What I was in words, I was the ſame in life. Then the ambaſſador who had ſtood without, came in; for he ſaid, that Iriſh colonel was ſuch a deſperate man, he durſt not come in with him for fear he ſhould have done us ſome miſchief; but truth came over him, and he carried himſelf lovingly towards us, as alſo did the ambaſſador; for the Lord's power was over them all.</p>
                        <p>At Mile-end friends were kept out of their meeting-place
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:037441_0509_100D91516C305120"/>by ſoldiers; but friends ſtood nobly in the truth, valiant for the Lord's name, and at laſt the truth gave them dominion.</p>
                        <p>About this time we had an account that John Love, a friend that was moved to go and bear teſtimony againſt the idolatry of the Papiſts, was dead in priſon at Rome: it was ſuſpected he was privately put to death. John Perrot was alſo priſoner there, and being releaſed came over again; but after his arrival here, he, with Charles Baily and ſome others, turned aſide from the unity of friends and truth. Whereupon I was moved to give forth a paper, declaring how the Lord would blaſt him and his followers, if they did not repent and return, and that they ſhould wither like the graſs on the houſe-top; which many of them did: but others repented and returned.</p>
                        <p>Alſo before this time we received account from New-England, <q>That the government there had made a law to baniſh the Quakers out of their colonies, upon pain of death in caſe they returned; that ſeveral of our friends, having been ſo baniſhed and returning, were thereupon taken and actually hanged, and that divers more were in priſon, in danger of the like ſentence to be executed upon them.</q> When thoſe were put to death, I was in priſon at Lancaſter, and had a perfect ſenſe of their ſufferings as though it had been myſelf, and as though the halter had been put about my own neck, though we had not at that time heard of it. But as ſoon as we heard of it, Edward Burrough went to the king, and told him, <q>There was a vein of innocent blood opened in his dominions, which if it were not ſtopped would over-run all.</q> To which the king replied, 'But I will ſtop that vein.' Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſaid, <q>Then do it ſpeedily, for we know not how many may ſoon be put to death.</q> The king anſwered, <q>As ſpeedily as ye will. Call (ſaid he to ſome preſent) the ſecretary, and I will do it preſently.</q> The ſecretary being called, a mandamus was forthwith granted. A day or two after, Edward Burrough going again to the king to deſire the matter might be expedited, the king ſaid, He had no occaſion at preſent to ſend a ſhip thither, but if we would ſend one we might do it as ſoon as we would. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then aſked the king, If it would pleaſe him to grant his deputation to one called a Quaker to carry the manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus to New-England? He ſaid, 'Yes, to whom ye will.' Whereupon E. B. named Samuel Shattock, who being an inhabitant of New-England was baniſhed by their law, to
<pb n="433" facs="unknown:037441_0510_100D915306B7F0B0"/>be hanged if he came again, and to him the deputation was granted. Then he ſent for Ralph Goldſmith, an honeſt friend, who was maſter of a good ſhip, and ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eed with him for three hundred pounds (goods or no goods) to ſail in ten days. He forthwith prepared to ſet ſail, and with a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous gale, in about ſix weeks time, arrived before the town of Boſton in New-England, upon a firſt-day morning. With him went many paſſengers, both of New and Old England, friends, whom the Lord moved to go to bear their teſtimony againſt thoſe bloody perſecutors, who had exceeded all the world in that age in their bloody perſecutions. The townſmen at Boſton, ſeeing a ſhip come into the bay with Engliſh colours, ſoon came on board and aſked for the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Ralph Goldſmith told him. He was the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They aſked him, If he had any letters? He ſaid, Yes. They aſked, If he would deliver them? He ſaid, 'No, not to-day.' So they went aſhore, and reported, There was a ſhip full of Quakers, and that Samuel Shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock was among them, who they knew was by their law to be put to death for coming again after baniſhment; but they knew not his errand nor his authority. So all being kept cloſe that day, and none of the ſhip's company ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go on ſhore; next morning Samuel Shattock, the king's deputy, and Ralph Goldſmith, went on ſhore, and ſending back to the ſhip the men that landed them, they two went through the town to the governor's, John Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott's door, and knocked. He ſent out a man to know their buſineſs. They ſent him word their buſineſs was from the king of England, and they would deliver their meſſage to none but the governor himſelf. Thereupon they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in, and the governor came to them; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the deputation and the mandamus, he put off his hat and looked upon them. Then going out, he bid the friends follow him. He went to the deputy-governor, and after a ſhort conſultation came out to the friends, and ſaid, 'We ſhall obey his majeſty's commands.' After this the maſter gave liberty to the paſſengers to come on ſhore, and preſently the noiſe of the buſineſs flew about the town; and the friends of the town and the paſſengers of the ſhip me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

While they were thus met, in came a poor friend, who, being ſentenced by their bloody law to die, had lain ſome time in irons expecting execution. This
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:037441_0511_100D915599531010"/>added to their joy, and cauſed them to lift up their hearts in high praiſes to God, who is worthy for ever to have the praiſe, the glory, and the honour; for he only is able to deliver, to ſave, and ſupport all that ſincerely put their truſt in him.

                  <p>Some time after this ſeveral New-England magiſtrates came over, with one of their prieſts. We had ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with them concerning their murdering our friends,
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:037441_0512_100D7F8567D89B78"/>the ſervants of the Lord; but they were aſhamed to ſtand to their bloody actions. At one of thoſe meetings I aſked Simon Broadſtreet, one of the New-England magiſtrates, Whether he had not an hand in putting to death thoſe four ſervants of God, whom they hanged for being Quakers only, as they had nicknamed them? He confeſſed, He had. I then aſked him, and the reſt of his aſſociates then preſent, Whether they would acknowledge themſelves to be ſubjects to the laws of England? And if they did, by what law they had put our friends to death? They ſaid, They were ſubjects to the laws of England, and they had put our friends to death by the ſame law as the Jeſuits were put to death here in England. I aſked them then, Whether they did believe thoſe friends of ours, whom they had put to death, were Jeſuits or jeſuitically affected? They ſaid, Nay. Then, ſaid I, ye have murdered them, if ye have put them to death by the law that Jeſuits are put to death here in England, and yet confeſs they were no Jeſuits.' By this it plainly appears ye have put them to death in your own wills, without any law. Then Simon Broadſtreet, finding himſelf and his company enſnared by their own words, ſaid, Did we come to catch them? I told them, they had catched themſelves, and they might juſtly be queſtioned for their lives; and if the father of William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon (who was one of thoſe that were put to death) was in town, it was probable he would queſtion them, and bring their lives into jeopardy. Hereupon they began to excuſe themſelves, ſaying, <q>There was no perſecution now amongſt them;</q> but next morning we had letters from New-England, giving us account that our friends were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted there afreſh. Thereupon we went to them again, and ſhewed them our letters, which put them both to ſilence and to ſhame. In great fear they ſeemed to be, leſt ſome ſhould call them to account and proſecute them for their lives, eſpecially Simon Broadſtreet; for he had at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many witneſſes confeſſed, <q>He had a hand in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our friends to death,</q> that he could not get from it; though he afterwards through fear ſhuffled, and would have unſaid it again. After this he and the reſt ſoon left the city, and got back to New-England again. I went alſo to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Winthorp, and diſcourſed with him about theſe matters; but he aſſured me, <q>He had no hand in putting our friends to death, or in any way perſecuting of them, but was one of them that proteſted againſt it.</q> Theſe
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:037441_0513_100D915997B050D8"/>ſtingy perſecutors of New-England were a people that fled out of Old England thither from the perſecution of the biſhops here; but when they had got power into their hands, they ſo far exceeded the biſhops in ſeverity and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, that whereas the biſhops had made them pay twelve pence a Sunday (ſo called) for not coming to their worſhip here, they impoſed a fine of five ſhillings a day upon ſuch as ſhould not conform to their will-worſhip there, and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goods of friends that could not pay it. Beſides, many they impriſoned, divers they whipped, and that moſt cruelly; they cut the ears off ſome, and ſome they hanged: as the books of friends ſufferings in New-England largely ſhew, particularly one written by George Biſhop of Briſtol, intituled, New-England judged: (in two parts.) Some of the old Royaliſts were earneſt with friends to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them; but we told them, we left them to the Lord, to whom vengeance belonged, and he would repay it. And the judgments of God have ſince fallen heavy on them; for the Indians have been raiſed up againſt them, and have cut off many of them.</p>
                  <p>About this time I loſt a very good book, being taken in the printer's hands: it was a uſeful, teaching book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſignification and explanation of Names, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Types, and Figures in the ſcriptures. Thoſe who took it were ſo affected therewith that they were loth to deſtroy it; but thinking to have made a great advantage of it, they would have let us had it again, if we would have given them a great ſum of money for it; which we were not free to do.</p>
                  <p>Before this, while I was priſoner in Lancaſter caſtle, the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>k called the Battledore came forth, which was written to ſhew that in all languages Thou and Thee is the proper and uſual form of ſpeech to a ſingle perſon, and You to more than one. This was ſet forth in examples or inſtances taken out of the ſcriptures, and out of books of inſtruction in about thirty languages. John Stubbs and Benjamin Furly took great pains in compiling it, which I put them upon; and ſome things I added to it. When it was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of them were preſented to the king and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to the biſhops of Canterbury and London, and to the two univerſities one apiece; and many bought of them. The king ſaid, 'It was the proper language of all nations.' The biſhop of Canterbury, being aſked what he thought of it, was ſo at a ſtand that he could not tell what to ſay to
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:037441_0514_100D915BA8866F78"/>it. For it did ſo inform and convince people, that few afterwards were ſo rugged towards us for ſaying Thou and Thee to a ſingle perſon, which before they were exceeding fierce againſt us for. For Thou and Thee was a ſore cut to proud fleſh, and them that ſought ſelf-honour; who, though they would ſay it to God and Chriſt, would not endure to have it ſaid to themſelves. So that we were often beat and abuſed, and ſometimes in danger of our lives for uſing thoſe words to ſome proud men, who would ſay, 'What! you ill-bred clown, do you Thou me!' as though there lay chriſtian breeding in ſaying You to one, which is contrary to their grammars and teaching books, by which they inſtructed their youth.</p>
                  <p>Now the biſhops and prieſts being buſy and eager to ſet up their form of worſhip, and compel all to come to it, I was moved to give forth the following paper, to open the nature of the true worſhip which Chriſt ſet up, and which God accepts; thus:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>CHRIST's worſhip is free in the Spirit to all men; and ſuch as worſhip in the Spirit and in the truth are thoſe that God ſeeks to worſhip him; for he is the God of truth, and is a Spirit, and the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh. He hath given to all nations of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men breath and life, to live, move, and have their being in him, and hath put into them an immortal ſoul. So all nations of men and women are to be temples for him to dwell in; and they that defile his temple will he deſtroy.

This is a free worſhip; for where the Spirit of the Lord is and ruleth, there is liberty; the fruits of the Spirit are ſeen, and will manifeſt themſelves; and the Spirit is not to be limited, but to be lived and walked in, that the fruits of it may appear. The tares are ſuch as hang upon the wheat, and thereby draw it down to the earth; yet the tares and the wheat muſt grow together till the harveſt, leſt they that take upon them to pluck up the tares ſhould pluck up the wheat with the tares. The tares are ſuch as worſhip

Chriſt's church was never eſtabliſhed by blood, nor held up by priſons; neither was the foundation of it laid by carnal armed men, nor is it preſerved by ſuch. When men went from the Spirit and truth, they took up carnal weapons to maintain their outward forms, and yet cannot preſerve them with their carnal weapons; for one plucketh down another's form with his outward weapons. And this work hath been among the Chriſtians in name ſince they loſt the Spirit, and ſpiritual weapons, and the true worſhip which Chriſt ſet up, that is in the Spirit and in the truth; which Spirit and truth they that worſhip in are over all the tares. All that would be plucking up the tares are forbidden by Chriſt, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; for the tares and the wheat muſt grow together till the harveſt, as Chriſt hath commanded. The ſtone that ſmote the image became a great mountain, and ſilled the whole earth: now if the ſtone do fill the whole earth, all nations muſt be temples for the ſtone. All that ſay they travail for the ſeed, and yet bring forth nothing but a birth of ſtrife, contention, and confuſion, their fruit ſhews their travail to be wrong; for by the fruit the end of every one's work is ſeen of what ſort it is.</p>

                     <q>Whether the church of Rome was not degenerated from the church in the primitive times, from the Spirit, power, and practice that they were in in the apoſtles times?</q> He to whom I put this queſtion, being ſubtle, ſaid, <q>He would not anſwer it.</q> I aſked him, Why? But he would ſhew no reaſon. His companion ſaid, he would anſwer me; and ſaid, <q>They were not degenerated from the church in the primitive times.</q> I aſked the other, <q>Whether he was of the ſame mind? He ſaid, Yes. Then I replied, for the better underſtanding one another, and that there might be no miſtake, I would repeat my queſtion over again after this manner: Whether the church of Rome now was in the ſame purity, practice, power, and Spirit, that the church in the apoſtles time was in?</q> When they ſaw we would be exact with them, they flew off, and denied that, ſaying, <q>It was preſumption in any to ſay they had the ſame power and Spirit which the apoſtles had.</q> I told them, It was preſumption in them to meddle with the words of Chriſt and his apoſtles, and make people believe they ſucceeded the apoſtles, yet be forced to confeſs, <q>They were not in the ſame power and Spirit that the apoſtles were in:</q> This, ſaid I, is a ſpirit of preſumption, and rebuked by the apoſtles Spirit. I ſhewed them how different their fruits and practices were from the fruits and practices of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. Then got up one of them, and ſaid, <q>Ye are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of dreamers.</q> Nay, ſaid I, ye are the filthy dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who dream ye are the apoſtles ſucceſſors, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <q>Ye have not the ſame power and Spirit which the apoſtles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then I began to tell them how that evil ſpirit, which they were led by, had led them to pray by beads and to images, and to ſet up nunneries, fria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and monaſteries, and to put people to death for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which practice I ſhewed them was below the law, and far ſhort of the goſpel, in which is liberty. They were ſoon weary of this diſcourſe, and went their way, and gave a charge, as we heard, to the Papiſts, <q>That they ſhould not diſpute with us, nor read any of our books.</q> So we were rid of them; but we had reaſonings with all the other
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:037441_0517_100D9161C52A72E0"/>ſects, Preſbyterians, Independents, Seekers, Baptiſts, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal-men Socinians, Browniſts, Lutherans, Calviniſts, Arminians, Fifth-monarchy-men, Familiſts, Muggletonians, and Ranters; none of which would affirm they had the ſame power and Spirit that the apoſtles had and were in; ſo in that power and Spirit the Lord gave us dominion over them all.</p>
                  <p>As for the Fifth-monarchy-men I was moved to give forth a paper, to manifeſt their error to them; for they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Chriſt's perſonal coming in an outward form and manner, and fixed the time to the year 1666; at which time ſome of them prepared themſelves when it thundered and rained, thinking Chriſt was then come to ſet up his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and they imagined they were to kill the whore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. But I told them the whore was alive in them, and was not burned with God's fire, nor judged in them with the ſame power and Spirit the apoſtles were in. And their looking for Chriſt's coming outwardly to ſet up his kingdom, was like the Phariſees 'Lo here,' and 'Lo there.' But Chriſt was come and had ſet up his kingdom above ſixteen hundred years ago (according to Nebuchadnezzar's dream and Daniel's prophecy) and he had daſhed to pieces the four monarchies, the great image, with its head of gold, breaſt and arms of ſilver, belly and thighs of braſs, legs of iron, and feet part of iron part of clay; and they were all blown away with God's wind, as the chaff in the ſummer threſhing-floor. And when Chriſt was on earth, he ſaid, His kingdom was not of this world: if it had, his ſervants would have fought; but it was not, therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſervants did not fight. Therefore all the Fifth-monarchy men, that are fighters with carnal weapons, are none of Chriſt's ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, but the beaſt's and the whore's. Chriſt ſaid, <q>All power in heaven and in earth is given to me;</q> ſo then his kingdom was ſet up above ſixteen hundred years ago, and he reigns. And we ſee Jeſus Chriſt reign, ſaid the apoſtle, and he ſhall reign till all things be put under his feet; tho' all things are not yet put under his feet, nor ſubdued.</p>

                  <p>THIS year ſeveral friends were moved to go beyond ſea, to publiſh truth in foreign countries. John Stubbs, Henry Fell, and Richard Coſtrop were moved to go towards China and Preſter John's country; but no maſters of ſhips would carry them. With much ado they got a warrant from the king; but the Eaſt-India company found ways to avoid it, and the maſters of their ſhips would not carry them. Then they went into Holland, hoping to have got paſſage there; but no paſſage could they get there neither. Then John Stubbs and Henry Fell took ſhipping for Alexandria in Egypt, intending to go by the caravans from thence. Meanwhile Daniel Baker being to go to Smyrna, drew Richard Coſtrop, contrary to his own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, along with them; and in the paſſage, Richard falling ſick, D. Baker left him ſick in the ſhip; where he died: but that hard-hearted man afterwards loſt his own condition.</p>
                  <p>John Stubbs and Henry Fell got to Alexandria; but they had not been long there before the Engliſh conſul baniſhed them from thence; yet before they came away, they diſperſed many books and papers for the opening the principles and way of truth to the Turks and Grecians.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037441_0520_100D9165F4571FC8"/>They gave the book called, 'The Pope's ſtrength broken,' to an old friar, for him to give or ſend to the pope; which book, when the friar had peruſed, he clapped his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

John had a viſion that the Engliſh and Dutch, who had joined together not to carry them, <q>would fall out one with the other.</q> And ſo it came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Having ſtaid in London ſome time. I felt drawings to viſit friends in Eſſex. I went to Colcheſter, where I had very large meetings, and from thence to Coggeſhall; not far from which there was a prieſt convinced, and I had a meeting at his houſe. So travelling a little in thoſe parts, viſiting friends in their meetings, I returned pretty quickly to London, where I ſound great ſervice for the Lord; for a large door was opened, many ſlocked in to our meetings, and the Lord's truth ſpread mightily this year. Yet friends had great travail and fore labour, the rude people having been ſo heightened by the Monarchy-men's riſing a little before. But the Lord's power was over all, and in it friends had dominion though we had not only thoſe ſufferings without, but ſufferings within alſo, by John Perrot and his company; who giving heed to a ſpirit of deluſion, ſought to introduce among friends that evil and uncomely practice of 'keeping on the hat in the time of publick prayers.' Friends had ſpoken to him and divers of his followers about it, and I had written to them concerning it; but he and ſome others rather ſtrengthened themſelves againſt us. Wherefore feeling the judgment of truth riſe againſt it, I gave forth the following lines, as a warning to all concerned therein.</p>

When the woman was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the jury preſented the child heir to its father's lands, and accordingly the child was admitted; afterwards another friend married the widow. And after that, a perſon near of kin to her former huſband, brought his action againſt the friend who had laſt married her, endeavouring to diſpoſſeſs them, and deprive the child of the inheritance, and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf thereof, as next heir to the woman's firſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. To effect this, he endeavoured to prove the child illegitimate, alleging, <q>The marriage was not according to law.</q> In opening the cauſe, the plaintiff's counſel uſed unſeemly words concerning friends, ſaying, <q>they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like brute beaſts,</q> with other ill expreſſions. After the counſel on both ſides had pleaded, the judge, (viz. judge Archer) took the matter in hand, and opened it to them, telling them, <q>There was a marriage in paradiſe when Adam took Eve, and Eve took Adam, and that it was the conſent of the parties that made a marriage. And for the Quakers (he ſaid) he did not know their opinions; but he did not believe they went together as brute beaſts, as had been ſaid of them, but as Chriſtians; and therefore he did believe the marriage was lawful, and the child lawful heir.</q> The better to ſatisfy the jury, he brought them a caſe to this purpoſe, <q>A man that was weak of body, and kept his bed, had a deſire in that condition to marry, and did declare before witneſſes, that he did take ſuch a woman to be his wife, and the woman declared that ſhe took that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037441_0522_100D916A64FEC788"/>man to be her huſband. This marriage was afterwards called in queſtion, (and as the judge ſaid) all the biſhops did conclude it to be a lawful marriage.</q> Hereupon the jury gave in their verdict for the friend's child againſt the man that would have deprived it of its inheritance.</p>
                  <p>About this time the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy were tendered to friends as a ſnare, becauſe it was known we could not ſwear, and thereupon many were impriſoned, and divers premunired.

                  <p>There were two of our friends in priſon in the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Malta, both women; Catherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. I was told that one called the Lord D'Aubeny could procure their liberty; wherefore I went to him: and having informed him concerning their impriſonment, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to write to the magiſtrates there for their releaſe. He readily promiſed me he would; and ſaid, <q>If I would come again within a month he would acquaint me of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</q> I went again about that time, and he ſaid, <q>He
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037441_0525_100D9170F4A1DC98"/>thought his letters had miſcarried, becauſe he had received no anſwer.</q> But he promiſed he would write again, and did ſo; whereupon they were ſet at liberty.</p>
                  <p>With this great man I had a great deal of reaſoning about religion, and he confeſſed that <q>Chriſt hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened every man that cometh into the world with his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light; that he had taſted death for every man: that the Grace of God, which brings ſalvation, hath appeared to all men; and that it would teach them, and bring their ſalvation, if they did obey it.</q> I aſked him, What would they (the Papiſts) do with all their relicks and images, if they ſhould own and believe in this light, and receive the grace to teach them and bring their ſalvation? He ſaid, <q>Thoſe things were but policies to keep people in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> Very free he was in diſcourſe. I never heard a Papiſt confeſs ſo much as he did. Tho' ſeveral about the court began to grow kind to friends, yet the perſecution was very hot, and ſeveral friends died in priſon. Whereupon I gave forth a little paper concerning the grounds and riſe of perſecution; which was thus:</p>

                        <p>ALL the ſufferings of the people of God in all ages were becauſe they could not join to the national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions and worſhips which men have made and ſet up, and becauſe they would not forſake God's religion and his worſhip which he had ſet up. You may ſee through all chronicles and hiſtories, that the prieſts joined with the powers of the nations; the magiſtrates, ſooth-ſayers, and fortune-tellers, all joined againſt the people of God, and did imagine vain things againſt them in their councils. When the Jews did wickedly, they turned againſt Moſes; when the Jewiſh kings tranſgreſſed the law of God, they perſecuted the prophets; as may be ſeen in the prophets writings. When Chriſt, the ſubſtance, came, the Jews perſecuted Chriſt, his apoſtles, and diſciples. And when the Jews had not power enough of themſelves to perſecute anſwerable to their wills, then they got the heathen Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to help them againſt Chriſt, and againſt his apoſtles and diſciples, who were in the Spirit and power of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>After I had made ſome ſtay in London, and had cleared myſelf of what lay upon me there, I went into the country, having with me Alexander Parker and John Stubbs. We
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037441_0526_100D9172F1BE9A98"/>travelled through the country, viſiting friends meetings, till we came to Briſtol. There we underſtood, that the officers were likely to come and break up the meeting; yet on firſt-day we went to the meeting at Broad-mead, and Alexander Parker ſtanding up firſt, while he was ſpeaking, the officers came and took him away. After he was gone, I ſtood up and declared the everlaſting truth of the Lord God in his eternal power, which came over all, and the meeting was quiet the reſt of the time, and broke up peaceably. I tarried till firſt-day following, viſiting friends, and being viſited by friends. On firſt-day morning ſeveral friends came to Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pyot's (where I lay the night before) and uſed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſuade me not to go to the meeting that day; for the magiſtrates had threatened to take me, and had raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the trained-bands. I wiſhed them to go to the meeting, not telling them what I intended to do; but I told Edward Pyot I intended to go, and he ſent his ſon to ſhew me the way from his houſe by the fields. As I went I met divers friends, who did what they could to ſtop me: 'What,' ſaid one, 'wilt thou go into the mouth of the beaſt?' 'Wilt thou go into the mouth of the dragon?' ſaid another. I put them by and went on. When I came to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Margaret Thomas was ſpeaking. When ſhe had done, I ſtood up. I ſaw a concern and fear upon friends for me; but the power of the Lord, in which I declared, ſoon ſtruck the fear out of them. Life ſprang, and an heavenly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meeting we had. After I had cleared myſelf of what was upon me from the Lord to the meeting, I was moved to pray, and after prayer to ſtand up again, and tell friends, <q>Now they might ſee there was a God in Iſrael that could deliver.</q> A very large meeting this was, and very hot; but truth was over all, and the life was exalted which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through all, and the meeting broke up in peace. The officers and ſoldiers had been breaking up another meeting, which had taken up their time; ſo that our meeting was ended before they came. But I underſtood afterwards they were in a great rage, becauſe they had miſſed me; for they were heard to ſay one to another before, <q>I'll warrant we ſhall have him;</q> but the Lord prevented them. I went to Joan Hily's, where many friends came to ſee me; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing and bleſſing God for our deliverance. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had a fine freſh meeting at a friend's houſe over the water, where we were much refreſhed in the Lord. After this I ſtaid moſt part of that week in Briſtol, and at Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037441_0527_100D9174B541F4F8"/>Pyot's. Edward was brought ſo low and weak with an ague, that when I firſt came he was looked upon as a dying man; but it pleaſed the Lord to raiſe him up again, ſo that, before I went away, his ague left him, and he was ſinely well.</p>
                  <p>Having been two firſt-days at the meeting at Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead. and feeling my ſpirit clear of Briſtol. I went next firſt-day to a meeting in the country not far diſtant. And after the meeting. ſome friends from Briſtol told me, the ſoldiers that day had beſet the meeting-houſe round at Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, and then went up, ſaying. <q>They would be ſure to have me now;</q> but when they found me not there, they were in a great rage, and kept friends in the meeting-houſe moſt part of the day before they would let them go home; and queried of them, Which way I was gone, and how 'they might ſend after me? For the mayor,' they ſaid, 'would fain have ſpoken with me.' I had a viſion of a great maſtiff dog, that would have bit me; but I put one hand above his jaws, and the other hand below, and tore his jaws in pieces. So the Lord by his power tore their power to pieces, and made way for me to eſcape them. Then I paſſed through the country, viſiting friends in Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and Berkſhire, till I came to London, having great meetings amongſt friends as I went. The Lord's power was over all, and a bleſſed time it was for the ſpreading of his glorious truth. It was indeed the immediate power of the Lord that preſerved me out of their hands at Briſtol, and over the heads of all our perſecutors; and the Lord alone is worthy of all the glory, who did uphold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for his name and truth's ſake.</p>
                  <p>At London I ſtaid not long, being drawn in ſpirit to viſit friends northward as far as Leiceſterſhire. John Stubbs was with me. We travelled down, having meetings amongſt friends as we went; and at Skegby we had a great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thence we came to Barnet-hills, where lived captain Brown, a Baptiſt, whoſe wife was convinced of truth. This captain Brown, after the act for 'breaking up meetings' came forth, being afraid his wife ſhould go to meetings, and be caſt into priſon, left his houſe at Barrow, and took a place on theſe hills, ſaying, 'His wife ſhould not go to priſon.' And this being a free place, many prieſts and others fled thither as well as he. But he, who would neither ſtand to truth himſelf nor ſuffer his wife, was in this place, where he thought himſelf ſafe, found out by the Lord, whoſe hand
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037441_0528_100D9176B17894D0"/>fell heavy upon him for his unfaithfulneſs; ſo that he was ſorely plagued, and grievouſly judged in himſelf for flying and drawing his wife into that private place. We went to ſee his wife, and being in the houſe, I aſked him, how he did? 'How do I!' ſaid he, <q>The plagues and vengeance of God are upon me, a runagate, a Cain as I am. God may look for a witneſs for me, and ſuch as me; for if all were not faithfuller than I, God would have no witneſs left in the earth.</q> In this condition he lived on bread and water, and thought it was too good for him. At length he got home again with his wife to his own houſe at Barrow, where afterwards he was convinced of God's eternal truth, and died in it. A little before his death he ſaid, <q>Though he had not borne a teſtimony for truth in his life, he would bear a teſtimony in his death, and would be buried in his orchard;</q> and was ſo. He was an example to all the flying Baptiſts in the time of perſecution, who could not bear perſecution themſelves, yet perſecuted us when they had power.</p>
                  <p>From Barnet-hills we came to Swanington, in Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where William Smith and ſome, other friends viſited me; but went away towards night, leaving me at a friend's houſe in Swanington. At night, as I was ſitting in the hall, ſpeaking to a widow-woman and her daughter, lord Beaumont came with a company, of ſoldiers, who, ſlapping their ſwords on the door, ruſhed into the houſe with ſwords and piſtols in their hands, crying, <q>Put out the candles, and make faſt the doors.' Then they ſeized upon the friends in the houſe, and aſked, If there were no more about the houſe?</q> The friends told them, there was one man more in the hall. There being ſome friends out of Derbyſhire, one of them was named Thomas Fauks; lord Beaumont, after he had aſked all their names, bid his man ſet down that man's name Thomas Fox. The friend ſaid, Nay, his name was not Fox, but Fauks. In the mean time ſome of the ſoldiers came, and fetched me out of the hall to him. He aſked my name. I told him my name was George Fox, and that I was well known by that name. 'Aye,' ſaid he, 'you are known all the world over.' I ſaid, I was known for no hurt, but for good. Then he put his hands into my pockets to ſearch them, and plucked out my comb-caſe, and afterwards commanded one of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to ſearch further for letters. I told him, I was no let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-carrier, and aſked him, Why he came amongſt a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037441_0529_100D917998752778"/>people with ſwords and piſtols, without a conſtable, contrary to the king's proclamation and to the late act? For he could not ſay, there was a meeting, I being only talking with a poor widow-woman and her daughter. By reaſoning thus with him, he came ſomewhat down; yet ſending for the conſtables, he gave them charge of us that night, and to bring us before him next morning. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the conſtables ſet a watch of the town's people upon us that night, and had us next morning to his houſe about a mile from Swanington. When we came before him, he told us, 'We met contrary to the Act.' I deſired him to ſhew us the act. 'Why,' ſays he, <q>you have it in your pocket.</q> I told him, he did not find us in a meeting. Then he aſked, <q>Whether we would take the oaths of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and ſupremacy?</q> I told him, I never took any oath in my life, nor engagement, nor the covenant. Yet ſtill he would force the oath upon us. I deſired him to ſhew us the oath, that we might ſee whether we were the perſons it was to be tendered to, and whether it was not for the diſcovery of popiſh recuſants. At length he brought a little book, but we called for the ſtatute-book. He would not ſhew us that, but cauſed a mittimus to be made, which mentioned, 'That we were to have had a meeting.' With this mittimus he delivered us to the conſtables to convey us to Leiceſter gaol. But when the conſtables had brought us back to Swanington, being harveſt-time, it was hard to get any body to go with us. The people were loth to take their neighbours to priſon, eſpecially in ſuch a buſy time. They would have given us our mittimus to have carried ourſelves to the gaol; for it had been uſual for conſtables to give friends their own mittimuſes, and they have gone themſelves with them to the gaoler. But we told them, though our friends had ſometimes done ſo, we would not take this mittimus; but ſome of them ſhould go with us to the gaol. At laſt they hired a poor labouring man, who was loth to go, though hired. So we rode to Leiceſter, being five in number; ſome carried their bible<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> open in their hands, declaring truth to the people as we rode in the fields and through the towns, and telling them, <q>We were priſoners of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, going to ſuffer bonds for his name and trutl ſake.</q> One woman friend carried her wheel on her lap to ſpin on in priſon, and the people were mightily affected. At Leiceſter we went to an inn, The maſter of the houſe ſeemed to be troubled that we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037441_0530_100D917B28240FE0"/>ſhould go to priſon; and being himſelf in commiſſion, he ſent for lawyers in the town to adviſe with, and would have taken up the mittimus, and kept us in his own houſe, and not have let us gone into the gaol. But I told friends, it would be great charge to lie at an inn, many friends and people would come to viſit us, and it might be hard for him to bear meetings in his houſe: beſides, we had many friends in the priſon already, and we had rather be with them. So we let the man know we were ſenſible of his kindneſs, and to priſon we went; the poor man that brought us thither delivering both the mittimus and us to the gaoler. This gaoler had been a very wicked, cruel man. Six or ſeven friends being in priſon before we came, he had taken ſome occaſion to quarrel with them, and had thruſt them into the dungcon amongſt felons, where was hardly room for them to lie down. We ſtaid all that day in the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. and deſired the gaoler to let us have ſome ſtraw. He ſurlily anſwered, <q>You do not look like men that would lie on ſtraw.</q> After awhile William Smith came to me, and being acquainted in the houſe, I aſked him, What rooms were in the houſe, and what rooms friends had been uſually put in before they were put into the dungeon? I aſked him alſo, Whether the gaoler or his wife was maſter? He ſaid, The wife was maſter; and though ſhe was lame, and ſate moſtly in her chair, not being able to go but on crutches, yet ſhe would beat her huſband when he came within her reach, if he did not as ſhe would have him. I conſidered that many friends might probably come to viſit us, and if we had a room to ourſelves, it would be better for them to ſpeak to me, and for me to ſpeak to them in, as there ſhould be occaſron. Wherefore I deſired William Smith to ſpeak with the woman, and acquaint her, if ſhe would let us have a room, ſuffer our friends to come out of the dungeon, and leave it to us to give her what we would, it might be better for her. He went, and after ſome reaſoning with her ſhe conſented; and we were had into a room. Then we were told, The gaoler would not ſuffer us to have any drink out of the town into the priſon, but what beer we drank we muſt take of him. I told them, I would remedy that if they would; for we would get a pail of water, and a little wormwood once a day, and that might ſerve us; ſo we ſhould have none of his beer, and the water he could not deny us.</p>
                  <p>Before we came, when thoſe ſew friends that were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037441_0531_100D917CC210F610"/>met together on firſt-days, if any of them was moved to pray to the Lord, the gaoler would come up with his quarter-ſtaff in his hand, and his maſtiff-dog at his heels, and pluck them down by the hair of the head, and ſtrike them with his ſtaff; but when he ſtruck friends, the maſtiff<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dog, inſtead of falling upon them, would take the ſtaff out of his hand. When firſt-day came, I ſpoke to one of my fellow-priſoners to carr, a ſtool and ſet it in the yard, and give notice to the debtors and felons that there would be a meeting in the yard, and they that would hear the word of the Lord declared might come thither. So the priſoners gathered in the yard, and we went down and had a very precious meeting, the gaoler not meddling. Thus every firſt-day we had a meeting as long as we ſtaid in priſon, and ſeveral came out of the town and country. Many were convinced, and ſome received the Lord's truth there, who ſtood faithful witneſſes for it ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>When the ſeſſions came, we were brought before the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, with more friends, to the number of about twenty. Being brought into the court, the gaoler put us in the place where the thieves were, and ſome of the juſtices began to tender the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy to us. I told them, I never took any oath in my life; and they knew we could not ſwear, becauſe Chriſt and his apoſtle forbad it: therefore they put it but as a ſnare to us. We told them, if they could prove, that after Chriſt and the apoſtle had forbid ſwearing, they did ever command Chriſtians to ſwear, we would take theſe oaths; otherwiſe we were reſolved to obey Chriſt's command and the apoſtle's exhortation. They ſaid, <q>We muſt take the oath, that we might manifeſt our allegiance to the king.</q> I told them, I had been formerly ſent priſoner by col. Hacker from that town to London, under pretence that I held meetings to plot to bring in king Charles. I alſo deſired them to read our mittimus, which ſet forth the cauſe of our commitment to be, that 'we were to have a meeting;' and I ſaid, lord Beaumont could not by that act ſend us to gaol, unleſs we had been taken at a meeting, and found to be ſuch perſons as the act ſpeaks of; therefore we deſired they would read the mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, and ſee how wrongfully we were impriſoned. They would not take notice of the mittimus; but called a jury, and indicted us <q>for refuſing to take the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy.</q> When the jury was ſworn and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they were going out, one who had been an alderman
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037441_0532_100D917EB9CA5B78"/>of the city bid them, 'Have a good conſcience;' and one of the jury, being a peeviſh man, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d the juſtices, there was one affronted the jury; whereupon they called him up, and tendered him the oath alſo, which he to.</p>
                  <p>While we were ſtanding where the thieves uſed to ſtand, a cut-purſe had his hand in ſeveral friends pockets. Friends declared it to the juſtices, and ſhewed them the man. They called him up before them, and upon examination he could not deny it; yet they ſet him at liberty.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before the jury returned, and brought us in guilty; and after ſome words, the juſtices whiſpered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bid the gaoler take us to priſon again; but the Lord's power was over them, and his everlaſting truth, which we declared boldly amongſt them. There being a great concourſe of people, moſt of them followed us; ſo that the crier and bailiffs were fain to call the people back again to the court. We declared the truth as we went along the ſtreets, till we came to the gaol, the ſtreets being full of people. When we were in our chamber again, after ſome time the gaoler came to us, and deſired all to go forth that were not priſoners. When they were gone, he ſaid, <q>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, it is the court's pleaſure that ye ſhould be ſet at liberty, except thoſe that are in for tithes: and you know there are fees due to me; but I ſhall leave it to you to give me what you will.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we were all ſet at liberty on a ſudden, and paſſed every one into our ſervices. Leonard Fell went with me again to Swanington. I had a letter from lord Haſtings, who hearing of my impriſonment had wrote from London to the juſtices of the ſeſſions to ſet me at liberty. I had not delivered this letter to the juſtices; but whether they had any knowledge of his mind from any other hand, which made them diſcharge us ſo ſuddenly, I know not. But his letter I carried to lord Beaumont, who ſent us to priſon; and when he had broke it open and read it, he ſeemed much troubled; but at laſt came a little lower; yet threatened us, if we had any more meetings at Swanington, he would break them up and fend us to priſon again. But notwithſtanding his threats we went to Swanington, and had a meeting with friends there, and he neither came nor ſent to break it up.</p>
                  <p>From Swanington we came to Twy-croſs, where that great man formerly mentioned, whom the Lord raiſed up from his ſickneſs in the year 1649 (whoſe ſerving-man came at me with a drawn ſword to have done me a miſchief) and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037441_0533_100D9180B2199F60"/>his wife came to ſee me. From thence we travelled through Warwickſhire, where we had brave meetings; and into Northamptonſhire and Bedfordſhire, viſiting friends till we came to London.</p>
                  <p>I ſtaid not long in London, but went into Eſſex, and ſo to Norſolk, having great meetings. At Norwich, when I came to captain Lawrence's, there was a great threatening of diſturbance; but the meeting was quiet. Paſſing from thence to Sutton, and into Cambridgeſhire, I heard of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burrough's deceaſe. And being ſenſible how great a grief and exerciſe it would be to friends to part with him, I wrote the following lines for the ſtaying and ſettling of their minds.</p>

                  <p>From thence I paſſed to Little-port and the Iſle of Ely; where one that had been the mayor, with his wife, and the wife of the then preſent mayor of Cambridge, came to the meeting. Travelling into Lincolnſhire and Huntingdon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. I came to Thomas Parnel's, where the mayor of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon came to ſee me, and was very loving. From thence I came into the Fen-country, where we had large and quiet meetings. While I was in that country, there came ſo great a flood, that it was dangerous to go out; yet we did get out, and went to Lynn, where we had a bleſſed meeting. Next morning I went to viſit ſome priſoners there; then back to the inn, and took horſe. As I was riding out of the yard, the officers came to ſearch the inn for me. I knew nothing of it then, only I felt a great burden come upon me as I rode out of the town, till I was got without the gates. When ſome friends that came after overtook me, they told me their officers had been ſearching for me in the inn, as ſoon as I was gone out of the yard. So by the good hand of the Lord I eſcaped their cruel hands. After this we paſſed through the countries, viſiting friends in their meetings.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037441_0534_100D9182F7F4BCD0"/>The Lord's power carried us over the perſecuting ſpirits, and through many dangers; and his truth ſpread and grew, and friends were eſtabliſhed therein: praiſes and glory to his name for ever!</p>
                  <p>Having paſſed through Norfolk, Suffolk, Eſſex, and Hertfordſhire, we came to London again; where I ſtaid awhile, viſiting friends in their meetings, which were very large, and the Lord's power was over all. After ſome time I left the city, and travelled into Kent, having Thomas Briggs with me. We went to Aſhford, where we had a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and a very bleſſed meeting. On firſt-day we bad a very good and peaceable meeting at Cranbrook. Then we went to Tenterden, and had a meeting there, to which friends came from ſeveral parts; and many other people came in and were reached by the truth. When the meeting was done, I walked with Thomas Briggs into a cloſe, while our horſes were getting ready; and turning my head, I eſpied a captain coming, and a great company of ſoldiers with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matches and muſkets. Some of the ſoldiers came to Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas and me, and ſaid, 'We muſt go to their captain.' When they had brought us before him, he aſked, <q>Where was George Fox? Which was he? I ſaid, I am the man.</q> 
                     <q>Then he came to me, and was ſomewhat ſtruck, and ſaid, I will ſecure you among the ſoldiers.</q> So he called for the ſoldiers to take me. Then he took Thomas Briggs and the man of the houſe, with many more; but the power of the Lord was mightily over them all. Then he came to me again, and ſaid, 'I muſt go along with him to the town;' and he carried himſelf pretty civilly, bidding the ſoldiers bring the reſt after. As we walked, I aſked him, <q>Why they did thus? for I had not ſeen ſo much ado a great while;</q> and I bid him be civil to his peaceable neighbours. When we were come to the town, they had us to an inn that was the gaoler's houſe. After awhile the mayor of the town, this captain, and the lieutenant, who were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, came together and examined me, <q>Why I came thither to make a diſturbance?</q> I told them, I did not come to make a diſturbance, neither had I made any diſturbance ſince I came. They ſaid, <q>There was a law againſt the Quakers meetings, made only againſt them.</q> I told them, I knew no ſuch law. Then they brought the act made againſt Qurakers and others. I told them, that was againſt ſuch as were a <q>terror to the king's ſubjects, who were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and held principles dangerous to the government;</q>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037441_0535_100D9184906E67D8"/>and therefore it was not againſt us, for we held the truth; our principles were not dangerous, and our meeting were peaceable, as they knew, who knew their neighbours were a peaceable people. They told me, <q>I was an enemy to the king.</q> I anſwered, We loved all people, were enemies to none, and that I had been caſt into Derby dungcon about the time of Worceſter fight, becauſe I would not take up arms againſt him; and that I was afterwards brought by colonel Hacker to London, as a plotter to bring in king Charles, and was kept priſoner at London till I was ſet at liberty by Oliver. They aſked me, <q>Whether I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the time of the inſurrection?</q> I ſaid, Yes; I had been impriſoned then and ſince, and had been ſet at liberty by the king's own command. I opened the act to them, ſhewed them the king's late declaration, gave them the examples of other juſtices, and told them alſo what the houſe of lords had ſaid of it. I ſpoke alſo to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their own conditions, exhorting them to live in the fear of God, to be tender towards their neighbours that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and to mind God's wiſdom by which all things were made and created, that they might come to receive it, be ordered by it, and by it order all things to God's glory. They demanded bond of us for our appearance at the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but we, pleading our innocency, refuſed to give bond. Then they would have us promiſe to come no more there; but we kept clear of that alſo. When they ſaw they could not bring us to their terms, they told us, <q>We ſhould ſee they were civil to us, for it was the mayor's pleaſure we ſhould all be ſet at liberty.</q> I told them, their civility was noble; and ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p>Leaving Tenterden, we went to Newick in Suſſex, where we viſited ſome friends. From thence we paſſed through the country, ſiſiting friends, and having great meetings; all quiet and free from diſturbance (except by ſome jangling Baptiſts) till we came into Hampſhire. Where, after a good meeting at Southampton, we went to Pulner, in the pariſh of Ringwood, where was to be a monthly meeting next day, to which many friends reſorted from Southampton, Pool, and other places; and the weather being very hot, ſome came pretty early in the morning. I took a friend, and walked out with him into the orchard, enquiring of him how the affairs of truth ſtood amongſt them? (For many of them had been convinced by me before I was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in Cornwall.) While we were diſcourſing, a young
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037441_0536_100D9187204A47F8"/>man came and told us the trained bands were raiſing, and he heard they would break up the meeting. It was not yet meeting-time by about three hours, and there being other friends walking in the orchard, the friend I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with before deſired me to walk into a corn-field adjoining to it, which we did. After awhile, the young man that ſpoke of the trained bands left us, and when he was gone a pretty way he ſtood and waved his hat. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſpoke to the other young man that was with me to go ſee what he meant. He went, but came not to me again, for the ſoldiers were come into the orchard. As I kept walking I could ſee the ſoldiers, and ſome of them, as I heard afterwards, did ſee me, but had no mind to meddle. So the ſoldiers coming ſo long before meeting-time, did not tarry; but took what friends they found at the houſe, and ſome they met in the lane, and had them away. After they were gone, it drew towards the eleventh hour, friends began to come in apace, and a large and glorious meeting we had; for the everlaſting ſeed of God was ſet over all, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſettled in the new covenant of life, upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Chriſt Jeſus. Towards the latter end of the meeting there came a man in gay apparel, and looked in while I was declaring, and went away again preſently. This man came with an evil intent; for he went forthwith to Ringwood, and told the magiſtrates, <q>That they had taken two or three men at Pulner, and had left George Fox there preaching to two or three hundred.</q> Upon this the magiſtrates ſent the officers and ſoldiers again; but the meeting being near ended when the man looked in, and he having about a mile and a half to go with his information to fetch the ſoldiers, and they as far to come after they had received their orders, before they came our meeting was over; ending about the third hour peaceably and orderly. After the meeting, I ſpoke to the friends of the houſe where this was held (the woman of the houſe then lying dead in the houſe) and then ſome friends led me to another friend's at a little diſtance; where after we had refreſhed ourſelves, I took horſe, having about twenty miles to ride that afternoon to one— Frye's. in Wiltſhire, where a meeting was appointed to be held the next day.</p>
                  <p>After we were gone, the officers and ſoldiers came in a great heat, who finding they had miſſed their prey were much enraged; and the officers were offended with the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, becauſe they had not ſeized my horſe in the ſtable
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037441_0537_100D918969B667E0"/>the firſt time they came. But the Lord, by his good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, delivered me, and prevented their miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. For the officers were envious men, and had an evil mind againſt friends; but the Lord brought his judgments upon them, ſo that it was taken notice of by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For <q>as before they were wealthy men, after this their eſtates waſted away; and John Line, the conſtable, who was not only very forward in putting on the ſoldiers to take friends, but alſo carried thoſe that were taken to priſon, and took a falſe oath againſt them at the aſſize, upon which they were fined and continued priſoners, was a ſad ſpectacle to behold. For his fleſh rotting away while he lived, he died in a very miſerable condition, wiſhing he had never meddled with the Quakers, and confeſſing he never proſpered ſince he had an hand in perſecuting them; and that he thought the hand of the Lord was againſt him for it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At—Frye's in Wiltſhire we had a very bleſſed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and quiet, though the officers purpoſed to have broken it up, and were on their way in order thereunto. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were got to the meeting, word was brought them, <q>There was a houſe newly broken up by thieves, and they were required to go back again with ſpeed to ſearch after and purſue them;</q> by which means our meeting eſcaped diſturbance, and we were preſerved out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed through Wiltſhire into Dorſetſhire, having large and good meetings. The Lord's everlaſting power was with us, and carried us over all; in which we ſounded forth his ſaving truth and word of life, which many gladly received. Thus we viſited friends till we came to Topſham, in Devonſhire, travelling ſome weeks eight or nine ſcore miles a week, and had meetings every day. At Topſham we met with Margaret Fell and two of her daughters, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah and Mary, and with Leonard Fell and Thomas Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. From thence we paſſed to Totneſs, where we viſited ſome friends, and then to Kingſbridge, and to Henry Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexfen's, who had been an ancient juſtice of peace. There we had a large meeting. This old juſtice accompanied us to Plymouth, and into Cornwall, to juſtice Porter's, and from thence to Thomas Mount's, where we had a large meeting. After which we went to Humphry Lower's, where alſo we had a large meeting; and from thence to Loveday Hambley's, where we had a general meeting for the whole country: and all was quiet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:037441_0538_100D918AF9B06308"/>
A little before this, Joſeph Hellen, and G. Bewley had been at Loo to viſit Blanch Pope, a Ranting woman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to convince and convert her: but before they left her, ſhe had ſo darkened them with her principles, that they ſeemed to be like her diſciples, eſpecially Joſeph Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. She aſked them, <q>Who made the devil? Did not God?</q> This idle queſtion ſo puzzled them, they could not anſwer her. They afterwards aſked me the queſtion. I told them, No; for all that God made was good and was bleſt, ſo was not the devil. He was called a ſerpent before he was called a devil and an adverſary and then he had the title of devil given him. Afterwards he was called a dragon, becauſe he was a deſtroyer. The devil abode not in the truth: by departing from the truth he became a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. So the Jews, when they went out of the truth, were ſaid to be of the devil, and were called ſerpents. There is no promiſe of God to the devil, that ever he ſhall return into truth again; but to man and woman, who have been deceived by him, the promiſe of God is, that <q>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head;</q> ſhall break his power and ſtrength to pieces. When theſe things were opened more at large to the ſatisfaction of friends, thoſe two, who had let up the ſpirit of that ranting woman, were judged by the truth; and one of them, viz. Joſeph Hellen, ran quite out, and was denied by friends; but Georgo Bewly was recovered, and afterwards became ſerviceable.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed from Loveday Hambley's to Francis Hodges's, near Falmouth and Penryn, where we had a large meeting. From thence we went to Helſtone that night, where friends came to viſit us, and next day paſſed to Thomas Teage's, where we had a large meeting, at which many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. I was led to open <q>the ſtate of the church in the primitive times, the ſtate of the church in the wilderneſs, the ſtate of the falſe church that was got up ſince; and to ſhew, that now the everlaſting goſpel was preached over the head of the whore, beaſt, falſe prophets, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts, which had roſe up ſince the apoſtles days; and now the everlaſting goſpel was received and receiving, which brought life and immortality to light, that they might ſee over the devil who had darkened them.</q> The people received the goſpel and the word of life gladly, and a glorious bleſſed meeting we had for the exalting the Lord's everlaſting truth and his name. After it was done I walked out, and coming in again, I heard a noiſe in the court.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037441_0539_100D918D4B92D460"/>Approaching nearer, I found the man of the houſe ſpeaking to the tinners and others, telling them, It was the <q>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth that had been declared there that day;</q> and the people generally confeſſed to it.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed to the Land's-end to John Ellis's, where we had a precious meeting. Here was a fiſherman, Nicholas Joſe, that was convinced. He ſpoke in meetings, and declared the truth amongſt the people; and the Lord's power was over all. I was glad the Lord raiſed up his ſtandard in thoſe dark parts of the nation, where ſince there is a fine meeting of honeſt-hearted friends; many are come to ſit under Chriſt's teaching, and a great people the Lord will have in that country.</p>
                  <p>From thence we returned to Redruth, and the next day to Truro, where we had a meeting. Next morning, ſome of the chief of the town deſired to ſpeak with me, amongſt whom was colonel Rouſe. I went, and had a great deal of diſcourſe with them concerning the things of God. In their reaſoning they ſaid, <q>The goſpel was the four books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;</q> and they called it natural. I told them, the goſpel was the power of God, which was preached before Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John were written; and it was preached to every creature (of which a great part might never ſee nor hear of thoſe four books) ſo that every creature was to obey the power of God; for Chriſt, the Spiritual Man, would judge the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goſpel, that is, according to his inviſible power. When they heard this, they could not gainſay; for the truth came over them. I directed them to their teacher, the grace of God, and ſhewed them the ſufficiency of it, which would teach them how to live, and what to deny; and being obeyed would bring them ſalvation. So to that grace I recommended them, and left them.</p>
                  <p>Then we returned through the country, viſiting friends, and had meetings at Humphrey Lower's and Thomas Mount's. Afterwards at, George Hawkins's at Stoke we had a large meeting, to which friends came from Lanceſton and ſeveral other places. A living, precious meeting it was, in which the Lord's preſence and power was richly manifeſted amongſt us, and I left friends there under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's teaching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In Cornwall I was informed there was one colonel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon, a very wicked man, who after the king came in was made a juſtice of peace, and became a cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037441_0540_100D918FA1B13A98"/>of friends; of whom he ſent many to priſon. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had ſome little liberty, through the favour of the gaoler, to go home ſometimes to viſit their wives and children, he made great complaint thereof to the judge at the aſſize againſt the gaoler: whereupon the gaoler was fined an hundred marks and friends were kept very ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up for awhile. After he was come home from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize, he ſent to a neighbouring juſtice to deſire him to go a fanatick-hunting with him. He ſent his man about with his horſes, and walked himſelf on foot from his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe to a tenement where his cows and dairy were kept, and where his ſervants were then milking. When he came there, he aſked for his bull. The ſervant-maids ſaid, They had ſhut him into the field becauſe he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y, and hindered their milking. Then went he into the field to the bull; and having formerly accuſtomed himſelf to play with him he began to ſence at him with his ſtaff. But the bull ſnuffed at him, and paſſed a little back; then turning upon him again, ran fiercely at him, and ſtruck his horn into his thigh, and heaving him upon his horn, threw him over his back, and tore up his thigh to his belly. When he came to the ground again he gored him with his horns run them into the ground in his rage and violence, and roared, and licked up his maſter's blood. The maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, hearing her maſter cry out, ran into the field, and took the bull by the horns to pull him off from her maſter. The bull, without hurting her, put her gently by with his horns, but ſtill fell to goring of him, and licking up his blood. Then ſhe ran, and got ſome men that were at work not far off, to come and reſcue her maſter; but they could not at all beat off the bull, till they brought maſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogs to ſet on him; and then he fled in great rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Upon notice of it his ſiſter came, and ſaid to him, <q>Alack! brother, what a heavy judgment is this that is befallen you!</q> He anſwered, <q>Ah! ſiſter, it is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgment indeed.</q> Pray let the bull be killed, and the fleſh given to the poor, ſaid he. They carried him home; but he died ſoon after. The bull was grown ſo fierce, they were forced to ſhoot him with guns; for no man durſt come near to kill him. Thus does the Lord ſometimes make examples of his juſt judgment upon the perſecutors of his people, that others may fear, and learn to beware.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I had cleared myſelf of Cornwall, and Thomas
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037441_0541_100D9191B6D66FD8"/>Lower had brought us over Horſe-bridge into Devonſhire again, we took our leave of him. Thomas Briggs, Robert Widders, and I came to Tiverton. It being their fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and many friends there, we had a meeting amongſt them; and the magiſtrates gathered in the ſtreet, but the Lord's power ſtopped them. I ſaw them over againſt the door; but they had not power to come in to meddle with us, though they had will enough to have done it.</p>
                  <p>After the meeting we paſſed to Collumpton and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington; for we had appointed a meeting five miles off, where we had a large one at a butcher's houſe, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meeting it was. The people were directed to their Teacher, the Grace of God, which would bring them ſalvation, and many were ſettled under its teaching. The Lord's preſence was amongſt us, and we were refreſhed in him, in whom we laboured and travailed; and the meeting was quiet. There had been very great perſecution in that country, and in that town a little before, inſomuch that ſome friends queſtioned the peaceableneſs of our meeting; but the Lord's power chained all, and his glory ſhined over all. Friends told us, how they had broken up their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by warrants from the juſtices, and how by their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants they were required to carry friends before the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The friends bid them, Carry them then. The officers told them, they muſt Go; but they ſaid, Nay, that was not according to their warrants, which required them to carry them. Then they were forced to hire carts, waggons, and horſes, and to lift them into their waggons and carts to carry them before a juſtice. When they came to a juſtice's houſe, ſometimes he happened to be from home, or if he was a moderate man he would get out of the way, and then they were obliged to carry them before another; ſo that they were many days carting and carrying friends up and down from place to place. And when afterwards the officers came to lay their charges for this upon the town, the town's people would not pay it, but made them bear it themſelves, which broke the neck of their perſecution there for that time. The like was done in ſeveral other places, till the officers had ſhamed and tired themſelves, and then were glad to give over.</p>
                  <p>At one place they warned friends to come to the ſteeple-houſe. Friends met to conſider of it, and ſinding freedom to go, they met together there. They ſate down to wait upon the Lord in his power and Spirir and minded the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037441_0542_100D9193A48E2780"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Teacher and Saviour; but did not mind the prieſt. When the officers ſaw that, they came to them to put them out of the ſteeple-houſe again; but the friends told them, it was not time for them to break up their meeting yet. Awhile after, when the prieſt had done, they came to the friends again, and would have had them go home to dinner; but the friends told them, they did not chooſe to go to dinner, they were feeding upon the bread of life. So there they ſate, waiting upon the Lord, and enjoying his power and preſence, till they found freedom in themſelves to depart. Thus the prieſt's people were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, firſt becauſe they could not get them to the ſteeple-houſe, and when there, they were offended, becauſe they could not get them out again.</p>
                  <p>From the meeting near Collumpton we went to Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where we had a large meeting. The next day we came to a general meeting in Somerſetſhire, which was very large; and the Lord's everlaſting word of life and truth was largely declared. The people were refreſhed thereby, and ſettled upon Chriſt, their Rock and Foundation, and brought to ſit under his teaching; and the meeting was peaceable. About the ſecond hour of the night came a company of men, knocked at the door, and bid open it, or they would break it open; for they wanted a man that they came to ſearch the houſe for. I heard the noiſe, and got up, and ſaw a man at the door with his ſword by his ſide. When they had let him in, he came into the chamber where I was, and looked on me, and ſaid, <q>You are not the man I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for;</q> and went his way.</p>
                  <p>We came from thence to Street, and to William Beaton's at Puddimore, where we had a very large general meeting; wherein the Lord's everlaſting truth was declared, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple refreſhed, and all quiet. From thence we went to John Dandy's, where we had another large and very precious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then paſſed to Briſtol, where we had good ſervice for the Lord, and all quiet. Here we met with Margaret Fell and her daughters again. After ſome time we went to Slattenford in Wiltſhire, where was a very large meeting in a great barn. Good ſervice we had there; for the truth, as it is in Jeſus, was publiſhed amongſt them, and many were gathered by it into the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>After this I paſſed into Glouceſterſhire and Herefordſhire, having large meetings in each. In Hereford I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the inn; after which, and I was gone, the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037441_0543_100D919550D82DF8"/>hearing of it, came to ſearch the inn for me, and were vexed they had miſſed me. But the Lord ſo ordered it, that I eſcaped their hands, and friends were eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, their Foundation, the Rock of Ages.</p>
                  <p>Then I went into Radnorſhire, in Wales, where I had ſeveral precious meetings. The Lord's name and ſtandard was ſet up, many were gathered to it, and ſettled under the teaching of Chriſt Jeſus, their Saviour, who bought them.</p>
                  <p>After I was clear of Wales, I came to a market-town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt England and Wales, where was a great fair that day; and ſeveral friends being at the fair, we went to an inn, where they came to us. After a fine opportunity with friends we parted and went our way. The officers of the town took notice it ſeems, of our being there, and of friends gathering to us. They began alſo to get together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult how to enſnare us, though it was the fair-time; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could do any thing we were gone, and ſo eſcaped them.</p>
                  <p>From thence we came into Shropſhire, where we had a large and precious meeting. After many meetings in thoſe parts, we came into Warwickſhire, viſited friends there, and ſo into Derbyſhire and Staffordſhire, viſiting meetings as we went. At White-haugh we had a large bleſſed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and quiet; after which we took horſe, and rode about twenty miles that night to captain Lingard's. We heard afterwards, that when we were gone, the officers came to have ſeized us, and were much diſturbed they miſſed us; but the Lord diſappointed them, and friends were joyful in the Lord that we eſcaped them.</p>
                  <p>At captain Lingard's we had a bleſſed meeting, the Lord's preſence being wonderfully amongſt us. After which we paſſed thro' the Peak-country in Derbyſhire, and went to Synderhill-green, where we had a large meeting. Here John Whitehead and ſeveral friends came to me. Then I paſſed through the country, viſiting friends, till I came to the farther end of Holderneſs, and by Scarborough, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and Malton, to York, having many meetings in the way, and the Lord's everlaſting power was over all.</p>
                  <p>We went from york to Boroughbridge, where I had a glorious meeting. Thence we paſſed into the Biſhoprick to one Richmond's, where was a general meeting; and the Lord's power was over all, though people were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rude about this time. After the meeting we went to Henry Draper's, where we ſtaid all night. Next morning
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037441_0544_100D919851C1C6C0"/>a friend came as I was paſſing away, and told me, <q>If the prieſts and juſtices could light on me, they would deſtroy me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being clear of the Biſhoprick, I went over Stainmore into Yorkſhire, and to Sedberg; where having viſited friends, I went into Weſtmoreland, viſiting friends there alſo. From thence I paſſed into Lancaſhire, and came to Swarthmore, where I ſtaid but a little while before I went over the Sands to Arnſide; where I had a general meeting. After it was ended ſome men came to have broken it up, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding before they got thither the meeting was over, they turned back. I went to Robert Widders's, and from thence to Underbarrow, where I had a glorious meeting; and the Lord's power was ſet over all. From thence I paſſed to Grayrigg, viſited friends, and then to Ann Audland's, where they would have had me to have ſtay'd their meeting the next day; but I felt a ſtop in my Spirit. It was upon me to go to John Blaykling's, in Sedberg, to be at the meeting there; which is large, and a precious people there is. We had a very good meeting the next day; but the conſtables went to Ann Audland's meeting to look for me. Thus by the good hand and diſpoſing providence of the Lord I eſcaped their ſnare.</p>
                  <p>I went from John Blaykling's with Leonard Fell to Strickland-head, where on, firſt-day we had a very precious meeting on the common. That night we ſtaid amongſt our friends there, and the next day paſſed into Northumberland. After the juſtices heard of this meeting, they made ſearch for me; but by the good hand of the Lord I eſcaped them, though there were ſome very wicked juſtices. We went to Hugh Hutchinſon's, in Northumberland, a friend in the miniſtry, from whence we viſted friends thereabouts; and then to Derwent-water, where we had a very glorious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There came an ancient woman, and told me, her huſband remembered his love to me; ſhe ſaid I might call him to mind by this token, that I uſed to call him, <q>The tall white old man.</q> She ſaid, he was ſix ſcore and two years old, and that he would have come to the meeting, but that his horſes were all employed upon ſome urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I heard he lived ſome years after.</p>
                  <p>When I had viſited friends in thoſe parts, and they were ſettled upon Chriſt, their Foundation, I paſſed through Northumberland, and came to old Thomas Bewley's, in Cumberland. Friends came about me and aſked, <q>Would
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037441_0545_100D919A4923EF70"/>I come there to go into priſon?</q> For there was great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in that country at that time; yet I had a general meeting at Thomas Bewley's, which was large and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and the Lord's power was over all.</p>
                  <p>One Muſgrave was at that time deputy-governor of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle, and I paſſing along that country, came to a man's houſe that had been convinced, whoſe name was Fletcher; and he told me, <q>If Muſgrave knew I was there, he would be ſure to ſend me to priſon, he was ſuch a ſevere man.</q> But I ſtaid not, only called on the way to ſee this man, then went to William Pearſon's, near Wigton, where this meeting was, which was very large and precious. Some friends were then priſoners at Carliſle, whom I viſited by a letter, which Leonard Fell carried. From William Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's I viſited friends till I came to Pardſey-crag; where we had a general meeting, which was large, quiet, and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the glorious, powerful preſence of the everlaſting God was with us.</p>
                  <p>So eager were the magiſtrates about this time to ſtir up perſecution in thoſe parts, that ſome offered five ſhillings, ſome a noble a day, to any that could apprehend the ſpeakers amongſt Quakers; but it being now the time of the quarter-ſeſſions in that county, the men who were ſo hired were gone to the ſeſſions to get their w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ges, ſo all our meetings were at that time quiet.</p>
                  <p>From Pardſey-crag we went into Weſtomoreland, calling in the way upon Hugh Tickell, near Keſwick, and upon Thomas Laythes, where friends came to viſit us; and we had a fine opportunity to be refreſhed together. We went that night to Francis Benſon's, in Weſtmoreland, near juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Fleming's. This juſtice was at that time in a great rage againſt friends, and me in particular; inſomuch that in the open ſeſſions at Kendal, juſt before, he had bid <q>Five pounds to any man that ſhould take me,</q> as Francis Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon told me. And it ſeems, as I went to this friend's houſe, I met one man coming from the ſeſſions that had this five pounds offered him to take me, and he knew me; for as I paſſed by him, he ſaid to his companion, <q>That is George Fox:</q> yet he had not power to touch me; for the Lord preſerved me over them all. The juſtices being ſo eager to have me, and I being ſo often nigh them and you they miſſing me, it tormented them the more.</p>
                  <p>I went from thence to James Taylor's at Cartmel, in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037441_0546_100D919BD96B56E8"/>where I ſtaid firſt-day, and had a precious meeting. After which I came over the Sands to Swarthmore.</p>
                  <p>There they told me coloned Kirby had ſent his lieutenant, who had ſearched trunks and cheſts for me. That night as I was in bed, I was moved of the Lord to go next day to Kirby-hall, which was colonel Kirby's houſe about five miles off, to ſpeak with him. When I came thither, I found the Flemings, and ſeveral others of the gentry (ſo called) of the country, who were come to take their leave of colonel Kirby, he being then to go up to London to the parliament. I was had into the parlour amongſt them; but colonel Kirby was not then within, being gone out a little way. They ſaid little to me, nor I much to them. But after a little while colonel Kirby came in, and I told him, <q>I came to viſit him, underſtanding he was deſirous to ſee me, to know what he had to ſay to me, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had any thing againſt me?</q> He ſaid before all the company, <q>As he was a gentleman, he had nothing againſt me. But,</q> ſaid he, <q>miſtreſs Fell muſt not keep great meetings at her houſe, for they met contrary to the act.</q> I told him, <q>That act did not take hold on us, but on ſuch as <q>met to plot and contrive, and to raiſe inſurrections againſt the king;</q> whereas we we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> no ſuch people: for he knew they that met at Margaret Fell's were his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and a peaceable people.</q> After many words had paſſed, he ſhook me by the hand, and ſaid again, <q>He had nothing againſt me;</q> and others of them ſaid, <q>I was a deſerving man.</q> So we parted, and I returned to Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after, when colonel Kirby was gone to London, there was a private meeting of the juſtices and deputy-lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants at Houlker-hall, where juſtice Preſton lived; where they granted a warrant to apprehend me. I heard over night both of their meeting and of the warrant, and could have gone out of their reach if I would; for I had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any meeting at that time, and I had cleared myſelf of the north, and the Lord's power was over all. But I conſidered, there being a noiſe of a plot in the north, if I ſhould go away they might fall upon friends; but if I gave myſelf up to be taken, it might prevent them, and friends ſhould eſcape the better; ſo I gave myſelf up to be taken, and prepared againſt they came. Next day an officer came with his ſword and piſtols to take me. I told him, <q>I knew his errand before, and had given myſelf to be taken;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037441_0547_100D919DC8F3BF80"/>for if I would have eſcaped their impriſonment, I could have been forty miles off before he came; but I was an innocent man, and ſo mattered not what they could do to me.</q> He aſked me, <q>How I heard of it, ſeeing the order was made privately in a parlour?</q> I ſaid, it was no matter for that, it was ſufficient that I heard it. I aſked him to let me ſee his order; whereupon he laid his hand on his ſword, and ſaid, <q>I muſt go with him before the lieutenants, to anſwer ſuch queſtions as they ſhould propound to me.</q> I told him, it was but civil and reaſonable for him to let me ſee his order; but he would not. Then ſaid I, I am ready. So I went along with him, and Margaret Fell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied us to Houlker-hall. When we came thither, there was one Rawlinſon, a juſtice, and one called Sir George Middleton, and many more that I did not know, beſides old juſtice Preſton who lived there. They brought Thomas Atkinſon, a friend, of Cartmel, as a witneſs againſt me, for ſome words which he had told to one Knipe, who had informed them; which words were, <q>That I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the plotters, and had knocked them down.</q> Theſe words they could not make much of; for I told them I had heard of a plot and had written againſt it. Old Preſton aſked me, 'Whether I had an hand in that ſcript?' I aſked him what he meant? He ſaid, in the Battledore? I anſwered, Yes. Then he aſked me, <q>Whether I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand languages?</q> I ſaid, Sufficient for myſelf; and <q>that I knew no law that was tranſgreſſed by it. I told them alſo, That to underſtand thoſe outward languages, was no matter of ſalvation; for the many tongues began but at the confuſion of Babel: and if I did underſtand any thing of them, I judged and knocked them down again for any matter of ſalvation that was in them.</q> Thereupon he turned away, and ſaid, <q>George Fox knocks down all the languages. Come,</q> ſaid he, <q>we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine you of higher matters.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſaid George Middleton, <q>You deny God, and the church, and the faith.</q> I replied, <q>Nay: I own God, and the true church, and the true faith. But what church doſt thou own, ſaid I?</q> (for I underſtood he was a Papiſt.) Then he turned again, and ſaid, <q>You are a rebel and a traitor.</q> I aſked him, Whom he ſpoke to? or whom did he call a rebel? He was ſo full of envy, that for 02 awhile he could not ſpeak; but at laſt he ſaid, <q>He ſpoke it to me.</q> With that I ſtruck my hand on the table, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037441_0548_100D91A04CD2E1F8"/>told him, I had ſuffered more than twenty ſuch as he, or than any that were there; <q>for I had been caſt into Derby priſon for ſix months together, and had ſuffered much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not take up arms againſt the king before Worceſter fight. I had been ſent up priſoner out of my own country by colonel Hacker to O. Cromwel, as a plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring in K. Charles, in the year 1654; and I had nothing but love and good-will to the king, and deſired the eternal good and welfare of him and all his ſubjects. "Did you ever hear the like?". ſaid Middleton. Nay, ſaid I, ye may hear it again, if ye will. For ye talk of the king, a company of you; but where were ye in Oliver's days? and what did ye do then for him? I have more love to the king for his eternal good and welfare than any of you have.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then they aſked me, <q>Whether I had heard of the plot? I ſaid, Yes, I had heard of it.</q> They aſked me, <q>How I had heard of it? and whom I knew in it?</q> I told them, <q>I had heard of it through the high-ſheriff of Yorkſhire, who told Dr. Hodgſon there was a plot in the north;" that was the way I heard of it; but I never heard of any ſuch thing in the ſouth, nor till I came into the north. And as for knowing any in the plot, I was as a child in that, for I knew none of them.</q> Then they ſaid, <q>Why would you write againſt it, if you had not known ſome that were in it?</q> I ſaid, <q>My reaſon was, becauſe you are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to maſh the innocent and guilty together; therefore I wrote againſt it to clear the truth from ſuch things, and to ſtop all forward fooliſh ſpirits from running into ſuch things.</q> I ſent copies of it into Weſtmoreland, Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <q>Biſhoprick, Yorkſhire, and to you here. I ſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other copy of it to the king and his council, and it is like it may be in print by this time.</q> One of them ſaid, <q>O! this man hath great power!</q> I ſaid, Yes, I had power to write againſt plotters. Then ſaid one of them, <q>You are againſt the laws of the land.</q> I anſwered <q>Nay; for I and my friends direct all people to the Spirit of God in them, to mortify the deeds of the fleſh. This brings them into well-doing, and from that which the magiſtrates ſword is againſt, which eaſes the magiſtrates, who are for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of evil-doers. People being turned to the Spirit of God, which brings them to mortify the deeds of the fleſh, from under the occaſion of the magiſtrates ſword. This muſt needs be one with magiſtracy, and one with
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037441_0549_100D91A2375E7810"/>the law, which was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, and is for the praiſe of them that do well. In this we eſtabliſh the law, are an eaſe to the magiſtrates, and are not againſt but ſtand for all good government.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then George Middleton cried, <q>Bring the book, and put the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy to him.</q> He being a Papiſt, I aſked him, <q>Whether he had taken the oath of ſupremacy, who was a ſwearer? As for us, we could not ſwear at all, becauſe Chriſt and his apoſtle had forbidden it.</q> Some of them would not have had the oath put to me, but have ſet me at liberty. The reſt would not agree to it; for this was their laſt ſnare, and they had no other way to get me into priſon, as all other things had been cleared to them. This was like the Papiſts ſacrament of the altar, by which they enſnared the martyrs. So they tendered me the oath, which I could not take; whereupon they were about to make my mittimus to ſend me to Lancaſter gaol; but conſidering of it, they only engaged me to appear at the ſeſſions, and for that time diſmiſſed me. I went back with Margaret Fell to Swarthmore, and ſoon after colonel Weſt came to ſee me, who was-at that time a juſtice of peace. He told us, <q>He acquainted ſome of the reſt of the juſtices, that he would come and ſee Margaret Fell and me; but it may be,</q> ſaid he, 'ſome of you will take offence at it.' I aſked him, What he thought they would do with me at the ſeſſions? He ſaid, <q>They would tender the oath to me again.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was at Swarthmore, William Kirby came into Swarthmore meeting, and brought the conſtables with him. I was ſitting with friends in the meeting, and he ſaid to me, 'How now, Mr. Fox! you have a fine company here.' 'Yes,' ſaid I, 'we meet to wait upon the Lord.' So he began to take the names of friends, and thoſe that did not readily tell him their names, he committed to the conſtables hands, and ſent ſome to priſon. The conſtables were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take them without a warrant, whereupon he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to ſet them by the heels; but the conſtable told him, <q>He could keep them in his preſence, but after he was gone he could not keep them without a warrant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeſſions coming on, I went to Lancaſter, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared according to my engagement. There was upon the bench juſtice Fleming, who had bid five pounds in Weſt moreland to any man that would apprehend me; for he was a juſtice both in Weſtmoreland and Lancaſhire. There
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037441_0550_100D91A3CC6ACD70"/>were alſo juſtice Spencer, colonel Weſt, and old juſtice Rawlinſon, the lawyer, who gave the charge, and was very ſharp againſt truth and friends; but the Lord's power ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them. The ſeſſion was large, the concourſe of people great, and way being made for me, I came up to the bar, and ſtood with my hat on, they looking earneſtly upon me and I upon them for a pretty ſpace. Proclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <q>for all to keep ſilence upon pain of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</q> and all being quiet, I ſaid twice, <q>Peace be among you.</q> The chairman aſked, If I knew where I was? I ſaid, <q>Yes, I do; but it may be, ſaid I, my hat offends you. That's a low thing, that's not the honour that I give to magiſtrates, for the true honour is from above; which, ſaid I, I have received, and I hope it is not the hat which ye look upon to be the honour.</q> The chairman ſaid, 'They looked for the hat too,' and aſked, <q>Wherein I ſhewed my reſpect to magiſtrates, if I did not put off my hat?</q> I replied, 'In coming when they called me.' Then they bid one, 'Take off my hat.' After which it was ſome time before they ſpoke to me, and I felt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord to ariſe. After ſome pauſe, old juſtice Rawlinſon (the chairman) aſked me, <q>If I knew of the plot?</q> I told him, <q>I heard of it in Yorkſhire by a friend, who had it from the high-ſheriff.</q> They aſked me, 'Whether I had declared it to the magiſtrates?' I ſaid, <q>I had ſent papers abroad againſt plots and plotters, and alſo to you, as ſoon as I came into the country, to take all jealouſies out of your minds concerning me and my friends; for it is our principle to declare againſt ſuch things.</q> They aſked me, <q>If I knew not of an act againſt meetings?</q> I ſaid, <q>I knew there was an act that took hold of ſuch as met to the terrifying of the king's ſubjects, were enemies to the king, and held dangerous principles; but I hoped they did not look upon us to be ſuch men, for our meetings were not to terrify the king's ſubjects, neither are we enemies to him or any man.</q> Then they tendered me the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy. I told them, <q>I could not take any oath at all, becauſe Chriſt and his apoſtle had forbid it; and they had ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſwearers, firſt one way, then another; but I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>er taken any oath in my life.</q> Rawlinſon aſked me, 'Whether I held it was unlawful to ſwear?' This queſtion he put on purpoſe to enſnare me; for by an act that was made; ſuch were liable to baniſhment or a great
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037441_0551_100D91A55E33BC38"/>fine, that ſhould ſay, it was 'unlawful to ſwear.' But I, ſeeing the ſnare, avoided it, and told him, <q>That in the time of the law amongſt the Jews, before Chriſt came, the law commanded them to ſwear; but Chriſt, who doth fulfil the law in his goſpel-time, commands, <q>not to ſwear at all;</q> and the apoſtle James forbids ſwearing, even to them that were Jews, and who had the law of God.</q> After much diſcourſe they called for the gaoler, and committed me to priſon. I had the paper about me which I wrote as a teſtimony againſt plots, which I deſired they would read, or ſuffer to be read in open court; but they would not. So being committed for refuſing to ſwear, <q>I bid them and all the people take notice, that I ſuffered for the doctrine of Chriſt, and for my obedience to his command.</q> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I underſtood the juſtices did ſay, that they had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate inſtructions from colonel Kirby to proſecute me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his fair carriage and ſeeming kindneſs to me before, when he declared before many of them. <q>That he had nothing againſt me.</q> Several other friends were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon, ſome for meeting to worſhip God, and ſome for not ſwearing; ſo that the priſon was very full. Many of them being poor men, without any thing to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their families by but their labour, which now they were taken from, ſeveral of their wives went to the juſtices who committed their huſbands, and told them, <q>If they kept their huſbands in gaol for nothing but the truth of Chriſt and for good conſcience-ſake, they would bring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to them to be maintained.</q> A mighty power of the Lord roſe in friends, and gave them great boldneſs, ſo that they ſpoke much to the juſtices. Friends alſo that were priſoners wrote to the juſtices, <q>laying the weight of their ſufferings upon them, and ſhewing them both their injuſtice and want of compaſſion towards their poor neighbours, whom they knew to be honeſt, conſcientious, peaceable people, that in tenderneſs of conſcience could not take any oath; yet they ſent them to priſon for refuſing to take the oath of allegiance. Though ſeveral of thoſe impriſoned on that account were known to be men who had ſerved the king in his wars, had hazarded their lives in the field in his cauſe, had ſuffered great hardſhips, with the loſs of much blood for him, and always ſtood faithful to him from firſt to laſt, yet never received pay for their ſervice; and to be thus requited for all their faithful ſervices and ſufferings by thoſe that pretended to be the king's friends,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037441_0552_100D91A7C3EC8058"/>was hard, unkind, and ungrateful dealing.</q> At length the juſtices, being continually attended with complaints of grievances, releaſed ſome of the friends, but kept divers ſtill in priſon.</p>
                  <p>There were four friends priſoners for tithes, ſent to priſon at the ſuit of the counteſs of Derby, who had lain near two years and an half. One of theſe was Oliver Atherton, who being of a weakly conſtitution was through long and hard impriſonment in a cold, raw, unwholeſome place, brought ſo low and weak in his body, that there appeared no hopes of his life unleſs he might be removed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a letter was wrote on his behalf to the counteſs, and ſent by his ſon Godfrey Atherton, wherein was laid before her <q>the reaſons why he and the reſt could not pay tithes; becauſe if they did, they ſhould deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, who by his coming had put an end to the tithes, and to the prieſthood to which they had been given, and to the commandment by which they had been paid under the law. His weak condition of body was alſo laid before her, and the apparent likelihood of his death, if ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to hold him there, that ſhe might be moved to pity and compaſſion, and alſo warned not to draw the guilt of innocent blood upon her.</q> When his ſon went to her with his father's letter, a ſervant of hers abuſed him, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off his cap and threw it away, and put him out of the gate. Nevertheleſs the letter was delivered into her own hand, but ſhe ſhut out all pity and tenderneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him in priſon till death. When his ſon returned to his father in priſon, and told him as he lay on his dying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that the counteſs denied his liberty, he only ſaid, <q>She hath been the cauſe of ſhedding much blood, but this will be the heavieſt blood that ever ſhe ſpilt,</q> and ſoon after he died. Friends having his body delivered to them to bury, as they carried it from the priſon to Ormſkirk, the pariſh wherein he had lived, they ſtuck up papers upon the croſſes at Garſtang, Preſton, and other towns through which they paſſed, with this inſcription:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This is Oliver Atherton, of Ormſkirk pariſh, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to death by the counteſs of Derby for good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake towards God and Chriſt, becauſe he could not give her tithes, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Setting forth the reaſons of his refuſing to pay tithes, the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037441_0553_100D91A9B056FC18"/>length of his impriſonment, the hardſhips he underwent, her hard-heartedneſs towards him, and the manner of his death. After his death, Richard Cubban, another of her priſoners for tithes, wrote a large letter to her, on behalf of himſelf and his fellow-priſoners at her ſuit, laying their innocency before her; <q>and that it was not out of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtubbornneſs, or covetouſneſs, that they refuſed to pay their tithes, but purely in good conſcience towards God and Chriſt; letting her know, if ſhe ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to keep them there till they every one died, as ſhe had done their fellow-ſufferer, Oliver Atherton, they could not yield to pay her. And therefore deſired her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their caſe in a Chriſtian ſpirit, and not bring their blood upon herſelf alſo.</q> Yet ſhe would not ſhew any pity or compaſſion to them, who had now ſuffered hard impriſonment about two years and an half under her. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof ſhe ſent to Garſtang, and threatened to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the king and council, and bring them into trouble, for ſuffering the paper concerning Oliver Atherton's death to be ſtuck upon their croſs. The rage ſhe expreſſed made the people take the more notice of it, and ſome of them ſaid, 'The Quakers had given her a bone to pick.' But ſhe, that regarded not the life of an innocent ſufferer for Chriſt, lived not long after herſelf; for that day three weeks that Oliver Atherton's body was carried through Ormſkirk to be buried, ſhe died; and her body was carried that day ſeven weeks through the ſame town to her burying-place. Thus the Lord purſued the hard-hearted perſecutor. I was kept till the aſſize, and judge Turner and judge Twiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den coming that circuit, I was brought before judge Twiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the 14th of the month called March, the latter end of the year 1663. When I was ſet to the bar, I ſaid, <q>Peace be amongſt you all.</q> The judge looked upon me, and ſaid, <q>What! do you come into the court with your hat on! Upon which words, the gaoler taking it off, I ſaid, The hat is not the honour that comes from God.</q> Then ſaid the judge to me, <q>Will you take the oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, George Fox?</q> I ſaid, <q>I never took any oath in my life, nor any covenant or engagement.</q> 'Well,' ſaid he, 'Will you ſwear or no?' I anſwered, <q>I am a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and Chriſt commands me "not to ſwear;" ſo does the apoſtle James; and whether I ſhould obey God or man, do thou judge.</q> I aſk your again, ſaid he, <q>Whether you will ſwear or no?</q> I anſwered again, <q>I am neither
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037441_0554_100D91AB9F225A28"/>Turk, Jew, nor Heathen, but a Chriſtian, and ſhould th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w forth chriſtianity. I aſked him, If he did not know that Chriſtians in the primitive times, under the ten perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſome alſo of the martyrs in queen Mary's days, refuſed ſwearing, becauſe Chriſt and the apoſtle had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it? I told him alſo, they had experience enough, how many had firſt ſworn for the king and then againſt him. But as for me I had never taken an oath in my life, My allegiance did not lie in ſwearing, but in truth and faithfulneſs; for I honour all men, much more the king. But Chriſt, who is the Great Prophet, the King of kings, the Saviour and Judge of the whole world, ſaith, I muſt "not ſwear." Now, whether muſt I obey Chriſt or thee? For it is tenderneſs of conſcience, and in obedience to the command of Chriſt, that I do not ſwear: and we have the word of a king for tender conſciences. Then I aſked the judge, If he did own the king? "Yes," ſaid he, <q>I do own the king.</q> Why then, ſaid I, doſt thou not obſerve his declaration from Breda, and his promiſes made ſince he came into England, <q>That no man ſhould be called in queſtion for matters of religion, ſo long as they lived peaceably?</q> If thou owneſt the king, ſaid I, why doſt thou call me in queſtion, and put me upon taking an oath, which is a matter of religion; ſeeing thou nor none elſe can charge me with unpeaceable living?</q> Upon this he was moved, and looking angrily at me, ſaid, <q>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, will you ſwear?</q> I told him, <q>I was none of his Sirrahs, I was a Chriſtian; and for him, an old man, and a judge, to ſit there and give nick-names to priſoners, it did not become either his grey hairs or his office.</q> 'Well,' ſaid he, 'I am a Chriſtian too.' <q>Then do Chriſtian works,</q> ſaid I. 'Sirrah!' ſaid he, <q>Thou thinkeſt to frighten me with thy words.</q> Then catching himſelf, and looking aſide, he ſaid, <q>Hark! I am uſing the word (Sirrah) again;</q> ſo checked himſelf. I ſaid, <q>I ſpoke to thee in love; for that language did not become thee, a judge. Thou oughteſt to inſtruct a priſoner in the law, if he were ignorant and out of the way.</q> 
                     <q>And I ſpeak in love to thee too,</q> ſaid he. 'But,' ſaid I, 'Love gives no nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names.' Then he rouſed himſelf up, and ſaid, <q>I will not be afraid of thee, George Fox. Thou ſpeakeſt ſo loud, thy voice drowns mine and the court's; I muſt call for three or four criers to drown thy voice: thou haſt good lungs.</q> 'I am a priſoner here,' ſaid I, <q>for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037441_0555_100D91AD8E2BF9B8"/>Chriſt's ſake; for his ſake do I ſuffer, for him do I ſtand this day, and if my voice were five times louder I ſhould lift it up, and ſound it out for Chriſt's fake, for whoſe cauſe I ſtand this day before your judgment-ſeat, in obedience to him who commands "not to ſwear;" be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe judgment-ſeat you muſt all be brought, and muſt give an account.</q> 'Well,' ſaid the judge, <q>George Fox, ſay, Whether thou wilt take the oath, Yea or Nay?</q> I replied, <q>I ſay as I ſaid before, Whether ought I to obey God or man, judge thou? If I could take any oath at all, I ſhould take this; for I do not deny ſome oaths only or on ſome occaſions, but all oaths, according to Chriſt's doctrine, who hath commanded his, "Not to ſwear at all." Now if thou or any of you, or any of your miniſters or prieſts here, will prove that ever Chriſt or his apoſtle, after they had forbid all ſwearing, commanded Chriſtians to ſwear, then I will ſwear.</q> I ſaw ſeveral prieſts there; but not one of them offered to ſpeak. Then ſaid the judge, <q>I am a ſervant to the king, and the king ſent me not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with you, but to put the laws in execution; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tender him the oath of allegiance.</q> 
                     <q>If thou love the king,</q> ſaid I, <q>why doſt thou break his word, and not keep his declarations and ſpeeches, wherein he promiſed liberty to tender conſciences? I am a man of a tender conſcience, and in obedience to Chriſt's command I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſwear.</q> 'Then you will not ſwear,' ſaid the judge; 'Take him away, gaoler.' I ſaid, <q>It is for Chriſt's ſake that I cannot ſwear, and for obedience to his command I ſuffer; and ſo the Lord forgive you all.</q> So the gaoler took me away; but I felt the mighty power of the Lord was over them all.</p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth of the ſame month I was brought before judge Twiſden again, who was ſomewhat offended at my hat; but it being the laſt morning of the aſſize, before he was to go out of town, and not many people there, he made the leſs of it. He aſked me, <q>Whether I would tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, ſtand mute, or ſubmit.</q> But he ſpoke ſo faſt, it was hard to know what he ſaid. However I told him, <q>I deſired I might have liberty to traverſe the indictment, and try it.</q> Then ſaid he, <q>Take him away. I will have nothing to do with him, take him away.</q> I ſaid, <q>Well, live in the fear of God, and do juſtice.</q> 'Why,' ſaid he, 'have not I done you juſtice?' I replied, <q>That which thou haſt done hath been againſt the command of Chriſt.</q>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:037441_0556_100D91AF2EC93FC8"/>So I was taken to the gaol again, and kept priſoner till the next aſſizes.</p>
                  <p>Some time before this aſſize, Margaret Fell was ſent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to Lancaſter gaol by Fleming, Kirby, and Preſton, juſtices; and at the aſſize the oath was tendered to her alſo, and ſhe was again committed to priſon to lie till the next aſſize.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice Fleming being one of the fierceſt and moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent juſtices in perſecuting friends, and ſending his honeſt neighbours to priſon for religion's ſke; and many friends being at this time in Lancaſter gaol committed by him, and 02 ſome having died in priſon, we that were then priſoners had it upon us to write to him, as followeth.</p>

                        <p>MERCY, compaſſion, love, and kindneſs adorn and grace men and magiſtrates. Oh! doſt thou not hear the cry of the widows, and the cry of the fatherleſs, who were made ſo through perſecution! Were they not driven like ſheep, from conſtable to conſtable, as though they had been the greateſt tranſgreſſors or malefactors in the land? Which grieved and tendered the hearts of many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber people, to ſee how their innocent neighbours and countrymen, who were of a peaceable carriage, and honeſt in their lives and converſations among men, were uſed and ſerved! One more is dead, whom thou ſenteſt to priſon, having left five children fatherleſs and motherleſs. How canſt thou do otherwiſe than take care of thoſe fatherleſs infants, and alſo of the other's wife and family? Is it not thy place? Conſider Job (c. xxix.) He was a father to the poor, he delivered the poor that cried, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that had none to help. He broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the ſpoil out of his teeth. But oh! meaſure thy life and his, and take heed of the day of God's eternal judgment, which will come, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and decree from Chriſt, when every man muſt give an account and receive a reward according to his deeds. Then it will be ſaid, <q>Oh! where are the months that are paſt!</q> Again, juſtice Fleming, conſider, when John Stubbs was brought before thee, having a wife and four ſmall children, and little to live on but what they honeſtly got by their own diligence; as ſoon as he appeared, thou cried out. "Put the oath to that man." And when he confeſſed he was but a poor man, thou hadſt no regard,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037441_0557_100D91B1D5B5C128"/>but caſt away pity, not hearing what he would ſay. And now he is kept in priſon, becauſe he could not ſwear, and break the command of Chriſt and the apoſtle, it is to be hoped thou wilt take care of his family, that his children do not ſtarve; and ſee that they do not want bread. Can this be allegiance to the king, to do that which Chriſt and his apoſtle ſay is evil, and brings into condemnation? Would not you have caſt Chriſt and the apoſtle into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who commanded "not to ſwear," if they had been in your days? Conſider alſo thy poor neighbour, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Wilſon, who was known to all the pariſh and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to be an induſtrious man, careful to maintain his wife and children; yet had little but what he got with his hands in diligence and travels to ſupply himſelf. How ſhould his wife maintain her children, when thou haſt caſt her huſband into priſon, and thereby made him incapable of working for them? Therefore it may be expected thou wilt have a care of his wife and children, and ſee they do not want; for how ſhould they live, having no other way to be ſuſtained but by the little that he got? Surely the noiſe of this is in the very markets, the death of thy two neighbours, the cry of the widows and fatherleſs is heard. All thoſe fatherleſs and widows are made ſo for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake. For might not John Stubbs and William Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have had their liberty ſtill, if they would have ſworn, though they had been ſuch as go after mountebanks and ſtage-plays, or run a hunting? Oh! conſider! for the Lord's mind is otherwiſe. He is tender, and the king hath declared his mind to be, that there ſhould be no cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty inflicted upon his peaceable ſubjects. Beſides, ſeveral poor honeſt people were fined, who had need to have ſomething given them; and it had been more honourable to have given them ſomething, than to fine them and ſend them to priſon, ſome of whom live upon the charity of others. What honour or grace can it be to thee to caſt thy poor neighbours into priſon, who are peaceable; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou knoweſt theſe people cannot do that which thou requireſt of them, if it were to ſave their lives or all that they have? Becauſe in tenderneſs they cannot take any oath, thou makeſt that a ſnare to them. What thinkeſt thou do the people ſay concerning this? "We know," ſay they, <q>the Quakers principle that keep to Yea and Nay; but we ſee others ſwear and forſwear.</q> Many of you have ſworn firſt one way and then another. So we
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037441_0558_100D91B3645FF360"/>leave it to the Spirit of God in thy conſcience, juſtice Fleming, who waſt ſo eager for the taking of George Fox, and ſo offended with them that had not taken him, and now haſt fallen upon thy poor neighbours. But oh! where's thy pity for their poor, fatherleſs children, and motherleſs infants? Oh! take heed of Herod's hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and caſting away all pity! Eſau did ſo, not Jacob, Here is alſo Thomas Walters, of Bolton, caſt into priſon, and the oath impoſed on him through thee, and for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſwear at all, in obedience to Chriſt's command, he is continued in priſon, who hath five ſmall children and his wife near down-lying. Surely, thou ſhouldeſt take care for them alſo, and ſee that his wife and ſmall children do not want, who are as fatherleſs and ſhe as a widow through thee. Doſt thou not hear in thy ears the cry of the fatherleſs, the cry of the widows, and the blood of the innocent ſpeak, who through thee have been perſecuted to priſon, and are now dead? Oh! heavy ſentence at the day of judgment! How wilt thou anſwer, when thou and thy works come to be judged, when thou ſhalt be brought before the judgment-ſeat of the Almighty, who in thy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity haſt made widows and fatherleſs for righteouſneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and for tenderneſs of conſcience towards God? The Lord knows and ſees it! O man! conſider in thy life-time how thou haſt ſtained thyſelf with the blood of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent! When thou had'ſt power and might'ſt have done good amongſt thy peaceable neighbours, thou would'ſt not: but uſedſt thy power not to a good intent, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Lord's mind and to the king's. The king's ſavour, mercy, and clemency to ſober people and tender conſciences hath been manifeſted by declarations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, which thou haſt abuſed and ſlighted by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his peaceable ſubjects. At London and in other parts the Quakers meetings are peaceable; and if thou look but as far as Yorkſhire, where the plot hath been, friends innocency hath cleared itſelf in the hearts of ſober juſtices; and for you here to fall upon your peaceable neighbours and people, and to be rigorous and violent againſt them that are tender, godly, and righteous, it is no honour to you. How many drunkards, ſwearers, and fighters, and ſuch as are ſubject to vice, have you cauſed to be brought before you to your courts? It were more honourable for you to look after ſuch; for the law was not made for the righteous, but for ſinners and tranſgreſſors. Therefore
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037441_0559_100D91B55453C028"/>conſider, and be humbled for theſe things; for the Lord may do to thee as thou haſt done to others; and thou doſt not know how ſoon there may be a cry in thy own family, as the cry is amongſt thy neighbours, of the fatherleſs and widows that are made ſo through thee. But the Quakers can and do ſay, <q>The Lord forgive thee, and lay not theſe things to thy charge, if it be his will.</q>

                  <p>It was not long after this ere Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or fourteen motherleſs children.</p>
                  <p>When I was priſoner at Lancaſter, there was priſoner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo one major Wiggan, a Baptiſt-preacher. He boaſted much before-hand what he would ſay at the aſſize, if the oath ſhould be put to him; and that he would refuſe to ſwear. But when the aſſize came, and the oath was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, he deſired time to conſider of it; and that being granted him till the next aſſize, he got leave to go to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before the aſſize came again, and ſtaid at London till the plague broke forth, and there both he and his wife were cut off. He was a very wicked man, and the judgments of God came upon him; for he had publiſhed a very wicked book againſt friends, full of lies and blaſphemies; the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which was this. Whilſt he was in Lancaſter caſtle, he challenged friends to a diſpute. Whereupon I got leave of the ga <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er to go up to them. And entering into diſcourſe with him, he affirmed, <q>That ſome men never had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and that the true light, which enlighteneth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that cometh into the world, is natural.</q> For proof of his firſt aſſertion, he inſtanced Balaam, affirming, <q>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam had not the Spirit of God,, I affirmed and proved, That Balaam had the Spirit of God, and that wicked men have the Spirit of God, elſe how could they quency it, vex it, grieve it, and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, like the ſtiff-necked
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037441_0560_100D91B744E00048"/>Jews?</q> To his ſecond aſſertion, I anſwered, <q>That the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, was the life in the world, and that was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and eternal, and not natural. And he might as well ſay, the word was natural as that the life in the word was natural. And wicked men were enlightened by this light, elſe how could they hate it? It is expreſsly ſaid, they did hate it; and the reaſon given why, was, <q>becauſe their deeds were evil;</q> and they would not come to it, becauſe it reproved them; and that muſt needs be in them, which reproved them. Beſides, that ligth could not be the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the New-Teſtament; for it was teſtified of before any part of the New-Teſtament was written; ſo it muſt be by the Divine Light, which is the life in Chriſt, the Word, before the ſcriptures were. And the grace of God, which brought ſalvation, had appeared unto all men, and taught the ſaints; but they that turned from it into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and walked deſpitefully againſt the Spirit of Grace, were the wicked. Again, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter, which leads the diſciples of Chriſt into all truth, the ſame ſhould reprove the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, of judgment, and of their unbelief. So the wicked world had it to reprove them, and the true diſciples and learners of Chriſt, that believed in the light as Chriſt commands, had it to lead them. But the world that did not believe in the light, though they were lighted, but hated the light which they ſhould have believed in, and loved the darkneſs rather than it, this world had a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs and a judgment, which the Holy Ghoſt reproved them for, as well as for their unbelief.</q> Having proved, that the good and the bad were enlightened, that the Grace of God had appeared unto all, and that all had the Spirit of God, elſe they could not vex and grieve it, I told major Wiggan, The leaſt babe there might ſee him; and preſently ſtood up one Richard Cubham, and proved him an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and a deceiver by ſcripture. Then the gaoler had me away to my priſon again. Afterwards Wiggan wrote a book of this diſpute, and put in abundance of abominable lies; which was ſoon anſwered in print, and himſelf was not long after cut off, as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>This Wiggan was poor, and while he was priſoner at Lancaſter he ſent into the country, and got money gathered for relief of the poor people of God in priſon; and many people gave freely, thinking it had been for us, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037441_0561_100D91B9EAF74480"/>it was for himſelf. But when we heard of it, we laid it upon him, and wrote into the country, that friends might let the people know the truth of the matter, that it was not our manner to have collections made for us, and that thoſe collections were only for Wiggan and another, a drunken preacher of his ſociety: who was ſo drunk, that once he loſt his breeches.</p>
                  <p>After this it came upon me to write to the judges and other magiſtrates concerning their <q>giving evil words and nick-names to ſuch as were brought before them.</q> Which was after this manner.</p>

                        <p>HEREIN and by reading the ſcriptures, ye may ſee both your own words and behaviour, and the words and practice of both Jews and Heathens, and of the King of kings, the great Lawgiver and Judge of the whole World. Firſt, concerning the words and carriage of the Jews, when ſome worthy of death were brought before the rulers amongſt them. When Achan had taken the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh garment, the two hundred ſhekels of ſilver, and the wedge of gold of fifty ſhekels weight, and Joſhua, who was then judge of Iſrael, had by the lot diſcovered him, he did not call him, Sirrah, nor you Raſcal, Knave, Rogue, as ſome, called Chriſtian magiſtrates, are too apt to do. But Joſhua ſaid unto Achan, "My ſon." Mark his clean language, ſavoury expreſſion, and gracious words. "My ſon," ſaid he, <q>give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, and make confeſſion unto him, and tell me now what thou haſt done, hide it not from me.</q> Then Achan confeſſed, that he had ſinned againſt the Lord God of Iſrael, and thus and thus he had done. Then Joſhua, the judge, ſaid, <q>Why haſt thou troubled Iſrael? The Lord ſhall trouble thee this day; and they ſtoned him and his with ſtones, and burned his goods with fire.</q> But there was no unſavoury word given him that we read of, though he was worthy of death, Joſh. vii.</p>
                        <p>So when the man, that gathered ſticks upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, was taken and brought before Moſes, the judge of Iſrael, and put in ward till the mind of the Lord
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037441_0562_100D91BB7A9CBED8"/>was known concerning him, we read not of any reviling language given him; but the Lord ſaid to Moſes, and Moſes to the people, <q>The man ſhall ſurely be put to death,</q> Numb. xv. 35.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe in the rebellion of Corah, Dathan and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, when Moſes called them to trial, he did not ſirrah them nor miſname them; but ſaid to Corah and the reſt, "Hear, I pray you, ye ſons of Levi," Numb. xvi. 8. And when he gave the ſentence againſt them, he ſaid, <q>If theſe men die the common death of all men,</q> &amp;c. He did not ſay, If theſe Raſcals or Knaves, as many that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians now do.</p>
                        <p>When Elihu ſpoke to Job, who was a judge, and to his friends, and ſaid, <q>Let me not, I pray you, accept of any man's perſon, neither let me give flattering titles unto man, for I know not to give flattering titles; in ſo doing my Maker would ſoon take me away,</q> Job xxxii. Job did not ſay, "Sirrah, hold thy tongue;" nor gave him any unſavoury expreſſion. The words of David, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and other kings and officers, ſee in the books of the Kings and Chronicles, the ſavoury language they gave to them that were brought before them. Nay, though Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei curſed David the king, yet neither did David then or afterward, nor Solomon when he cauſed him to be put to death, give him any reproachful language, or ſo much as call him Sirrah, 2 Sam. xvi. and 1 Kings ii.</p>
                        <p>Read the prophecies of Iſaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, and the reſt of the prophets, who propheſied to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent people, and againſt rulers, kings, and magiſtrates; yet where can it be found, that they had any bad language given them, as Sirrah or the like, by any ruler either of the Jews or Heathens? Nay, though Jeremiah was caſt into priſon, and into the dungeon, yet there was no ſuch word as Sirrah or Knave given him, Jer. xxxvii.</p>
                        <p>Reſpecting the words and carriage of the Heathens. When Abraham was before Abimelech, who was a king, he gave Abraham no unſavoury expreſſions, Gen. xx. When Iſaac came before Abimelech, he gave him no taunting language. Gen. xxvi. When Joſeph was caſt into priſon, and that in Egypt, we do not read he had any railing language given him, Gen. xxxix. Neither did Pharaoh, when Moſes and Aaron appeared before him, give them bad language, as Sirrah, Knave or the like.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="47" facs="unknown:037441_0563_100D7F8E0050B040"/>
When Nebuchadnezzar ſentenced the three children to the fiery furnace, there was no ſuch language given them as Sirrah, Knave, Raſcal; but they were called by the names they were known by, Dan. iii. When Daniel was brought before king Darius, and ſentenced to be caſt into the lion's den, he had no ſuch ill names given him, as many give now, who call thoſe Heathen rulers, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>If ye look into the New-Teſtament, in the parable of the wedding-ſupper, the king that came to view his gueſts did not ſay to him that was found without a wedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment, "Sirrah, how cameſt thou in hither?" but, "Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?" &amp;c. though he was to be bound hand and foot, and "caſt into utter darkneſs," Matth. xxii. Nay, when Judas had betrayed his maſter, Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of Life, and ſold him to the prieſts, Chriſt did not call him Sirrah, when he came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, but Friend, Matth. xxvi. 50. Stephen, in his examination, ſentence, and death had no ſuch reproachful word given him, as Sirrah or Knave, Acts vi. &amp; vii. chap. When the apoſtles Peter and John were brought before the high-prieſt and rulers of the Jews, and commanded not to preach in the name of Jeſus, Acts iv. they were not called Sirrahs or Knaves, nor had any ſuch ill names given them. When Paul and Silas were caſt into priſon by the magiſtrates, Acts xvi. they called them men, not Rogues, Sirrahs, nor Knaves. And when the magiſtrates had done contrary to law they feared. So ye may ſee how ſhort of this example many are that call themſelves Chriſtian rulers, who are not afraid to caſt innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into priſon, and give them ill names beſides, below both Jews and Heathens.</p>
                        <p>When the uproar was at Epheſus about Diana's ſhrine, Demetrius, who bore great ſway among the craftſmen, did not call Paul Sirrah, but Paul, Acts xix. When Paul was brought priſoner before the high-prieſt Ananias and the council of the Jews, and told them, <q>He had lived in all good conſcience towards God until that day;</q> though they, who profeſſed the ſcriptures but lived out of the life of them, could not abide to hear of living in a good conſcience, as profeſſors of the ſcriptures now, that live not in the life, cannot abide to hear of living in a good conſcience now-a-days; but Ananias cauſed Paul to be "ſmitten on the mouth;" yet he did not call him Knave
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037441_0564_100D91BD69001030"/>nor Sirrah, Acts xxiii. The apoſtate Jews indeed, who, though they profeſſed ſcripture, were out of the life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and had rejected Chriſt, in accuſing Paul before the Roman magiſtrates, did once call him a Peſtilent Fellow, Acts xxiv. as the accuſing profeſſors, who live out of the life, ſometimes call us now. But neither Felix, Feſtus, nor king Agrippa, in all their examinations, gave Paul any ſuch words as Sirrah, Raſcal, Knave, or the like, but heard him patiently. So Chriſtians may ſee through all the ſcriptures, when perſons were brought before rulers, kings, or magiſtrates, whether Jews or Heathens, they did not uſe to call them evil names, as Sirrah, Raſcal, Knave, and the like. They had no ſuch foul-mouth'd language in their courts. Nor did they uſe to ſay to them, <q>Sirrah, put off your hat.</q> Now, ye that profeſs chriſtianity, and ſay the "ſcripture is your rule," may ſee that more corrupt words proceed out of your mouths than either out of the Jews or Heathens, if ye will try your practice by the ſcriptures; and doth not the apoſtle tell you, that no corrupt communication ſhould proceed out of your mouths? and that your words ſhould be gracious? I query, Where and whence ye that call yourſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have got all theſe bad words and names, ſeeing neither God nor Chriſt, the prophets, judges, kings, nor rulers ever gave any ſuch names, ſo far as appears by ſcripture, either amongſt Heathens, Jews, or Chriſtians?</p>

                  <p>Before the next affizes there was a quarter-ſeſſions held at Lancaſter by the juſtices. To which, though we were not brought, I put friends upon drawing up an account of their ſufferings, and laying them before the juſtices in their open ſeſſions. For friends had ſuffered deeply by ſines and diſtreſſes, the bailiffs and officers making great havoc and ſpoil of their goods; but no redreſs was afforded.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome evil-minded magiſtrates would tell us ſometimes of the late plot in the north, we gave forth the following paper to ſtop their mouths, and to clear truth and friends therefrom.</p>

                     <p>A Teſtimony from the people of God, whom the world calls Quakers, to all the magiſtrates and officers of what ſort ſoever, from the higheſt to the loweſt.</p>
                     <p>WE are peaceable, and ſeek the peace, good, and welfare of all, as in our lives and peaceable carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is manifeſted, and we deſire the eternal good of all, and their ſouls everlaſting peace. We are become heirs of the bleſſing before the curſe was, and of the power of God before the devil was, and before the fall of man. We are heirs of the goſpel of peace, which is the power of God; we are heirs of Chriſt, who have inherited him and his everlaſting kingdom, and do poſſeſs the power of an endleſs life. Knowing this our portion and inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, this is to take off all jealouſies out of your minds, and out of the minds of all concerning us, that all plots and conſpiracies, plotters and conſpirators againſt the king, and all aiders or aſſiſters thereunto we always did and do utterly deny to be of us, or to be of the fellowſhip of the goſpel, of Chriſt's kingdom, or his ſervants. For Chriſt, ſaid, <q>His kingdom was not of this world, if it were his ſervants would fight.</q> 'Therefore he bid Peter, <q>put up his ſword; for,</q> ſaid he, <q>he that taketh the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword.</q> Here is the faith and patience of the ſaints, to bear and ſuffer all things, knowing venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is the Lord's, and he will repay it to them that hurt his people and wrong the innocent; therefore cannot we avenge but ſuffer for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The blood of bulls, lambs, rams, and other offerings, and that prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which offered them, together with other things in the law, were types of Chriſt, the one offering, and of his blood, who is the everlaſting prieſt and covenant, our life, and way to God, the great prophet and ſhepherd, the head of his church, and the great biſhop of our ſouls, whom we witneſs come; he doth overſee and keep his flock. For in Adam, in the fall, we know the ſtriving, quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, unpeaceable ſpirits are at enmity one with another, and not in peace; but in Chriſt Jeſus, the ſecond Adam, that never fell, is peace, reſt, and life. The doctrine of Chriſt, who never ſinned, is to "love one another," and thoſe who are in this doctrine hurt no man, in which we are, in Chriſt, who is our life. Therefore it is well for you to diſtinguiſh betwixt the precious and the vile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that fear God and ſerve him and them that do not, and to put a difference between the innocent and the 'guilty, between him that is holy and pure and the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prophane; for they that do not ſo, bring troubles, burdens, and ſorrows upon themſelves. This we write in love to your ſouls, that ye may conſider theſe things; for thoſe that hate enemies, and one another, we cannot ſay they are of God, nor in Chriſt's doctrine, but are oppoſers of it. And ſuch as wreſtle with fleſh and blood, with carnal weapons, are gone into the fleſh out of the Spirit. They are not in our fellowſhip in the Spirit, in which is the bond of peace, neither are they of us, nor have we unity with them in their fleſhly ſtate, and with their carnal weapons. For our unity and fellowſhip ſtands in the goſpel, which is the power of God, before the devil was, the liar, the murderer, the man-ſlayer, and the envious. Chriſt's mind and his doctrine being to ſave men's lives, we who are of Chriſt's mind are out of and above theſe things. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that in the fear of the Lord ye may live, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037441_0567_100D91C33120B8A0"/>in ye may receive God's wiſdom, by which all things were created, that by it all may be ordered to his glory.</p>
                     <p>This is from them that love all your ſouls, and ſeek your eternal good.</p>

                        <p>NOW is the day that every one's faith and love to God and Chriſt will be tried; who are redeemed out of the earth, and who are in the earth will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; who is the maſter they ſerve, and whether they will run to the mountains to cover them.

                  <p>In the ſixth month the aſſizes were held again at Lancaſter, and the ſame judges, Twiſden and Turner, came that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit again; but judge Turner then ſate on the crown-bench, ſo I was brought before him. Before I was called to the bar, I was put among murderers and felons for about the ſpace of two hours, the people, the juſtices, and the judge alſo gazing upon me. After they had tried ſeveral others, they called me to the bar, and impanelled a jury. Then the judge aſked the juſtices, <q>Whether they had tendered me the oath at the ſeſſions?</q> They ſaid, 'They had.' Then he bid, <q>Give them the book, that they might ſwear they had tendered me the oath at the ſeſſions.</q> They ſaid, 'They had.' Then the bid, <q>Give them the book, that they might ſwear they had tendered me the oath according to the indictment.</q> Some of the juſtices refuſed to be ſworn; but the judge ſaid, he would have it done to take away all occaſion of exception. When the jury were ſworn, and the juſtices had ſworn <q>they had tendered the oath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the indictment,</q> the judge aſked me, <q>Whether I had not refuſed the oath at the laſt aſſizes?</q> I ſaid, <q>I never took an oath in my life, and Chriſt, the Saviour and Judge of the World, ſaid, "Swear not at all." The judge ſeemed not to take notice of my anſwer; but aſked me, Whether or no I had not refuſed to take the oath at the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037441_0569_100D91C7120C6838"/>laſt aſſize?</q> I ſaid, <q>The words that I then ſpoke to them were, that if they could prove, either judge, juſtices, prieſt, or teacher, that after Chriſt and the apoſtle had forbidden ſwearing, they commanded that Chriſtians ſhould ſwear, I would ſwear.</q> The judge ſaid, <q>He was not at that time to diſpute whether it was lawful to ſwear, but to inquire whether I had refuſed to take the oath or no.</q> I told him, <q>Thoſe things mentioned in the oath, as plotting againſt the king, and owning the pope's or any other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, I utterly deny.</q> 'Well,' ſaid he, <q>you ſay well in that; but did you deny to take the oath? What ſay you? What wouldſt thou have me to ſay?</q> ſaid I, 'for I have told thee before what I did ſay.' Then he aſked me, <q>If I would have theſe men to ſwear that I had taken the oath?</q> I aſked him, <q>If he would have thoſe men to ſwear that I had refuſed the oath?</q> At which the court burſt out into laughter. I was grieved to ſee ſo much lightneſs in a court, where ſuch ſolemn matters are handled, and thereupon aſked him, <q>If this court was a play-houſe? Where is gravity and ſobriety,</q> ſaid I; <q>for this behaviour doth not become you.</q> Then the clerk read the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I told the judge, <q>I had ſomething to ſpeak to it; for I had informed myſelf of the errors that were in it.</q> He told me, <q>He would hear me afterward any reaſons that I could allege why he ſhould not give judgment.</q> Then I ſpoke to the jury, and told them, <q>They could not bring me in guilty according to that indictment; for the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was wrong laid, and had many groſs errors in it.</q> 
                     <q>The judge ſaid, I muſt not ſpeak to the jury, but he would ſpeak to them;</q> and he told them, <q>I had denied to take the oath at the laſt aſſizes, and,</q> ſaid he, <q>I can tender the oath to any man now, and premunire him for not taking it; and,</q> he ſaid, <q>they muſt bring me in guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeeing I refuſed to take the oath.</q> 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>what do ye do with a form? Ye may throw away your form then.</q> And I told the jury, <q>It lay upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as they would anſwer it to the Lord God before his judgment-ſeat.</q> Then the judge ſpoke again to the jury, and I called to him to 'do me juſtice.' The jury brought me in guilty. Whereupon I told them, <q>That both the juſtices and they had forſworn themſelves, and 'therefore they had ſmall cauſe to laugh as they did a little before.</q> Oh! the envy, rage, and malice, that appeared againſt me, and the lightneſs; but the Lord confounded
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:037441_0570_100D91C95CDA8150"/>them, and they were wonderfully ſtopped. So they ſet me aſide, and called up Margaret Fell, who had a great deal of good ſervice amongſt them, and then the court broke up near the ſecond hour.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon we were brought again to have ſentence paſſed upon us. Margaret Fell deſired ſentence might be deferred till the next morning. <q>I deſired nothing but law and juſtice at his hands, for the thieves had mercy; only I requeſted the judge to ſend ſome to ſee my priſon, which was ſo bad they would put no creature they had in it; and I told him, that colonel Kirby, who was then on the bench, ſaid, <q>I ſhould be locked up, and no fleſh alive ſhould come to me.</q> The judge ſhook his head, and ſaid, When the ſentence was given, he would leave 'me to the favour of the gaoler.</q> Moſt of the gentry of the country were gathered together, expecting to hear the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and the noiſe amongſt the people was, <q>That I ſhould be tranſported.</q> But they were all croſſed at that time; for the ſentence being deferred till next morning, I was had to priſon again. Upon my complaining of the badneſs of my priſon, ſome of the juſtices, with colonel Kirby, went up to ſee it; but when they came, they durſt hardly go in, the floor was ſo bad and dangerous, and the place ſo open to wind and rain. Some that came up ſaid, 'Sure it was a Jakes-houſe.' When colonel Kirby ſaw it, and heard what others ſaid of it, he excuſed the matter as well as he could, ſaying, <q>I ſhould be removed ere it was long to ſome more convenient place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next day, towards the eleventh hour, we were called again to hear the ſentence; and Margaret Fell being called firſt to the bar, ſhe had counſel to plead, who found many errors in her indictment; whereupon, after the judge had acknowledged them, ſhe was ſet by. Then the judge aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'What they could ſay to mine?' I was not willing to let any man plead for me, but to ſpeak to it myſelf; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though Margaret had ſome that pleaded for her, yet ſhe ſpoke as much herſelf as ſhe would. But before I came to the bar, I was moved in my ſpirit to pray, <q>That God would confound their wickedneſs and envy, ſet his truth over all, and exalt his ſeed.</q> The Lord heard and anſwered, and did confound them in their proceedings againſt me. And though they had moſt envy againſt me, yet the moſt groſs errors were found in my indictment.</p>
                  <p>I having put by others from pleading for me, the judge
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037441_0571_100D91CAEC184CB0"/>aſked me, <q>What I had to ſay, why he ſhould not paſs ſentence upon me?</q> I told him, <q>I was no lawyer; but I had much to ſay if he would but have patience to hear.</q> At that he laughed, and others laughed alſo, and ſaid, 'Come, what have you to ſay? He can ſay nothing.' 'Yes,' ſaid I, <q>I have much to ſay; have but the patience to hear me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I aſked him, <q>Whether the oath was to be tendered to the king's ſubjects, or to the ſubjects of foreign princes?</q> He ſaid, 'To the ſubjects of this realm.' Then ſaid I, <q>Look into the indictment, ye may ſee that ye have left out the word Subject; ſo not having named me in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment as a ſubject, ye cannot premunire me for not taking an oath.</q> Then they looked over the ſtatute and the indictment, and ſaw it was as I ſaid; and the judge confeſſed it was an error. I told him, I had ſomething 'elſe to ſtop his judgment,' and deſired him to look what day the indictment ſaid the oath was tendered to me at the ſeſſions there. They looked, and ſaid, <q>It was the eleventh day of January.</q> 
                     <q>What day of the week was the ſeſſions held on?</q> ſaid I. 'On a Tueſday,' ſaid they. Then ſaid I, <q>Look your Almanacks, and ſee whether there was any ſeſſions held at Lancaſter on the eleventh day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, ſo called?</q> So they looked, and found that the eleventh day was the day called Monday, and that the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was on the day called Tueſday, which was the twelfth day of that month. 'Look now,' ſaid I, <q>ye have indicted me for refuſing the oath in the quarter-ſeſſions held at Lancaſter on the eleventh day of January laſt, and the juſtices have ſworn that they tendered me the oath in open ſeſſions here that day, and the jury upon their oaths have found me guilty thereupon; and yet ye ſee there was no ſeſſion held in Lancaſter that day.</q> Then the judge, to cover the matter, aſked, <q>Whether the ſeſſions did not begin on the eleventh day?</q> But ſome in the court an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>No; the ſeſſion held but one day, and that was the twelfth.</q> Then the judge ſaid, <q>This was a great miſtake and an error.</q> Some of the juſtices were in a great rage at this, ſtamped, and ſaid, <q>Who hath done this? Somebody hath done this on purpoſe;</q> and a great heat was amongſt them. Then, ſaid I, <q>Are not the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices here, that have ſworn to this indictment, forſworn men in the face of the country? But this is not all,</q> ſaid I <q>I have more yet to offer why ſentence ſhould not be
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037441_0572_100D91CCC23C8280"/>given againſt me.</q> I aſked, <q>In what year of the king the laſt aſſize here was holden, which was in the month called March laſt?</q> The judge ſaid, <q>It was in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of the king.</q> 'But,' ſaid I, <q>the indictment ſays, it was in the fifteenth year.</q> They looked, and found it ſo. This alſo was acknowledged to be another error. Then they were all in a fret again, and could not tell what to ſay; for the judge had ſworn the officers of the court, that the oath was tendered to me at the aſſize mentioned in the indictment. 'Now,' ſaid I, <q>is not the court here forſworn alſo, who have ſworn that the oath was tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me at the aſſize holden here in the fifteenth year of the king, when it was in his ſixteenth year, and ſo they have ſworn a year falſe?</q> The judge bid them look whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Margaret Fell's indictment was ſo or no. They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and found it was not ſo. I told the judge, <q>I had more yet to offer to ſtop ſentence;</q> and aſked him. <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the oath ought to be put into the indictment or no?</q> 'Yes,' ſaid he, 'it ought to be all put in.' 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>compare the indictment with the oath, and there thou mayeſt ſee theſe words; viz. [or by any authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, or pretended to be derived from him or his ſee] left out of the indictment, which is a principal part of the oath; and in another place the words [heirs and ſucceſſors] are left out.</q> The judge acknowledged theſe alſo to be great errors. 'But,' ſaid I, 'I have ſomething further to allege.' 'Nay,' ſaid the judge, 'I have enough, you need ſay no more.' 'If,' ſaid I, <q>thou haſt enough, I deſire nothing but law and juſtice at thy hands; for I don't look for mercy.</q> 
                     <q>You muſt have juſtice,</q> ſaid he, 'and you ſhall have law.' Then I aſked, <q>Am I at liberty, and free from all that ever hath been done againſt me in this matter?</q> 'Yes,' ſaid the judge, <q>you are free from all that hath been done againſt you. But then,</q> ſtarting up in a rage, he ſaid, <q>I can put the oath to any man here, and I will tender you the oath again.</q> I told him, <q>He had examples enough yeſterday of ſwearing and falſe-ſwearing. both in the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and in the jury; for I ſaw before mine eyes that both juſtices and jury had forſworn themſelves.</q> The judge aſked me, 'If I would take the oath?' I anſwered. Do me <q>juſtice for my falſe impriſonment all this while; for what have I been impriſoned ſo long for? I told him, I ought to be ſet at liberty.</q> 'You are at liberty,' ſaid he, <q>but I will put the oath to you again.</q> Then I turned about,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037441_0573_100D91CF75D3A5D8"/>and ſaid, <q>All people, take notice this is a ſnare, for I ought to be ſet free from the gaoler and from this court.</q> But the judge cried, 'Give him the book,' and the ſheriff and the juſtices cried, 'Give him the book.' Then the power of darkneſs roſe up in them, like a mountain, and a clerk lifted up a book to me. I ſtood ſtill, and ſaid, <q>If it be a Bible, give it me into my hand.</q> 'Yes, yes,' ſaid the judge and juſtices, 'give it him into his hand.' <q>So I took it, and looked into it, and ſaid, I ſee it is a Bible, I am glad of it.</q> He had cauſed the jury to be called, and they ſtood by; for after they had brought in their former verdict, he would not diſmiſs them though they deſired it, but told them, <q>He could not diſmiſs them yet, he ſhould have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for them; therefore they muſt attend, and be ready when they were called.</q> When he ſaid ſo, I felt his intent, that if I was freed, he would come on again. So I looked him in the face, and the witneſs of God ſtarted up in him, and made him bluſh when he looked at me again; for he ſaw that I diſcovered him. Nevertheleſs hardening himſelf, he cauſed the oath to be read to me, the jury ſtanding by. When it was read, he aſked me, <q>Whether I would take the oath or no?</q> Then ſaid I, <q>Ye have given me a book here to kiſs, and to ſwear on; and this book which ye have given me to kiſs, ſays, "Kiſs the Son;" and the Son ſays in this book, "Swear not at all;" and ſo ſays alſo the apoſtle James. I ſay as the book ſays, yet ye impriſon me. How chance ye do not impriſon the book for ſaying ſo? How comes it that the book is at liberty among you, which bids me not to ſwear, and yet ye impriſon me for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the book bids me?</q> I was ſpeaking this to them, and held up the Bible open in my hand, to ſhew them the place where Chriſt forbad ſwearing, they plucked the book out of my hand, and the judge ſaid, <q>Nay, but we will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon George Fox.</q> Yet this got abroad over all the country as a by-word, <q>That they gave me a book to ſwear on that commanded the "not to ſwear at all;" and that the Bible was at liberty, and I in priſon for doing as the Bible ſaid.</q> When the judge ſtill urged me to ſwear, I told him, <q>I never took oath, covenant, nor engagement in my life; but my yea, or nay was more binding to me than an oath was to many others; for had they not had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how little men regarded an oath? and how they had ſworn one way and then another? and how the juſtices and court had forſworn themſelves now? I told him, I.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037441_0574_100D91D169208C98"/>was a man of a tender conſcience, and if they had any ſenſe of a tender conſcience, they would conſider, that it was in obedience to Chriſt's command that I could not ſwear. But,</q> ſaid I, <q>if any of you can convince me, that, after Chriſt and the apoſtle had commanded not to ſwear, they altered that command, and commanded Chriſtians to ſwear, ye ſhall ſee I will ſwear.</q> There being many prieſts by, I ſaid, <q>If ye cannot do it, let your prieſts ſtand up and do it.</q> But not one of the prieſts made anſwer. 'Oh!' ſaid the judge, 'all the world cannot convince you.' 'No,' ſaid I, <q>how is it like the world ſhould convince me? "The whole world lies in wickedneſs." Bring out your ſpiritual men, as ye call them, to convince me.</q> Then both the ſheriff and the judge ſaid, <q>The angels ſwore in the Revelations.</q> I replied, <q>When God bringeth his firſt-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the world, he ſaith, "Let all the angels "of God worſhip him;" and he ſaith, "Swear not at all." Nay,</q> ſaid the judge, 'I will not diſpute.' Then I ſpoke to the jury, telling them, <q>It was for Chriſt's ſake that I could not ſwear, and therefore I warned them not to act contrary to that of God in their conſciences; for before his judgment ſeat they muſt all be brought.</q> I told them, <q>As for plots, and perſecution for religion and popery, I deny them in my heart; for I am a Chriſtian, and ſhall ſhew forth Chriſtianity amongſt you this day. It is for Chriſt's doctrine I ſtand.</q> More words I had both with the judge and jury before the gaoler took me away.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon I was brought up again, and put among the thieves a pretty while, where I ſtood with my hat on till the gaoler took it off. Then the jury having found this new indictment againſt me 'for not taking the oath,' I was called to the bar, and the judge aſked me, <q>What I would ſay for myſelf?</q> I bid them read the indictment, for I would not anſwer to that which I did not hear. The clerk read it, and as he read the judge ſaid, <q>Take heed it be not falſe again;</q> but he read it in ſuch a manner, that I could hardly underſtand what he read. When he had done, the judge aſked me, 'What I ſaid to the indictment?' I told him, <q>At once hearing ſo large a writing read, and that at ſuch a diſtance, that I could not diſtinctly hear all the parts of it, I could not well tell what to ſay to it; but if he would let me have a copy of it, and give me time to conſider of it, I ſhould anſwer it.</q> This put them to a little ſtand; but after awhile the judge aſked me, <q>What time I would
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037441_0575_100D91D2FA916498"/>have?</q> I ſaid, 'Till the next aſſize.' 'But,' ſaid he, <q>what plea will ye now make? Are ye guilty, or not guilty?</q> I ſaid, <q>I am not guilty at all of denying to ſwear obſtinately and wilfully; and as for thoſe things mentioned in the oath, as jeſuitical plots and foreign powers, I utterly deny them in my heart. If I could take any oath I ſhould take that; but I never took any oath in my life.</q> The judge anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'I ſaid well; but,' ſaid he, <q>the king is ſworn, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is ſworn, I am ſworn, and the juſtices are ſworn, and the law is preſerved by oaths.</q> I told him, <q>They had ſufficient experience of men's ſwearing, and he had ſeen how the juſtices and jury had ſworn wrong the other day; and if he had read in the book of martyrs how many of them had refuſed to ſwear, both in the time of the ten perſecutions and in biſhop Bonner's days, he might ſee, that to deny ſwearing in obedience to Chriſt's command was no new thing.</q> He ſaid, 'He wiſhed the laws were otherwiſe.' I ſaid, <q>Our yea is yea, and our nay is nay; and if we tranſgreſs our yea or our nay, let us ſuffer as they do, or ſhould do, that ſwear falſely.</q> This, I told him, we had offered to the king, and the king ſaid, 'It was reaſonable.'</p>
                  <p>After ſome further diſcourſe, they committed me to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon again, there to lie till the next aſſize; and colonel Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gave order to the gaoler, <q>To keep me cloſe, and ſuffer no fleſh alive to come at me; for I was not fit,</q> he ſaid, 'to be diſcourſed with by men.' I was put into a tower, where the ſmoke of the other priſoners came up ſo thick, it ſtood as dew upon the walls, and ſometimes it was ſo thick that I could hardly ſee the candle when it burned; and I being locked under three locks, the under-gaoler, when the ſmoke was great, would hardly be perſuaded to come up to unlock one of the uppermoſt doors, for fear of the ſmoke, ſo that I was almoſt ſmothered. Beſides it rained in upon my bed, and many times, when I went to ſtop out the rain in the cold winter-ſeaſon, my ſhirt was as wet as muck with the rain that came in upon me while I was labouring to ſtop it out. And the place being high and open to the wind, ſometimes as faſt as I ſtopped it the wind blew it out again. In this manner did I lay all that long cold winter till the next aſſize, in which time I was ſo ſtarved with cold and rain, that my body was greatly ſwelled, and my limbs much benumbed.</p>
                  <p>The aſſize began the ſixteenth of the month called March 1661-5. The ſame judges, Twiſden and Turner, coming,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037441_0576_100D91D48FFF7968"/>that circuit again, judge Twiſden ſat this time on the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench, and before him I was brought. I had informed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the errors in this indictment alſo. For though at the aſſize before, judge Turner ſaid to the officers in court, <q>Pray, ſee that all the oath be in the indictment, and that the word Subject be in, and that the day of the month and year of the king be put in right; for it is a ſhame that ſo many errors ſhould be ſeen and found in the face of the country;</q> yet many errors, and thoſe great ones, were in this indictment as well as in the former. Surely the hand of the Lord was in it, to confound their miſchievous work againſt me, and to blind them therein; inſomuch that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, after the indictment was drawn at the former aſſize, the judge examined it himſelf, and tried it with the clerks, yet the word Subject was left out of this indictment alſo, the day of the month was put in wrong, and ſeveral mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial words of the oath were left out; yet they went on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidently againſt me, thinking all was ſafe and well. When I was ſet to the bar, and the jury called over to be ſworn, the clerk aſked me, firſt, <q>Whether I had any objection to make to any of the jury?</q> I told him, <q>I knew none of them.</q> Then, having ſworn the jury, they ſwore three of the officers of the court, to prove, <q>That the oath was tendered to me at the laſt aſſizes, according to the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> 'Come, come,' ſaid the judge, <q>it was not done in a corner.</q> Then he aſked me, <q>What I had to ſay to it; or whether I had taken the oath at the laſt aſſize?</q> I told him what I had formerly ſaid to them, as it now came to my remembrance. Whereupon the judge ſaid, <q>I will not diſpute with you but in point of law.</q> 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>I have ſomething to ſpeak to the jury concerning the indictment.</q> He told me, <q>I muſt not ſpeak to the jury; but if I had any thing to ſay, I muſt ſpeak to him.</q> I aſked him, <q>Whether the oath was to be tendered to the king's ſubjects only, or to the ſubjects of foreign princes?</q> He replied, <q>To the ſubjects of this realm; for I will ſpeak nothing to you,</q> ſaid he, 'but in point of law.' 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>look in the indictment, and thou mayeſt ſee the word Subject is left out of this indictment alſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing the oath is not to be tendered to any but the ſubjects of this realm, and ye have not put me in as a ſubject, the court is to take no notice of this indictment.</q> I had no ſooner ſpoke thus, but the judge cried, <q>Take him away, gaoler, take him away.</q> So I was preſently
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037441_0577_100D91D6D3655CD0"/>hurried away. The gaoler and people looked when I ſhould be called for again; but I was never brought to the court any more, though I had many other great errors to aſſign in the indictment. After I was gone, the judge aſked the jury, 'If they were agreed?' They ſaid, 'Yes;' and found for the king againſt me, as I was told. But I was never called to hear ſentence given, nor was any given againſt me that I could hear of. I underſtand, when they looked narrowly into the indictment, they ſaw it was not good; and the judge having ſworn the officers of the court, that the oath was tendered me at the aſſize before, ſuch a day, according as was ſet in the indictment, and that being the wrong day, I ſhould have proved the officers of the court forſworn men again, if the judge would have ſuffered me to plead to the indictment; which was thought to be the reaſon why he hurried me away ſo ſoon. The judge had paſſed ſentence of premunire upon Margaret Fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was brought in; and it ſeems, when I was hurried away, they recorded me as a premunired perſon, though I was never brought to hear the ſentence, nor knew of it; which was very illegal. For they ought not only to have had me preſent to hear the ſentence given, but alſo to have aſked me firſt, <q>What I could ſay why ſentence ſhould not be given againſt me?</q> But they knew I had ſo much to ſay they could not give ſentence if they heard me.</p>
                  <p>While I was priſoner in Lancaſter caſtle, there was great noiſe and talk of the Turk's overſpreading Chriſtendom, and great fears entered many. But one day, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my priſon-chamber, <q>I ſaw the Lord's power turn againſt him, and that he was turning back again.</q> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to ſome what the Lord had let me ſee, when there were ſuch fears of his over-running Chriſtendom; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a month after the news came down, wherein it was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, 'They had given him a defeat.'</p>
                  <p>Another time, as I was walking in my chamber, with my eye to the Lord, <q>I ſaw the angel of the Lord, with a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering drawn ſword ſtretched ſouthward, as though the court had been all on a fire.</q> Not long after the wars broke out with Holland, the ſickneſs broke forth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fire of London; ſo the Lord's ſword was drawn indeed.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of my long and cloſe impriſonment in ſo bad a place, I was become very weak of body; but the Lord's power was over all, ſupported me through all, and enabled
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037441_0578_100D91D935D0CB60"/>me to do ſervice for him, and for his truth and people, as the place would admit. For while I was in Lancaſter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I anſwered ſeveral books, as the Maſs, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, the Directory, and the Church-faith; which are the four chief religions that are got up ſince the apoſtles days. And there being ſeveral friends in priſon at Lancaſter and other priſons for not paying tithes, I was moved to publiſh the following lines concerning tithes:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>IN the time of the law, thoſe that did not bring their tithes into the ſtore-houſe robbed God; then there was not meat in their houſe; therefore the Lord commanded, <q>To bring them into his houſe, that there might be meat in the ſtore-houſe, which was to feed the fatherleſs, ſtranger, and widow.</q> But theſe prieſts who are counterfeits, who take people's tithes now by a law, are from the beaſt; and if they will not pay them they priſon them, or make them pay treble. Theſe rob the, poor, rob the fatherleſs, and the ſtranger and widow are not filled; ſo their cry is gone up to heaven againſt theſe. Many are made almoſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars by theſe oppreſſing prieſts, their cattle and corn being taken away from them, and they caſt into priſon. Others are ſued at law by the prieſts, and have treble damage ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them; yet ſuch prieſts are cried up to be miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the goſpel. Though when the unchangeable prieſt was come, the prieſthood that was changeable was denied, as we now deny theſe. But if any be moved to cry againſt them, they are ſtocked, beat, or impriſoned. Many are now in priſon at Lancaſter and other places by a national law, the like whereof was never done by the law of God delivered to Moſes. We do not read that under Moſes's law any ſuffered impriſonment, or ſpoiling of goods for not paying tithes, or was to pay treble damage. Surely, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cry for vengeance will be heard, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

There are many priſoners at Kendal, becauſe they cannot pay tithes, as captain Ward, Thomas Robertſon, and the widow Garland, who hath many ſmall children: theſe ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot pay tithes. Others there are in Kendal priſon, who were moved of the Lord to ſpeak to the prieſts, whereof one was moved to go in ſackcloth, and of late with aſhes upon her head. Others have been moved to go in ſackcloth, as a lamentation for the miſerable eſtate of this nation, ſeeing ſo many crying up of the preaching of the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037441_0579_100D91DB242A0A98"/>goſpel, and yet ſo much ſtrife, debate, oaths, and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among people. But where the goſpel is received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſtrife and contention are ended, and oppreſſion is taken off. Oh! the land mourns, becauſe of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe called miniſters! And though the cry of the oppreſſed hath not entered into the ears of the magiſtrates, yet is the cry of the poor oppreſſed people of God entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath, who now will be avenged of all his adverſaries.

                  <p>After the aſſize, colonel Kirby and other juſtices were very uneaſy with my being at Lancaſter; for I had galled them ſore at my trials there, and they laboured much to get me removed from thence to ſome remote place. Colonel Kirby threatened I ſhould be ſent far enough; ſometimes he ſaid, 'I ſhould be ſent beyond ſea.' About ſix weeks after the aſſizes, they got an order from the king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to remove me from Lancaſter; and with it they brought a letter from the earl of Angleſey, wherein was written, <q>That if thoſe things were found true againſt me, which I was charged withal, I deſerved no clemency nor mercy;</q> yet the greateſt matter they had againſt me was, becauſe I could not diſobey the command of Chriſt, and ſwear.</p>
                  <p>When they had prepared for my removal, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheriff and the head-ſheriff's man, with ſome bailiffs, came and fetched me out of the caſtle, when I was ſo weak with lying in that cold, wet, and ſmoky priſon, that I could hardly go or ſtand. They had me into the gaoler's houſe, where was William Kirby and ſeveral others, and they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for wine to give me. I told them, <q>I would have none of their wine.</q> Then they cried, 'Bring out the horſes.' I deſired them firſt to ſhew me their order, or a copy of it, if they intended to remove me; but they would ſhew me none but their ſwords. I told them, <q>There was no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed upon me, nor was I premunired, that I knew of; and therefore I was not made the king's priſoner, but was the ſheriff's; for they and all the country knew, that I was not fully heard at the laſt aſſize, nor ſuffered to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037441_0580_100D91DD87B484D8"/>ſhew the errors in the indictment, which were ſufficient to quaſh it, though they had kept me from one aſſize to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to the end they might try me. But they all knew there was no ſentence of premunire paſſed upon me; therefore I, not being the king's priſoner but the ſheriff's, did deſire to ſee their order.</q> Inſtead of ſhewing me their order, they haled me out, and lifted me upon one of the ſheriff's horſes. When I was on horſeback in the ſtreet, the town's people being gathered to gaze upon me, I told the officers, I had received neither Chriſtianity, civility, nor humanity from them. They hurried me away about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles to Bentham, though I was ſo very weak that I was hardly able to ſit on horſeback, and my cloaths ſmelt ſo of ſmoke they were loathſome to myſelf. The wicked gaoler, one Hunter, a young fellow, would come behind and give the horſe a laſh with his whip, and make him ſkip and leap; ſo that I, being weak, had much ado to ſit on him; then he would come and look me in the face, and ſay, 'How do you, Mr. Fox?' I told him, <q>It was not civil in him to do ſo.</q> The Lord cut him off ſoon after.</p>
                  <p>When we were come to Bentham in Yorkſhire, there met us many troopers and a marſhal; and many of the gentry of the country were come in, and abundance of people to take a view of me. I being very weak and weary, deſired them to let me lie down on a bed, which the ſoldiers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; for thoſe that brought me thither gave their order to the marſhal, and he ſet a guard of his ſoldiers upon me. When they had ſtaid awhile, they preſſed horſes, raiſed the bailiff of the hundred, the conſtables, and others, and had me to Giggleſwick that night; but exceeding weak I was. There they raiſed the conſtables with their clog-ſhoes, who ſat drinking all the night in the room by me, ſo that I could not get much reſt. Next day we came to a market-town, where ſeveral friends came to ſee me. Robert Widders and divers friends came to me upon the road. The next night I aſked the ſoldiers, <q>Whither they intended to carry me, and whither I was to be ſent?</q> Some of them ſaid, <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſea,</q> others ſaid, 'To Tinmouth-caſtle.' And a great fear there was amongſt them, leſt ſome ſhould reſcue me out of their hands; but that fear was needleſs. Next night we came to York, where the marſhal put me up into a great chamber, where there came moſt part of two troops to ſee me. One of thoſe oopers, an envious man, hearing I was premunired, aſked me, <q>What eſtate I had, and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037441_0581_100D91DF7649D7A8"/>whether it was copy-hold or free-land?</q> I took no notice of his queſtion, but was moved to declare the word of life to the ſoldiers, and many of them were very loving. At night lord Frecheville, who commanded thoſe horſe, came to me, and was very civil and loving. I gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my impriſonment, and declared many things to him relating to truth. They kept me at York two days, then the marſhal and four or five ſoldiers were ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey me to Scarborough caſtle. Indeed theſe were very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil men, and carried themſelves civilly and lovingly to me. On the way we baited at Malton, and they permitted friends to come and viſit me. When we were come to Scarborough, they had me to an inn, and gave notice to the governor, who ſent half a dozen ſoldiers to be my guard that night. Next day they conducted me to the caſtle, put me into a room, and ſet a centry on me. I being very weak, and ſubject to fainting, they for awhile let me go out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into the air with a centry. They ſoon removed me out of this room, and put me into an open room, where the rain came in; and the room ſmoked exceedingly, which was very offenſive to me. One day the governor, who was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir Jordan Croſland, came to ſee me, and brought with him one called Sir Francis Cobb. I deſired the governor to go into my room, and ſee what a place I had. I had got a little fire made in it, and the room was ſo filled with ſmoke, that when they were in they could hardly find their way out again. He being a Papiſt, I told him that was his purgatory which they had put me into. I was forced to lay out about fifty ſhillings to ſtop out the rain, and keep the room from ſmoking ſo much. When I had been at that charge, and made it ſomewhat tolerable, they removed me into a worſe, where I had neither chimney nor fire-hearth. This being to the ſea-ſide, and lying much open, the wind drove in the rain forcibly, ſo that the water came over my bed, and ran about the room, that I was fain to ſkim it up with a platter. And when my clothes were wet, I had no fire to dry them; ſo my body was numbed with cold, and my fingers ſwelled, that one was grown as big as two. Though I was at ſome charge on this room alſo, yet I could not keep out the wind and rain. Beſides they would ſuffer few friends to come at me, and many times not any, not ſo much as to bring me a little food; but I was forced for the firſt quarter, to hire one of another ſociety to bring me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries. Sometimes the ſoldiers would take it from her,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037441_0582_100D91E1C7ACAD08"/>and ſhe would ſcuffle with them for it. Afterwards I hired a ſoldier to fetch me water and bread, and ſomething to make a fire of, when I was in a room where a fire could be made. Commonly a three-penny loaf ſerved me three weeks, and ſometimes longer, and moſt of my drink was water, with wormwood ſteeped or bruiſed in it. One time, when the weather was very ſharp, and I had taken a great cold, I got a little elecampane-beer; and I heard one of the ſoldiers ſay to the other, <q>They would play me a pretty trick, for they would ſend for me up to the deputy-governor, and in the mean time drink my ſtrong beer out;</q> and ſo they did. When I returned, one of the ſoldiers came to me in a jeer, and aſked me for ſome ſtrong beer. I told him, They had played their pretty trick, and took no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-notice of it. But inaſmuch as they kept me ſo very ſtrait, not giving liberty for friends to come to me, I ſpoke to the keepers of the caſtle to this effect: <q>I did not know till I was removed from Lancaſter caſtle, and brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to this caſtle of Scarborough, that I was convicted of a premunire; for the judge did not give ſentence upon me at the aſſizes in open court. But ſeeing I am now a priſoner here, if I may not have my liberty, let my friends and acquaintance have their liberty to come and viſit me, as Paul's friends had among the Romans, who were not Chriſtians but Heathens. For Paul's friends had their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; all that would might come to him, and he had his liberty to preach to them in his hired houſe; but I cannot have liberty to go into the town, nor for my friends to come to me here. So you, that go under the name of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, are worſe in this reſpect than thoſe Heathens were.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though they would not let friends come to me, they would often bring others, either to gaze upon me or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with me.</p>
                  <p>One time came a great company of Papiſts to diſcourſe with me, who affirmed, <q>The pope was infallible, and had ſtood infallible ever ſince Peter's time.</q> I ſhewed them the contrary by hiſtory: <q>For one of the biſhops of Rome, Marcellinus by name, denied the faith, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to idols; therefore he was not infallible. I told them, if they were in the Infallible Spirit, they need not have gaols, ſwords, ſtaves, racks, tortures, fires, whips, and gallows, to hold up their religion by, and to deſtroy men's lives about religion; for if they were in the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit, they would preſerve men's lives, and uſe none
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037441_0583_100D91E36410ECE8"/>but ſpiritual weapons about religion. I told them alſo what one that had been of their ſociety told me. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lived in Kent, who had not only been a Papiſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but had brought over ſeveral to that religion; but coming to be convinced of God's truth, and being turned by it to Chriſt, her Saviour, ſhe exhorted the Papiſts to the ſame. One of them, a taylor, being at work at her houſe, while ſhe opened to him the falſeneſs of the Popiſh religion, and endeavoured to draw him from it to the truth, drew his knife, and got between her and the door. But ſhe ſpoke boldly to him, and bid him put up his knife, for ſhe knew his principle. I aſked the woman, What ſhe thought he would have done with his knife? She ſaid, "He would have ſtabbed her." "Stab thee!" ſaid I, <q>What would he have ſtabbed thee for? thy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</q> "Yes," ſaid ſhe, <q>It is the principle of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, if any turn from their religion, to kill them if they can.</q> This ſtory I told thoſe Papiſts, and that I had it from a perſon who had been one of them. but had forſook their principles, and diſcovered their practices. They did not deny this to be their principle, but ſaid, What! would I declare this abroad? I told them, Yes, ſuch things ought to be declared abroad, that it might be known how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary their religion was to true Chriſtianity;</q> whereupon they went away in a great rage.</p>
                  <p>Another Papiſt came to diſcourſe with me, who ſaid, <q>All the patriarchs were in hell from the creation till Chriſt came, and that when Chriſt ſuffered he went into hell, and the devil ſaid to him, What comeſt thou hither for, to break open our ſtrong bolds? And Chriſt ſaid, To fetch them all out. So,</q> he ſaid, <q>Chriſt was three days and three nights in hell to bring them out.</q> I told him, that was falſe; for Chriſt ſaid to the thief, <q>This day thou ſhalt be with the in paradiſe.</q> And Enoch and Elijah were tranſlated into heaven. And Abraham was in heaven: for the ſcripture ſaith, <q>Lazarus was in his boſom; and Moſes and Elias were with Chriſt upon the mount before he ſuffered.</q> Theſe inſtances ſtopped the Papiſt's mouth, and put him to a ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Another time came Dr. Witty, who was eſteemed a great doctor in phyſick, with lord Falconbridge, the governor of Tinmouth caſtle, and ſeveral knights. I being called to them, Witty undertook to diſcourſe with me, and aſked me, 'What I was in priſon for?' I told him, <q>Becauſe I
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037441_0584_100D91E559D53090"/>would not diſobey the command of Chriſt, and ſwear.</q> He ſaid, 'I ought to ſwear my allegiance to the king.' He being a great Preſbyterian, I aſked him, <q>Whether he had not ſworn againſt the king and houſe of lords, and taken the Scotch covenant? And had he not ſince ſworn to the king? What then was his ſwearing good for? But my allegiance,</q> I told him, <q>did not conſiſt in ſwearing, but in truth and faithfulneſs.</q> After ſome further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I was had away to my priſon again; and afterwards Dr. Witty boaſted in the town amongſt his patients, that he had conquered me. When I heard of it, I told the governor, <q>It was a ſmall boaſt in him to ſay, He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered a bondman.</q> I deſired to bid him come to me again, when he came to the caſtle. He came again awhile after, with about ſixteen or ſeventeen great perſons, and then he ran himſelf worſe on ground than before. For he affirmed before them all, <q>That Chriſt had not enlightened every man that cometh into the world;</q> and <q>that the grace of God, that brought ſalvation, had not appeared unto all men, and that Chriſt had not died for all men.</q> I aſked him, what ſort of men thoſe were which Chriſt had not enlightened? and whom his grace had not appeared to? and whom he had not died for? He ſaid, <q>Chriſt did not die for adulterers, and idolaters, and wicked men.</q> I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <q>Whether adulterers and wicked men were not ſinners?</q> He ſaid, 'Yes.' 'Did not Chriſt die for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?' 'ſaid I. 'Did he not come to call ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?' 'Yes,' ſaid he. 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>thou haſt ſtopped thy own mouth.</q> So I proved, that the grace of God had appeared unto all men, though ſome turned from it into wantonneſs, and walked deſpitefully againſt it; and that Chriſt had enlightened all men, though ſome hated the light. Several of the people confeſſed it was true; but he went away in a great rage, and came no more to me.</p>
                  <p>Another time the governor brought a prieſt; but his mouth was ſoon ſtopped. Not long after he brought two or three parliament-men, who aſked me, <q>Whether I did own miniſters and biſhops?</q> I told them, <q>Yes, ſuch as Chriſt ſent, ſuch as had freely received, and would freely give, ſuch as were qualified, and were in the ſame power and ſpirit the apoſtles were in. But ſuch biſhops and teachers as theirs, that would go no farther than a great benefice, I did not own; for they were not like the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. Chriſt ſaith to his miniſters, <q>Go ye into all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037441_0585_100D91E7A2CBDA28"/>and preach the goſpel;</q> but ye parliament-men, <q>who keep your prieſts and biſhops in ſuch great fat benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have ſpoiled them all. For do ye think they will go into all nations to preach? or will go any farther than a great fat benefice? Judge yourſelves whether they will or no.</q>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There came another time the widow of old lord Fairfax, and with her a great company; one of whom was a prieſt. I was moved to declare the truth to them, and the prieſt aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, <q>Why we ſaid Thou and Thee to people? for he counted us but fools and idiots for ſpeaking ſo.</q> I aſked him, <q>Whether thoſe that tranſlated the ſcriptures, and made the grammar and accidence, were fools and idiots, ſeeing they tranſlated the ſcriptures ſo, and made the grammar ſo, Thou to one, and You to more than one, and left it ſo to us? If they were fools and idiots, why had not he and ſuch as he, who looked upon themſelves as wiſe men, and could not bear Thou and Thee to a ſingular, altered the grammar, accidence, and bible, and put the plural inſtead of the ſingular? But if they were wiſe men, that ſo tranſlated the bible, and made the grammar and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo, I wiſhed him to conſider, whether they were not fools and idiots themſelves, that did not ſpeak as their grammars and bibles taught them; but were offended with us, and called us fools and idiots for ſpeaking ſo?</q> Thus the prieſt's mouth was ſtopped, many of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acknowledged the truth, and were pretty loving and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Some would have given me money, but I would not receive it.</p>
                  <p>After this came Dr. Cradock, with three prieſts more, and the governor with his lady (ſo called) and another that was called a lady, with a great company. Dr. Cradock aſked me, 'What I was in priſon for?' I told him, <q>For obeying the command of Chriſt and the apoſtle, in not ſwearing. But if he, being both a doctor and a juſtice, could convince me, that after Chriſt and the apoſtle had forbid ſwearing, they commanded Chriſtians to ſwear, then I would ſwear. Here was the bible, I told him, he might if he could ſhew me any ſuch command.</q> He ſaid. <q>It is written, ye ſhall ſwear in truth and righteouſneſs.</q> 'Aye.' <q>ſaid I, 'it was written ſo in Jeremiah's time; but that was many ages before Chriſt commanded not to ſwear at all; but where is it written ſo ſince Chriſt forbad all ſwearing? I could bring as many inſtances out of the Old Teſtament
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037441_0586_100D91E99378B5F0"/>for ſwearing as thou, and it may be more; but of what force are they to prove ſwearing lawful in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince Chriſt and the apoſtle forbad it? Beſides,</q> ſaid I, <q>in that text where it is written, "Ye ſhall ſwear," what [Ye] was this? Was it Ye Gentiles, or Ye Jews?</q> To this he would not anſwer; but one of the prieſts that were with him anſwered. <q>It was to the Jews that this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</q> Then Dr. Cradock confeſſed it was ſo.' 'Very well,' ſaid I, <q>but where did God ever give a command to the Gentiles to ſwear? For thou knoweſt that we are Gentiles by nature.</q> 'Indeed,' ſaid he, <q>in the goſpel-times every thing was to be eſtabliſhed out of the mouths of two or three witneſſes; but there was to be no ſwearing then.</q> 'Why then,' ſaid I, <q>doſt thou force oaths upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, contrary to thy own knowledge, in the goſpel-times? And why,</q> ſaid I, 'doſt thou excommunicate my friends?' (for he had excommunicated abundance both in Yorkſhire and Lancaſhire.) He ſaid, 'For not coming to church.' 'Why,' ſaid I, <q>ye left us above twenty years ago, when we were but young lads and laſſes, to the Preſbyterians, Independents, and Baptiſts, many of whom made ſpoil of our goods, and perſecuted us becauſe we would not follow them. We being but young, knew little then of your principles, and the old men that did know them, if ye had intended to have kept them to you, and have kept your principles alive, that we might have known them, ye ſhould either not have fled from us as ye did, or ye ſhould have ſent us your epiſtles, collects, homilies, and evening ſongs; for Paul wrote epiſtles to the ſaints, though he was in priſon. But they and we might have turned Turks or Jews for any collects, homilies, or epiſtles we had from you all this while. And now thou haſt excommunicated 'us, both young and old, and ſo have others of you done; that is, <q>Ye have put us out of your church, before ye have got us into it,</q> and before ye have brought us to know your principles. Is not this madneſs in you, to put us out before we were brought in? Indeed, if ye had brought us into your church, and when we had been in, if we had done ſome bad thing, that had been ſomething like a ground for excommunication or putting out again. But,' ſaid I, 'What doſt thou call the church?' 'Why,' ſaid he, 'that which you call the ſteeple-houſe,' Then I afted him, 'Whether Chriſt ſhed his blood for the ſteeple-houſe? and purchaſed and ſanctified the ſteeple-houſe
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037441_0587_100D91EB2391E560"/>with his blood? And ſeeing the church is Chriſt's bride and wife, and that he is the head of the church, doſt thou think the ſteeple-houſe is Chriſt's wife and bride, and that he is the head of that old houſe, or of his people? No,</q> ſaid he, <q>Chriſt is the head of his people, and they are the church.</q> 'But,' ſaid I, <q>you have given the title church to an old houſe, which belongs to the people; and you have taught them to believe ſo.</q> I aſked him alſo, <q>Why he perſecuted friends for not paying tithes? And whether God ever commanded the Gentiles to pay tithes? And whether Chriſt had not ended tithes when he ended the Levitical prieſthood that took tithes? And whether Chriſt, when he ſent his diſciples to preach, had not commanded them to preach freely as he had given them freely? And whether all the miniſters of Chriſt are not bound to obſerve this command of Chriſt?</q> He ſaid, 'He would not diſpute 'that.' Neither did I find he was willing to ſtay on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for he preſently turned to another matter, and ſaid, <q>You marry, but I know not how.</q> I replied, <q>It may be ſo: but why doſt thou not come and ſee?</q> Then he <q>threatened that he would uſe his power againſt us, as he had done.</q> I bid him. 'Take heed; for he was an old man.' I aſked him alſo, <q>Where he read from Geneſis to Revelations, that ever any prieſt did marry any? I wiſhed him to ſhew me ſome inſtance thereof, if he would have us come to them to be married; for, ſaid I, thou haſt excommunicated one of my friends two years after he was dead, about his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And why doſt thou not excommunicate Iſaac, and Jacob, and Boaz, and Ruth? For we do not read they were ever married by the prieſts; but they took one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the aſſemblies of the righteous, in the preſence of God and his people; and ſo do we. So that we have all the holy men and women, that the ſcripture ſpeaks of in this practice, on our ſide.</q> Much diſcourſe we had; but when he found he could get no advantage on me, he went away with his company.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch people I was much exerciſed while I was there; for moſt that came to the caſtle would deſire to ſpeak with me, and great diſputes I had with them. But as to friends, I was as a man buried alive; for though many came far to ſee me, few were ſuffered to come at me; and when any friend came into the caſtle about buſineſs, if he looked but towards me, they would rage at him. At laſt the governor came under trouble himſelf; for having ſent
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037441_0588_100D91ED1BD2E108"/>out a privateer to ſea, they took ſome ſhips that were not enemies ſhips, but their friends; whereupon he was brought into trouble; after which he grew ſomewhat more friendly to me. For before I had a marſhal ſet over me, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to get money out of me; but I was not to give him a farthing; and when they found they could get nothing from me, he was taken off again. The officers often threatered me, that I ſhould be hanged over the wall. Nay, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-governor told me once, that the king, knowing I had great intereſt in the people had ſent me thither; that if there ſhould be any ſtirring in the nation, they ſhould hang m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> over the wall to keep the people down. There being awhile after a marriage at a Papiſt's houſe, upon which occaſion a great many of them were met together, they talked much then of hanging me. But I told them, <q>If that was what they deſired, and it was permitted them, I was ready; for I never feared death nor ſufferings in my life; but I was known to be an innocent, peaceable man, free from all ſtirrings and plottings, and one that ſought the good of all men.</q> Afterwards, the governor growing kinder, I ſpoke to him, when he was to go to London to the parliament. and deſired him to ſpeak to 'ſquire Marſh, Sir Francis Cobb, and ſome others; and let them know how long I had lain in priſon, and for what: which he did. When he came down again, he told me, 'ſquire Marſh ſaid, <q>He would go an hundred miles barefoot for my liberty, he knew me ſo well;</q> and ſeveral others, he ſaid, ſpoke well of me. From which time the governor was very loving to me.</p>
                  <p>There were amongſt the priſoners two very bad men, who often fat drinking with the officers and ſoldiers; and becauſe I would not ſit and drink with them, it made them the worſe againſt me. One time, when theſe two priſoners were drunk, one of them (whoſe name was William Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, a Preſbyterian, who had been a captain) came and challenged me to fight with him. I ſeeing what condition he was in, got out of his way; and next morning, when he was more ſober, ſhewed him, <q>How unmanly a thing it was in him to challenge a man to fight, whoſe principle, he knew it, was not to ſtrike; but if he was ſtricken on one ear, to turn the other. I told him, if he had a mind to fight, he ſhould have challenged ſome of the ſoldiers, that could have anſwered him in his own way. But however, ſeeing he had challenged me, I was now come to anſwer
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037441_0589_100D91EF82E2EC10"/>him, with my hands in my pockets: and (reaching my head towards him) Here ſaid I, here is my hair, here are my cheeks, here is my back.</q> With that he ſk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pped away from me, and went into another room: at which the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fell a laughing; and one of the officers ſaid, <q>You are a happy man that can bear ſuch things.</q> Thus he was conquered without a blow. After awhile he took the oath, gave bond, got out of priſon; and not long after the Lord cut him off.</p>
                  <p>There were great impriſonments in this and the former years, while I was priſoner at Lancaſter and Scarborough. At London many friends were crowded into Newgate, and other priſons, where the ſickneſs was; and many died in priſon. Many alſo were baniſhed, and ſeveral ſent on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board by the king's order. Some maſters of ſhips would not carry them, but ſet them on ſhore again; yet ſome were ſent to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and Mevis, and the Lord bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them there. One maſter of a ſhip was very wicked and cruel to friends that were put on board his ſhip; for he kept them down under decks, though the ſickneſs was amongſt them; ſo that many died of it. But the Lord viſited him for his wickedneſs; for he loſt moſt of his ſeamen by the plague, and lay ſeveral months croſſed with contrary winds, though other ſhips went out, and made their voyages. At laſt he came before Plymouth, where the governor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates would not ſuffer him nor any of his men to come aſhore, though he wanted neceſſaries for his voyage; but Thomas Lower, Arthur Cotton; John Light, and other friends went to the ſhip's ſide, and carried neceſſaries for the friends that were priſoners on board. The maſter, being thus croſſed and vexed; curſed them that put him upon this freight; and ſaid, <q>He hoped he ſhould not go far before he was taken.</q> And the veſſel was but a little while gone out of ſight of Plymouth, before ſhe was taken by a Dutch man of war, and carried into Holland. When they came into Holland, the States ſent the baniſhed friends back to England, with a letter of paſſport, and a certificate, <q>That they had not made an eſcape, but were ſent back by them.</q> In time the Lord's power wrought over this ſtorm, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our perſecutors were confounded and put to ſhame.</p>
                  <p>After I had lain priſoner above a year in Scarborough caſtle, I ſent a letter to the king, in which I gave him <q>an account of my impriſonment, and the bad uſage I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in priſon; and alſo that I was informed no man
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037441_0590_100D91F1D42D2170"/>could deliver me but he.</q> After this, John Whitehead being at London, and having acquaintance alſo with ſquire Marſh, he went to viſit him, and ſpoke to him about me; and he undertook, if John Whitehead would get the ſtate of my caſe drawn up, to deliver it to the maſter of requeſts, Sir John Birkenhead, who would endeavour to get a releaſe for me. So John Whitehead and Ellis Hookes drew up a relation of my impriſonment and ſufferings, and carried it to Marſh; and he went with it to the maſter of requeſts, who procured an order from the king for my releaſe. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the order was, <q>That the king being certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that I was a man principled againſt plotting and fighting, and had been ready at all times to diſcover plots, rather than to make any, &amp;c. therefore his royal pleaſure was, that I ſhould be diſcharged from my impriſonment,</q> &amp;c. As ſoon as this order was obtained, John Whitehead came to Scarborough with it, and delivered it to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; who, upon receipt thereof, gathered the officers together, and, without requiring bond or ſureties for my peaceable living, being ſatisfied that I was a man of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, he diſcharged me freely, and gave me the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſport:</p>

                  <p>After I was releaſed, I would have made the governor a preſent for the civility and kindneſs he had of late ſhewed me; but he would not receive any thing; ſaying, <q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good he could do for me and my friends, he would do it, and never do them any hurt.</q> And afterwards, if at any time the mayor of the town ſent to him for ſoldiers to break up friends meetings, if he ſent any down, he would pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately give them a charge, 'Not to meddle.' He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loving to his dying-day. The officers alſo and the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were mightily changed, and become very reſpectful to me. When they had occaſion to ſpeak of me, they would
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037441_0591_100D91F365EDA3F8"/>ſay, <q>He is as ſtiff as a tree, and as pure as a bell; for we could never bow him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very next day after my releaſe, the fire broke out in London; and the report of it came quickly down into the country. Then I ſaw the Lord God was true and juſt in his word, which he had ſhewed me before in Lancaſter gaol, when I ſaw the angel of the Lord with a glittering drawn ſword ſouthward, as before expreſſed. The people of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don were forewarned of this fire: yet few laid it to heart, or believed it; but rather grew more wicked, and higher in pride. A friend was moved to come out of Huntingdon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire a little before the ſire, and to ſcatter his money up and down the ſtreets, turn his horſe looſe, untie the knees of his breeches, and let his ſtockings fall down, and to unbutton his doublet, and tell the people, 'So ſhould they run up and down, ſcattering their money and goods, half undreſſed, like 'mad people, as he was a ſign to them;' which they did when the city was burning. Thus hath the Lord exerciſed his prophets and ſervants by his power, ſhewed them ſigns of his judgments, and ſent them to forewarn the people; but inſtead of repenting, they have beaten and cruelly entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome; and ſome they have impriſoned, both in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer power's days, and ſince. But the Lord is juſt; and happy are they that obey his word. Some have been mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go naked in their ſtreets, in the other power's days, and ſince, as ſigns of their nakedneſs; and have declared amongſt them, <q>That God would ſtrip them of their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical profeſſions, and make them as bare and naked as they were.</q> But, inſtead of conſidering it, they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whipped, or otherwiſe abuſed them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impriſoned them. Others have been moved to go in ſackcloth, and to denounce the woes and vengeance of God againſt the pride and haughtineſs of the people; but few regarded it. And in the other power's days, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, envious, profeſſing prieſts put up ſeveral petitions both to Oliver and Richard, called protectors, and to the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, judges, and juſtices againſt us, ſtuffed full of lies, and vilifying words and ſlanders; but we got copies of them, and through the Lord's aſſiſtance anſwered the all, and cleared the Lord's truth and ourſelves of them. But oh! the body of darkneſs that roſe againſt the truth, in them that made lies their refuge! But the Lord ſwept them away; and in and with his power, truth, light, and life hedged his lambs about, and preſerved them as on eagles'
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037441_0592_100D91F4F8702E60"/>wings. Therefore we all had and have great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to truſt the Lord, who, we ſaw, by his power and Spirit, overturned and brought to nought all the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and counſels that were hatched in darkneſs againſt his trath and people; and by the ſame truth gave his people dominion, that therein they might ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I could not but take notice how the hand of the Lord turned againſt thoſe my perſecutors who had been the cauſe of my impriſonment, or had been abuſive or cruel to me under it. For the officer that fetched me to Houlker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall waſted his eſtate, and ſoon after fled into Ireland. And moſt of the juſtices that were upon the bench at the ſeſſions when I was ſent to priſon died in awhile after; as old Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Preſten, Rawlinſon, Porter, and Matthew Weſt of Borwick. And juſtice Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or fourteen motherleſs children; who had impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned two friends to death, and thereby made ſeveral chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fatherleſs. Colonel Kirby never proſpered after. The chief conſtable, Richard Dodgſon, died ſoon after; and Mount, the petty conſtable, and the wife of John Aſhbum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the other petty conſtable, who railed at me in her houſe, died ſoon after. William Knipe, the witneſs they brought againſt me, died ſoon after. Hunter, the gaoler of Lancaſter, who was very wicked to me while I was his priſoner, was cut off in his young days. The under ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, that carried me from Lancaſter priſon towards Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, lived not long after. And Joblin, the gaoler of Durham, who was priſoner with me in Scarborough caſtle, and had often incenſed the governor and ſoldiers againſt me, though he got out of priſon, the Lord cut him off in his wickedneſs ſoon after. When I came into that country again, moſt of thoſe that dwelt in Lancaſhire were dead, and others ruined in their eſtates: ſo that, though I did not ſeek revenge upon them, for their actings againſt me contrary to the law, yet the Lord had executed his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon many of them.</p>
                  <p>Being now at liberty, I went about three miles to a large general meeting at a friend's houſe, who had been a chief conſtable; and all was quiet and well. On fourth-day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I returned to Scarborough, and had a meeting in the town at Peter Hodgſon's. To this meeting came one call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lady, and ſeveral other great perſons; alſo a young man, ſon to the bailiff of the town, who had been convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while I was there in priſon. That lady (ſo called) came
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037441_0593_100D91F7A736F890"/>to me, and ſaid, 'I ſpoke againſt the miniſters.' I told her, <q>Such as the prophets and Chriſt declared againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, I declared againſt now.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence I went to Whitby: and, having viſited friends there, paſſed to Burlington, where I had another meeting. From thence to Oram, where I had another meeting; and thence to Marmaduke Storr's, and had a large meeting at a conſtable's houſe, on whom the Lord had wrought a great miracle.</p>
                  <p>Next day two friends being to take each other in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, there was a very great meeting, which I attended. I was moved to open the ſtate of our marriages, declaring, <q>How the people of God took one another in the aſſemblies of the elders; and that it was God who joined man and woman together before the fall. And though men had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en upon them to join in the fall, yet in the reſtoration it is God's joining that is the right and honourable marriage; but never any prieſt did marry any, that we read of in the ſcriptures, from Geneſis to Revelations.</q> Then I ſhewed them the duty of man and wife, how they ſhould ſerve God, being heirs of life and grace together.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed from thence to Grace Barwick's, where I had a general meeting, which was very large. I came next to Richard Shipton's, where I had another meeting; and to a prieſt's houſe, whoſe wife was convinced, and himſelf grown very loving, and glad to ſee me. This was that prieſt, who, in the year 1651, threatened, <q>If ever he met with me again, he would have my life, or I ſhould have his;</q> and ſaid, <q>He would loſe his head if I were not knocked down in a month;</q> but now he was partly convinced, and become very kind. I went from his houſe towards the ſea, where ſeveral friends came to viſit me: amongſt others, Philip Scarff, who had formerly been a prieſt, but, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth, was now become a preacher of Chriſt freely, and continued ſo. Paſſing on, I called to ſee an ancient man, who was convinced of truth, and was above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old. Then I came to a friend's houſe, where I had a great meeting, and quiet. I had a great meeting near Malton; and another large one near Hull: from whence I went to Holdendike. As we went into the town, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men queſtioned me and thoſe that were with me; but they not having any warrant to ſtay us, we paſſed by them, and they in a rage threatened they would ſearch us out. I went to the houſe of one called the lady Montague, where I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037441_0594_100D91F9A1A63648"/>that night; and ſeveral friends came to viſit me. Next morning, being up betimes, I walked into the orchard, and ſaw a man about ſun-riſing go into the houſe in a great cloak. He ſtaid not long; but ſoon came out again, and went away, not ſeeing me. I felt ſomething ſtrike at my life; and went into the houſe, where I found the maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant affrighted and trembling. She told me, <q>That man had a naked rapier under his cloak.</q> By which I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he came with an intent to have done miſchief; but the Lord prevented him.</p>
                  <p>I then viſited friends till I came to York, where we had a large meeting. After which I went to viſit juſtice Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, an ancient juſtice of peace; who had been very loving to me and friends from the beginning. There was a prieſt with him; who told me, <q>It was ſaid, that we loved none but ourſelves.</q> I told him, <q>We loved all mankind as they were God's creation, and as they were children of Adam and Eve by generation; and we loved the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the Holy Ghoſt.</q> This ſtopped him. After ſome other diſcourſe, we parted friendly, and paſſed away.</p>
                  <p>About this time I wrote a book, intituled, <q>Fear God, and honour the king;</q> in which I ſhewed, <q>That none could rightly fear God, and honour the king, but they that departed from ſin and evil:</q> This book did much affect the ſoldiers and moſt people.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited friends at York, we paſſed to a market town, where we had a meeting at George Watkinſon's, who formerly had been a juſtice. A glorious, bleſſed meeting it was, very large, and the ſeed of life was ſet over all. But we had been troubled to get into this town, had not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence made way for us; for the watchmen ſtood ready to ſtop us: but there being a man riding juſt before us, the watchmen queſtioned him firſt; and perceiving he was a juſtice, let him paſs; and we riding cloſe after him, by that means eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>From this place we paſſed to Thomas Taylor's, who had formerly been a captain, where we had a precious meeting. Hard by Thomas Taylor's lived a knight, who was much diſpleaſed when he heard I was like to be releaſed out of priſon; and threatened, <q>if the king ſet me at liberty, he would ſend me to priſon again the next day.</q> But though I had this meeting ſo near him, the Lord's power ſtopped him from meddling, and our meeting was quiet. Colonel Kirby alſo, who had been the chief means of my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037441_0595_100D91FB329D9C70"/>at Lancaſter and Scarborough caſtles, when he heard I was ſet at liberty, got another order for the taking me up; and ſaid, <q>He would ride his horſe forty miles to take me, and would give forty pounds to have me taken.</q> Awhile after I came ſo near as to have a meeting within two miles of him: and then he was ſtruck with the gout, and kept his bed, ſo that it was thought he would have died.</p>
                  <p>From Thomas Taylor's I viſited friends till I came to Synderhill-Green, where I had a large and general meeting. The prieſt of the place, hearing of it, ſent the conſtable to the juſtices for a warrant; and they rode their horſes ſo hard, they almoſt ſpoiled them: but the notice they had being ſhort, and the way long, the meeting was ended before they came. I heard not of them till I was going out of the houſe, after meeting was over; and then a friend came and told me, <q>They were ſearching another houſe for me, the houſe I was then going to.</q> As I went along the cloſes towards it, I met the conſtables, wardens, and the juſtice's clerk. I paſſed through them, they looking at me, and went to the houſe they had been ſearching. Thus they loſt their deſign; for the Lord's power bound them, and preſerved me over them; and friends parted, and all eſcaped them. The officers went away as they came; for the Lord had fruſtrated their deſign; praiſed be his name for ever!</p>
                  <p>After this I went into Derbyſhire, where I had a large meeting. Some friends were apprehenſive of the conſtable's coming; for they had great perſecution in thoſe parts: but our meeting was quiet. A juſtice of peace in that county had taken away much of friends goods: whereupon Ellen Fretwell had made her appeal to the ſeſſions, and the reſt of the juſtices granted her her goods again, and ſpoke to that perſecuting juſtice, that he ſhould not do ſo any more. She was moved to ſpeak to that juſtice, and to warn him: whereupon he bid her, 'Come and ſit down on the bench.' 'Ay,' ſaid ſhe, <q>if I may perſuade you to do juſtice to the country, I will ſit down with you.</q> 'No,' ſaid he, <q>then you ſhall not. Get out of the court.</q> As ſhe was going. ſhe was moved of the Lord to turn again, and ſay, <q>She ſhould be there when he ſhould not.</q> After the ſeſſions, he went home and drove away her brother's oxen, for going to meetings. Then Suſan Frith, a friend of Cheſterfield was moved of the Lord to tell him, <q>If he continued in his perſecuting of the innocent, the Lord would execute his
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037441_0596_100D91FCDE85F318"/>plagues upon him.</q> Soon after which he fell diſtracted, and died. This relation I had from Ellen Fretwell herſelf.</p>
                  <p>I travelled out of Derbyſhire into Nottinghamſhire, and had a large meeting at Skegby; from thence went to Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, where alſo I had a meeting; and thence to another town, where was a fair, at which I met with many friends. Then paſſing through the foreſt in a mighty thundering and rainy day, I came to Nottingham. So great was the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, that many trees were torn up by the roots, and ſome people killed; but the Lord preſerved us. On firſt-day following I had a large meeting in Nottingham, very quiet; friends were come to ſit under their teacher the grace of God, which brought them ſalvation, and were eſtabliſhed upon the rock and foundation Chriſt Jeſus. After meeting I went to viſit the friend who had been ſheriff about the year 1649, whoſe priſoner I then was.</p>
                  <p>From Nottingham I paſſed into Leiceſterſhire, and came to Syleby, where we had a large bleſſed meeting. After which I went to Leiceſter to viſit the priſoners there, and then to John Penford's, where we had a general meeting, large and precious. From thence I paſſed, viſiting friends and my relations, till I came to Warwick; where having viſited the priſoners, I paſſed to Badgley, and had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meeting. I travelled through Northamptonſhire, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, Buckinghamſhire, and Oxfordſhire, viſiting friends in each county. In Oxfordſhire the devil had laid a ſnare for me, but the Lord broke it; his power came over all, his bleſſed truth ſpread, and friends were increaſed therein. Thus after I had paſſed through many counties, viſiting friends, and had many large and precious meetings amongſt them, I came to London. But I was ſo weak with lying almoſt three years in cruel and hard impriſonments, my joints and my body were ſo ſtiff and benumbed, that I could hardly get upon my horſe, nor bend my joints, nor well bear to be near the fire, or to eat warm meat, I had been kept ſo long from it. Being come to London, I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little among the ruins, and took good notice of them I ſaw the city lying, according as the word of the Lord came to me concerning it ſeveral years before.</p>
                  <p>After I had been a time in London, and viſited meetings through the city, I went into the country again, and had large meetings as I went, at Kingſton, Reading, and in Wiltſhire, till I came, to Briſtol; where alſo I had many large meetings. Thomas Lower came out of Cornwall to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037441_0597_100D91FEF2C0EB80"/>meet me, and friends from ſeveral parts of the nation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the fair-time. After I was clear of Briſtol, I went to Nath. Crips's, and through the country to London again, having large meetings in the way, and all quiet, bleſſed be the Lord. Thus, though I was very weak, I travelled up and down in the ſervice of the Lord, who enabled me to go through in it.</p>
                  <p>About this time, ſome who had run out from truth and claſhed againſt friends, were reached unto by the power of the Lord, which came wonderfully over, and made them 'condemn and tear their papers of controverſy to pieces.' Several meetings we had with them, the Lord's everlaſting power was over all, and ſet judgment on the head of that which had run out. In theſe meetings, which laſted whole days, ſeveral who had gone out with John Perrot and others came in again, and condemned that ſpirit which led them to <q>keep on their hats when friends prayed, and when themſelves prayed.</q> Some of them ſaid, <q>Friends were more righteous than they;</q> and that, <q>If friends had not ſtood they had been gone and had fallen into perdition.</q> Thus the Lord's power was wonderfully manifeſted, and came over all.</p>
                  <p>Then I was moved of the Lord to recommend the ſetting up of five monthly meetings of men and women in the city of London, beſides the women's meetings and the quarterly meetings, to take care of God's glory, and to admoniſh and exhort ſuch as walked diſorderly or careleſsly, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth. For whereas friends had only quarterly meetings, now truth was ſpread and friends grown more numerous, I was moved to recommend the ſetting up of monthly meetings throughout the nation. And the Lord opened to me what I muſt do, and how the men's and women's monthly and quarterly meetings ſhould be ordered and eſtabliſhed in this and other nations; and that I ſhould write to thoſe where I came not, to do the ſame. After things were well ſettled at London, and the Lord's truth, power, ſeed, and life reigned and ſhined over all in the city, I went into Eſſex. After the monthly meetings were ſettled in that county, I went into Suffolk and Norfolk, Thomas, Dry being with me. When we had viſited friends in thoſe parts, and the monthly meetings were ſettled, we went into Huntingdonſhire, where we had very large and bleſſed meetings; and though we met with ſome oppoſition, the Lord's power came over all, and the monthly meetings
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037441_0598_100D9201C6C9F9E0"/>were eſtabliſhed there alſo. When we came into Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, we had great oppoſition; but the Lord's power came over it all. Afterwards we went into Nottinghamſhire, where we had many precious meetings, and the monthly meetings were ſettled there. Then paſſing into Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, we had a meeting of ſome men friends of all the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the county, at his houſe who had been formerly ſheriff of Lincoln; and all was quiet. After this meeting we paſſed over Trent into Nottinghamſhire, he that had been the ſheriff of Lincoln being with me, where we had ſome of all the meetings in that county together. Our meeting was glorious and peaceable, and many precious meetings we had in that county.</p>
                  <p>At that time William Smith was very weak and ſick, and the conſtables and others had ſeized all his goods, to the very bed he lay upon, for truth's ſake. Theſe officers threatened to break up our meeting; but the Lord's power chained them, ſo that they had not power to meddle with us, bleſſed be his name. After the meeting I went to viſit William Smith, and there were conſtables and others watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his corn and his beaſts, that none of them might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                  <p>From thence we paſſed into Leiceſterſhire and Warwick-ſhire, where we had many bleſſed meetings. The order of the goſpel was ſet up, and the men's monthly meetings eſtabliſhed in all thoſe counties. Then we went into Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhire, where we had ſeveral large and bleſſed meetings. In many places we were threatened by the officers, but through the power of the Lord we eſcaped their hands. Leaving things well ſettled in Derbyſhire, we travelled over the Peak-hills (which were very cold, for it was then froſt and ſnow) and came into Staffordſhire. At Thomas Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſley's we had a general men's meeting; where things were well ſettled in the goſpel order, and the monthly meetings eſtabliſhed. I was ſo exceeding weak, I was hardly able to get on or off my horſe's back; but my ſpirit being earneſtly engaged in the work the Lord had concerned me in and ſent me forth about, I travelled on therein, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the weakneſs of my body, having confidence in the Lord, that he would carry me through, as he did by his power. We came into Cheſhire, where we had ſeveral bleſſed meetings, and a general men's meeting; wherein all the monthly meetings for that county were ſettled, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the goſpel order, in and by the power of God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037441_0599_100D9203563132B8"/>the meeting I paſſed away. But when the juſtices heard of it, they were very much troubled that they had not come and broke it up, and taken me; but the Lord prevented them. After I had cleared myſelf there in the Lord's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I paſſed into Lancaſhire, to William Barnes's, near Warrington, where met ſome of moſt of the meetings in that county; and there all the monthly meetings were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the goſpel order. From thence I ſent papers into Weſtmoreland by Leonard Fell and Robert Widders, and alſo into Biſhoprick, Cleveland, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Scotland, to exhort friends to ſettle the monthly meetings in the Lord's power in thoſe places; which they did. So the Lord's power came over all, and the heirs of it came to inherit it. For the authority of our meetings is the power of God, the goſpel, which brings life and immortality to light; that all might ſee over the devil that darkened them, that all the heirs of the goſpel might walk according to the goſpel, and glorify God with their bodies, ſouls, and ſpirits, which are the Lord's: for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the glorious goſpel is not of man nor by man. To this meeting in Lancaſhire, Margaret Fell, being a priſoner, got liberty to come, and went with me from thence to Jane Milner's in Cheſhire, where we parted. I paſſed into Shropſhire, and from thence into Wales, and had a large general men's meeting at Charles Lloyd's, where ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers came in; but the Lord's power brought them down.</p>
                  <p>Having gone through Denbighſhire and Montgomery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, we paſſed into Merionethſhiro, where we had ſeveral bleſſed meetings; and then to the ſea-ſide, where we had a precious meeting. We left Wales, the monthly meetings being ſettled there in the power of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into Shropſhire, where the friends of the county ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together, the monthly meetings were eſtabliſhed there. Coming into Worceſterſhire, after many meetings amongſt friends in that county, we had a general men's meeting at Henry Gibs's, at Paſhur; where alſo the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meetings were ſettled in the goſpel order.</p>
                  <p>The ſeſſions being held that day in the town, ſome friends were concerned leſt they ſhould ſend officers to break up our meeting; but the power of the Lord reſtrained them, ſo that it was quiet; through which power we had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I had ſeveral meetings amongſt friends in that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till I came to Worceſter; and it being the fair-time, we had a precious meeting. There was then in Worceſter
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037441_0600_100D9205489576C8"/>one major Wild, a perſecuting man; and after I was gone ſome of his ſoldiers inquired after me; but having left the friends there ſettled in good order, we paſſed to Droitwich, and from thence to Shrewſbury, where alſo we had a very precious meeting. The mayor, hearing I was in town, got the reſt of the officers together to conſult what to do againſt me; for they ſaid, <q>The great Quaker of England is come to town.</q> But when they were come together, the Lord confounded their councils, ſo that ſome were for impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, others oppoſed it; and being divided amongſt themſelves, I eſcaped their hands.</p>
                  <p>We went into Radnorſhire, where we had many precious meetings, and the monthly meetings were ſettled in the Lord's power. As we came out of that county, ſtaying a little at a market-town, a juſtice's clerk and other rude fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows combined together to do us a miſchief upon the road. Accordingly they followed as out of town, and ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us; but there being many market people on the way, they were ſomewhat hindered from doing what they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet obſerving two of our company ride at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance behind, they ſet upon them two, and one of them drew his ſword, and cut Richard Moor, the ſurgeon of Shrewſbury. Meanwhile another of theſe rude fellows came galloping after me and the other friend with me; and we being to paſs over a bridge, ſomewhat of the narroweſt for him to paſs by us, he, in his eagerneſs to get before us, rode into the brook, and plunged his horſe into a deep hole in the water. I ſaw the deſign, ſtopped, and deſired friends to be patient, and give them no occaſion. In this time came Richard Moor up to us, with the other friend, who knew the men and their names. Then we rode on, and a little further met another man on foot, much in liquor, with a naked ſword in his hand, and not far beyond him two men and two women, one of which men had his thumb cut off by the drunken man; for being in drink he attempted rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to one of the women, and this man withſtanding him, and reſcuing her, he whipped out his ſword and cut off his thumb. This miſchievous man had a horſe, that, being looſe, followed him a pretty way behind. I rode after the horſe, caught him, and brought him to the man who had his thumb cut off; and bid him take the horſe to the next juſtice of peace, by which means they might find out and purſue the man that had wounded him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this occaſion I wrote a letter to the juſtices, and
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:037441_0601_100D92075E70B980"/>the judge of aſſize, which was then at hand. I employed ſome friends to carry it to the juſtices firſt. The juſtice, to whom the clerk belonged, rebuked him and the others alſo, for abuſing us upon the highway; ſo that they were glad to come and intreat friends not to appear againſt them at the aſſize; which, upon their ſubmiſſion and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, was granted. This was of good ſervice in the country; for it ſtopped many rude people, who had been forward to abuſe friends.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed into Herefordſhire, where we had ſeveral bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meetings. We had a general men's meeting alſo, where all the monthly meetings were ſettled. There was about this time a proclamation againſt meetings; and as we came through Herefordſhire, we were told of a great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there of the Preſbyterians, who had engaged themſelves to ſtand, and give up all, rather than forſake their meetings. When they heard of this proclamation, the people came, but the prieſt was gone, and left them at a loſs. Then they met in Leominſter privately, and provided bread, cheeſe, and drink, in readineſs, that if the officers ſhould come, they might put up their bibles and fall to eating. The bailiff found them out, came in among them, and ſaid, <q>Their bread and cheeſe ſhould not cover them, he would have their ſpeakers.</q> They cried, <q>What then would become of their wives and children?</q> But he took their ſpeakers and kept them awhile. This the bailiff told Peter Young, and ſaid, <q>They were the verieſt hypocrites that ever made a profeſſion of religion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like contrivance they had in other places. For there was one Pocock at London, that married Abigail Darcy, who was called a lady; and ſhe being convinced of truth, I went to his houſe to ſee her. This Pocock had been one of the triers of the prieſts; and, being an high Preſbyterian, and envious againſt us, he uſed to call our friends houſe-creepers. He being preſent, ſhe ſaid to me, <q>I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſpeak to thee againſt my huſband.</q> 'Nay,' ſaid I, 'thou muſt not ſpeak againſt thy huſband.' 'Yes,' ſaid <q>ſhe, but I muſt in this caſe. The laſt firſt-day,</q> ſaid ſhe, <q>he, his prieſts and people, the Preſbyterians, met; they had candles, tobacco-pipes, bread, cheeſe, and cold meat on the table; and they agreed beforehand, if the officers ſhould come in upon them, they would leave their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying, and fall to their cold meat.</q> 'Oh,' ſaid <q>I to him, is not this a ſhame to you who impriſoned us,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037441_0602_100D920964843C70"/>and ſpoiled our goods, becauſe we would not join you in your religion, and called us houſe-creepers, that ye do not ſtand to your own religion yourſelves? Did ye ever find our meetings ſtuffed with bread and cheeſe and tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes? Or did ye ever read in the ſcriptures of any ſuch practice among the ſaints?</q> 'Why,' ſaid the old man, 'we muſt be as wiſe as ſerpents.' I anſwered, <q>This is the ſerpent's wiſdom indeed. But who would have thought that you Preſbyterians and Independents, who perſecuted, impriſoned others, ſpoiled their goods, and whipped ſuch as would not follow your religion, ſhould now flinch yourſelves, and not dare to ſtand to your own religion, but cover it with tobacco-pipes, flagons of drink, cold meat, and bread and cheeſe!</q> But this, and ſuch-like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful practices, I underſtood afterwards, were too common amongſt them in times of perſecution.</p>
                  <p>After we had travelled through Herefordſhire, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were well ſettled there, we paſſed into Monmouthſhire, where I had ſeveral bleſſed meetings; and at Walter Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins's, who had been a juſtice of peace, we had a large meeting, where ſome were convinced: this meeting was qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. But to a meeting before this came the bailiff of the hundred, almoſt drunk, pretending he was to take up the ſpeakers. There was a mighty power of God in the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that, although he raged, it limited him, that he could not break up the meeting. When it was over, I ſtaid awhile, and he ſtaid alſo. After ſome time I ſpoke to him, and ſo paſſed quietly away. At night ſome rude people came, and ſhot off a muſket againſt the houſe; but did not hurt any body. Thus the Lord's power came over all, and chained down the unruly ſpirits, ſo that we eſcaped them. We came to Roſs that night, and had a meeting at James Merrick's.</p>
                  <p>After this we came into Glouceſterſhire, and had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men's meeting at Nathaniel Crips's, where all the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meetings were ſettled in the Lord's everlaſting power; and the heirs of ſalvation were exhorted to take their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in the goſpel, the power of God, which was and is the authority of their meetings. Many bleſſed meetings we had in that county, before we came to Briſtol. And after ſeveral powerful ſeaſons, the men's and women's meetings were ſettled there alſo.</p>
                  <p>As I was in bed at Briſtol, the word of the Lord came to me, that I muſt go back to London. Next morning
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037441_0603_100D920B5A943AD0"/>Alexander Parker and ſeveral others came to me. I aſked them, What they felt? They aſked me, What was upon me? I told them, I felt I muſt return to London. They ſaid, the ſame was upon them. So we gave up to return to London; for which way the Lord moved and led us, thither we went in his power. Leaving Briſtol, we paſſed into Wiltſhire, and eſtabliſhed the men's monthly meetings in the Lord's power there; and viſited friends till we came to London.</p>
                  <p>After we had viſited friends in the city I was moved to exhort them to bring all their marriages to the men's and women's meetings, that they might lay them before the faithful; that care might be taken to prevent ſuch diſorders as had been committed by ſome. For many had gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in marriage contrary to their relations minds; and ſome young, raw people, that came among us, had mixed with the world. Widows had married without making proviſion for their children by their former huſbands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſecond marriage. Yet I had given forth a paper concerning marriages about the year 1653, when truth was but little ſpread, adviſing friends, who might be concerned in that caſe, <q>That they might lay it before the faithful in time, before any thing was concluded; and afterwards pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it in the end of a meeting, or in a market, as they were moved thereto. And when all things were found clear, being free from all others, and their relations ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they might appoint a meeting on purpoſe, for the taking of each other; in the preſence of at leaſt twelve faithful witneſſes.</q> Yet theſe directions not being obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and truth being now more ſpread over the nation, it was ordered by the ſame power and Spirit of God, <q>That marriages ſhould be laid before the men's monthly and quarterly meetings, or as the meetings were then eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that friends might ſee, that the relations of thoſe who proceeded to marriage were ſatisfied; that the parties were clear from all others; and that widows had made proviſion for their firſt huſband's children, before they married again; and what elſe was needful to be inquired into; that all things might be kept clean and pure, and be done in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the glory of God.</q> Afterwards it was ordered in the wiſdom of God, <q>That if either of the parties intending to marry came out of another nation, county, or monthly meeting, they ſhould bring a certificate from the monthly meeting to which they belonged; for the ſatisfaction of the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037441_0604_100D920CEBA04A08"/>monthly meeting before which they came to lay their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of marriage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe things, with many other ſervices for God, were ſet in order, and ſettled in the city, I paſſed out of London, in the leadings of the Lord's power, into Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire. After I had viſited friends there, and the men's monthly meetings were ſettled, I had a great meeting at Baldock of many ſorts of people. Then returning towards London by Waltham, I adviſed the ſetting up of a ſchool there for teaching boys; and alſo a women's ſchool to be opened at Shacklewell for inſtructing girls and young maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, in whatſoever things were civil and uſeful in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thus, after ſeveral precious meetings in the country, I came to London again, where I ſtaid awhile in the work and ſervice of the Lord; and then went into Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where I had many precious meetings. At John Brown's of Weſton near Ayleſbury ſome of the men friends of each meeting being gathered together, the men's monthly meetings for that county were eſtabliſhed, in the order of the goſpel, the power of God; which confirmed it in all that felt it, who came thereby to ſee and feel-that the power of God was the authority of their meetings. I then went to Nathaniel Ball's, at North Newton near Banbury, Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, who was a friend in the miniſtry. And there being a general meeting, where ſome of all the meetings were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the monthly meetings for that county were ſettled in the power of God; and friends were very glad of them; for they came into their ſervices in the church, to take care for God's glory. After this, we came into Glouceſterſhire, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting friends till we came into Monmouthſhire, to Richard Hambery's; where meeting with ſome of all the meetings of that county, the monthly meetings were ſettled there in the Lord's power, that all in it might take care of God's glory, and admoniſh and exhort ſuch as did not walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the goſpel. And indeed theſe meetings made a great reformation amongſt people, inſomuch that the juſtices took notice of their uſefulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Richard Hambery and his wife accompanied us a day's journey, viſiting friends, till we came to a widow's, where we lay that night. From thence we paſſed over the hills, viſiting friends, and declaring the truth to people, till we came to another widow's, where we had a meeting. The
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037441_0605_100D920FAE4421A8"/>woman could not ſpeak Engliſh; yet ſhe praiſed the Lord for ſending us to viſit them.</p>
                  <p>We travelled till we came to Swanſey, where on the firſt-day we had a large and precious meeting, the Lord's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence being eminently amongſt us. On a week day after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we had a general meeting beyond Swanſey, of men friends from Swanſey, Tenby, Haverfordweſt, and other places; and the monthly meetings were ſettled in the goſpel order, and received by friends in the power of the Lord; whoſe truth was over all.</p>
                  <p>From hence we endeavoured to get over the water into Cornwall: and in order thereunto went back through Swanſey to Mumbles, thinking to have got paſſage there; but the maſter deceived us; for though he had promiſed to carry us, when we came he would not. We went to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, where was a paſſage-boat, into which we got our horſes; but ſome rude men in the boat (though called gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) threatened to piſtol the maſter if he took us in; who, being afraid of them, turned our horſes out again; which put us out of hopes of getting over that way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turning back into the country, we ſtaid up all night; and about the ſecond hour in the morning took horſe, and travelled till we came near Cardiff, where we ſtaid one night. The next day we came to Newport, and it being market-day there, ſeveral friends came to us, with whom we ſat awhile; and after a fine refreſhing ſeaſon together, we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, and went forward.</p>
                  <p>Beyond this market-town we overtook a man who linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the way, as if he ſtaid for ſomebody; but when we came up to him, he rode along with us, and aſked us many queſtions. At length meeting with two, who ſeemed to be pages to ſome great perſons, he took acquaintance with them; and I heard him tell them he would ſtop us, and take us up. We rode on; and when he came to us, and would have ſtopped us, I told him. <q>None ought to ſtop us on the king's highway, for it was as free for us as for them;</q> and I was moved to exhort him to fear the Lord. Then he galloped away before us; and I perceived his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to ſtop us at Shipton in Wales, a garriſon-town, through which we were to paſs. When we were come to Shipton. John-ap-John being with me, we walked down the hill into the town, leading our horſes. It being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-day there, ſeveral friends met us, and would have had us to an inn. But we were not to go into any inn, ſo we
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037441_0606_100D92119B9F0F68"/>walked directly through the town over the bridge, and then were out of the limits of that town. Thus the Lord's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting arm and power preſerved us, and carried us over in his work and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The next firſt-day we had a large meeting in the Foreſt of Dean; and all was quiet. Next day we paſſed over the water to Oldſtone; where after we had viſited friends, we came again to William Yeomans's, at Jubb's Court in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetſhire. From thence we went to a meeting at Poſſet, whither ſeveral friends of Briſtol came to us. After which we went further into the country, and had ſeveral large meetings. The Lord's living preſence was with us, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and refreſhing us in our labour and travel in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>We came to a place near Minehead, where we had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral meeting of the men friends in Somerſetſhire. There came alſo a cheat, whom ſome friendly people would have had me to have taken along with me. I ſaw he was a cheat; therefore bid them bring him to me, and ſee whether he would look me in the face. Some were ready to think I was too hard towards him, becauſe I would not let him go along with me; but when they brought him to me, he was not able to look me in the face, but looked hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he was indeed a cheat, and had cheated a prieſt, by pretending himſelf to be a miniſter, he had got a prieſt's ſuit, and went away with it.</p>
                  <p>After the meeting we paſſed to Minehead, where we tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that night. In the night I had an exerciſe upon me, from a ſenſe I had of a dark ſpirit working and ſtriving to get up to diſturb the church of Chriſt. Next morning I was moved to write a few lines to friends, as a warning thereof, as follows:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>LIVE in the power of the Lord God, in his Seed that is ſet over all, and is over all trials that you may have from the dark ſpirit, which would be owned in its actings, and thruſt itſelf amongſt you; which is not come as yet: but in the power of the Lord God, and his Seed, keep over it, and bring it to condemnation. For I felt a kind of dark ſpirit thruſting itſelf up towards you, and heaving up laſt night; but you may keep it down with the power of God; that the witneſs may ariſe to condemn its actings, ſo far as it hath ſpread its dark works, before it
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:037441_0607_100D921329B91F30"/>have any admittance. So no more, but my love in the Seed of God, which changeth not.</p>

                  <p>The next day ſeveral friends of Minehead accompanied us as far as Barnſtable and Appledon in Devonſhire, where we had a meeting. Barnſtable had been a bloody perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town. There were two men friends of that town, who had been a great while at ſea; and coming home to viſit their relations (one of them having a wife and children) the mayor of the town ſent for them, under pretence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them; and put the oaths of allegiance and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to them. Becauſe they could not ſwear, he ſent them to Exeter gaol, where judge Archer premunired them, and kept them till one of them died in priſon. When I heard of this, I was moved to write a letter to judge Archer, and another to that mayor of Barnſtable, laying their wicked and unchriſtian actions upon their heads; and letting them know, that the <q>blood of that man would be required at their hands.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a precious meeting at Appledon among ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends there, we paſſed to Stratton, and ſtaid at an inn all night. Next day we rode to Humphrey Lower's, where we had a very precious meeting; the next day to Truro; ſo viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends till we came to the Land's End. Then coming by the ſouth part of that county, we viſited friends till we came to Tregangeeves, where at Loveday Hambley's we had a general meeting for all the county; in which the monthly meetings were ſettled in the Lord's power, and in the bleſſed order of the goſpel; that all who were faithful might admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and exhort ſuch as walked not according to the goſpel; that the houſe of God might be kept clean, righteouſneſs might run down, and all unrighteouſneſs be ſwept away. Several, who had run out, were brought to condemn what they had done amiſs; and through repentance came in again.</p>
                  <p>Being clear of that county, we came into Devonſhire, and had a meeting amongſt friends at Plymouth. Whence paſſing to Richard Brown's, we came to the widow Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips's, where we had ſome men friends from all the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings together; and there the men's monthly meetings were fettled in the heavenly order of the goſpel, the power of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037441_0608_100D7F8A0CB20000"/>God; which anſwered the witneſs of God in all. There was a great noiſe of a troop of horſe coming to diſturb our meeting; but the Lord's power prevented it, and preſerved us in peace and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>After things were well ſettled, and the meeting done, we came to King's Bridge, and viſited friends. Then (leaving friends in thoſe parts well ſettled in the power of God) we paſſed to Topſham and Membury, viſiting friends, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many meetings in the way, till we came to Ilcheſter in Somerſetſhire. Here we had a general men's meeting, and therein ſettled the men's monthly meetings for that county in the Lord's everlaſting power, the order of the goſpel. After the meetings were ſettled, and friends refreſhed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in the Lord's power, and eſtabliſhed upon Chriſt, their rock and foundation, we paſſed to Puddimore; where, at William Beaton's, we had a bleſſed meeting, and all was quiet: though the conſtables had threatened before.</p>
                  <p>When we had viſited moſt of the meetings in Somerſet, ſhire, we paſſed into Dorſetſhire to George Harris's, where we had a large men's meeting. There all the men's month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting for that county were ſettled in the glorious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the goſpel; that all in the power of God might <q>ſeek that which was loſt, bring again that which was driven away; cheriſh the good, and reprove the evil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then we came to Southampton, where we had a large meeting on the firſt-day. From thence we went to Capt, Reeves's, where the general men's meeting for Hampſhire was appointed; to which ſome from all parts of the county came, and a bleſſed meeting we had. The men's monthly meetings for that county were ſettled in the order of the goſpel, which had brought life and immortality to light in them.</p>
                  <p>But there came a rude company of Ranters, who had oppoſed and diſturbed our meetings much. One of the women had lain with a man, who had declared it at the Market-croſs, and gloried in his wickedneſs. A company of theſe lewd people lived together, at a houſe hard by the place of our meeting. I went to the houſe, and told them of their wickedneſs. The man of the houſe aſked, <q>Why! did I make ſo ſtrange of that?</q> Another of them ſaid, <q>It was to ſtumble me.</q> I told them, <q>Their wickedneſs ſhould not ſtumble me; for I was above it.</q> I was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord to tell them, <q>The plagues and judgments of God would overtake them, and come upon them.</q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:037441_0609_100D9217F8C124F0"/>they went up and down the country, till at laſt they were caſt into Wincheſter gaol; where the man that had lain with the woman ſtabbed the gaoler, but not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. After they were let out of gaol, this fellow that ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the gaoler hanged himſelf. The woman alſo had like to have cut a child's throat, as we were informed. Theſe people had formerly lived about London; and, when the city was fired, they propheſied, <q>That all the reſt of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſhould be burnt within fourteen days,</q> and haſted out of town. Though they were Ranters, great oppoſers of friends, and diſturbers of our meetings, yet in the country, where they came, ſome would be apt to ſay they were Quakers. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to write a paper, to be diſperſed amongſt the magiſtrates and people of Hampſhire, to clear friends and truth of them and their wicked actions.</p>
                  <p>After the men's monthly meetings in thoſe parts were ſettled, and the Lord's bleſſed power was over all, we went to a town, where we had a meeting with friends. From thence we came to Farnham, where we me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> many friends, it being the market-day. We had precious meetings up and down that country. Friends in thoſe parts had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been plundered, and their goods much ſpoiled, on account of tithes, and for going to meetings; but the Lord's power at this time preſerved both them and us from falling into the perſecutors hands.</p>
                  <p>We had a general men's meeting at a friend's houſe in Surry; who had been plundered ſo extremely, that he had ſcarce a cow, horſe, or ſwine left. The conſtables threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come and break up our meeting; but the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them. At this meeting the men's monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſettled in the authority of the heavenly power. After we had viſited friends in that county, and had many large and precious meetings, we paſſed to a friend's houſe in Suſſex, where the general meeting for the men friends of that county was appointed to be held; and thither came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral from London to viſit us. We had a bleſſed meeting; and the men's monthly meetings for that county were then ſettled in the Lord's eternal power, the goſpel of ſalvation; that all in it might keep to the order of the goſpel. There were at that time great threatenings of diſturbance; but the meeting was quiet. We had ſeveral large meetings in that county; though friends were in great ſufferings there, and many in priſon. I was ſent for to viſit a friend that was
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037441_0610_100D9219EA044190"/>ſick, and went to ſee friends that were priſoners. There was danger of my being apprehended; but I went in the faith of God's power, and thereby the Lord preſerved me in ſafety.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed into Kent; where, after we had been at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meetings, we had a general one for the men friends of that county. There alſo the men's monthly meetings for that county were ſettled in the power of God, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the order of the goſpel, for all the heirs of it to enter into their ſervices and care in the church for the glory of God. Friends rejoiced in the order of the goſpel, and were glad of the ſettlement thereof.</p>
                  <p>After this I viſited the meetings in Kent; and when I had cleared myſelf of the Lord's ſervice in that county, I came to London. Thus were the men's monthly meetings ſettled through the nation; for I had been in Berkſhire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where moſt of the ancient friends of that county were in priſon; and when I had informed them of the ſervice of theſe monthly meetings, they were ſettled amongſt them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The quarterly meetings were generally ſettled before. I wrote alſo into Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and ſeveral parts of America, adviſing friends to ſettle their men's monthly meetings in thoſe countries. For they had their general quarterly meetings before; but now that truth was increaſed amongſt them, they ſhould ſettle monthly meetings in the power and Spirit of God which firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them. Since theſe meetings have been ſettled, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mouths have been opened in thankſgivings and praiſe, and many have bleſſed the Lord, that he ſent me forth in this ſervice; yea, with tears have many praiſed him. For all coming to have a concern and care for God's honour and glory, that his name be not blaſphemed, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; and to ſee that all who profeſs the truth, walk in the truth, in righteouſneſs and holineſs, which becomes the houſe of God, and that all order their converſation aright, that they may ſee the ſalvation of God; all having this care upon them for God's glory, and being exerciſed in his holy power and Spirit, in the order of the heavenly life and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Jeſus, they may all ſee and know, poſſeſs and partake of the government of Chriſt, of the increaſe of which there is to be no end. Thus the Lord's everlaſting renown and praiſe is ſet up in every one's heart that is faithful; ſo that we can ſay the goſpel order eſtabliſhed amongſt us is not of man, nor by man, but of and by Jeſus Chriſt, in and
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:037441_0611_100D921B8BB9D0D8"/>through the Holy Ghoſt. This order of the goſpel, which is from Chriſt the heavenly man, is above all the orders of men in the fall, whether Jews, Gentiles, or apoſtatized Chriſtians, and will remain when they are gone. For the power of God, which is the everlaſting goſpel, was before the devil was, and will be and remain for ever. And as the everlaſting goſpel was preached in the apoſtles days to all nations, that all might come into the order thereof, through the divine power, which brings life and immortality to light, that they who were heirs of it, might inherit the power and authority of it; ſo now, ſince all nations have drunk the whore's cup, and all the world hath worſhipped the beaſt (but they, whoſe names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, who have worſhipped God in ſpirit and truth, as Chriſt commanded) the everlaſting goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is to be and is preached again, as John the divine fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw it ſhould, to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. This everlaſting goſpel torments the whore, and makes her and the beaſt to rage, even the beaſt that hath power over the tongues, which are called the original, to order them, by which they make divines, as they call them. But all that receive the goſpel, the power of God, which brings life and immortality to light, come to ſee over the beaſt, devil, whore, and falſe prophet, that darkened them and all their worſhips and orders, and come to be heirs of the goſpel, the power of God, which was before the beaſt, whore, falſe prophet, and devil were, and will be when they are all gone and caſt into the lake of fire. And they that are heirs of this power and of this goſpel inherit the power which is the authority of this order, and of our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Theſe come to poſſeſs the joyful order of the joyful goſpel, the comfortable order of the comfortable goſpel, the glorious order of the glorious goſpel, and the everlaſting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the everlaſting goſpel, the power of God, which will laſt for ever, and will outlaſt all the orders of the devil, and that which is of men or by men. Theſe ſhall ſee the government of Chriſt, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; and of the increaſe of his glorious, righteous, holy, juſt government there is no end; but his government and his order will remain: for he who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it is the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and ending the foundation of God, which over all ſtands ſure; Chriſt Jeſus, the Amen.</p>
                  <p>Being returned to London, I ſlaid ſome time, viſiting
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037441_0612_100D921D1FE924C8"/>friends meetings in and about the city. While I was in London, I went one day to viſit ſquire Marſh, who had ſhewed much kindneſs both to me and friends. I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go when he was at dinner. He no ſooner heard of my name, but he ſent for me up, and would have had me ſit down with him to dinner; but I had not freedom to do ſo. Several great perſons were at dinner with him; and he ſaid to one of them who was a great Papiſt, <q>Here is a Quaker, which you have not ſeen before.</q> The Papiſt aſked me, 'Whether I did own the chriſtening of children?' I told him, 'There was no ſcripture for any ſuch practice.' 'What!' ſaid he, 'not for chriſtening children!' I ſaid, 'Nay.' I told him, <q>The one baptiſm by the one ſpirit into one body we owned; but to throw a little water on a child's face, and ſay, that was baptizing and chriſtening it, there was no ſcripture for that.</q> He aſked me, <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did own the Catholic faith?</q> I ſaid, 'Yes;' but added, <q>That neither the pope nor the papiſts were in the Catholic faith; for the true faith works by love, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart; and if they were in that faith that gives victory, by which they might have acceſs to God, they would not tell the people of a purgatory after they were dead. So I undertook to prove, <q>That neither pope nor papiſts, that held a purgatory hereafter, were in the true faith.</q> For the true, precious, divine faith, which Chriſt is the author of, gives victory over the devil and ſin, that ſeparated man and woman from God. And if they (the Papiſts) were in the true faith, they would never uſe racks, priſons, and fines to perſecute and force others to their religion, that were not of their faith. This was not the practice of the apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed and enjoyed the true faith of Chriſt; but it was the practice of the faithleſs Jews and heathens ſo to do. But,</q> ſaid I, <q>ſeeing thou art a great leading man among the Papiſts, and haſt been taught and bred up under the pope,</q> and ſeeing thou ſayeſt, <q>There is no ſalvation but in your church;</q> I deſire to know of thee, <q>What it is that doth bring ſalvation in your church?</q> He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "A good life." 'And nothing elſe?' ſaid I. 'Yes,' ſaid he, 'good works!' <q>Is this it that brings ſalvation in your church, a good life and good works? Is this your doctrine and principle?</q> ſaid I. 'Yes,' ſaid he. <q>Then, ſaid I, neither thou, nor the pope, nor any of the Papiſts know what it is that brings ſalvation.</q> He aſked me,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:037441_0613_100D921FF3F6EEC8"/>'What brought ſalvation in our church?' I told him, That which brought ſalvation to the church in the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles days, the ſame brought ſalvation to us, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely, "The grace of God, which," the ſcripture ſays, "brings ſalvation, and hath appeared to all men," which taught the ſaints then, and teaches us now. This grace, which brings ſalvation, teaches, <q>To deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts, and to live godly, righteouſly, and ſoberly.</q> So it is not the good works, nor the good life that brings ſalvation, but the grace. 'What!' ſaid the Papiſt, 'doth this grace, that brings ſalvation, appear unto all men?' 'Yes,' ſaid I. 'Then,' ſaid he, 'I deny that.' I replied, 'All that deny that are ſect-makers, and are not in the univerſal faith, grace, and truth, which the apoſtles were in.' Then he ſpoke to me about the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-church. I told him, The ſeveral ſects in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had accuſed us, and ſaid, <q>We forſook our mother-church.</q> The Papiſts charged us with forſaking their church, ſaying, "Rome was the only mother-church." The Epiſcopalians taxed us with forſaking the old Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant religion, alleging, <q>Theirs was the reformed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-church.</q> The Preſbyterians and Independents blamed us for leaving them, each of them pretending "Theirs was the right-reformed church." But I ſaid, if we could own any outward place to be the mother-church, we ſhould own Jeruſalem, where the goſpel was firſt preached by Chriſt himſelf and the apoſtles, where Chriſt ſuffered, where the great converſion to Chriſtianity by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, where were the types, figures, and ſhadows, which Chriſt ended, and where Chriſt commanded his <q>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to wait until they were endued with power from on high.</q> If any outward place deſerved to be called the mother, that was the place where the firſt great converſion to Chriſtianity was. But the apoſtle faith, Gal. iv. 25, 26. <q>Jeruſalem, which now is in bondage with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but Jeruſalem, which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren, that beareſt not; break forth and cry, thou that travaileſt not; for the deſolate hath many more children than ſhe that hath an huſband,</q> ver. 27. The apoſtle doth not ſay, outward Jeruſalem was the mother, though the firſt and great converſion to Chriſtianity was there; and there is leſs reaſon for the title [mother] to be given to Rome, or to any other outward place or city, by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037441_0614_100D9221E976DE40"/>of Jeruſalem, that is above and free: neither are they Jeruſalem's children that is above and free, who give the title of mother either to outward Jeruſalem, to Rome, or to any other place or ſect of people. And though this title [mother] hath been given to places and ſects by the degenerate Chriſtians, yet we ſay ſtill, as the apoſtle ſaid of old, "Jeruſalem that is above, is the mother of us all." We can own no other, neither outward Jeruſalem, nor Rome, nor any ſect of people for our mother, but Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem which is above; which is free, the mother of all that are born again, become true believers in the light, and are graſted into Chriſt, the heavenly vine. For all who are born again of the immortal ſeed, by the word of God which lives and abides for ever, feed upon the milk of the word, the breaſt of life, grow by it in life; and cannot acknowledge any other to be their mother, but Jeruſalem which is above.' 'Oh!' ſaid ſquire Marſh to the Papiſt, You do not know this man. If he would but come to church now and then, he would be a brave man.'</p>
                  <p>After ſome other diſcourſe, I went aſid with juſtice Marſh to another room, to ſpeak with him concerning friends; for he was a juſtice of peace for Middleſex, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a courtier, the other juſtices put much of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affairs upon him. He told me, <q>He was in a ſtrait how to act between us and ſome other Diſſenters. For,' ſaid he, 'You cannot ſwear, and the Independents, Baptiſts, and Fifth-monarchy-people ſay alſo, They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſwear; therefore,' ſaid he, 'how ſhall I diſtinguiſh betwixt you and them, ſeeing they and you all ſay. It is for conſcience-ſake that you cannot ſwear?' I anſwered, I will ſhew thee how to diſtinguiſh. They, or moſt of them, thou ſpeakeſt of, can and do ſwear in ſome caſes, but we cannot ſwear in any caſe. If a man ſhould ſleal their cows and horſes, and thou ſhouldeſt aſk them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would ſwear they were theirs? many of them would readily do it; but if thou try our friends, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſwear for their own goods. Therefore, when thou put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the oath of allegiance to any of them, aſk them, <q>Whether they can ſwear in any other caſe, as for their cow or horſe?</q> Which, if they be really of us, they cannot do, though they can bear witneſs to the truth.</q> I gave him a relation of a trial in Berkſhire, which was thus: <q>A thief ſtole two beaſts from a friend of ours. The thief was taken and call into priſon, and the friend appeared againſt
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037441_0615_100D92237A8A7728"/>him at the aſſizes. But ſomebody having informed the judge, that the proſecutor was a Quaker and could not ſwear, the judge, before he heard the friend, ſaid, <q>Is he a Quaker? And will he not ſwear? Then tender him the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy.</q> So he caſt the friend into priſon, and premunired him, and ſet the thief at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.' Juſtice Marſh ſaid, 'That judge was a wicked man. 'But,' ſaid I, 'If we could ſwear in any caſe, we would take the oath of allegiance to the king, who is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the laws that are to ſupport every man in his eſtate. Whereas others, that can ſwear in ſome caſes, to preſerve a part of their eſtates if they be robbed, will not take this oath to the king, who is to preſerve them in their whole eſtates and bodies alſo. So that thou mayeſt eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and put a difference betwixt us and thoſe people.</q> Juſtice Marſh was afterwards very ſerviceable to friends in this and other caſes; for he kept ſeveral, both friends and others, from being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> ſet many of them at liberty. When he could not avoid ſending to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he ſent ſome for a few hours, or a night. At length he went to the king, and told him, <q>He had ſent ſome of us to priſon contrary to his conſcience, and he could not do ſo any more.</q> Therefore he removed his family from Limehouſe, where he lived, and took lodgings near James's Park. He told the king, <q>If he would be pleaſed to give liberty of conſcience, that would quiet and ſettle all; for then none could have any pretence to be uneaſy.</q> And indeed he was a very ſerviceable man to truth and friends in his day.</p>
                  <p>We had great ſervice at London this year; the Lord's truth came over all. Many who had gone out came in again this year, confeſting and condemning their outgoings.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſtaid ſome time in London, I viſited friends in Surry, Suſſex, and other places that way, and then tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled northward, having Leonard Fell with me. We vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited friends till we came to Warwick, where many were in priſon. We had a meeting in the town. I paſſed from thence to Birmingham and Badgely. At Badgely I had a large meeting. After which I paſſed to Nottingham, where on the firſt-day we had a precious meeting, but not without danger of being apprehended; the conſtables having threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened friends.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed from thence, viſiting friends, ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l I came to Bal.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037441_0616_100D92E63B6FE588"/>by, and ſo to York quarterly-meeting. A bleſſed meeting we had. Friends had in Yorkſhire ſeven monthly meetings before, and they were ſo ſenſible of the ſervice of them, that they deſired to have ſeven more added; for truth was much ſpread in that county. Accordingly in that quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were ſettled: ſo now they have fourteen monthly meetings.</p>
                  <p>It being the aſſize-time at York, I met with juſtice Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, a well-wiſher to friends, who had been tender and very kind to me from the firſt.</p>
                  <p>After I had finiſhed my ſervice in York, I paſſed into the country. As I went, a great burden fell upon me; but I did not preſently know the reaſon of it. I came to a meeting on firſt-day at Richard Shipton's, which was very large. There being a meeting the ſame day at another place, and the prieſt of that place, being miſinformed that I was to be there, got a warrant, and made great diſturbance at that meeting; of which Iſaac Lindley gave me an account by the following letter:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>WHEN thou went'ſt from York, the firſt-day after thou waſt at Richard Shipton's, that day I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a meeting ten miles from York, where there had not been a meeting before. But the prieſt and the conſtable got a warrant on the ſeventh-day, and put thy name only in the warrant; for they had heard thou waſt to be there. They came with weapons and ſtaves, and cried, <q>Where is Mr. Fox?</q> over and over; many friends being there, they concluded thou waſt among them. But thoſe raveners, being diſappointed, plucked me down, abuſed me, beat ſome friends, and then took me before a magiſtrate; but he ſet me at liberty.</p>

                  <p>I then viſited friends at Whitby and Scarborough. When I was at Scarborough, the governor, hearing I was come, ſent to invite me to his houſe, ſaying, <q>Surely, I would not be ſo unkind, as not to come and ſee him and his wife.</q> After the meeting I went to viſit him, and he received me very courteouſly and lovingly.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited moſt of the meetings in Yorkſhire, the Woulds, and Holderneſs, I came to Henry Jackſon's, where
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037441_0617_100D7F9C8094DD60"/>I had a great meeting. From thence to Thomas Taylor's, and to John Moor's at Eldreth, where we had a very large meeting: the Lord's power and preſence was eminently amongſt us. Not far from this place lay colonel Kirby, lame of the gout, who had threatened, <q>If ever I came near, he would ſend me to priſon again; and had bid forty pounds to any man that could take me,</q> as I was credibly informed.</p>
                  <p>After this I came into Staffordſhire and Cheſhire, where we had many large and precious meetings. I had a very large one at William Barns's, about two miles from War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington; and though colonel Kirby was now got abroad again, as violent in breaking up meetings as before, and was then at Warrington, the Lord did not ſuffer him to come to this meeting: ſo we were preſerved out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Now was I moved of the Lord to go over into Ireland, to viſit the ſeed of God in that nation. There went with me Robert Lodge, James Lancaſter, Thomas Briggs, and John Stubbs. We waited near Liverpool for ſhipping and wind. After we had waited ſome days, we ſent James Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, who took paſſage, and brought word the ſhip was ready, and would take us in at Black-rock. We went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on foot. It being pretty fair and the weather very hot, I was much ſpent with walking. When we arrived the ſhip was not there, ſo we were o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ged to go to the town and take ſhipping. When we were get on board, I ſaid to the reſt of the company, <q>Come, ye will triumph in the Lord; for we ſhall have fair wind and weather.</q> There were many paſſengers in the ſhip ſick, but not one of our company. The maſter and many of the paſſengers were very loving; and being at ſea on a firſt-day, I was moved to declare truth among them: whereupon the maſter ſaid to the paſſengers, <q>Come, here are things that you never heard in your lives.</q> When we came before Dublin, we took boat, and went aſhore; and the earth and air ſmelt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, with the corruption of the nation, ſo that it yielded another ſmell to me than England did; which I imputed to the popiſh maſſacres that had been committed, and the blood that had been ſpilt in it, from which a foulneſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. We paſſed through among the officers of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms four times, yet they did not ſearch us; for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what we were. Some of them were ſo envious, they did not care to look at us. We did not preſently ſind friends; but went to an inn, and ſent to inquire for ſome,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037441_0618_100D7FAA5ED58248"/>who were exceeding glad of our coming, and received us with great joy. We ſtaid there the weekly meeting, which was a large one, and the power and life of God appeared greatly in it. Afterwards we paſſed to a province-meeting, which laſted two days, there being both a men's meeting about the poor, and another more general, in which a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of the Lord appeared. Truth was livingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and friends were much refreſhed therein.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing from thence about twenty-four miles, we came to another place, where we had a very good refreſhing meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after which ſome Papiſts were angry, and raged very much. When I heard of it, I ſent for one of them, a ſchoolmaſter; but he would not come. Whereupon I ſent a challenge to him, with all the friars, monks, prieſts, and jeſuits, to come forth, and <q>try their God and their Chriſt, which they made of bread and wine;</q> but no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer could I get from them. Wherefore I told them, <q>They were worſe than the prieſts of Baal; for Baal's prieſts tried their wooden god, but theſe durſt not try their god of bread and wine; and Baal's prieſts and people did not eat their god, as theſe did, and then make another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We went on to New-garden, where was a great meeting. From thence we travelled to Bandon-bridge and the Land's-end, having many meetings as we went; in which the mighty power of the Lord was manifeſted, friends were well refreſhed, and many people were affected with the truth. At Bandon, the mayor's wife, being convinced, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her huſband to come to the meeting; but he bid her for her life ſhe ſhould not make known that I was at a meeting there.</p>
                  <p>He that was then mayor of Cork, being very envious againſt truth and friends, had many friends in priſon; and knowing I was in the country, he ſent four warrants to take me; therefore friends were deſirous that I might not ride through Cork. But being at Bandon, there appeared to me in a viſion, <q>A very ugly-viſaged man, of a black and dark look. My ſpirit ſtruck at him in the power of God, and it ſeemed to me that I rode over him with my horſe, and my horſe ſet his ſoot on the ſide of his face.</q> When I came down in the morning, I told a friend, the command of the Lord was to me to ride through Cork; but bid him tell no man. So we took horſe, many friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me. When we came near the town, friends would have ſhewed me a way on the backſide of it; but I told
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037441_0619_100D92256E903A20"/>them, my way was through the ſtreets. Taking Paul Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice to guide me through the town, I rode on; and as we rode through the market-place, and by the mayor's door, he, ſeeing me, ſaid, 'There goes George Fox;' but he had not power to ſtop me. When we had paſſed through the centinels, and were come over the bridge, we went to a friend's houſe, and alighted. There the friends told me, what a rage was in the town, and how many warrants were granted to take me. While I was ſitting there with friends, I felt the evil ſpirit at work in the town, ſtirring up miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt me; and I felt the power of the Lord ſtrike at that evil ſpirit. By-and-by ſome other friends coming in, told me, <q>It was over the town, and amongſt the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, that I was in the town.</q> I ſaid, <q>Let the devil do his worſt,</q> After awhile that friends were refreſhed one in another, and we travellers had refreſhed ourſelves, I call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my horſe, and having a friend to guide me, we went on our way. But great was the rage that the mayor and others of Cork were in, that they had miſſed me, and great pains they afterwards took to have taken me, having their ſcouts abroad upon the roads, as I underſtood, to obſerve which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I went. Afterwards, ſcarce a public meeting I came to, but ſpies came to watch if I was there. And the envious magiſtrates and prieſts ſent informations one to another concerning me, deſcribing me by my hair, hat, cloaths, and horſe; ſo that when I was near an hundred miles from Cork they had an account concerning me, and deſcription of me, before I came amongſt them. One very envious magiſtrate, who was both a prieſt and a juſtice, got a warrant from the judge of aſſize to apprehend me; the warrant was to go over all his circuit, which reached near an hundred miles. Yet the Lord diſappointed all their councils, defeated all their deſigns againſt me, and by his good hand of Providence preſerved me out of all their ſnares, and gave us many ſweet and bleſſed opportunities to viſit friends, and ſpread truth through that nation. For meetings were very large, friends coming to them far and near; and other people flocking in. The powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord was preciouſly felt with and amongſt us; whereby many of the world were reached, convinced, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the truth, and the Lord's flock was increaſed; and friends were greatly refreſhed and comforted in feeling the love of God. Oh! the brokenneſs that was amongſt them in the flowings of life! So that, in the power and Spirit
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037441_0620_100D922724C4B070"/>of the Lord, many together broke out into ſinging, even with audible voices, making melody in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>At which time I was moved to declare to friends there in the miniſtry, as followeth:</p>

                  <p>To James Hutchinſon's in Ireland came many great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, deſiring to diſcourſe with me about Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. I told them, <q>Though they judged our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple fooliſh, it was too high for them, they could not with their wiſdom comprehend it; therefore I would diſcourſe, with them according to their capacities. You ſay,</q> ſaid I, <q>that God hath ordained the greateſt part of men for hell, and that they were ordained ſo before the world began; for which your proof is in Jude. You ſay, Eſau was reprobated, and the Egyptians, and the ſtock of Ham. But Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples, "Go, teach all nations;" and, <q>Go into all nations, and preach the goſpel of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> If they were to go to all nations, were they not to go to Ham's ſtock, and Eſau's ſtock? Did not Chriſt die for all? Then for the ſtock of Ham, of Eſau, and the Egyptians. Doth not the ſcripture ſay, <q>God would have all men to be ſaved?</q> Mark, "All men;" then the ſtock of Eſau, and of Ham alſo. Doth not God ſay, "Egypt my people?" and that he would have an altar in Egypt? Iſa. xix. Were there not many Chriſtians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in Egypt? And doth not hiſtory ſay, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Alexandria would formerly have been pope? And
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:037441_0622_100D922B68F99BD8"/>had not God a church in Babylon? I confeſs, <q>The word come to Jacob, and the ſtatutes to Iſrael; the like was not to other nations.</q> For the law of God was given to Iſrael; but the goſpel was to be preached to all nations, and is to be preached. The goſpel of peace and glad-tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to all nations. <q>He that believes is ſaved, but he that doth not believe is condemned already;</q> ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation comes through unbelief. And whereas Jude ſpeaks of ſome that were of old ordained (or written of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to condemnation, he doth not ſay, before the world began; but, "written of old;" which may be referred to Moſes's writings, who wrote of thoſe whom Jude men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely Cain, Corah, Balaam, and the angels that kept not their firſt eſtate; and ſuch Chriſtians as followed them in their way, and apoſtatized from the firſt ſtate of Chriſtianity, were and are ordained for condemnation by the light and truth, which they are gone from. And though the apoſtle ſpeaks of God's loving Jacob and hating Eſau, yet he tells the believers, <q>We all were by nature children of wrath, as well as others.</q> This includes the ſtock of Jacob, of which the apoſtle himſelf and all believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews were. Thus both Jews and Gentiles were all concluded under ſin, and ſo under condemnation, that God might have mercy upon all through Jeſus Chriſt. The election and choice ſtands in Chriſt: <q>and he that believes is ſaved, and he that believes not is condemned already.</q> Jacob typifies the ſecond birth, which God loved; and both Jews and Gentiles muſt be born again, before they can enter the kingdom of God. When you are born again, ye will know election and reprobation; for the election ſtands in Chriſt, the ſeed, before the world began; but the reprobation lies in the evil ſeed ſince the word began.</q> After this manner, but ſomewhat more largely, I diſcourſed with thoſe great perſons about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they confeſſed they had never heard ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>After I had travelled over Ireland, and viſited friends in their meetings, as well for buſineſs as worſhip, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral papers and writings from monks, friars, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant prieſts (for they all were in a rage againſt us, and endeavoured to ſtop the work of the Lord, and ſome Jeſuits ſwore in ſome of our hearing, that we came to ſpread our principles in that nation, but we ſhould not do it) I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Dublin, in order to take paſſage for England. When
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037441_0623_100D922D5CF36468"/>I had ſtaid the firſt-day's meeting there, which was very large and precious, there being a ſhip ready, and the wind ſerving, we took our leave of friends; parting in much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and brokenneſs, in the ſenſe of the heavenly life and power, manifeſted amongſt us. Having put our horſes and neceſſaries on board in the morning, we went ourſelves in the afternoon, many friends accompanying us to the ſhip; and divers friends and friendly people followed us in boats, when we were near a league at ſea, their love drawing them, though not without danger. A good, weighty, and true people there is in that nation, ſenſible of the power of the Lord God, tender of his truth, and very good order they have in their meetings; for they ſtand up for righteouſneſs and holineſs, which dams up the way of wickedneſs. A precious viſitation they had, and there is an excellent ſpirit in them, worthy to be viſited. Many things more I could write of that nation, and of my travels in it, which would be large to mention particularly; but thus much I thought good to ſignify, that the righteous may rejoice in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of truth.</p>
                  <p>James Lancaſter, Robert Lodge, and Thomas Briggs came back with me; John Stubbs, having further ſervice there, ſtaid behind. We were two nights at ſea; in one of which a mighty ſtorm aroſe that put the veſſel in great danger; but I ſaw the power of God went over the winds and ſtorms, he had them in his hand, and his power bound them. And the ſame power of the Lord God, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us over, brought us back again; and in his life gave us dominion over all the evil ſpirits that oppoſed us there.</p>
                  <p>We landed at Liverpool, and went to Richard John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's, William Barnes's, and to William Gandy's, viſiting friends, and having many precious meetings in Lancaſhire and Cheſhire. We came into Glouceſterſhire, and met with a report at Nailſworth, which was ſpread in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <q>That George Fox was turned Preſbyterian, that a pulpit was prepared for him and ſet in a yard, and that there would be a thouſand people there the next day to hear him.</q> I thought it ſtrange that ſuch a report ſhould be raiſed of me; yet as we went further from one friend's houſe to another, we met with the ſame. We paſſed by the yard where the pulpit was, and ſaw it, and went to the place where friends meeting was to be next day, where we ſtaid that night. Next day, being the firſt-day, we had a
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037441_0624_100D922FCB0AF720"/>very large meeting, and the Lord's power and preſence was amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion of this ſtrange report (as I was informed) was this. There was one John Fox, a Preſbyterian prieſt, who uſed to go about preaching; and ſome, changing his name from John to George, gave out that George Fox was turned from a Quaker to be a Preſbyterian, and would preach at ſuch a place ſuch a day. This begat ſuch curioſity in the people, that they went thither to hear this Quaker turned Preſbyterian, who would not have gone to have heard John Fox himſelf. By this means it was reported they had go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> together above a thouſand people. But when they came there, and perceived they had a trick put upon them, that he was but a counterfeit George Fox, and underſtood that the real George Fox was hard by, ſeveral hundreds came to our meeting and were ſober and attentive. <q>I directed them to the grace of God in themſelves, which would teach them, and bring them ſalvation.</q> When the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was over, ſome of the people ſaid, <q>They like George Fox the Quaker's preaching better than George Fox the Preſbyterian's.</q> Thus, by my providential coming into thoſe parts at that time, this falſe report was diſcovered, and ſhame came over the contrivers of it.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this John Fox was complained of in the houſe of commons, for <q>having a tumultuous meeting, in which treaſonable words were ſpoken:</q> which (according to the beſt information I could get) was thus. John Fox had formerly been prieſt of Mansfield in Wiltſhire; and, being put out of that place, was afterwards permitted by a Common-prayer prieſt to preach ſometimes in his ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. At length this Preſbyterian prieſt, preſuming too far upon the pariſh prieſt's former grant, began to be more bold than welcome, and attempted to preach there whether the pariſh prieſt would or no. This cauſed a great buſtle and conteſt in the ſteeple-houſe between the two prieſts, and their hearers on either ſide; in which conteſt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer-book was cut to pieces, and ſome treaſonable words ſpoken by ſome of the followers of John Fox. This was quickly put in the news, and ſome malicious Preſbyterians canſed it to be ſo worded as if it had proceeded from George Fox the Quaker, though I was above two hundred miles from the place when this buſtle happened. When I heard of it. I ſoon procured certificates from ſome of the members of the houſe of commons, who knew this man, and gave it
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037441_0625_100D9231BADF7110"/>under their hands, that it was J. Fox, who had formerly been parſon of Mansfield in Wiltſhire, that was complained of to the houſe of commons, to be the chief ringleader in that unlawful aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this John Fox diſcovered himſelf to be an ill man, for ſome who had been his followers came to be convinced of truth, and thereupon left him; upon which he came to ſome of their houſes to talk with them; and they telling him, <q>He was in the ſteps of the falſe prophets, preaching for hire and filthy lucre, like thoſe whom Chriſt cried wo againſt, and the apoſtles declared againſt, ſuch as ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own bellies, and telling him, Chriſt ſaid, Freely ye have received, freely give, and therefore he ſhould not take money of people for preaching, eſpecially now time were ſo hard;</q> he replied, <q>God bleſs preaching, that brings in money, let times go how they will. Fill my belly with good victuals; then call me falſe prophet, or what you will, and kick me about the houſe when ye have done, if ye will.</q> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I had from a man and his wife, who had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly his hearers, and whom John Fox (with others) cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deeply to ſuffer. For he, and ſome other Preſbyterian prieſts, reſorting to a widow woman's, who had the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, and took the tithes of the pariſh, ſhe told them, <q>There was a Quaker in that pariſh that would not pay her tithes;</q> and aſked, what ſhe ſhould do with him. They adviſed her, <q>To ſend workmen to cut down and carry away his corn:</q> which ſhe did, and thereby impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the man. But to proceed.—</p>
                  <p>After this meeting in Glouceſterſhire, we travelled till we came to Briſtol; where I met with Margaret Fell, who was come to viſit her daughter Yeomans. I had ſeen from the Lord a conſiderable time before, that I ſhould take Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Fell to be my wife; and when I firſt mentioned it to her, ſhe felt the anſwer of Life from God thereunto. But though the Lord had opened this thing to me, yet I had not received a command from him for the accompliſhing of it then. Wherefore I let the thing reſt, and went on in the work and ſervice of the Lord, according as he led me; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in this nation, and through Ireland. But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Briſtol, and finding Margaret Fell there, it opened in me from the Lord that the thing ſhould be accompliſhed. After we had diſcourſed the matter together, I told her, <q>If ſhe alſo was ſatisfied with the accompliſhing of it now,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:037441_0626_100D92334D311EF8"/>ſhe ſhould firſt ſend for her children:</q> which ſhe did. When the reſt of her daughters were come. I aſked both them and her ſons-in-law, <q>If they had any thing againſt it, or for it?</q> and they all ſeverally expreſſed their ſatisfaction therewith. Then I aſked Margaret, <q>If ſhe had fulfilled her huſband's will to her children?</q> She replied, <q>The children knew ſhe had.</q> Whereupon I aſked them, <q>Whether, if their mother married, they ſhould not loſe by it?</q> I aſked Margaret, <q>Whether ſhe had done any thing in lieu of it, which might anſwer it to the children?</q> The children ſaid, <q>She had anſwered it to them, and deſired me to ſpeak no more of it.</q> I told them, <q>I was plain, and would have all things done plainly: for I ſought not any outward advantage to myſelf.</q> So our intention of marriage was laid before friends both privately and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to their full ſatisfaction, many of whom gave teſtimony that it was of God. Afterwards, a meeting being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on purpoſe for the accompliſhing thereof, in the publick meeting-houſe at Broad Mead in Briſtol, we took each other in marriage; the Lord joining us together in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable marriage, in the everlaſting covenant and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Seed of life. In the ſenſe whereof, living and weighty teſtimonies were borne thereunto by friends in the movings of the heavenly power, which united us together. Then was a certificate, relating both the proceedings and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, openly read, and ſigned by the relations, and by moſt of the ancient friends of that city; beſides many others from divers parts of the nation.</p>
                  <p>We ſtaid about a week in Briſtol, and then went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Oldſtone: where, taking leave of each other in the Lord, we parted, betaking ourſelves each to our ſeveral ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Margaret returning homewards to the north, and I paſſing on in the work of the Lord as before. I travelled through Wiltſhire, Berkſhire, Oxfordſhire, Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and ſo to London, viſiting friends: in all which counties I had many large and precious meetings.</p>
                  <p>Being in London, it came upon me to write to friends throughout the nation, about <q>putting out poor children to trades.</q> Wherefore I ſent the following epiſtle to the quarterly meetings of friends in all the counties.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>LET every quarterly meeting make inquiry through all the monthly and other meetings, to know all friends
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037441_0627_100D9234DE84AEE0"/>that are widows, or others, that have children fit to put out to apprenticeſhips; ſo that once a quarter you may ſet forth an apprentice from your quarterly meeting; ſo you may ſet forth four in a year, in each county, or more, if there be occaſion. This apprentice, when out of his time, may help his father or mother, and ſupport the family that is decayed; and, in ſo doing, all may come to live comfortably. This being done in your quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ye will have knowledge through the county, in the monthly and particular meetings, of maſters fit for them; and of ſuch trades as their parents or you deſire, or the children are moſt inclinable to. Thus being placed out to friends, they may be trained up in truth; and by this means in the wiſdom of God, you may preſerve friends children in the truth, and enable them to be a ſtrength and help to their families, and nurſers and preſervers of their relations in their ancient days. Thus alſo, things being ordered in the wiſdom of God, you will take off a continual maintenance, and free yourſelves from much cumber. For in the country, ye know, ye may ſet forth an apprentice for a little to ſeveral trades, as brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, maſons, carpenters, wheelwrights, ploughwrights, taylors, tanners, curriers, blackſmiths, ſhoemakers, nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, butchers, weavers of linen and woollen, ſtuffs and ſerges, &amp;c. And you may do well to have a ſtock in your quarterly meetings for that purpoſe. All that is given by any friends at their deceaſe (except it be given to ſome particular uſe, perſon, or meeting) may be brought to the publick ſtock for that purpoſe. This will be a way for the preſerving of many that are poor among you; and it will be a way of making up poor families. In ſeveral counties it is practiſed already. Some quarterly meetings ſet forth two apprentices; and ſometimes the children of others that are laid on the pariſh. You may bind them for fewer or more years, according to their capacities. In all things the wiſdom of God will teach you; by which ye may help the children of poor friends, that they may come to ſupport their families, and preſerve them in the fear of God. So no more, but my love in the everlaſting Seed, by which ye will have wiſdom to order all things to the glory of God.</p>

I ſtaid not long in London; but having viſited friends, and finding things there quiet and well, the Lord's power being over all, I paſſed into Eſſex and Hertfordſhire, where I had many precious meetings. Intending to go as far as Leiceſterſhire, I wrote a letter to my wife, to acquaint her therewith; that, if ſhe found it convenient, ſhe might meet me there. From Hertfordſhire I turned into Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire; thence into Huntingdonſhire, and ſo into Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire; where, inſtead, of meeting my wife, I heard ſhe was haled out of her houſe to Lancaſter priſon, by an order got from the king and council, to fetch her back to priſon upon the old premunire; though ſhe had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from that impriſonment by an order from the king and council the year before. Wherefore, having viſited friends as far as Leiceſterſhire, I returned by Derbyſhire and Warwickſhire to London; having had many large and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meetings in the ſeveral counties I paſſed through, and been ſweetly refreſhed amongſt friends in my travels.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I was got to London, I haſtened Mary Lower and Sarah Fell (two of my wife's daughters) to the king, to acquaint him how their mother was dealt with, and ſee if they could get a full diſcharge for her, that ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her eſtate and liberty without moleſtation. This was ſomewhat difficult, but by diligent attendance they at length obtained it; the king giving command to Sir John Otway to ſignify his pleaſure therein by letter to the ſheriff, and others concerned in the country. Which letter Sarah Fell, going down with her brother and ſiſter Rous, carried with her to Lancaſter; and by them I wrote to my wife, as followeth:</p>

They went; and then thought to have come down; but it was upon me to ſtay them a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that they might follow the buſineſs till it was effected: which it now is, and is here ſent. The late declaration of mine hath been very ſerviceable, people being generally ſatisfied with it. So no more but my love in the holy Seed.</p>

                        <p>O FRIENDS, conſider this act, which limits our meetings to five. Is this, to do as ye would be done by?' Would ye be ſo ſerved yourſelves? We own Chriſt Jeſus as well as you, his coming, death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and if we be contrary minded to you in ſome things, is not this the apoſtle's exhortation, to <q>wait till God hath revealed it?</q> Doth not he ſay, What is not of faith, is ſin?' Seeing we have not faith in things which ye would have us to do, would it not be ſin in us if we ſhould act contrary to our faith? Why ſhould any man have power over any other man's faith, ſeeing Chriſt is the author of it? When the apoſtles preached in the name of Jeſus, and great multitudes heard them, and the rulers forbad them to ſpeak my more in that name, did not they bid them judge whether it were better to obey God or man? Would not this act have taken hold of the twelve apoſtles and ſeventy diſciples; for they met often together? If there had been a law made then, that not above five ſhould have met with Chriſt, would not that have been an hindering him from meeting with his diſciples? Do ye think that he, who is the wiſdom of God, or his diſciples, would have obeyed it? If ſuch a law had been made in the apoſtles days, that not above five might have met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who had been different minded from either the Jews or the Gentiles, do ye think the churches of Chriſt at Corinth, Philippi, Epheſus.

                        <p>MY dear friends, Keep in the faith of God above all outward things and in his power, that hath given you dominion over all. The ſame power of God is ſtill with you to deliver you as formerly: for God and his power is the ſame; his Seed is over all, and before all; and will be, when that which makes to ſuffer is gone. Be of good faith in that which changeth not; for whatſoever any doth againſt the truth it will come upon themſelves, and fall as a mill-ſtone on their heads. If the Lord ſuffer you to be tried, let all be given up; look at the Lord and his power, which is over the whole world, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main when the world is gone. In the Lord's power and truth rejoice, friends, over that which makes to ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Friends, the Lord hath bleſſed you in outward things; and now he may try you, whether your minds be in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, or with the Lord that gave you them? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep in the Seed, by which all outward things were made, and which is over them all. What! ſhall not I pray, and ſpeak to God, with my face towards heavenly Jeruſalem, according to my wonted time? Let not any one's Delilah ſhave his head, leſt ſuch loſe their ſtrength; neither reſt in its lap, leſt the Philiſtines be upon you.

                  <p>On the next firſt-day after the act came in force, I went to the meeting-houſe at Gracechurch-ſtreet, where I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtorm was moſt likely to begin. When I came there, I found the ſtreet full of people, and a guard ſet to keep friends out of their meeting-houſe. I went to the other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, out of Lombard-ſtreet, where alſo I found a guard; but the court was full of people, and a friend was ſpeaking amongſt them: but ſpoke not long. When he had done, I ſtood up, and was moved to ſay, <q>Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for thee to kick againſt that which pricks thee. Then I ſhewed, it is Saul's nature that perſecuteſt ſtill; and that they, who perſecute Chriſt in his members now, where he is made manifeſt, kick againſt that which pricks them. That it was the birth of the fleſh that perſecuted the birth born of the Spirit; and that it was the nature of dogs to tear and devour the ſheep; but that we ſuffered as ſheep that bite not again; for we were a peaceable people, and loved them that perſecuted us.</q> After I had ſpoken awhile to this effect, the conſtable came with an informer and ſoldiers; and as they plucked me down, I ſaid, 'Bleſſed are the peace-makers.' The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the ſoldiers put me among the ſoldiers, and bid them ſecure me, ſaying to me, <q>You are the man I looked for.</q> They took alſo John Burneyate, with another friend, and had us away firſt to the Exchange, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards Moorfields. As we went along the ſtreets the people were very moderate. Some of them laughed at the conſtable, and told him, 'We would not run away.' The informer went with us unknown; till falling into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one of the company, he ſaid, <q>It would never be a good world till all people came to the good old reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that was too hundred years ago.</q> Whereupon I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <q>Art thou a Papiſt? What! a Papiſt informer? for two hundred years ago there was no other religion but that of the Papiſts.</q> He ſaw he had enſnared himſelf, and was vexed at it; for as he went along the ſtreets, I ſpoke often to him, and manifeſted what he was. When we were come to the mayor's houſe, and were in the court-yard, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:037441_0632_100D923E93202610"/>aſked me, 'How and for what I was taken?' ... I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to aſk the informer; and alſo know what his name was: but he refuſed to tell his name. Whereupon one of the mayor's officers looking out at a window, told him, <q>He ſhould tell his name before he went away: for the lord mayor would know by what authority he intruded himſelf with ſoldiers into the execution of thoſe laws which belonged to the civil magiſtrate to execute, and not to the military. After this, he was eager to be gone; and went to the porter to be let out. One of the officers called to him, ſaying. Have you brought people here to inform againſt, and now will you go away before my lord mayor comes?</q> Some called to the porter not to let him out; whereupon he forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pulled open the door and ſlipped out. No ſooner was he come into the ſtreet but the people gave a ſhout, that made the ſtreet ring again, crying out, <q>A Papiſt informer! A Papiſt informer!</q> We deſired the conſtable and ſoldiers to go and reſcue him out of the people's hands, leſt they ſhould do him a miſchief. They went, and brought him into the mayor's entry, where we ſtaid awhile: but when he went out again, the people received him with ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhout. Whereupon the ſoldiers were obliged to reſcue him once more; and then they had him into an houſe in an alley, where they perſuaded him to change his perriwig, ſo he got away unknown.</p>
                  <p>When the mayor came, we were brought into the room where he was, and ſome of his officers would have taken off our hats; which he perceiving, bid them, <q>let us alone, and not meddle with our hats; for,</q> ſaid he, <q>they are not yet brought before me in judicature.</q> So we ſtood by, while he examined ſome Preſbyterian and Baptiſt teachers; with whom he was ſomewhat ſharp, and convicted them. After he had done with them, I was brought to the table where he ſat; and then the officers took off my hat. The mayor ſaid mildly to me, <q>Mr. Fox, you are an eminent man amongſt thoſe of your profeſſion; pray, will you be inſtrumental to diſſuade them from meeting in ſuch great numbers? for, ſeeing Chriſt hath promiſed, that where two or three are met in his name, he will be in the midſt of them; and the king and parliament are graciouſly pleaſed to allow of four to meet together to worſhip God; why will not you be content to partake both of Chriſt's promiſe to two or three and the king's indulgence to four?</q> I anſwered to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <q>Chriſt's promiſe was not to diſcourage many from
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:037441_0633_100D9241374425C8"/>meeting together in his name; but to encourage the few, that the feweſt might not forbear to meet, becauſe of their fewneſs. But if Chriſt hath promiſed to manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the midſt of ſo ſmall an aſſembly, where but two or three were gathered in his name, how much more would his preſence abound, where two or three hundred are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in his name? I wiſhed him to conſider whether this act would not have taken hold of Chriſt, with his twelve apoſtles and ſeventy diſciples (if it had been in their time) who uſed to meet often together, and that in great numbers? However, I told him this act did not concern us; for it was made againſt ſeditious meetings, of ſuch as met, under colour and pretence of religion, to contrive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, as (the act ſays) late experience had ſhewn; but we had been ſufficiently tried and proved, and always found peaceable; therefore he ſhould do well to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the innocent and the guilty.</q> He ſaid, <q>The act was made againſt meetings, and a worſhip not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the liturgy.</q> I told him, <q>[According to] was not the very ſame thing; and aſked him, whether the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was according to the ſcriptures? And whether we might not read ſcriptures, and ſpeak ſcriptures? He ſaid, Yes. I told him, This act took hold only of ſuch as met to plot and contrive inſurrections, as late experience had ſhewn; but they had never experienced that by us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thieves are ſometimes on the road, muſt not honeſt men travel? And becauſe plotters and contrivers have met to do miſchief, muſt not an honeſt, peaceable people meet to do good? If we had been a people that met to plot and contrive inſurrections, &amp;c. we might have drawn ourſelves into fours; for four might do more miſchief in plotting than if there were four hundred, becauſe four might ſpeak out their minds more freely to one another than four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred could. Therefore we being innocent, and not the people this act concerns, we keep our meetings as we uſed to do; and I ſaid, I believed that he knew in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we were innocent.</q> After ſome more diſcourſe he took our names, and the places where we lodged, and at length, as the informer was gone, ſet us at liberty.</p>
                  <p>Being at liberty, the friends with me aſked, <q>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would go?</q> I told them, <q>To Gracechurch-ſtreet meeting again, if it was not over.</q> When we came there, the people were generally gone; only ſome few ſtood at the gate. We went into Gerrard Roberts's. From thence
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:037441_0634_100D9242C9D97430"/>I ſent to know how the other meetings in the city were? And underſtood, that at ſome of the meeting-places friends were kept out; at others they were taken, but ſet at liberty again a few days after. A glorious time it was; for the Lord's power came over all, and his everlaſting truth got renown. For as faſt as ſome, that were ſpeaking, were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, others were moved of the Lord of ſtand up and ſpeak, to the admiration of the people; and the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many Baptiſts and other ſectaries left their publick meetings, and came to ſee how the Quakers would ſtand. As for the informer aforeſaid, he was ſo frighted, that there durſt hardly any informer appear publickly again in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſome time after. But the mayor, whoſe name was Samuel Starling, though he carried himſelf ſmoothly towards us, proved afterwards a very great perſecutor of our friends, many of whom he caſt into priſon, as may be ſeen in the trials of W. Penn, W. Mead, and others at the Old Bailey this year.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time the heat of perſecution in the city be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abate, and meetings were quieter there. I being then clear of the city, went to viſit friends in the country; and attended ſeveral meetings in Middleſex, Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Oxfordſhire, which were quiet, though in ſome places there was much threatening. At Reading moſt of the friends were in priſon; and I went to viſit them. When I had been awhile with them, the friends that were priſoners gathered together, and ſeveral other perſons came in; ſo I had a fine opportunity amongſt them, and <q>declared the word of life, encouraging them in the truth; and they were refreſhed in feeling the preſence and power of the Lord amongſt them.</q> When the meeting was ended, the gaoler underſtanding I was there, friends were concerned how to get me ſafe out again; for they feared he ſhould ſtop me. After I had ſtaid awhile, and eat with them, I went down ſtairs, and the gaoler being at the door, I put my hand in my pocket, which he had ſuch an eye to, hoping to get ſomething of me, that he aſked me no queſtion. So I gave him ſomething, and bad him <q>be kind and civil to my friends in priſon, whom I came to viſit;</q> and he let me paſs out without interruption. But ſoon after Iſaac Penington coming to viſit them, he ſtopped him, and cauſed him to be made a priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Next morning I rode to a meeting at Baghurſt in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Thomas Briggs being with me. When we came into
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037441_0635_100D92445BFD7B48"/>the pariſh, ſome ſober people told us, <q>the prieſt of the town was an envious man, and did threaten us.</q> We went to the meeting, which was large, and after ſome time Thomas Briggs ſtood up and ſpoke. It ſeems the prieſt had got a warrant, and ſent the conſtables and other officers with it. They came to the houſe, ſtaid awhile, and then went away, but did not come into the meeting; ſo we in the meeting did not know of their being there. After Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Briggs had done ſpeaking, I was moved of the Lord to ſtand up, and declare the word of life to the people; and a precious meeting we had. When the meeting was ended and riſen, I heard a great clutter in the yard; and when we came out, the man of the houſe told us, <q>The officers had been in the houſe before, and did not come into the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but went away without doing any thing. And that now the prieſt in a great rage had ſent them again, and his own ſervant with them.</q> But the meeting being ended before they came, they could do nothing. Thus the good providence of the Lord preſerved us from the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the envious prieſt.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went to a friend's on the edge of Berkſhire, where ſeveral friends came to viſit us. Afterwards we paſſed into Surry, and had many precious meetings, till we came to Stephen Smith's near Guildford, where great perſecution had been; and much goods had been taken away from friends for their meetings, and under great threatenings they were at that time; yet we had ſeveral bleſſed meetings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; and the Lord's power was over all, in and by which we were preſerved.</p>
                  <p>We went into Suſſex, by Richard Baxe's, where we had a large, precious, quiet meeting, though the conſtables had given out threatenings before. I had many more meetings in that county; and though there were ſome threatenings, meetings were peaceable; and friends refreſhed, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon the foundation of God that ſtands ſure. When I had thoroughly viſited Suſſex, I went into Kent, and had many glorious and precious meetings in ſeveral parts of that county. I went to a meeting near Deal, which was very large; and returning from thence to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, viſited friends there; then paſſed into the Iſle of Sheppy, where I ſtaid two or three days: and thither came Alexander Parker, George Whitehead, and John Rouſe.</p>
                  <p>The next day, finding my ſervice for the Lord finiſhed there, we paſſed towards Rocheſter. As I was walking
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:037441_0636_100D924756E023E0"/>down a hill, a great weight and oppreſſion fell upon my ſpirit. I got on my horſe again; but the weight remained ſo, that I was hardly able to ride. At length we came to Rocheſter, but I was much ſpent, being ſo extremely loaden and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the world's ſpirits, that my life was oppreſſed under them. I got with difficulty to Graveſend, and lay at an inn there; but could hardly either eat or ſleep. The next day John Rouſe and Alexander Parker went for London. John Stubbs and I went over the Ferry into Eſſex. We came to Horn-church, where was a meeting on the firſt-day. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the meeting I rode with great uneaſineſs to Stratford, to a friend's whoſe name was Williams; he had formerly been a captain. Here I lay exceeding weak, and at laſt loſt both hearing and ſight. Several friends came to me from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I told them, <q>I ſhould be as a ſign to ſuch as would not ſee, and ſuch as would not hear the truth.</q> In this condition I continued a pretty while. Several came about me; and though I could not ſee their perſons, I felt and diſcerned their ſpirits, who of them was honeſt-hearted, and who was not. Divers friends, who practiſed phyſick, would have given me medicines, but I was not to meddle with any; for I was ſenſible I had a travail to go through; and therefore deſired none but ſolid, weighty friends might be about me. Under great ſufferings, ſorrows, and oppreſſions I lay for ſeveral weeks; whereby I was brought ſo low and weak in body, that few thought I could live. Some of thoſe with me went away, ſaying, 'They would not ſee me die;' and it was reported both in London and in the country that I was deceaſed; but I felt the Lord's power inwardly ſupporting me. When thoſe about me had given me up to die, I ſpoke to them to get a coach to carry me to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Roberts's, about twelve miles off; for I found it was my place to go thither. I had now recovered a little glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering ſight, ſo that I could diſcern the people and fields as I went, and that was all. When I came to Gerrard's, he was very weak. I was moved to ſpeak to him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him. After I had ſtaid about three weeks there, it was with me to go to Enfield. Friends were afraid of my removing; but I told them I might ſafely go. When I had taken my leave of Gerrard, and was come to Enfield, I went firſt to viſit Amor Stoddart, who lay very weak, and almoſt ſpeechleſs. I was moved to tell him, <q>He had been faithful as a man, and faithful to God; and that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Seed of life was his crown.</q> Many more words I
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:037441_0637_100D924948319860"/>was moved to ſpeak to him; though I was then ſo weak, I was hardly able to ſtand; and within a few days after Amor died. I went to the widow Dry's at Enfield, where I lay all that winter; warring in ſpirit with the evil ſpirits of the world, that warred againſt truth and friends. For there were great perſecutions at this time. Some meeting-houſes were pulled down, and many were broken up by ſoldiers. Sometimes a troop of horſe or a company of foot came; and ſome broke their ſwords, carbines, muſkets, and pikes with beating friends. Many they wounded, ſo that their blood lay in the ſtreets. Amongſt others, that were active in this cruel perſecution at London, my old adverſary colonel Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was one; who, with a company of foot, went to break up ſeveral meetings; and would often inquire for me at the meetings he broke up. One time, as he went over the water to Horſlydown, there happening ſome ſcuffle between ſome of his ſoldiers and ſome of the watermen, he bid his men 'Fire at them;' which they did, and killed ſome.</p>
                  <p>I was under great ſufferings at this time, beyond what I have words to declare. For I was brought into the deep, and ſaw all the religions of the world, and people that lived in them, and the prieſts that held them up; who were as a company of men-eaters, eating up the people like bread, and gnawing the fleſh from off their bones. But as for true religion and worſhip, and miniſters of God, alack! I ſaw there was none amongſt thoſe of the world that pretended to it. For they that pretended to be the church, were but a company of men-eaters, men of cruel viſages, and of long teeth; who, though they had cried againſt the men-eaters in America, I ſaw they were in the ſame nature. And as the great profeſſing Jews did 'eat up God's people like bread,' and the falſe prophets and prieſts then preached peace to people, ſo long as they <q>put into their mouths and fed them;</q> but if they fed them not, they prepared war againſt them; <q>they ate their fleſh off their bones, and chopped them for the caldron;</q> ſo theſe that profeſs themſelves chriſtians now (both prieſts and profeſſors) and are not in the ſame power and Spirit that Chriſt and the holy prophets and apoſtles were in, are in the ſame nature that the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Jews were in, and are men-eaters as well as they. Theſe ſtirred up perſecution, and ſet the wicked informers on work; ſo that a friend could hardly ſpeak a few words in a private family, before they ſat down to cat, but ſome
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:037441_0638_100D924AD86E0358"/>were ready to inform againſt them. A particular inſtance of which I have heard, as followeth:
At Droitwich, J. Cartwright came to a friend's houſe; and being moved of the Lord to ſpeak a few words before he ſat down to ſupper, there came an informer, and ſtood heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening under the window. When he had heard the friend ſpeak, hoping to get ſome gain to himſelf, he went and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and go: a warrant to diſtrain the friend's goods, under pretence that there was a meeting at his houſe: whereas there was none in the houſe at that time but the friend, the man of the houſe, his wife, and their maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. But this evil-minded man, as he came back with his warrant in the night, fell off his horſe, and broke his neck. So there was a wretched end of a wicked informer, who hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have enriched himſelf by ſpoiling friends; but the Lord prevented him, and cut him off in his wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Though it was a cruel, bloody, perſecuting time, yet the Lord's power went over all, his everlaſting Seed prevailed; and friends were made to ſtand firm and faithful in the Lord's power. Some ſober people of other profeſſions would ſay, <q>If friends did not ſtand, the nation would run into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though by reaſon of my weakneſs I could not travel, amongſt friends as I uſed to do; yet in the motion of life I ſent the following lines, as an encouraging teſtimony to them:</p>

                  <p>After ſome time it pleaſed the Lord to allay the heat of this violent perſecution; and I felt in ſpirit an overcoming of the ſpirits of thoſe men-eaters that had ſtirred it up, and carried it on to that height of cruelty, though I was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly very weak. I plainly felt, and thoſe friends that were with me, and that came to viſit me, took notice, that, as the perſecution ceaſed, I came from under the travails and ſufferings which had laid with ſuch weight upon me: ſo that towards the ſpring I began to recover, and to walk up and down, beyond the expectation of many; who did not think I could ever have gone abroad again.</p>

But they that are out of the grace, truth, light, Spirit and power of God, ſuch as reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, quench, vex, and grieve the Spirit of God, who hate the Light, turn from the grace of God into wantonneſs, and do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, ſuch as have erred from the faith, made ſhipwreck of it and of a good conſcience, who abuſe the power of God, and deſpiſe propheſying, revelation, and inſpiration, theſe are the dogs and unbelievers that are without the city. Theſe make up the great city Babylon, confuſion, and her cage, the power of darkneſs; and the evil ſpirit of error ſurrounds and covers them over. In this great city Babylon are the falſe prophets, in the falſe power and falſe ſpirit; the beaſt in the dragon's power, and the whore that is gone a whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Spirit of God, and nom Chriſt her huſband. But the Lord's power is over all this power of darkneſs, cage,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:037441_0640_100D924F7656A8E8"/>whore, beaſt, dragon, falſe prophets and their worſhippers, who are for the lake which burns with fire. Many things more did I ſee concerning the heavenly city, the New Jeruſalem, which are hard to be uttered, and would be hard to be received. But, in ſhort, this holy city is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the light; and all that are within the light are within the city; the gates whereof ſtand open all the day (for there is no night there) that all may come in. Chriſt's blood being ſhed for every man, he taſted death for every man, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth every man that cometh into the world; and his grace, that brings ſalvation, having appeared to all men, there is no place or language where his voice may not be heard. The chriſtians in the primitive times were called by Chriſt 'A city ſet upon an hill;' they were alſo called 'The light of the world,' and, 'The ſalt of the earth;' but when chriſtians loſt the light, ſalt, and power of God, they came to be trodden under foot, like unſavoury ſalt. Even as the Jews, who while they kept the law of God were preſerved above all nations, but when they turned their backs on God and his law they were trodden under foot of other nations; ſo Adam and Eve, while they obeyed God, were kept in his image and in the paradiſe of God, in dominion over all the works of his hands; but when they diſobeyed God, they loſt the image of God, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and the holineſs in which they were made; they loſt their dominion, were driven out of paradiſe, fell under the dark power of Satan, and came under the chains of darkneſs. But the promiſe of God was, <q>That the Seed of the woman. Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head,</q> ſhould break his power and authority, which had led into captivity, and had held man therein. So Chriſt, who is the firſt and laſt, ſets man free, and is the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the juſt and unjuſt, the Judge of quick and dead; and they that are in him are inveſted with everlaſting reſt and peace, out of all the labours, travails, and miſeries of Adam in the fall. So he is ſufficient and of ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore man up into the ſtate that he was in before he fell; and not into that ſtate only, but up into that ſtate alſo that never fell, even to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I had alſo in this time a great exerciſe and travail of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon me, concerning the powers and rulers of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the ſenſe I had of the many tender viſitations and faithful warnings given them, and of their great abuſe thereof, who had refuſed to hear, and rejected the counſel of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:037441_0641_100D9251966AD4A0"/>the Lord. And though I knew friends would be clear of their blood, yet I could not but mourn over them, and give forth theſe few lines concerning them:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>WE have given them a viſitation, have faithfully warned them, have declared to them our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and uprightneſs, and that we never did any hurt to the king, nor to any of his people. We have nothing in our hearts but love and good-will to him and his people, and deſire their eternal welfare. But if they will not hear, the day of judgment, ſorrow, torment, miſery, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſtruction will come from the Lord upon them, that have been the cauſe of the ſufferings of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſimple, innocent, harmleſs people, that have done them no hurt, nor have had any ill-will towards him or them; but have deſired their eternal good, for the eternal truth's ſake. Deſtruction will come upon them that turn the ſword backward. Therefore do not blind your eyes, the Lord will bring ſwiſt deſtruction and miſery upon you. Surely he will do it, and relieve his innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have groaned for deliverance from under your oppreſſion, and have alſo groaned for your deliverance out of wickedneſs. Bleſſed be the Lord God, that he hath a people in this nation that ſeek the good of all men upon the face of the earth; for we have the mind of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that deſires not the death of a ſinner, but the ſalvation and good of all. Bleſſed be the name of the Lord our God for ever!</p>

                  <p>While I continued at Enfield, a ſenſe came upon me of an hurt, that ſometimes happened by perſons coming under the profeſſion of truth out of one country into another, to take an huſband or wife amongſt friends, where they were ſtrangers, and it was not known whether they were clear and orderly or no. And it opened in me to recommend the following method to friends, for preventing ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>ALL friends that marry, whether men or women, if they come out of another nation, iſland, plantation, or county, let them bring a certificate from the men's meeting of that county, nation, iſland, or plantation from which they come, to the men's meeting where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:037441_0642_100D92532885FA48"/>their intention of marriage. For the men's meeting being made up of the faithful, this will ſtop all bad and raw ſpirits from roving up and down. When any come with a certificate or letter of recommendation from one men's meeting to another, one is refreſhed by another, and can ſet their hands and hearts to the thing. This will prevent a great deal of trouble. And then, when ye have to ſay to them in the power of God, in admoniſhing and inſtructing them, ye are left to the power and Spirit of God to do it, and to let them know the duty of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and what it is; that there may be unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Spirit, and power, light, and wiſdom of God, throughout all the men's meetings in the whole world, in one, in the life. Let copies of this be ſent to every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nation, and iſland, where friends are, that all things may be kept holy, pure, and righteous, in unity and peace, and God over all may be glorified among you, his lot, his people, and inheritance, his adopted ſons and daughters, and heirs of his life. So no more, but my love in that which changeth not.</p>

                  <p>When I had recovered, ſo that I could walk a little up and down, I went from Enfield to Gerrard Roberts's again, and from thence to the women's ſchool at Shacklewell, and ſo to the meeting at Gracechurch-ſtreet, London; where, though I was yet but weak, the Lord's power upheld and enabled me to declare his eternal word of life.</p>

                  <p>I mentioned before, that, upon notice received of my wife's being had to priſon again, I ſent two of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the king, and they procured his order to the ſheriff of Lancaſhire for her diſcharge. But though I expected ſhe would have been ſet at liberty, yet this violent ſtorm of perſecution coming ſuddenly on, the perſecutors there found means to hold her ſtill in priſon. But now the perſecution a little ceaſing, I was moved to ſpeak to Martha Fiſher, and another woman friend, to go to the king about her liberty. They went in the faith, and in the Lord's power; and he gave them favour with the king, ſo that he granted a diſcharge under the broad ſeal, to clear both her and her eſtate after ſhe had been ten years a priſoner, and premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nired; the like whereof was ſcarce to be heard in England. I ſent down the diſcharge forthwith by a friend; by whom alſo I wrote to her, to inform her how to get it delivered to the juſtices, and alſo to acquaint her, that it was upon me from the Lord to go beyond ſea, to viſit the plantations in America, and therefore deſired her to haſten to London, as ſoon as ſhe could conveniently after ſhe had obtained her liberty, becauſe the ſhip was then fitting for the voyage. In the meantime I got to Kingſton, and ſtaid at John Rous's till my wife came up, and then began to prepare for the voyage. But the yearly meeting being near at hand, I tarried till that was over. Many friends came up to it from all parts of the nation, and a very large and precious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was; for the Lord's power was over all, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, everlaſtingly-renowned ſeed of life was exalted above all.</p>
                  <p>After this meeting was over, and I had finiſhed my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for the Lord in England, the ſhip, and the friends that
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:037441_0644_100D925657B48EC8"/>intended to go with me, being ready, I went to Graveſend the 12th of the 6th month. The friends that were bound for the voyage with me went down to the ſhip the night before. Their names were, Thomas Briggs, William Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundſon, John Rouſe, John Stubbs, Solomon Eccles, James Lancaſter, John Cartwright, Robert Widders, George Pattiſon, John Hull, Elizabeth Hooton, and Elizabeth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The veſſel we were to go in was a yacht, called the Induſtry, the maſter's name Thomas Forſter, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of paſſengers about fifty. I lay that night on board; but moſt of the friends lay at Graveſend. Early next morning, the paſſengers, and thoſe friends that intended to accompany us to the Downs, being come on board, we took our leave in great tenderneſs of thoſe that came with us to Graveſend only, and ſet ſail about ſix in the morning for the Downs. Having a fair wind, we outſailed all the ſhips that were outward-bound, and got thither by the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some of us went aſhore that night, and lodged at Deal; where we underſtood an officer had orders from the governor to take our names in writing, which he did the next morning, though we told him they had been taken at Graveſend. In the afternoon, the wind ſerving, I took leave of my wife and the other friends, and went on board. Before we could ſet ſail, there being two of the king's fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates riding in the Downs, the captain of one of them ſent his preſs-maſter on board us, who took three of our ſeamen. This had certainly delayed, if not wholly prevented our voyage, had not the captain of the other frigate, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the leakineſs of our veſſel, and the length of our voyage, in compaſſion and much civility, ſpared us two of his men. Before this was over, an officer of the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe came on board to peruſe packets and get fees, ſo that we were kept from ſailing till about ſun-ſet; during which ſtop, a very conſiderable number of merchantmen, outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, were got ſeveral leagues before us. Being clear we ſet ſail in the evening, and by next morning overtook part of that fleet about the height of Dover. We ſoon reached the reſt, and in a little time left them all behind us; for our yatch was counted a very ſwift ſailer. But ſhe was very leaky, ſo that the ſeamen and ſome of the paſſengers did for the moſt part pump day and night. One day they obſerved that in two hours time ſhe ſucked in ſixteen inches of water in the well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:037441_0645_100D92597A1FB708"/>
When we had been about three weeks at ſea, one after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we ſpied a veſſel about four leagues aſtern of us. Our maſter ſaid, It was a Sallee man of war who ſeemed to give us chace. Our maſter ſaid, <q>Come, let us go to ſupper, and when it grows dark, we ſhall loſe him.</q> This he ſpoke to pacify the paſſengers, ſome of whom began to be very apprehenſive of the danger. But friends were well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, having faith in God, and no fear upon their ſpirits. When the ſun was down, I ſaw the ſhip out of my cabin making towards us. When it grew dark, we altered our courſe to miſs her; but ſhe altered alſo, and gained upon us. At night the maſter and others came into my cabin, and aſked me, 'What they ſhould do?' I told them, <q>I was no mariner;</q> and aſked them, <q>What they thought was beſt to do?</q> They ſaid, <q>There were but two ways, either to out-run him, or tack about and hold the ſame courſe we were going before.</q> I told them, <q>If he were a thief, they might be ſure he would tack about too; and as for out-running him, it was to no purpoſe to talk of that, for they ſaw he ſailed faſter than we.</q> They aſked me again, 'What they ſhould do?' 'For,' they ſaid, <q>if the mariners had taken Paul's counſel, they had not come to the damage they did.</q> I anſwered, <q>It was a tria of faith, therefore the Lord was to be waited on for counſel.</q> So retiring in ſpirit, the Lord ſhewed me, <q>That his life and power was placed between us and the ſhip that purſued us.</q> I told this to the maſter and the reſt, and that the beſt way was to tack about and ſteer our right courſe. I wiſhed them alſo to put out all their candles, but that they ſteered by, and to ſpeak to all the paſſengers to be ſtill and quiet. About the 11th hour in the night the watch called, and ſaid, 'They were juſt upon us.' That diſquieted ſome of the paſſengers; whereupon I ſat up in my cabin, and looking through the port-hole, the moon being not quite down, I ſaw them very near us. I was getting up to go out of the cabin; but remembering the word of the Lord, 'That his life and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er was placed between us and them,' I lay down again. The maſter and ſome of the ſeamen came again, and aſked me, <q>If they might not ſteer ſuch a point?</q> I told them, 'They might do as they would.' By this time the moon was gone quite down, a freſh gale aroſe, and the Lord hid us from them; and we ſailed briſkly on, and ſaw them no more. The next day, being the firſt day of the week, we had a publick meeting in the ſhip, as
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:037441_0646_100D925B0D9ABA20"/>we uſually had on that day throughout the voyage, and the Lord's preſence was greatly among us. I deſired the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <q>To mind the mercies of the Lord, who had delivered them; for they might have been all in the Turks hands by that time, had not the Lord's hand ſaved them.</q> About a week after, the maſter and ſome of the ſeamen endeavoured to perſuade the paſſengers, it was not a Turkiſh pirate that chaſed us, but a merchant-man going to the Canaries. When I heard of it, I aſked them, <q>Why then did they ſpeak ſo to me? Why did they trouble the paſſengers? And why did they tack about from him, and alter their courſe?</q> I told them, <q>They ſhould take heed of ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mercies of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards, while we were at Barbadoes, came in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant from Sallee, and told the people, <q>That one of the Sallee men of war ſaw a monſtrous yacht at ſea, the greateſt that ever he ſaw, had her in chace, and was juſt upon her; but there was a Spirit in her that he could not take.</q> This confirmed us in the belief, that it was a Sallee-man we ſaw make after us; and that it was the Lord that delivered us out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>I was not ſea-ſick during the voyage, as many of the friends and other paſſengers were; but the many hurts and bruiſes I had formerly received, and the infirmities I had contracted in England by extreme cold and hardſhips, that I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone in many long and ſore impriſonments, returned upon me at ſea; ſo that I was very ill in my ſtomach, and full of violem pains in my bones and limbs. This was after I had been at ſea about a month; for about three weeks after I came firſt to ſea, I ſweat abundantly, chiefly my head; and my body broke out in pimples, and my legs and feet ſwelled extremely, ſo that my ſtockings and ſlippers could not be drawn on without difficulty and great pain. On a ſudden the ſweating ceaſed, ſo that when I came into the hot climate, where others ſweat moſt freely, I could not ſweat at all; but my fleſh was hot, dry, and burning, and that which before broke out in pimples ſtruck in again to my ſtomach and heart; ſo that I was very ill, and weak beyond expreſſion. Thus I continued during the reſt of the voyage, which was about a month; for we were ſeven weeks and ſome odd days at ſea.</p>
                  <p>The third of the eighth month, early in the morning, we diſcovered the iſland of Barbadoes; but it was between nine and ten at night ere we came to anchor in Carliſle-bay. We
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:037441_0647_100D925CFABB4358"/>got on ſhore as ſoon as we could, and I with ſome others walked to a friend's houſe, a merchant, whoſe name was Richard Forſtall, above a quarter of a mile from the bridge. But being very ill and weak, I was ſo tired, that I was in a manner ſpent by that time I got thither. There I abode very ill ſeveral days, and though they ſeveral times gave me things to make me ſweat, they could not effect it. What they gave me did rather parch and dry up my body, and made me probably worſe than otherwiſe I might have been. Thus I continued about three weeks after I landed, having much pain in my bones, joints, and whole body, ſo that I could hardly get any reſt; yet I was pretty cheary, and my ſpirit kept above it all. Neither did my illneſs take me off from the ſervice of truth; but both while I was at ſea, and after I came to Barbadoes, before I was able to travel about, I gave forth ſeveral papers (having a friend to write for me) ſome of which I ſent by the firſt conveyance for England to be printed.</p>
                  <p>After I had reſted three or four days at Richard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall's, where many friends came to viſit me, John Rous, having borrowed a coach of colonel Chamberlain, came to fetch me to his father Thomas Rous's. But it was late ere we could get thither, and little or no reſt could I take that night. A few days after, colonel Chamberlain, who had ſo kindly lent his coach, came to give me a viſit, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf very courteouſly towards me.</p>
                  <p>Soon after I came into the iſland, I was informed of a remarkable paſſage, wherein the juſtice of God did emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear: It was thus. There was a young man of Barbadoes, whoſe name was John Drakes (a perſon of ſome note in the world's account, but a common ſwearer and a bad man) who, when he was in London, had a mind to marry a friend's daughter, left by her mother very young, with a conſiderable portion, to the care and government of ſeveral friends, whereof I was one. He made application to me, that he might have my conſent to marry this young maid. I told him, <q>I was one of her overſeers appointed by her mother, who was a widow, to take care of her; that if her mother had intended her for a match to any man of another profeſſion, ſhe would have diſpoſed her accordingly; but ſhe committed her to us, that ſhe might be trained up in the fear of the Lord; and therefore I ſhould betray the truſt repoſed in me, if I ſhould conſent that he, who was out of the fear of God, ſhould marry
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:037441_0648_100D925F318D5938"/>her; which I would not do.</q> When he ſaw that he could not obtain his deſire, he returned to Barbadoes with great offence of mind againſt me, but without a juſt cauſe. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when he heard I was coming to Barbadoes, he ſwore deſperately, and threatened, <q>if he could poſſibly procure it, he would have me burned to death when I came there.</q> Which a friend hearing, aſked him, <q>What I had done to him, that he was ſo violent againſt me?</q> He would not anſwer, but ſaid again, 'I'll have him burned.' Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the friend replied, <q>Do not march on too furiouſly, left thou come too ſoon to thy journey's end.</q> About ten days after, he was ſtruck with a violent burning fever, of which he died; by which his body was ſo ſcorched, that the people ſaid, 'It was as black as a coal; and three days before I landed, his body was laid in the duſt. This was taken notice of as a ſad example.</p>
                  <p>While I continued ſo weak that I could not go abroad to meetings, the other friends that came over with me beſtirred themſelves in the Lord's work. The next day but one after we came on ſhore, they had a great meeting at the Bridge, and after that ſeveral meetings in different parts of the iſland; which alarmed the people of all ſorts, ſo that many came to our meetings, and ſome of the chiefeſt rank. For they had got my name, underſtanding I was come upon the iſland, and expected to have ſeen me, not knowing I was unable to go abroad. And indeed my weakneſs continued the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on me, by reaſon that my ſpirit was much preſſed down at the firſt with the filth and dirt, the unrighteouſneſs of the people, which lay as an heavy weight and load upon me. But after I had been above a month upon the iſland, my ſpirit became ſomewhat eaſier, I began to recover my health and ſtrength, and get abroad among friends. In the meantime, having an opportunity to ſend to England, I wrote to friends there, to let them know how it was with me.</p>

I have hardly ſweated theſe ſeven weeks paſt,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:037441_0649_100D9261220DBA48"/>though I am in a very hot climate, where hardly any but are well nigh continually ſweating; but as for me, my old bruiſes, colds, numbneſs, and pains ſtruck inwardly, even to my very heart. So that little reſt I have taken, and the chiefeſt things that were comfortable to my ſtomach were a little water and powdered ginger; but now I begin to drink a little beer as well as water, and ſometimes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wine and water mixed. Great pains and travails I have felt, and in meaſure am under; but it is well, my life is over all. This iſland was to me as all on a fire ere I came to it, but now it is ſomewhat quenched and abated. I came in weakneſs amongſt thoſe that are ſtrong, and have ſo continued; but now I am got a little cheary, and over it. Many friends, and ſome conſiderable perſons of the world, have been with me. I tired out my body much when amongſt you in England; it is the Lord's power that helps me; therefore I deſire you all to prize the power of the Lord and his truth. I was but weak in body when I left you, after I had been in my great travail amongſt you; but after that it ſtruck all back again into my body, which was not well ſettled after ſuch ſore travails in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Then I was ſo tired at ſea, that I could not reſt, and have had little or no ſtomach a long time. Since I came into the iſland, my life hath been very much bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened; but I hope, if the Lord gives me ſtrength to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his work, I ſhall work thoroughly, and bring things that have been out of courſe into better order. So, dear friends, live all in the peaceable truth, and in the love of it, ſerving the Lord in newneſs of life; for glorious things and precious truths have been manifeſted among you plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, to you the riches of the kingdom have been reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have been almoſt a month in this iſland, but have not been able to go abroad or ride out; only very lately I rode out twice, a quarter of a mile at a time, which wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me much. My love in the truth is to you all.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe I was not well able to travel, the friends of the iſland concluded to have their men's and women's meeting for the ſervice of the church at Thomas Rous's, where I lay; by which means I was preſent at each of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and had very good ſervice for the Lord in both. For they had need of information in many things, divers diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being crept in for want of care and watchfulneſs. <q>I
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037441_0650_100D926348D75610"/>exhorted them, more eſpecially at the men's meeting, to be careful with reſpect to marriages, to prevent friends marrying in near kindreds, and alſo to prevent over-haſty proceedings towards ſecond marriages after the death of a former huſband or wife; adviſing that a decent regard be had in ſuch caſes to the memory of the deceaſed huſband or wife. As to friends children marrying too young, at thirteen or fourteen years of age, I ſhewed the unfitneſs thereof, and the inconveniencies and hurts that attend ſuch, childiſh marriages. I admoniſhed them to purge the floor thoroughly, and to ſweep their houſes very clean, that nothing might remain that would defile; and that all ſhould take care, that nothing be ſpoken out of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the blemiſhing or defaming one of another. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regiſtering of marriages, births, and burials, I adviſed them to keep exact records of each in diſtinct books for that only uſe; and alſo to record in a book for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the condemnations of ſuch as went out from truth into diſorderly practices, and the repentance and reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as returned again. I recommended to their care the providing of convenient burying-places for friends, which in ſome parts were yet wanting. Some directions alſo I gave them concerning wills, and the ordering of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies left by friends for publick uſes, and other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the affairs of the church. Reſpecting their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, I deſired them to endeavour to train them up in the fear of God, as well thoſe that were bought with their money, as them that were born in their families, that all might come to the knowledge of the Lord; that ſo, with Joſhua, every maſter of a family might ſay, <q>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</q> I deſired alſo, that they would cauſe their overſeers to deal mildly and gently with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>groes, and not uſe cruelty towards them, as the manner of ſome hath been and is; and that after certain years of ſervitude they ſhould make them free.</q> Many ſweet and precious things were opened in theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by the Spirit and in the power of the Lord, to the edifying, confirming, and building up of friends in the faith and holy order of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>After theſe meetings, the veſſel bound for England not being gone. I was moved to write another epiſtle to friends there; the copy whereof follows:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <pb n="135" facs="unknown:037441_0651_100D9265397296B8"/>
                        <p>DEAR friends and brethren, to whom is my love in that which never changeth, but remains in glory, which is over all, the top and corner-ſtone. In this all have peace and life, as ye dwell in the bleſſed ſeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all is bleſſed, over that which brought the curſe; where all ſhortneſs, narrowneſs of ſpirit, brittleneſs, and peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is. Therefore keep the holy order of the goſpel. Keep in this bleſſed ſeed, where all may be kept in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, in patience, in love, in meekneſs, in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, and in peace; in which the Lord may be ſeen amongſt you, and no way diſhonoured, but glorified by you all. In all your meetings, in cities, towns, and countries, men's meetings, women's meetings, and others, let righteouſneſs flow among you, the holy truth be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, the pure Spirit your guide and leader, and the holy wiſdom from above your orderer, that is pure, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated. Keep in the religion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from the ſpots of the world, which is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled in God's ſight. Keep in the pure and holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in which the pure and holy God is worſhipped, viz. in the Spirit, and in the truth, which the devil is out of, who is the author of all unholineſs, and of that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours God. Be tender of God's glory, of his honour, and of his bleſſed and holy name, in which ye are gathered. All who profeſs the truth, ſee that ye walk in it, in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, holineſs, and godlineſs; for <q>holineſs becomes the houſe of God, the houſehold of faith.</q> That which becomes God's houſe, God loves. He loves righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That is the ornament which becomes his houſe and all his family. Therefore ſee that righteouſneſs run down in all your aſſemblies, that it flow, to drive away all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. This preſerves your peace with God; for in righteouſneſs ye all have peace with the righteous God of peace, and one with another. Every one that bears the name of the Anointed, that high title of being a Chriſtian, named after the Heavenly Man, ſee that ye be in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature made conformable unto his image, even the image of the Heavenly Divine Man, who was before that image which Adam and Eve got from Satan in the fall ſo that in none of you that fallen image may appear, but his image, and you made conformable unto him. Here tranſlation is ſhewed forth in life and converſation, not in words only; yea, and converſion and repentance, which is a change of the nature, of the mind, and of the heart,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037441_0652_100D92672E064D88"/>of the ſpirit and affections, which have been below, and come to be ſet above; and ſo receive the things that are from above, and have the converſation in heaven, not that converſation which is according to the power of the prince of the air, that now rules in the diſobedient. So be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; this is the word of the Lord God unto you all. See, that godlineſs, holineſs, righteouſneſs, truth, and virtue, the fruits of the good Spirit, flow over the bad and its fruits, that ye may anſwer that which is of God in all; for your Heavenly Father is glorified, in that you bring forth much fruit. Therefore ye, who are plants of his planting, his trees of righteouſneſs, ſee that every tree be full of fruit. Keep in true humility, and in the true love of God, which doth edify his body, that the true nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the head, the refreſhings, ſprings, and rivers of water, and bread of life may be plenteouſly known and felt amongſt you, that ſo praiſes may aſcend to God. Be faithful to the Lord God, and juſt and true in all your dealings and doings with and towards men. Be not negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in your men's meetings to admoniſh, exhort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, in the ſpirit of love and of meekneſs, and to ſeek that which is loſt, and to bring back again that which hath been driven away. Let all minds, ſpirits, ſouls, and hearts, be bended down under the yoke of Chriſt Jeſus, the power of God. Much I could write, but am weak, and have been moſtly ſince I left you. Burdens and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails I have been under, and gone through many ways; but it is well. The Lord Almighty knows my work, which he hath ſent me forth to do by his everlaſting arm and power, which is from everlaſting to everlaſting. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his holy name, which I am in, and in which my love is to you all.</p>

                  <p>After I was able to go abroad, and had been a little amongſt friends, I went to viſit the governor; Lewis Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Thomas Rouſe, and ſome other friends being with me. He received us very civilly, and treated us very kindly; making us dine with him, and keeping us moſt part of the day before he let us go away.</p>
                  <p>The ſame week I went to Bridge Town. There was to be a general meeting of friends that week; and the viſit I had made to the governor, and the kind reception I had with him, being generally known to the officers, civil and
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037441_0653_100D92692187EC60"/>military, many came to this meeting from moſt parts of the iſland, and thoſe not of the meaneſt rank; divers of them being judges or juſtices, colonels or captains; ſo that a very great meeting we had of friends and others. The Lord's bleſſed power was plentifully with us, and though I was ſomewhat ſtraitened for time, three other friends having ſpoken before me, the Lord opened things through me to the general and great ſatisfaction of thoſe preſent. Colonel Lewis Morrice came to this meeting, and with him a judge in the country, whoſe name was Ralph Fretwell; who was well ſatisfied, and received the truth.</p>
                  <p>Paul Gwin, a jangling Baptiſt, came into the meeting, and aſked me, <q>How I ſpelt Cain? and whether I had the ſame ſpirit as the apoſtles had?</q> I told him, Yes. And he bade the judge take notice of it. I told him, <q>He that had not a meaſure of the ſame Holy Ghoſt as the apoſtles had, was poſſeſſed with an unclean ſpirit.</q> And then he went his way.</p>
                  <p>I went home with Lewis Morrice that night, being about nine or ten miles; going part of the way by boat, the reſt on horſeback. The place where his plantation was I thought to be the fineſt air of the iſland. Next day Thomas Briggs and William Edmundſon came to ſee me, they intending to leave the iſland the day following, and to go upon the Lord's ſervice to Antigua and Nevis. Lewis Morrice went with them. At Antigua they had ſeveral good meetings, to which there was a great reſort of people; and many were convinced. But when they went to Nevis, the governor, an old perſecutor, ſent ſoldiers on board the veſſel, to ſtop them, and would not ſuffer them to land. Wherefore, after friends of the place had been on board the veſſel with them, and they had been ſweetly refreſhed together, in feeling the Lord's power and preſence amongſt them, they returned to Antigua; where having ſtaid awhile longer, they came again to Barbadoes; Thomas Briggs being very weak and ill.</p>
                  <p>Of the other friends that came over with me, James Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, John Cartwright, and George Pattiſon, were gone ſome time before to Jamaica, and others to other places; ſo that few remained in Barbadoes with me. We had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and precious meetings, both for worſhip, and for the affairs of the church; to the former of which many of other ſocieties came. At one of theſe meetings, colonel Lyne, a ſober perſon, was ſo well ſatisfied with what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037441_0654_100D926B1CA11DE8"/>that he ſaid, <q>Now I can gainſay ſuch as I have heard ſpeak evil of you; who ſay you do not own Chriſt, nor that he died: whereas I perceive you exalt Chriſt in all his offices, beyond what I have ever heard before.</q> This man, obſerving one to take in writing the heads of what I delivered, deſired him ſo let him have a copy of it; and ſaid another day with us before he went away; ſo great a love was raiſed in him to the truth. A very great convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was in moſt parts of the iſland; which made the prieſt and ſome profeſſors fret and rage. Our meetings were very large, and free from diſturbance from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though the envious prieſts and ſome profeſſors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtir up the magiſtrates againſt us. When they found they could not prevail that way, ſome Baptiſts came to the meeting at the town, which was full of people of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ranks and qualities. A great company came with them; and they brought a ſlanderous paper written by John Pennyman with which they made a great noiſe. But the Lord gave me wiſdom and utterance to anſwer their cavils; ſo that the auditory generally received ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoſe quarrelſome profeſſors loſt ground. When they had wearied themſelves with clamour, they went away; but the people ſtaying, the meeting was continued; the things they cavilled about were further opened and cleared, and the life and power of God came over all. But the rage and envy in our adverſaries did not ceaſe; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to defame friends with many falſe and ſcandalous reports, which they ſpread through the iſland. Whereupon I, with ſome other friends, drew up a paper, to go forth in the name of the people called Quakers, for the clearing truth and friends from thoſe falſe reports. It was after this manner:</p>

<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037441_0655_100D926CAB478760"/>That we own and believe in the only Wiſe, Omnipotent, and Everlaſting God, the Creator of all things in heaven and earth, and the Preſerver of all that he hath made; who is God over all, bleſſed for ever; to whom be all honour, glory, dominion, praiſe and thankſgiving, both now and for evermore! And we own and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, his beloved and only begotten Son, in whom he is well pleaſed; who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin Mary; in whom we have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins; who is the expreſs image of the Inviſible God, the firſt-born of every creature, by whom were all things created that are in heaven and in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers; all things were created by him. And we own and believe that he was made a ſacrifice for ſin, who knew no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; that he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for us in the fleſh, without the gates of Jeruſalem; and that he was buried, and roſe again the third day by the power of his Father, for our juſtification; and that he aſcended up into heaven, and now ſitteth at the right hand of God. This Jeſus, who was the foundation of the holy prophets and apoſtles, is our foundation; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no other foundation to be laid but that which is laid, even Chriſt Jeſus: who taſted death for every man, ſhed his blood for all men, is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world: according as John the Baptiſt teſtified of him, when he ſaid, <q>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world,</q> John i. 29. We believe that he alone is our Redeemer and Saviour, the captain of our ſalvation, who ſaves us from ſin, as well as from hell and the wrath to come, and deſtroys the devil and his works; he is the Seed of the woman that bruiſes the ſerpent's head, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, the Alpha and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He alone is the Shepherd and Biſhop of our ſouls: he is our Prophet, whom Moſes long ſince teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, ſaying, <q>A prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him ſhall ye hear in all things, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you:
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037441_0656_100D926F8CBC6BF8"/>and it ſhall come to paſs, that every ſoul that will not hear that prophet ſhall be deſtroyed from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</q> Acts ii. 22, 23. He is now come in Spirit, <q>and hath given us an underſtanding, that we know him that is true.</q> He rules in our hearts by his law of love and life, and makes us free from the law of ſin and death. We have no life, but by him; for he is the quickening Spirit, the ſecond Adam, the Lord from heaven, by whoſe blood we are cleanſed, and our conſciences ſprinkled from dead works, to ſerve the living God. He is our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who makes peace and reconciliation between God offended and us offending; he being the Oath of God, the new covenant of light, life, grace, and peace, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finiſher of our faith. This Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the heavenly man, the Emanuel, God with us, we all own and believe in; he whom the high-prieſt raged againſt, and ſaid, he had ſpoken blaſphemy; whom the prieſts and elders of the Jews took counſel together againſt, and put to death; the ſame whom Judas betrayed for thirty pieces of ſilver, which the prieſts gave him as a reward for his treaſon; who alſo gave large money to the ſoldiers to broach an horrible lie, namely, <q>That his diſciples came and ſtole him away by night whilſt they ſlept.</q> After he was riſen from the dead, the hiſtory of the Acts of the apoſtles ſets forth how the chief prieſts and elders perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the diſciples of this Jeſus, for preaching Chriſt and his reſurrection. This, we ſay, is that Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom we own to be our life and ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the holy ſcriptures, we believe they were given forth by the holy Spirit of God, through the holy men of God, who (as the ſcripture itſelf declares, 2 Pet. i. 21.) "ſpoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt." We believe they are to be read, believed, and fulfilled (he that fulfils them is Chriſt); and they are <q>profitable for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for correction and for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">

We believe the holy ſcriptures are the words of God; for it is ſaid in Exodes 20. 1. <q>God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying,</q> &amp;c. meaning the ten commandments given forth upon mount Sinai. And in Rev. xxii. 18. ſaith John, <q>I teſtify to every man that heareth the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of this book, if any man addeth unto theſe, and if
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:037441_0657_100D9271956F2EC0"/>any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy</q> (not the Word) &amp;c. So in Luke 1. 20. "Becauſe thou believeſt not my words." And in John v. 47. xv. 7. xiv. 23. xii. 47. So that we call the holy ſcriptures, as Chriſt, the apoſtles, and holy men of God called them, viz. the words of God.</p>
                        <p>Another ſlander they have caſt upon us, is, <q>That we teach the negroes to rebel:</q> a thing we utterly abhor in our hearts, the Lord knows it, who is the ſearcher of all hearts, and knows all things, and can teſtify for us, that this is a moſt abominable untruth. That which we have ſpoken to them, is To exhort and admoniſh them to be ſober, to fear God, to love their maſters and miſtreſſes, to be faithful and diligent in their ſervice and buſineſs, and then their maſters and overſeers would love them, and deal kindly and gently with them; alſo that they ſhould not beat their wives, nor the wives their huſbands; neither ſhould the men have many wives; that they ſhould not ſteal, nor be drunk, nor commit adultery, nor fornication, nor curſe, ſwear, nor lie, nor give bad words to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor to any one elſe; for there is ſomething in them that tells them they ſhould not practiſe theſe nor any other evils. But if they notwithſtanding ſhould do them, then we let them know there are but two ways, the one that leads to heaven, where the righteous go; and the other that leads to hell, where the wicked and debauched, whoremongers, adulterers, murderers, and liars go. To the one the Lord will ſay, <q>Come, ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</q> to the other, <q>Depart, ye curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</q> ſo the wicked go into <q>everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal,</q> Mat. xxv. Conſider, friends, it is no tranſgreſſion for a maſter of a family to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his family himſelf, or for others to do it in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; but rather it is a very great duty incumbent upon them. Abraham and Joſhua did ſo: of the firſt, the Lord ſaid, Gen. xviii. 19. <q>I know that Abraham will command his children, and his houſehold after him; and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham the things that he hath ſpoken of him.</q> And the latter ſaid, Joſh. xxiv. 15. <q>Chooſe ye this day whom ye will ſerve —But as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</q>

                  <p>This wicked ſlander (of our endeavouring to make the Negroes rebel) our adverſaries took occaſion to raiſe, from our having ſome meetings amongſt the Negroes; for we had ſeveral meetings with them in divers plantations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we exhorted them to juſtice, ſobriety, temperance, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and piety, and to be ſubject to their maſters and governors. Which was altogether contrary to what our envious adverſaries maliciouſly ſuggeſted againſt us.</p>
                  <p>As I had been to viſit the governor, as ſoon as I was well able, after I came thither; ſo when I was at Thomas Rouſe's, the governor came to ſee me, carrying himſelf very courteouſly.</p>

                  <p>I ſet ſail from Barbadoes to Jamaica the eighth of the eleventh month, 1671, Robert Widders, William Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Solomon Eccles, and Elizabeth Hooton going with me. Thomas Briggs and John Stubbs remained in Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; with whom were John Rouſe and William Baily. We had a quick and eaſy paſſage to Jamaica; where we met with James Lancaſter, John Cartwright, and George Pattiſon again, who had been labouring there in the ſervice of truth; into which we forthwith entered with them, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling up and down through the iſland, which is large; and a brave country it is, though the people are many of them debauched and wicked. We had much ſervice. There was a great convincement, and many received the truth; ſome of which were people of account in the world. We had many meetings there, which were large, and very quiet. The people were civil to us, ſo that not a mouth was opened againſt us. I was twice with the governor, and ſome other magiſtrates, who all carried themſelves kindly towards me.</p>
                  <p>About a week after we landed in Jamaica, Elizabeth Hooton, a woman of great age, who had travelled much in truth's ſervice, and ſuffered much for it, departed this life.
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:037441_0660_100D9277220A9D68"/>She was well the day before ſhe died; and departed in peace, like a lamb, bearing teſtimony to truth at her departure.</p>
                  <p>When we had been about ſeven weeks in Jamaica, had brought friends into pretty good order, and ſettled ſeveral meetings amongſt them, we left Solomon Eccles there; the reſt of as embarked for Maryland; leaving friends and truth proſperous in Jamaica, the Lord's power being over all, and his bleſſed Seed reigning.</p>
                  <p>Before I left Jamaica, I wrote another letter to my wife, as followeth:</p>

                        <p>TO whom is my love, and to the children, in that which changeth not, but is over all; and to all friends in thoſe parts. I have been at Jamaica about five weeks.

Sufferings in every place attend me; but the bleſſed Seed is over all: the great Lord be praiſed, who is Lord of ſea and land, and of all things therein.

                  <p>We went on board the 8th of the firſt month 1671-2; and having contrary winds, were a full week ſailing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and backwards, before we could get out of ſight of Jamaica. A difficult voyage this proved, and pretty dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, eſpecially in our paſſing through the gulph of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida, where we met with many winds and ſtorms. But the great God, who is Lord of ſea and land, and who rideth upon the wings of the wind, did by his power preſerve us through many and great dangers, when by extreme ſtreſs of weather our veſſel was divers times like to be overſet, and much of her tackling broken. And indeed we were ſenſible that the Lord was a God at hand, and that his ear was open to the ſupplications of his people. For when the winds were ſo ſtrong and boiſterous, and the ſtorms and tempeſts ſo great, that the ſailors knew not what to do, but let the ſhip go which way ſhe would; then did we pray unto the Lord; who did graciouſly hear and accept us, and did
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:037441_0661_100D9279784F0A00"/>calm the winds and ſeas, gave us ſeaſonable weather, and made us to rejoice in his ſalvation; bleſſed and praiſed be the holy name of the Lord, whoſe power hath dominion over all, and whom the winds and ſeas obey!</p>
                  <p>We were between ſix and ſeven weeks in this paſſage from Jamaica to Maryland. Some days before we came to land, after we had entered the bay of Patuxent river, a great ſtorm aroſe, which caſt a boat upon us for ſhelter; in which were divers men and women of account in the world. We took them in; but the boat was loſt, with five hundred pounds worth of goods in it, as they ſaid. They continued on board us ſeveral days, not having any means to get off; and we had a very good meeting with them in the ſhip. But proviſions grew ſhort, for they brought none in with them; and ours, by reaſon of the length of our voyage, were well nigh ſpent when they came to us: ſo that with their living upon it too, we had now little or none left. Whereupon George Pattiſon took a boat, and ventured his life to get to ſhore; the hazard was ſo great, that all but friends concluded he would be caſt away. Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bring him ſafe to land; and in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the friends of the place came to fetch us to land alſo, in a ſeaſonable time, for our proviſions were quite ſpent.</p>
                  <p>We partook alſo of another great deliverance in this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, through the good providence of the Lord, which we underſtood afterwards. When we were determined to come from Jamaica, we had our choice of two veſſels, both bound for the ſame coaſt. One was a frigate, the other a yacht. The maſter of the frigate, we thought, aſked unreaſonably for our paſſage; which made us agree with the maſter of the yacht, who offered to carry us ten ſhillings a piece cheaper than the other. We went on board the yacht, and the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate came out together with us, intending to be conſorts during the voyage; and for ſeveral days we ſailed together: but what with calms and contrary winds, we were in awhile ſeparated. After which, the frigate, loſing her way, fell among the Spaniards; by whom ſhe was plundered and robbed, and the maſter and mate made priſoners; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being retaken by the Engliſh, ſhe was ſent home to her owners in Virginia, Which when we came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we ſaw and admired the Providence of God, who preſerved us out of our enemies hands; and he that was covetous fell among the covetous.</p>
                  <p>Here we found Burneyate, intending ſhortly to ſail for
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:037441_0662_100D927B0D84A9B0"/>Old England; but upon our arrival he altered his purpoſe, and joined us in the Lord's ſervice. He had appointed a general meeting for all the friends in the province of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he might ſee them together, and take his leave of them, before he departed out of the country; and it was ſo ordered by the good providence of God, that we landed juſt time enough to reach that meeting; by which means we had a very ſeaſonable opportunity of taking the friends of the province together. A very large meeting this was, and held four days; to which, beſides friends, came many other people, divers of whom were of conſiderable quality in the world's account: for there were five or ſix juſtices of the peace, the ſpeaker of their aſſembly, one of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and others of note, who ſeemed well ſatisfied with the meeting. After the publick meetings were over, the men's and women's meetings began; wherein I opened to friends the ſevice thereof, to their great ſatisfaction. After this we went to the Cliffs, where another general meeting was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. We went ſome of the way by land, the reſt by water; and a ſtorm ariſing, our boat was run aground, in danger to be beaten to pieces, and the water came in upon us. I was in a great ſweat, having come very hot out of a meeting before, and now was wet with the water beſides: yet having faith in the divine power, I was preſerved from taking hurt, bleſſed be the Lord! To this meeting many came, who received the truth with reverence. We had alſo a men's meeting and a women's meeting. Moſt of the backſliders came in again; and ſeveral of thoſe meetings were eſtabliſhed for taking care of the affairs of the church.</p>
                  <p>After theſe two general meetings, we parted company, dividing ourſelves unto ſeveral coaſts, for the ſervice of truth. James Lancaſter and John Cartwright went by ſea for New-England; William Edmundſon and three friends more ſailed for Virginia, where things were much out of order; John Burnyeate, Robert Widders. George Pattiſon, and I, with ſeveral friends of the province, went over by boat to the eaſtern ſhore, and had a meeting there on the firſt-day; where many people received the truth with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and friends were greatly refreſhed. A very large and heavenly meeting it was. Several perſons of quality in that country were at it, two of whom were juſtices of the peace. It was upon me from the Lord to ſend to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian emperor and his kings, to come to that meeting; the emperor came, and was at the meeting; but his kings, lying
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:037441_0663_100D927D52A84A78"/>further off, could not reach thither time enough; yet they came after with their cockarooſes. I had in the evening two good opportunities with them; they heard the word of the Lord willingly, and confeſſed to it. <q>What I ſpoke to them. I deſired them to ſpeak to their people; and let them know, that God was raiſing up his tabernacle of witneſs in their wilderneſs-country, and was ſetting up his ſtandard and glorious enſign of righteouſneſs.</q> They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves very courteouſly and lovingly; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <q>Where the next meeting would be, and they would come to it.</q> Yet they ſaid, <q>They had a great debate with their council about their coming, before they came now.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day we began our journey by land to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England; a tedious journey through the woods and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, over bogs and great rivers. We took horſe at the head of Tredaven Creek, and travelled through the woods till we came a little above the head of Miles River; by which we paſſed, and rode to the head of Wye River; and ſo to the head of Cheſter River; where, making a fire, we took up our lodging in the woods. Next morning we travelled the woods till we came to Saſſafras River, which we went over in canoes (or Indian boats) cauſing our horſes to ſwim by. Then we rode to Bohemia River; where in like manner ſwimming our horſes, we ourſelves went over in canoes. We reſted a little at a plantation by the way, but not long, for we had thirty miles to ride that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, if we would reach a town; which we were willing to do, and therefore rode hard for it. I with ſome others, whoſe horſes were ſtrong, got to the town that night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly tired, and wet to the ſkin; but George Pattiſon and Robert Widders, being weaker-horſed, were obliged to lay in the woods that night alſo. The town we went to was a Dutch town, called Newcaſtle; whither Robert Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and George Pattiſon came to us next morning. We departed thence, and got over the river Delaware, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger of ſome of our lives. When we were over, we were troubled to procure guides; which were hard to get, and very chargeable. Then had we that wilderneſs country to paſs through, ſince called Weſt Jerſey, not then inhabited by Engliſh; ſo that we have travelled a whole day together without ſeeing man or woman, houſe or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place. Sometimes we lay in the woods by a fire, and ſometimes in the Indians wigwams or houſes. We came
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:037441_0664_100D927F527BDF60"/>one night to an Indian town, and lay at the king's houſe, who was a very pretty man. Both he and his wife received us very lovingly, and his attendants (ſuch as they were) were very reſpectful to us. They laid us mats to lie on; but proviſion was very ſhort with them, having caught but little that day. At another Indian town, where we ſtaid, the king came to us, and he could ſpeak ſome Engliſh. I ſpoke to him much, and alſo to his people; and they were very loving to us. At length we came to Middletown, an Engliſh plantation in Eaſt Jerſey; and there were ſome friends; but we could not ſtay to have a meeting at that time, being earneſtly preſſed in our ſpirits to get to the half-year's meeting of friends at Oyſter-Bay in Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland, which was near at hand. We went with a friend, Richard Hartſhorn, brother to Hugh Hartſhorn, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſterer in London, who received us gladly to his houſe, where we refreſhed ourſelves, and then he carried us and our horſes in his own beat over a great water, which held us moſt part of the day in getting over, and ſet us upon Long-Iſland. We got that evening to friends at Grave, ſend, with whom we tarried that night. Next day we got to Fluſhing. The day following we reached Oyſter-Bay; ſeveral friends both of Graveſend and Fluſhing accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. The half-year's meeting began next day, which laſted four days. The firſt and ſecond days we had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings for worſhip, to which people of all ſorts might and did come. On third-day were the men's and women's meetings, wherein the affairs of the church were taken care of. Here we met with ſome bad ſpirits, who were run out from truth into prejudice, contention, and oppoſition to the order of truth, and to friends therein. Theſe had been very troubleſome to friends in their meetings, there and there abouts formerly, and it is like would have been ſo now; but I would not ſuffer the ſervice of our men's and women's meetings to be interrupted and hindered by their cavils. I let them know, <q>if they had any thing to object againſt the order of truth which we were in, we would give them a meeting another day on purpoſe.</q> And indeed I labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more, and travelled the harder to get to this meeting, where it was expected many of theſe contentious people would be; becauſe I underſtood they had reflected much upon me when I was far from them. The men's and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meetings being over, on the fourth day we had a meeting with thoſe diſcontented people, to which as many
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:037441_0665_100D9281568DCDC0"/>of them as would did come, and as many friends as had a deſire were preſent alſo; and the Lord's power broke forth gloriouſly, to the confounding of the gainſayers. Then ſome, that had been chief in the miſchievous work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and oppoſition againſt the truth, began to fawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and caſt the blame upon others; but the deceitſul ſpirit was judged down and condemned, and the glorious truth of God was exalted and ſet over all; and they were all brought down and bowed under. Which was of great ſervice to truth, and great ſatisfaction and comfort to friends; glory to the Lord for ever!</p>
                  <p>After friends were gone to their ſeveral habitations, we ſtaid ſome days upon the iſland, had meetings in ſeveral parts thereof, and good ſervice for the Lord. When we were clear of the iſland, we returned to Oyſter-Bay, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a wind to carry us to Rhode-Iſland, computed to be about two hundred miles. As ſoon as the wind ſerved we ſet ſail, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rived in Rhode-Iſland the thirtieth of the third month; where we were gladly received by friends. We went to Nicholas Eaſton's who was governor of the iſland; where we lay, being weary with travelling. On firſt-day following we had a large meeting; to which the deputy-governor and ſeveral juſtices came, and were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with the truth. The week following, the yearly meeting for friends of New-England, and other colonies adjacent, was held in this iſland; to which, beſides many friends who lived in thoſe parts, came John Stubbs from Barbadoes, and James Lancaſter and John Cartwright from another way. This meeting laſted ſix days. The firſt four were ſpent in general publick meetings for worſhip; to which abundance of other people came. For having no prieſts in the iſland, and no reſtriction to any particular way of worſhip; and the governor and deputy-governor, with ſeveral juſtices of the peace, daily frequenting meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; it ſo encouraged the people, that they flocked in from all parts of the iſland. Very good ſervice we had amongſt them, and truth and good reception. I have rarely obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a people, in the ſtate wherein they ſtood, to hear with more attention, diligence, and affection, than generally they did, during the four days; which was alſo taken notice of by other friends. Theſe public meetings over, the men's meeting began, which was large, precious, and weighty. The day following was the women's meeting, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was large and very ſolemn. Theſe two meetings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:037441_0666_100D9283438371D0"/>for ordering the affairs of the church, many weighty things were opened, and communicated to them, by way of advice, information, and inſtruction in the ſervices relating thereunto; that all might be kept clean ſweet, and ſavoury amongſt them. In theſe, ſeveral men's and women's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for other parts were agreed and ſettled, to take care of the poor, and other affairs of the church, and to ſee that all who profeſs truth walk according to the glorious goſpel of God. When this great general meeting was ended, it was ſomewhat hard for friends to part; for the glorious power of the Lord, which was over all, and his bleſſed truth and life flowing amongſt them, had ſo knit and united them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they ſpent two days in taking leave one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the friends of the iſland; and then, being mightily filled with the preſence and power of the Lord, they went away with jovful hearts to their ſeveral habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the ſeveral colonies where they lived.</p>
                  <p>When friends had taken their leave one of another, we, who travelled amongſt them, diſperſed ourſelves into our ſeveral ſervices, as the Lord ordered us. John Burnyeate, John Cartwright, and George Pattiſon went into the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of New-England, in company with the friends that came from thence, to viſit the particular meetings there; whom John Stubbs and James Lancaſter intended to follow awhile after, in the ſame ſervice; but they were not yet clear of this iſland. Robert Widders and I ſtaid longer upon this iſland; finding ſervice ſtill here for the Lord, through the great openneſs, and the daily coming in of freſh people from other colonies, for ſome time, after the general meeting; ſo that we had many large and ſerviceable meetings among them.</p>
                  <p>During this time, a marriage was celebrated amongſt friends in this iſland, and we were preſent. It was at a friend's houſe, who had formerly been governor of the iſland: and three juſtices of the peace, with many others not in profeſſion with us, and friends alſo ſaid, They never ſaw ſuch a ſolemn aſſembly on ſuch an occaſion, ſo weighty a marriage, and ſo comely an order. Thus truth was ſet over all. This might ſerve for an example to others; for there were ſome preſent from many other places.</p>
                  <p>After this I had a great travail in ſpirit concerning the Ranters in thoſe parts, who had been rude at a meeting which I was not at. Wherefore I appointed a meeting amongſt them believing the Lord would give me power
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:037441_0667_100D92851790D258"/>over them; which he did, to his praiſe and glory, bleſſed be his name for ever! There were at this meeting many friends, and divers other people; ſome of whom were juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the peace, and officers, who were generally well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the truth. One, who had been a juſtice twenty years, was convinced, ſpoke highly of the truth, and more highly of me than is fit for me to mention or take notice of.</p>
                  <p>We had a meeting at Providence, which was very large, conſiſting of many ſorts of people: I had a great travail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſpirit, that it might be preſerved quiet, and that truth might be brought over the people, and might gain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and have place in them; for they were generally above the prieſts, in high notions; and ſome came on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſpute. But the Lord, whom we waited upon, was with us, his power went over them all; and his bleſſed Seed was exalted and ſet above all. The diſputers were ſilent, and the meeting quiet, and ended well; praiſed be the Lord! The people went away mightily ſatisfied, much deſiring another meeting. This place (called Providence) was about thirty miles from Rhode-Iſland; we went to it by water. The governor of Rhode-Iſland, and many others, went with me thither; and we had the meeting in a great barn, which was thronged with people, ſo that I was exceeding hot, and in a great ſweat; but all was well; the glorious power of the Lord ſhined over all, glory to the great God for ever!</p>
                  <p>After this we went to Narraganſet, about twenty miles from Rhode-Iſland; and the governor went with us. We had a meeting at a juſtice's, where friends never had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The meeting was very large, for the country general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came in; and people from Connecticut, and other parts round about. There were four juſtices of peace. Moſt of theſe people were ſuch as had never heard friends before; but they were mightily affected, and a great deſire there is after the truth amongſt them. So that meeting was of very good ſervice; bleſſed be the Lord for ever! The juſtice, at whoſe houſe it was, and another juſtice of that country, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to come again; but I was then clear of thoſe parts, and was going towards Shelter-iſland. John Burnyeate and John Cartwright, being come out of New-England in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rhode-Iſland before I was gone, I laid this place before them, and they felt drawings thither, and went to viſit them. At another place, I heard ſome of the magiſtrates ſaid among themſelves, <q>If they had money enough, they would hire
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:037441_0668_100D928771B86C90"/>me to be their miniſter.</q> This was, where they did not well underſtand us, and our principles: but when I heard of it, I ſaid, <q>It was time for me to be gone; for if their eye was ſo much to me, or any of us, they would not come to their own teacher.</q> For this thing (hiring miniſters) had ſpoiled many, by hindering them from improving their own talents; whereas our labour is, to bring every one to their own teacher in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I went from hence towards Shelter-Iſland, having with me Robert Widders, James Lancaſter, George Partiſon, and John Jay, a planter in Barbadoes. We went off in a ſloop; and paſſing by Point Juda and Block-Iſland, we came to Fiſhers-Iſland, where at night we went on ſhore, but were not able to ſtay for the muſquetoes (a ſort of gnats, or little flies) which abound there, and are very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Wherefore we went into our ſloop again, put off from the ſhore, caſt anchor, and lay in our ſloop that night. Next day we went into the Sound, but finding our ſloop was not able to live in that water, we returned again, and came to anchor before Fiſhers-Iſland, where we lay in our ſloop that night alſo. There fell abundance of rain, and our ſloop being open, we were exceeding wet. Next day we paſſed over the waters called the Two Horſe Races, and then by Garner's-iſland; after which we paſſed by Gull's-iſland, and got at length to Shelter-iſland, which though it was but about twenty-ſeven leagues from Rhode-iſland, through the difficulty of paſſage, we were three days in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thither. The day after, being firſt-day, we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. In the ſame week, I had a meeting among the Indians, at which were their king, with his council, and about an hundred Indians more. They ſat down like friends, and heard very attentively, while I ſpoke to them by an interpreter, an Indian that could ſpeak Engliſh well. After the meeting they appeared very loving, and confeſſed what was ſaid to them was truth. The next firſt-day we had a great meeting on the iſland, to which many people came who had never heard friends before. They were well ſatisfied with the meeting, and would not go away when it was done till they had ſpoke with me. I went amongſt them, and found they were much taken with the truth; good deſires were raiſed in them, and great love. Bleſſed be the Lord, his name ſpreads, and will be great among the nations, and dreadful among the heathen.</p>
                  <p>White we were in Shelter-iſland, William Edmundſon
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:037441_0669_100D9289844FA728"/>came to us, who had been labouring in the work of the Lord in Virginia. From whence he travelled through the Deſert-country, through difficulties and many trials, till he came to Roan-oak, where he met with a tender people. After ſeven weeks ſervice in thoſe parts, ſailing to Maryland, and ſo to New-York, he came from thence to Long-iſland; where we met with him, and were very glad to hear from him the good ſervice he had for the Lord in the ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he had travelled ſince he parted from us.</p>
                  <p>We ſtaid not long in Shelter-iſland, but entering our ſloop again, put to ſea for Long-iſland. We had a very rough paſſage; the tide run ſo ſtrong for ſeveral hours, that I have not ſeen the like; and being againſt us, we could hardly get forward though we had a gale. We were upon the water all that day and the night following, but found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves next day driven back near Fiſher's-iſland. For there was a great fog, and towards day it was very dark, ſo that we could not ſee what way we made. Beſides, it rained much in the night, which in our open ſloop made us very wet. Next day a great ſtorm aroſe, ſo that we were fain to go over the Sound, and did get over with much ado. We paſſed by Faulcon-iſland, and came to the Main, where we caſt anchor till the ſtorm was over. Then we croſſed the Sound, all very wet, and much difficulty we had to get to land, the wind being ſtrong againſt us. But bleſſed be the Lord God of heaven and earth, and of the ſeas and waters, all was well. We got ſafe to Oyſter-bay in Long-Iſland, the ſeventh of the ſixth month, very early in the morning, which, they ſay, is about two hundred miles from Rhode-Iſland. At Oyſter-bay we had a very large meeting. The ſame day James Lancaſter and Chriſtopher Holder went over the bay to Rye, on the continent, in governor Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp's government, and had a meeting there. From Oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay we paſſed about thirty miles to Fluſhing, where we had a very large meeting, many hundreds of people being there; ſome of whom came about thirty miles to it. A glorious and heavenly meeting it was (praiſed be the Lord God!) and the people were much ſatisfied. Meanwhile Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Holder and ſome other friends went to a town in Long-Iſland, called Jamaica, and had a meeting there. We paſſed from Fluſhing to Graveſend, about twenty miles, and there had three precious meetings; to which many would have come from New-York, but that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindered them. Being clear of this place, we hired a
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:037441_0670_100D928B77473308"/>ſloop, and, the wind ſerving, ſet out for the new country now called Jerſey. Paſſing down the bay by Conny-iſland, Natton-iſland, and Stratton-iſland, we came to Richard Hartſhorn's at Middletown-harbour, about break of day, the twenty-ſeventh of the ſixth month. Next day we rode about thirty miles into that country, through the woods, and over very bad bogs, one worſe than all the reſt; the deſcent into which was ſo ſteep that we were fain to ſlide down with our horſes, and then let them lie and breathe themſelves before they could go on. This place the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the country called Purgatory. We got at length to Shrewſbury, in Eaſt-Jerſey, and on firſt-day had a precious meeting there; to which friends and other people came far, and the bleſſed preſence of the Lord was with us. The ſame week we had a men's and women's meeting out of moſt parts of New-Jerſey. They are building a meeting-place in the midſt of them, and there is a monthly and general meeting ſet up, which will be of great ſervice in thoſe parts, in <q>keeping up the goſpel-order, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt Jeſus (of the increaſe of which there is no end) that they who are faithful may ſee that all who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the holy truth live in the pure religion, and walk as 'becometh the goſpel.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>While we were at Shrewſbury, an accident beſel, which for the time was a great exerciſe to us; John Jay, a friend of Barbadoes, who came with us from Rhode-Iſland, and intended to accompany us through the Woods to Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being to try a horſe, got upon his back, and the horſe fell a running, caſt him down upon his head, and broke his neck, as the people ſaid. Thoſe that were near him took him up as dead, carried him a good way, and laid him on a tree. I got to him as ſoon as I could; and, feeling him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he was dead. As I ſtood pitying him and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, I took hold of his hair, and his head turned any way, his neck was ſo limber. Whereupon I took his head in both my hands, and ſetting my knees againſt the tree, I raiſed his head, and perceived there was nothing out or broken that way. Then I put one hand under his chin, and the other behind his head, and raiſed his head two or three times with all my ſtrength, and brought it in. I ſoon perceived his neck began to grow ſtiff again, and then he began to rattle in his throat, and quickly after to breathe. The people were amazed; but I bade them have a good heart, be of good faith, and carry him into the houſe. They
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:037441_0671_100D928D0C22E730"/>did ſo, and ſet him by the fire. I bid them get him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing warm to drink, and put him to bed. After he had been in the houſe awhile, he began to ſpeak; but did not know where he had been. The next day we paſſed away (and he with us, pretty well) about ſixteen miles, to a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Middletown, through woods and bogs, and over a river; where we ſwam our horſes, and got over ourſelves upon a hollow tree. Many hundred miles did he travel with us after this.</p>
                  <p>To this meeting came moſt of the people of the town. A glorious meeting we had, and the truth was over all; bleſſed be the great Lord God for ever! After the meeting we went to Middle-town-harbour, about five miles, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take our long journey next morning, through the woods towards Maryland, having hired Indians for our guides. I determined to paſs through the woods, on the other ſide of Delaware-bay, that we might head the creeks and rivers as much as poſſible. The ninth of the ſeventh month we ſet forward, paſſed through many Indian towns, and over ſome rivers and bogs. When we had rid about forty miles, we made a fire at night, and lay by it. As we came among the Indians, we declared the day of the Lord to them. Next day we travelled fifty miles, as we comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and at night finding an old houſe, which the Indians had forced the people to leave, we made a fire, and lay there, at the head of Delaware-bay. The next day we ſwam our horſes over a river about a mile, at twice, firſt to an iſland called Upper-Dinidock, and then to the main land, having hired Indians to help us over in their canoes. This day we could reach but about thirty miles, and came to a Swede's houſe, where we got a little ſtraw, and lay that night. Next day, having hired another guide, we travelled about forty miles through the woods, and made a fire at night, by which we lay, and dried ourſelves; for we were often wet in our travels. Next day we paſſed over a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate river, which had in it many rocks and broad ſtones, very hazardous to us and our horſes. From thence we came to Chriſtian-river, where we ſwam our horſes over, and went ourſelves in canoes; but the ſides of the river were ſo miry, that ſome of the horſes had like to have been laid up. From thence we came to New-Caſtle, heretofore called New-Amſterdam; and being very weary, and inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the town where we might buy ſome corn for our horſes, the governor came and invited me to his houſe, and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:037441_0672_100D928F15E51E28"/>afterwards deſired me to lodge there; telling me, he had a bed for me, and I ſhould be welcome. So I ſtaid, the other friends being taken care of alſo. This was on a ſeventh day, and he offering his houſe for a meeting, we had the next day a pretty large one; for moſt of the town were at it. Here had never been a mecting before, nor any within a great way; but this was a very precious one, many were tender, and confeſſed to the truth, and ſome received it; bleſſed be the Lord for ever!</p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth of the ſeventh month we ſet forward, and travelled, as near as we could compute, about fifty miles, through the woods and over the bogs, heading Bohemia-river and Saſſafras-river. At night we made a fire in the woods, and lay there all night. It being rainy weather, we got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome thick trees for ſhelter, and afterwards dried our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again by the fire. Next day we waded through Cheſter-river, a very broad water, and afterwards paſſing through many bad bogs, lay that night alſo in the woods by a fire, not having gone above thirty miles that day. The day following we travelled hard, though we had ſome troubleſome bogs in our way; we rode about fifty miles, and got ſafe that night to Robert Harwood's, at Miles-river in Maryland. This was the eighteenth of the ſeventh month; and though we were very weary, and much dirtied with the bogs, yet hearing of a meeting next day, we went to it, and from it to John Edmundſon's; from whence we went three or four miles by water to a meeting on the firſt-day following. Here was a judge's wife, who had never been at any of our meetings before, who was reached, and ſaid after the meeting, <q>She had rather hear us once, than the prieſts a thouſand times.</q> Many others alſo were well ſatisfied; for the power of the Lord was eminently with us. Bleſſed for ever be his holy name! We paſſed from thence about twenty-two miles, and had a good meeting upon the Kentiſh ſhore, to which one of the judges came. After ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good meeting hard-by at William Wilcock's, where we had good ſervice for the Lord, we went by water about twenty miles to a very large meeting, where were ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people, and four juſtices of peace, the high-ſheriff of Delaware, and others from thence; there was an Indian emperor or governor, and two others of the chief men among the Indians. With theſe Indians I had a good opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I ſpoke to them by an interpreter: they heard the truth attentively; and were very loving. A bleſſed meeting
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:037441_0673_100D9291D0064F68"/>this was, of great ſervice both for convincing, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the truth thoſe that were convinced of it. Bleſſed be the Lord, who cauſeth his bleſſed truth to ſpread! After the meeting a woman came to me, whoſe huſband was one of the judges of that country, and a member of the aſſembly there. She told me, <q>Her huſband was ſick, not likely to live, and deſired me to go home with her to ſee him.</q> It was three miles to her houſe, and I being juſt come hot out of the meeting, it was hard for me then to go; yet conſidering the ſervice, I got an horſe, went with her, viſited her huſband, and ſpoke what the Lord gave me to him. The man was much refreſhed, and finely raiſed up by the power of the Lord; and afterwards came to our meetings. I went back to the friends that night, and next day we departed thence about nineteen or twenty miles to Tredhaven-creek, to John Edmundſon's again; from whence, the third of the eighth month, we went to the general meeting for all Maryland friends.</p>
                  <p>This meeting held five days. The firſt three we had meetings for publick worſhip, to which people of all ſorts came; the other two were ſpent in the men's and women's meetings. To thoſe publick meetings came many Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of divers ſorts, and ſome Papiſts; amongſt whom were ſeveral magiſtrates and their wives, with other perſons of chief account in the country. Of the common people, it was thought there were ſometimes a thouſand at one of thoſe meetings; ſo that though they had enlarged their meeting-place, and made it as big again as it was before, it could not contain the people. I went by boat every day four or five miles to the meeting, and there were ſo many boats at that time paſſing upon the river, that it was almoſt like the Thames. The people ſaid, <q>There were never ſo many boats ſeen there together before;</q> and one of the juſtices ſaid, <q>He never ſaw ſo many people together in that country.</q> It was a very heavenly meeting, wherein the preſence of the Lord was gloriouſly manifeſted, friends were ſweetly refreſhed, the people generally ſatisfied, and many convinced; for the bleſſed power of the Lord was over all: everlaſting praiſes to his holy name for ever! Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the publick meetings were over, the men's and women's began, and were held the other two days; for I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to impart to them, which concerned the glory of God, the order of the goſpel, and the government of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. When theſe meetings were over, we took our leave of
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:037441_0674_100D929361B739C0"/>friends in thoſe parts, whom we left well eſtabliſhed in the truth. The tenth of the eighth month we went about thirty miles by water, paſſing by Cranes-iſland, Swan-iſland, and Kent-iſland, in very foul weather and much rain; whereby, our boat being open, we were not only very much wetted, but in great danger of being overſet; inſomuch that ſome thought we could not have eſcaped being caſt away, till they ſaw us come to ſhore next morning. But bleſſed be God, we were very well. Having got to a little houſe, dried our cloaths by the fire; and refreſhed ourſelves a little, we took to our boat again, and put off from land, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſailing, and ſometimes rowing; but having very foul weather, we could not get above twelve miles forward. At night we got to land, made us a ſire, by which ſome lay, and others by a ſire at a houſe a little way off. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we paſſed over the Great-bay, and ſailed about forty miles that day. Making to ſhore at night, we lay there, ſome in the boat, and ſome at an alehouſe. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being firſt-day, we went ſix or ſeven miles to a friend's houſe, a juſtice of the peace; where we had a meeting. This was a little above the head of the Great-bay. We were almoſt four days upon water, weary with rowing, yet all was very well; bleſſed and praiſed be the Lord! We went next day to another friend's over the head of Hatton's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſland, where we had good ſervice; as we had alſo the day following at George Wilſon's, a friend, that lived about three miles further, where we had a very precious meeting, there being great tenderneſs amongſt the people.</p>
                  <p>After this we ſailed about ten miles to James Frizby's, a juſtice of peace; where, the ſixteenth of the eighth month, we had a very large meeting, at which, beſides friends, were ſome hundreds of people, as it was ſuppoſed. Amongſt them were ſeveral juſtices, captains, and the ſheriff, with other perſons of note. A bleſſed heavenly meeting this was; a powerful, thundering teſtimony for truth was borne therein; a great ſenſe there was upon the people, and much brokenneſs and tenderneſs amongſt them. We ſtaid till about the eleventh hour in the night, that the tide turned for us; then taking boat, we paſſed that night and the next day about fifty miles to another; friend's houſe. The two next days we made ſhort journies, viſiting friends. The twentieth we had a great meeting at a place called Severn, where there was a meeting-place, but not large enough to hold the people. Divers chief magiſtrates were at it, with
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037441_0675_100D9294F40D7468"/>many other conſiderable people, and it gave them generally great ſatisfaction. Two days after we had a meeting with ſome that walked diſorderly, and had good ſervice in it. Then ſpending a day or two in viſiting friends, we paſſed to the Weſtern-ſhore, and the twenty-fifth had a large and precious meeting at William Coale's, where the ſpeaker of their aſſembly, with his wife, a juſtice of peace, and ſeveral people of quality, were preſent. Next day we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſix or ſeven miles further, at Abraham Birkhead's, where many of the magiſtrates and upper ſort were; and the ſpeaker of the aſſembly for that country was convinced. A bleſſed meeting it was; praiſed be the Lord! We tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled next day; and the day following, the twenty-eighth, of the eighth month, had a large and very precious meeting at Peter Sharp's, on the Clifts, between thirty and forty miles diſtant from the former. Many of the magiſtrates and upper rank of people were preſent, and a heavenly meeting it was. One of the governor's council's wives was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; and her huſband was very loving to friends. A juſtice of peace from Virginia was convinced, and hath a meeting ſince at his houſe. Some Papiſts were at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of whom threatened, before he came, to diſpute with me; but he was reached, and could not oppoſe. Bleſſed be the Lord, the truth reached into the hearts of people beyond words, and it is of a good ſavour amongſt them! After the meeting we went about eighteen miles to James Preſton's, a friend that lived on Patuxent River. Thither came an Indian king, with his brother, to whom I ſpoke, and I found they underſtood the thing I ſpoke of. Having finiſhed our ſervice in Maryland, and intending for Virginia, we had a meeting at Patuxent the fourth of the ninth month, to take our leave of friends. Many people of all ſorts were at it, and a powerful meeting it was.</p>
                  <p>The fifth of the ninth month we ſet ſail for Virginia, and in three days came to Nancemum, about two hundred miles from Maryland. In this voyage we met with foul weather, ſtorms, and rain, and lay in the woods by a fire in the night. Here lived a friend, called the widow Wright. Next day we had a great meeting at Nancemum, of friends and others. There came to this meeting colonel Dewes, with ſeveral other officers and magiſtrates, who were much taken with the declaration of truth. After the meeting, we haſtened towards Carolina; yet had ſeveral meetings by the way, wherein we had good ſervice for the Lord: one about
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037441_0676_100D929773117C80"/>four miles from Nancemum Water, which was very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and there was a men's and a women's meeting ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, for the affairs of the church. Another very good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had at William Yarrow's, at Pagan Creek; which was ſo large that we were fain to be abroad, the houſe not being big enough to contain the people. A great openneſs there was, the ſound of truth ſpread abroad, and had a good ſavour in the hearts of people: the Lord have the glory for ever!</p>
                  <p>After this, our way to Carolina grew worſe, being much of it plaſhy, and pretty full of great bogs and ſwamps; ſo that we were commonly wet to the knees, and lay abroad a-nights in the woods by a fire: ſaving one of the nights we got to a poor houſe at Sommertown, and lay by the fire. The woman of the houſe had a ſenſe of God upon her. The report of our travel had reached thither, and drawn ſome that lived beyond Sommertown to that houſe, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to have ſeen and heard us; but they miſſed us. Next day, the twenty-firſt of the ninth month, having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled hard through the woods, and over many bogs and ſwamps, we reached Bonner's Creek; there we lay that night by the fire-ſide the woman lending us a mat to lie on.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt houſe we came to in Carolina: here we left our horſes, over-wearied with travel. From hence we went down the creek in a canoe to Macocomocock Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and came to Hugh Smith's where people of other profeſſions came to ſee us (no friends inhabiting that part of the country) and many of them received us gladly. Amongſt others, came Nathaniel Batts, who had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Roanoak. He went by the name of captain Batts, and had been a rude, deſperate man. He aſked me about a woman in Cumberland, who, he ſaid, he was told, had been healed by our prayers and laying on of hands, after ſhe had been long ſick, and given over by the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: he deſired to know the certainty of it. I told him, we did not glory in ſuch things, but many ſuch things had been done by the power of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Not far from hence we had a meeting among the people, and they were taken with the truth; bleſſed be the Lord! Then paſſing down the river Maratick in a canoe, we went down the bay Connie-oak, to a captain's, who was loving to us, and lent us his boat (for we were much wetted in the canoe, the water flaſhing in upon us.) With this boat we went to the governor's; but the water in ſome places was
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:037441_0677_100D929BB7251890"/>ſo ſhallow, that the boat, being loaden, could not ſwim; ſo that we put off our ſhoes and ſtockings, and waded through the water a pretty way. The governor, with his wife, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us lovingly; but a doctor there would needs diſpute with us. And truly his oppoſing us was of good ſervice, giving occaſion for the opening of many things to the people concerning the Light and Spirit of God, which he denied to be in every one; and affirmed it was not in the Indians. Whereupon I called an Indian to us, and aſked him, <q>Whether or no, when he did lie, or do wrong to any one, there was not ſomething in him that did reprove him for it?</q> He ſaid, <q>There was ſuch a thing in him, that did ſo reprove him; and he was aſhamed when he had done wrong, or ſpoken wrong.</q> So we ſhamed the doctor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the governor and people; inſomuch that the poor man ran out ſo far, that at length he would not own the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We tarried at the governor's that night; and next morning he very courteouſly walked with us himſelf about two miles through the woods, to a place whither he had ſent our boat about to meet us. Taking leave of him, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered our boat, and went about thirty miles to Joſeph Scot's, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Wherefore at an houſe about four miles further, we had another meeting; to which the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's ſecretary came, who was chief ſecretary of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and had been formerly convinced.</p>
                  <p>I went from this place among the Indians, and ſpoke to them by an interpreter, ſhewing them, <q>That God made all things in ſix days, and made but one woman for one man; and that God did drown the old world becauſe of their wickedneſs. Afterwards I ſpoke to them concerning Chriſt, ſhewing them, that he died for all men, for their ſins, as well as for others; and had enlightened them as well as others; and that if they did that which was evil he would burn them; but if they did well they ſhould not be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> There was among them their young king and others of their chief men, who ſeemed to receive kindly what I ſaid to them.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited the north part of Carolina, and made a little entrance for truth upon the people there, we began to return again towards Virginia, having ſeveral meetings in our way, wherein we had good ſervice for the Lord, the people being generally tender and open; bleſſed be the

But the ſecretary's wife, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſtrait, came herſelf in a canoe (her huſband be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In our return we had a very precious meeting at Hugh Smith's; praiſed be the Lord for ever! The people were very tender, and very good ſervice we had amongſt them. There was at this meeting an Indian captain, who was very loving; and acknowledged it to be truth that was ſpoken. There was alſo one of the Indian prieſt, whom they called a Pauwaw, who ſat ſoberly among the people. The ninth of the tenth month we got back <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Next day we had a tedious journey through bogs and ſwamps, and were exceeding wet and dirty all the day, but dried ourſelves at night by a fire. We got that night to Sommertown. When we came near the houſe, the woman of the houſe ſeeing us, ſpoke to her ſon to keep up their dogs (for both in Virginia and Carolina they generally keep great dogs to guard their houſes, living lonely in the woods) but the ſon ſaid, <q>He need not, for their dogs did not uſe to meddle with theſe people.</q> Whereupon, when we were come into the houſe, ſhe told us. <q>We were like the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, whom the dogs did not move their tongues againſt.</q> Here we lay in our cloaths by the fire, as we had done many a night before. Next day we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the people, having been informed of us, had a great deſire to hear us; and a very good meeting we had among them, where we never had one before: praiſed be the Lord for ever! After the meeting we haſted away. When we had rid about twenty miles, calling at a houſe to enquire the way, the people deſired us to tarry all night with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> we had travelled about an hundred miles from Caroline into Virginia: in which time we obſerved great variety of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:037441_0679_100D929FD208DDF8"/>having paſſed in a few days from a very cold to a warm and ſpring-like country. But the power of the Lord is the ſame in all; is over all, and doth reach the good in all; praiſed be the Lord for ever!</p>
                  <p>We ſpent about three weeks in travelling through Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia moſtly amongſt friends, having large and precious meetings in ſeveral parts of the country; as at the widow Wright's, where many of the magiſtrates, officers, and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh people came. A moſt heavenly meeting we had; wherein the power of the Lord was ſo great, that it ſtruck a dread upon the aſſembly, chained all down, and brought reverence upon the people's minds. Among the officers was a major, kinſman to the prieſt, who told me, <q>The prieſt threatened to come and oppoſe us.</q> But the Lord's power was too ſtrong for him, and ſtopped him, and we were quiet and peaceable. The people were wonderfully affected with the teſtimony of truth; bleſſed be the Lord for ever! Another very good meeting we had at Cricka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trough, at which many conſiderable people were, who had never heard a friend before; and they were greatly ſatisfied, praiſed be the Lord! We had alſo a very good and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable meeting at John Porter's, which conſiſted moſtly of other people, in which the power of the Lord was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeen and felt, and it brought the truth over all the bad walkers and talkers; bleſſed be the Lord! Divers other meetings we had, and many opportunities of ſervice for the Lord amongſt the people where we came. The laſt week that we ſtaid we ſpent ſome time and pains among friends, ſweeping away that which was to be ſwept out, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a bad ſpirit that was got up in ſome: and bleſſed for ever be the name of the Lord! he it is that gives victory over all.</p>
                  <p>Having ſiniſhed what ſervice lay upon us at Virginia, the thirtieth of the tenth month we ſet ſail in an open ſloop for Maryland. But having a great ſtorm, and being much wetted, we were glad to get to ſhore before night; and, walking to an houſe at Willoughby-Point, we got lodging there that night. The woman of the houſe was a widow, a very tender perſon. She had never received friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but ſhe received us very kindly, with tears in her eyes. We returned to our boat in the morning, and hoiſied ſail, getting forward as faſt as we could; but towards evening a ſtorm riſing, the wind being high, we had much ado to get to ſhore; and our boat being open, the water ſtaſhed often
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:037441_0680_100D92A36A70C6D0"/>in, and ſometimes over us, ſo that we were ſufficiently wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Being got to land, we made a fire in the woods, to warm and dry us; and there we lay all that night, the wolves howling about us. The firſt of the eleventh month we ſailed again, but the wind being againſt us, we made but little way; and were fain to get to ſhore at Point-Comfort, where yet we found but ſmall comfort; for the weather was ſo cold, that though we made a good fire in the woods to lie by, our water that we had got for uſe was frozen near the fire-ſide. We made to ſea next day; but the wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong againſt us, we advanced but little; and were glad to get to land again, and travel about to find ſome houſe where we might buy proviſions, for our ſtore was ſpent. That night alſo we lay in the woods; ſo extreme cold was the weather, the wind blowing high, and the froſt and ſnow great, that it was hard for ſome to abide it. The third of the eleventh month, the wind ſetting pretty fair, we fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up by ſailing and rowing, and got to Milford-Haven, where we lay at Richard Long's near Quince's-Iſland. Next day we paſſed by Rappahannock-river, where dwell much people; and friends had a meeting there-away at a juſtice's, who had formerly been at a meeting where I was. We paſſed over Powtomack-river alſo, the winds being high, the water very rough, the weather extreme cold; and having a meeting there-away, ſome were convinced; and when we parted thence, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About the firſt hour in the morning we reached James Preſton's on Patuxent-river, which is accounted about two hundred miles from Nancemum in Virginia. We were very weary; yet the next day, being the firſt of the week, we went to the meeting not far from thence. The ſame week we went to an Indian king's cabin, where ſeveral Indians were, with whom we had a pretty opportunity to diſcourſe, and they carried themſelves very lovingly. We went alſo that week to a general meeting; from thence about eight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

After this the cold grew ſo exceeding ſharp, ſuch extreme froſt and ſnowy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beyond what was uſual in that country, that we could hardly endure to be in it. Neither was it eaſy or ſafe to ſtir abroad: yet we got with ſome difficulty ſix miles through the ſnow to John Mayor's, where we met with ſome friends
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:037441_0681_100D92A654486DB8"/>that were come from New-England, whom we had left there when we came away; and glad we were to ſee each other, after ſuch long and tedious travels. By theſe friends we underſtood William Edmundſon, having been at Rhode-Iſland and New-England, was gone from thence for Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; that Solomon Eccles coming from Jamaica, and landing at Boſton in New-England, was taken at a meeting there, and baniſhed to Barbado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, that John Stubbs and another friend were gone into New-Jerſey, and ſeveral other friends to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the Leeward Iſlands. It was matter of joy to us to underſtand the work of the Lord went on and proſpered, and that friends were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied and diligent in the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-ſeventh of the eleventh month we had a very precious meeting in a tobacco-houſe. The next day we returned to James Preſton's, about eighteen miles diſtant. When we came there, we found his houſe was burnt down to the ground the night before, through the careleſſneſs of a maid ſervant; ſo we lay three nights on the ground by the fire, the weather being very cold. We made an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was ſomewhat ſtrange, but certainly true; that one day in the midſt of this cold weather, the wind turning into the ſouth, it grew ſo hot, that we could hardly bear the heat; and the next day and night, the wind chopping back into the north, we could hardly endure the cold.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond of the twelfth month we had a glorious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Patuxent; and after it went to John Geary's again, where we waited for a boat to carry us to the monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Clifts; to which we went, and a living meeting it was; praiſed be the Lord! This was on the ſixth of the twelfth month. Another meeting we had on the ninth, wherein the glory of the Lord ſhined over all; bleſſed and magnified be his holy name for ever!</p>
                  <p>The twelfth of the twelfth month we ſet forward in our boat, and, travelling by night, we run our boat on ground in a creek near Manaco River. There we were fain to ſtay till morning, that the tide came and lifted her off. In the meantime ſitting in an open boat, and the weather being bitter cold, ſome had like to have loſt the uſe of their hands, they were ſo frozen and benumbed. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the tide ſet our boat a-float, we got to land, and made a good fire, at which we warmed ourſelves well, and then took boat and paſſed about ten miles farther to a friend's houſe, where next day we had a very precious
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037441_0682_100D92A7E4CC22B0"/>meeting, at which ſome of the chief of the place were. I went after the meeting to a friend's about four miles off, at the head of Anameſſy River, where the day following the judge of the country and a juſtice with him came to me, and were very loving, and much ſatisfied with friends or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The next day we had a large meeting at the juſtice's in his barn, for his houſe could not hold the company. There were ſeveral of the great folks of that country, and among the reſt an oppoſer; but all was preſerved quiet and well. A precious meeting it was; the people were much affected with the truth; bleſſed be the Lord! We went next day to ſee captain Colburn, a juſtice of peace, and there we had ſome ſervice. Then returning again, we had a very glorious meeting at the juſtices where we met before, to which came many people of account in the world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, officers, and others. It was a large meeting, and the power of the Lord was much felt, ſo that the people were generally well ſatisfied and taken with the truth; and there being ſeveral merchants and maſters of ſhips from New-England, the truth was ſpread abroad; bleſſed be the Lord!</p>
                  <p>A day or two after we travelled about ſixteen miler through the woods and bogs heading Anameſſy River and Amoroca River, part of which we went over in a canoe, and came to Manaoke, to a friendly woman's houſe, where on the twenty-fourth of the twelfth month we had a large meeting in a barn. The Lord's living preſence was with us and among the people; bleſſed be his holy name for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more! Friends never had a meeting in thoſe parts before. After this, we paſſed over the river Wicocomaco, and through many bad watery ſwamps and marſhy way, and came to James Jones's, a friend and a juſtice of the peace, where we had a large and very glorious meeting; praiſed be the Lord God! Then paſſing over the water in a boat, we took horſe, and travelled about twenty-four miles through woods and troubleſome ſwamps, and came to another juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice's houſe, where we had a very large meeting much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and many of conſiderable account being preſent; and the living preſence of the Lord was amongſt us; praiſed for ever be his holy name! This was the third of the firſt month 1672-3. The fifth of the ſame we had another living and heavenly meeting, at which divers juſtices with their wives and many others were; amongſt whom we had very good ſervice for the Lord; bleſſed be his holy name!
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:037441_0683_100D92AA335EECB8"/>At this meeting was a woman that lived at Anameſſy, who had been many years in trouble of mind, and ſometimes would ſit moping near two months together, and hardly ſpeak or mind any thing. When I heard of her, I was moved of the Lord to go to her, and tell her, <q>That ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was come to her houſe.</q> After I had ſpoken the word of life to her, and intreated the Lord for her, ſhe mended, went up and down with us to meetings, and is ſince well bleſſed be the Lord!</p>
                  <p>We left Anameſſy the ſeventh of the firſt month; and paſſing by water about fifty miles, came to a friendly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's houſ at Hunger River. We had very rough wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our paſſage to this place, and were in great danger, for the boat had like to have been turned over. But through the good providence of God we got ſafe thither; praiſed be hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> name! At this place we had a meeting. Amongſt the people were two Papiſts, a man and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the man was very tender, and the woman confeſſed to the truth. I had no friend with me but Robert Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the reſt having diſperſed themſelves into ſeveral parts of the country in the ſervice of truth.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the wind would permit, we paſſed from hence about forty miles by water, rowing moſt part of the way, and came to the head of Little Choptanck River, to Dr. Winſmore's, a juſtice of peace, lately convinced. Here we met with ſome friends, with whom we ſtaid awhile, and then went on by land and water, and had a large meeting abroad, for the houſe we were at could not receive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Divers of the magiſtrates and their wives were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and a good meeting it was; bleſſed be the Lord, who is making his name known in that wilderneſs country! We went from thence to William Stephens's, where we met with thoſe friends that had been travelling in other parts; and were much refreſhed in the Lord together, when we imparted to each other the good ſucceſs we had in the Lord's work, and the proſperity and ſpreading of truth in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where we travelled. John Cartwright and another friend had been at irginia, where were great deſires in people after the truth; and being now returned, they ſtaid a little with us here, and then ſet forward for Barbadoes. Before we left this place, we had a very glorious meeting, at which were many people; amongſt others, the judge of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, three juſtices of the peace, and the high-ſheriff, with their wives. Of the Indians, was one called their emperor,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:037441_0684_100D92ACD7D5CE80"/>an Indian king, and their ſpeaker, who ſat very attentive, and carried themſelves very lovingly. An eſtabliſhing, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling meeting it was. This was the twenty-third of the firſt month.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-fourth we went by water ten miles to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian town where this emperor dwelt; whom I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted before with my coming, and deſired to get their kings and councils together. In the morning the emperor came himſelf, and had me to the town; where they were generally come together, their ſpeaker and other officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and the old empreſs ſat among them. They ſat very grave and ſober, and were all very attentive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond many called Chriſtians. I had ſome with me that could interpret to them. We had a very good meeting with them, and of conſiderable ſervice it was; for it gave them a good eſteem of truth and friends; bleſſed be the Lord!</p>
                  <p>After this we had meetings in ſeveral parts of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; one at William Stephens's, which was a general meeting once a month; another at Tredhaven Creek, another at Wye, another at Reconow Creek, and another at Thomas Taylor's in the iſland of Kent. Moſt of theſe were large, there being many people at them, and divers of the moſt conſiderable in the world's account. The Lord's power and living preſence was with us, and plenteouſly manifeſted amongſt the people, by which their hearts were tendered, and opened to receive the truth, which had a good ſavour amongſt them; bleſſed be the Lord God over all for ever! Being clear of that ſide, we paſſed over the bay about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles to a friend's houſe, where we met with ſeveral friends. I ſent for Thomas Thurſton thither, and had a meeting with him, to bring the truth over his bad actions.</p>
                  <p>Having travelled through moſt parts of that country, and viſited moſt of the plantations, having alarmed people of all ſorts where we came, and proclaimed the day of God's ſalvation amongſt them, we found our ſpirits began to be clear of thoſe parts of the world, and to draw towards Old England again. Yet we were deſirous and felt freedom from the Lord to ſtay till the general meeting for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Maryland was over (which drew nigh) that we might ſee friends generally together before we departed. Wherefore ſpending our time in the interim in viſiting friends and friendly people, in attending meetings about the Clifts and Patuxent, in writing anſwers to ſome cavilling objections which adverſaries had raiſed and ſpread abroad
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:037441_0685_100D92AED846DFD0"/>to hinder people from receiving the truth; we were not idle, but laboured in the work of the Lord until that general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial meeting, which began the ſeventeenth of the third month, and laſted four days. The firſt of theſe days the men and women had their meetings for buſineſs, wherein the affairs of the church were taken care of, and many things relating thereto were opened to their edification and comfort. The other three days were ſpent in publick meetings for the worſhip of God, at which divers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable account in the government, and many others were preſent; who were generally ſatisfied, and many of them reached; for it was a wonderful glorious meeting, and the mighty preſence of the Lord was ſeen and felt over all; bleſſed and praiſed be his holy name for ever, who over all giveth dominion!</p>
                  <p>After this meeting we took our leave of friends, parting in great tenderneſs, in the ſenſe of the heavenly life and virtuous power of the Lord that was livingly felt amongſt us, and went by water to the place where we were to take ſhipping; many friends accompanying us thither and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with us that night. Next day, the twenty-firſt of the third month, 1673, we ſet ſail for England: the ſame day Richard Covell came on board our ſhip, his own being taken from him by the Dutch. We had foul weather and contrary winds, which cauſed us to caſt anchor often, ſo that we were till the thirty-firſt of the third month ere we paſſed the capes of Virginia into the main ſea. But after this we made good ſpeed, and the twenty-eighth of the fourth month caſt anchor at King's Road, the harbour for Briſtol. We had in our paſſage very high winds and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous weather, which made the ſea exceeding rough, the waves riſing like mountains, ſo that the maſters and ſailors wondered, and ſaid, 'They never ſaw the like before.' But though the wind was ſtrong, it ſat for the moſt part with us, ſo that we ſailed before it; and the great God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the winds, who is Lord of heaven; earth, and the ſeas, and whoſe wonders are ſeen in the deep, ſteered our courſe, and preſerved us from many imminent dangers. The ſame good hand of Providence that went with us, and carried us ſafely over, watched over us in our return, and brought us ſafely back again. Thankſgivings and praiſes be to his holy name for ever! Many ſweet and precious meetings we had on board the ſhip during this voyage (commonly two a week) wherein the bleſſed preſence of the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:037441_0686_100D92B06E69C660"/>Lord did greatly refreſh us, and often break in upon and tender the company. When we came into Briſtol harbour, there lay a man of war, and the preſs-maſter came on board to impreſs our men. We had a meeting at that time in the ſhip with the ſeamen, before we went to ſhore; and the preſs-maſter ſat down with us, ſtaid the meeting, and was well ſatisfied with it. After the meeting I ſpoke to him to leave two of the men he had impreſſed in our ſhip (for he had impreſſed four) one of which was a Iame man; he ſaid, 'At my requeſt he would.'</p>
                  <p>We went on ſhore that afternoon, and got to Shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton. We procured horſes, and rode to Briſtol that night, where friends received us with great joy. In the evening I wrote a letter to my wife, to give her notice of my landing.</p>

                  <p>Between this and the fair my wife came out of the north to Briſtol, and her ſon-in-law Thomas Lower with two of her daughters with her. Her other ſon-in-law John Rouſe, W. Penn and his wife, and Gerrard Roberts came from London, and many friends from ſeveral parts of the nation to the fair, and glorious powerful meetings we had there; for the Lord's inſinite power and life was over all. In the freſh openings whereof I was moved to declare of Three
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:037441_0687_100D92B268C57830"/>Eſtates and Three Teachers, viz. <q>God was the firſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man and woman in paradiſe; and as long as they kept to and under his teaching, they kept in the image of God, in his likeneſs, in righteouſneſs and holineſs, and in dominion over all that God had made; in the bleſſed ſtate, in the paradiſe of God. But when they hearkened to the ſerpent's falſe teaching (who was out of truth) diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and obeyed the ſerpent, in feeding upon that which God forbad; they loſt the image of God, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and holineſs, came under the power of Satan, and were turned out of paradiſe, out of the bleſſed into the curſed ſtate. Then the promiſe of God was, <q>That the Seed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head,</q> break his power that man and woman were under, and deſtroy his works. So here were Three States and Three Teachers. God was the Firſt Teacher in paradiſe; and whilſt man kept under his teaching, he was happy. The ſerpent was the ſecond teacher; and when man followed his teaching, he fell into miſery, into the fall from the image of God, righteouſneſs, and holineſs, and from the power that he had over all that God had made; and came under the ſerpent whom he had power over before. Chriſt Jeſus was the Third Teacher; of whom God ſaith, <q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him:</q> and who himſelf ſaith, "Learn of me." This is the true goſpel-teacher, who bruiſes the head of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the falſe teacher, and the head of all falſe teachers and falſe religions, falſe ways, falſe worſhips, and falſe churches. Chriſt, who ſaid, who ſaid, "Learn of me," and of whom the Father ſaid, "Hear ye him," ſaid, <q>I am the way to God, I am the truth, I am the life, and the true light.</q> So as man and woman come to God, and are renewed up into his image, righteouſneſs, and holineſs by Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they come into the paradiſe of God, the ſtate which man was in before he ſell; and into an higher ſtate than that, to ſit down in Chriſt who never fell. Therefore the Son of God is to be heard in all things, who is the Saviour and the Redeemer; who hath laid down his life, and bought his ſheep with his precious blood. We can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all the world. Who hath any thing to ſay againſt our way? our Saviour? our Redeemer? our Prophet, whom God hath raiſed up that we may hear, and whom we muſt hear in all things? Who hath any thing againſt our Shepherd, Chriſt Jeſus, who leads and ſeeds us, and
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:037441_0688_100D92B46CA24118"/>we know his heavenly voice? Who hath any thing againſt our Biſhop, in whoſe mouth was never guile found, who doth overſee us in his paſture of life, that we do not go aſtray out of his fold? Who hath any thing againſt our Prieſt, Chriſt Jeſus, made higher than the heavens, who gives us freely, and commands us to give freely? Who hath any thing to ſay againſt our Leader and Counſellor, Chriſt Jeſus, who never ſinned, but is holy, harmleſs, and ſeparate from ſinners? God hath commanded us to hear him, and he ſaith, "Learn of me;" and if we ſhould diſobey God's and Chriſt's command, we ſhould be like our father Adam and mother Eve, who diſobeyed God's command, and hearkened to the ſerpent's teaching. Man commands, and would force us to hear the hirelings, who plead for ſin and the body of death to the grave; which doctrine ſavours of the devil's teaching, not of Chriſt's; but we reſolve to hear the Son, as both the Father and he command; and in hearing the Son, we hear the Father alſo, as the ſcripture teſtifies. For the author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews ſays, <q>God, who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son:</q> Mark that, God hath ſpoken unto us (his apoſtles, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and church) by his Son. And whereas ſome have objected, <q>That although Chriſt did ſpeak both to his diſciples and to the Jews in the days of his fleſh, yet ſince his reſurrection and aſcenſion he doth not ſpeak now;</q> the anſwer is, as God did then ſpeak by his Son in the days of his fleſh, ſo the Son, Chriſt Jeſus, doth now ſpeak by his Spirit. Wherefore John ſaith in the Revelations, <q>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the churches,</q> Rev. ii. And Chriſt is ſaid to <q>ſpeak from heaven,</q> Heb. xii. 25. <q>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</q> They that reſiſted Moſes's law (who ſpake on earth) died for it without mercy, which was a natural death; but they that refuſe him that ſpeaks from heaven, neglect and ſlight their own ſalvation, and ſo die a ſpiritual death, through unbelief and hardneſs of heart. Therefore was the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation given of old, <q>To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,</q> &amp;c. Heb. iii. 15. &amp;c. They who neglect or refuſe to hear the voice
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:037441_0689_100D92B6FA352750"/>of Chriſt now ſpeaking from heaven in this his goſpel-day, harden their hearts. Therefore let all mark well theſe three ſtates and teachers: the God of truth was the firſt teacher, while man was in paradiſe and in innocence. The ſerpent was the ſecond teacher, the falſe teacher, who by his falſe teaching came to be the god of the world which lies in wickedneſs. Chriſt Jeſus, that bruiſes the ſerpent's head, is the third teacher, who ſaith, "Learn of me;" of whom God ſaith, <q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him;</q> and of whom the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſaints of old was, <q>That God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</q> Thus they, that come to be renewed up again into the divine heavenly image in which man was at firſt made, will know the ſame God, that was the firſt teacher of Adam and Eve in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, to ſpeak to them now by his Son, who changes not; glory be to his name for ever!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many deep and precious things were opened in thoſe meetings by the eternal Spirit which ſearcheth and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the deep things of God. After I had finiſhed my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Lord in that city, I departed into Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where we had many large and precious meetings; and the Lord's everlaſting power flowed over all. From Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire I paſſed into Wiltſhire, where alſo we had many bleſſed meetings. At Slattenford in Wiltſhire we had a very good meeting, though we met with much oppoſition from ſome, who had ſet themſelves againſt women's meetings; which I was moved of the Lord to recommend to friends, for the benefit of the church of Chriſt. <q>That faithful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, called to the belief of the truth, made partakers of the ſame precious faith, and heirs of the ſame everlaſting goſpel of life and ſalvation as the men are, might in like manner come into the poſſeſſion and practice of the goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and therein be meet helps unto the men in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, in the ſervice of truth, in the affairs of the church, as they are outwardly in civil or temporal things. That ſo all the family of God, women as well as men, might know, poſſeſs, perform, and diſcharge their offices and ſervices in the houſe of God, whereby the poor might be the better taken care of; the younger ſort inſtructed, informed, and taught in the way of God; the looſe and diſorderly reproved and admoniſhed in the fear of the Lord; the clearneſs of perſons propoſing marriage, more cloſely and ſtrictly inquired into in the wiſdom of God;
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:037441_0690_100D92B88FFB7DE0"/>and all the members of the ſpiritual body the church might watch over and be helpful to each other in love.</q> After theſe oppoſers had run into much contention and wrangling, the power of the Lord ſtruck down one of the chief of them, ſo that his ſpirit ſunk, and he came to be ſenſible of the evil he had done, in oppoſing God's heavenly power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his error before friends, and afterwards gave forth a paper of condemnation, wherein he declared, <q>That he did wilfully oppoſe (although I often warned him to take heed) until the fire of the Lord did burn within him, and he ſaw the angel of the Lord with his ſword drawn in his hand, ready to cut him off,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the oppoſition was made at the meeting, yet a very good and ſerviceable meeting it was; for occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was thereby adminiſtered to anſwer their objections and cavils, and to open the ſervices of women in and for the church. At this meeting the women's meetings for that county were eſtabliſhed in the bleſſed power of God.</p>
                  <p>After this I went to Marlborough, and had a meeting there, to which ſome of the magiſtrates came, and were civil and moderate. Then paſſing to Bartholomew Maylin's, I had a very precious meeting there. From thence went a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beyond Ore, where we had a bleſſed meeting, and very large, as we had alſo ſoon after upon the border of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Then turning into Oxfordſhire, we viſited friends there; then went to Reading where we had a large meeting. From thence paſſing into Buckinghamſhire, we had many precious meetings in that county. After which we viſited friends till we came to Kingſton upon Thames, where my wife and her daughter Rachel met me.</p>
                  <p>I made no long ſtay at Kingſton, but went to London, where I found the Baptiſts and Socinians, with ſome old apoſtates grown very rude, having printed many books againſt us: ſo I had a great travail in the Lord's power, before I could get clear of that city. But bleſſed be the Lord, his power came over them, and all their lying, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſcandalous books were anſwered. I made a ſhort journey into ſome parts of Eſſex and Middleſex, viſiting friends at their meetings, and their children at the ſchools, and returned ſoon to London. After ſome ſervice there among friends. I went to Kingſton, and from thence to Stephen Smith's, in Surrey, where was a very large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, many hundreds of people attending it. I ſtaid in theſe parts till I had cleared myſelf of the ſervice the Lord
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:037441_0691_100D92BA2ACA0678"/>had given me to do there, and then returned by Kingſton to London, whither I felt my ſpirit drawn; having heard that many friends were taken before the magiſtrates, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers impriſoned, both in London and in other parts of the nation, for opening their ſhop-windows upon holy-days and faſt-days (as they were called) and for bearing teſtimony againſt all ſuch obſervation of days. Which friends could not but do, knowing that the true Chriſtians did not obſerve the Jews holy-days in the apoſtles times, neither could we obſerve the Heathens and Papiſts holy days (ſo called) which have been ſet up amongſt thoſe called Chriſtians ſince the apoſtles days. For we were redeemed out of days by Chriſt Jeſus, and brought into the day which hath ſprung from on high, and are come into him, who is Lord of the Jewiſh ſabbath, and the ſubſtance of the Jews ſigns.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſtaid ſome time in London, labouring for ſome relief and eaſe to friends in this caſe, I went with my wife, and her daughter Rachel, to Hendon, in Middleſex, and from thence to William Penn's at Rickmanſworth, in Hertfordſhire, whither Thomas Lower, who married an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of my wife's daughters, came the next day to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany us in our journey northward. After we had viſited friends thereabouts, we paſſed to a friend's houſe near Ayleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; and from thence to Bray Doily's at Adderbury, in Oxfordſhire, where, on firſt-day, we had a large and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meeting. Truth being well ſpread, and friends in thoſe parts much increaſed in number, two or three new meetings were then ſet up thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>At night, as I was ſitting at ſupper, I felt I was taken; yet I ſaid nothing to any body of it then. But getting out next morning, we travelled into Worceſterſhire, and went to john Halford's at Armſcot, in Tredington pariſh; where we had a very large and precious meeting in his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rn, the Lord's powerful preſence being eminently with and amongſt us. After the meeting, friends being moſt of them gone, as I was ſitting in the parlour, diſcourſing with ſome friends, Henry Parker, a juſtice, came to the houſe, and with him Rowland Hains, a prieſt of Hunniton, in Warwickſhire. This juſtice came to know of the meeting by means of a woman-friend, who, being nurſe to a child of his, aſked leave of her miſtreſs to go to the meeting to ſee me; and ſhe ſpeaking of it to her huſband, he and the prieſt plotted together to break up the meeting, and apprehend me. But by means of their ſitting long at dinner, it being the day on

But though there was no meeting when they came, yet I being in the houſe, who was the perſon they aimed at, Henry Parker took me, and Thomas Lower for company with me, and though he had nothing to lay to our charge, ſent us both to Worceſter gaol, by a ſtrange ſort of mittimus; a copy of which here followeth:</p>

                  <p>When we had been ſome time in the gaol, we thought fit to lay our caſe before the lord Windſor, lord-lieutenant of Worceſterſhire, and before the deputy-lieutenants, and other magiſtrates; which we did by the following letter:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>THESE are to inform you, the lord-lieutenant (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) the deputy-lieutenants, and the juſtices of the county of Worceſterſhire, how unchriſtianly and inhumanly we have been dealt withal by Henry Parker, a juſtice (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) in our journey towards the north. We coming to our friend John Halſord's, the 17th of the 10th month, 1673, ſome friends bringing us on the way, and others coming to viſit us there; towards night came the aforeſaid juſtice, and a prieſt called Rowland Hains, of Hunniton, in Warwickſhire, and demanded our names and places of abode. And though we were not in any meeting, but were diſcourſing together when they came in, he made a mittimus to ſend us to Worceſter gaol. Now whereas he ſays in his mittimus, <q>That complaint had been made to him of ſeveral by-paſt meetings of many hundreds at a
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:037441_0694_100D92C17A5F3108"/>time;</q> we know nothing of that, nor do we think that concerns us. And whereas he ſays further, <q>That no ſatisfactory account of our ſettlement or place of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared unto him;</q> this he contradicts in his own mittimus, mentioning therein the places of our abode and habitation; the account of which we ſatisfactorily and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave him. And one of us (Thomas Lower) told him, that he was going down with his mother-in-law (who is George Fox's wife) and with his ſiſter, to fetch up his own wife and child out of the north into his own country. And the other of us (George Fox) told him, that he was bringing forward his wife on her journey towards the north who had been at London to viſit one of her daughters, who had lately lain in. And having received a meſſage from his mother, an ancient woman in Leiceſterſhire, that ſhe earneſtly deſired to ſee him before ſhe died, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſoon as he had brought his wife on her journey as far as Cauſal, in Warwickſhire, to turn into Leiceſterſhire, to viſit his mother and relations there, and then to have returned to London. But by his interrupting us in our journey, taking the huſband from his wife, the ſon from his mother and ſiſter, and ſtopping him from viſiting his wife and child ſo remote, we were forced to get ſtrangers, or whom we could, to help them on their journey, to our great damage and their hindrance. We aſked the prieſt, <q>whether this was his goſpel, and their way of entertaining ſtrangers?</q> And we deſired the juſtice to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was doing "as he would be done by?" But he ſaid, "He had ſaid it, and he would do it". And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſays, "We refuſed to give ſureties." He aſked only George Fox for ſureties; who replied, <q>He was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man, and knew no law he had broken;</q> but he did not aſk Thomas Lower for any, as if it had been crime and cauſe enough for his commitment that he came out of Cornwall. If we were at a meeting, as he ſays in his mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus, he might have proceeded otherwiſe, than by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to gaol, to anſwer the breach of the common laws; though he ſhewed us no breach of any, as may be ſeen in the mittimus. We thought fit to lay before you the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his proceedings againſt us, hoping there will more moderation and juſtice appear in you towards us, that we may proſecute our intended journey.</p>

But no enlargement did we receive by our application to the lord Windſor (ſo called.) And although Thomas Lower received ſeveral letters from his brother Dr. Lower, who was one of the king's phyſicians, concerning his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and one, by his procurement, from Henry Savil, who was of the king's bed-chamber; to his brother called the lord Windſor to the ſame effect; yet ſeeing it related only to his enlargement, not mine, ſo great was his love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to me, that he would not ſeek his own liberty ſingly, but kept the letter by him unſent; ſo we were continued priſoners till the next general quarter ſeſſions of the peace. At which time divers friends from ſeveral places being in town, did ſpeak to the juſtices concerning us; who ſpoke fair, and ſaid we ſhould be diſcharged. For many of the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices ſeemed to diſlike the ſeverity of Parker's proceedings againſt us, and declared an averſeneſs to enſnare us by the tender of the oaths. Some friends alſo had ſpoken with lord Windſor, who likewiſe ſpoke them fair; ſo that it was the general diſcourſe we ſhould be diſcharged. We heard alſo, that Dr. Lower had procured a letter from colonel Sands at London, to ſome of the juſtices in our favour. Some of the juſtices alſo ſpoke to ſome friends, to acquaint us, that they would have us ſpeak but little in the court, leſt we ſhould provoke any of the bench, and they would warrant we ſhould be diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>We were not called till the laſt day of the ſeſſions, which was the twenty-firſt of the eleventh month, 1673. When we came in, they were ſtruck with paleneſs in their faces, and it was ſome time before any thing was ſpoken; inſomuch that a butcher in the hall ſaid, <q>What! are they afraid? Dare not the juſtices ſpeak to them?</q> At length, before they ſpoke to us, juſtice Parker made a long ſpeech on the bench, much to the ſame effect as was contained in the mittimus, often mentioning the common laws, but not inſtancing any we had broken. Adding, <q>That he thought it a milder courſe to ſend us two to gaol, than to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When Parker had ended his ſpeech, the juſtices began with Thomas Lower, whom they examined of the cauſe of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:037441_0696_100D92C5B68F7BC8"/>his coming into that country; of which he gave them a full and plain account. Sometimes I put in a word while they were examining him, and then they told me, <q>They were upon his examination, when it came to my turn, I ſhould have free liberty to ſpeak, for they would not hinder me; but I ſhould have full time, and they would not enſnare us.</q> When they had done with him, they aſked me an account of my travel, which I gave them, as is mentioned before, but more largely. And whereas juſtice Parker, to aggravate the caſe, had made a great noiſe of <q>there being ſome from London, ſome from the north, ſome from Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, and ſome from Briſtol, at the houſe when I was taken.</q> I told him, <q>This was in a manner all but one family. For there was none from London, but myſelf; none from the north, but my wife and her daughter; none from Cornwall, but my ſon-in-law Thomas Lower; nor any from Briſtol, but one friend, a merchant there, who me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ye know,' ſaid I, in your own conſciences, that we, the people called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, cannot take an oath, nor ſwear in any caſe, becauſe Chriſt hath forbidden it. But as to the matter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance contained in the oaths, this I can and do ſay, that I do own and acknowledge the king of England to be lawful heir and ſucceſſor to the realm of England, and do abhor
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:037441_0697_100D92C8389EDB98"/>all plots and plotters, and contrivances againſt him; and I have nothing in my heart, but love and good-will to him and all men, and deſire his and their proſperity; the Lord knows it, before whom I ſtand an innocent man. And as to the oath of ſupremacy, I deny the pope, his power, and his religion, and abhor it with my heart.</q> While I was ſpeaking, they cried, 'Give him the book.' I ſaid, <q>The book ſaith, "Swear not at all." Then they cried, Take him away, gaoler;</q> and I ſtill ſpeaking on, they were urgent upon the gaoler, crying, <q>Take him away, we ſhall have a meeting here. Why do you not take him away? That fellow (meaning the gaoler) loves to hear him preach.</q> Then the gaoler drew me away; and as I was turning from them, I ſtretched out my arm, and ſaid, <q>The Lord forgive you, who caſt me into priſon for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of Chriſt.</q> Thus they apparently broke their promiſe in the face of the country; for they promiſed I ſhould have free liberty to ſpeak, but now they would not give it me; and they promiſed they would not enſnare us, yet now they tendered me the oaths on purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare me.</p>
                  <p>After I was had away, Thomas Lower was ſtayed behind in the court; and they told him, 'He was at liberty.' Then he would have reaſoned with them, aſking them, <q>Why I might not be ſet at liberty as well as he, ſeeing we were both taken together, and our caſe was alike?</q> But they told him, 'They would not hear him;' ſaying, <q>You may be gone about your buſineſs, for we have nothing more to ſay to you, ſeeing you are diſcharged.</q> This was all he could get from them. Wherefore, after the court was riſen, he went to ſpeak with them at their chamber, deſiring to know, <q>What cauſe they had to detain his father, ſeeing they had diſcharged him?</q> and wiſhing them to conſider, whether this was not partiality, and would be a blemiſh to them. Whereupon Simpſon threatened him, ſaying, <q>If you be not content we will tender you the oaths alſo, and ſend you to your father.</q> To which he replied, <q>They might do that, if they thought fit; but whether they ſent him or no, he intended to go and wait upon his father in priſon; for that was now his buſineſs in that country.</q> Then ſaid juſtice Parker to him, <q>Do you think, Mr. Lower, that I had not cauſe to ſend your father and you to priſon, when you had ſuch a great meeting that the parſon of the pariſh complained to me, that he hath loſt the greateſt part of his
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:037441_0698_100D92C9CCF686F8"/>pariſhioners; ſo that when he comes amongſt them he has ſcarce any auditors left?</q> 'I have heard,' replied Thomas Lower, <q>that the prieſt of that pariſh comes ſo ſeldom to viſit his flock (but once, it may be, or twice in a year, to gather up his tithes) that it was but charity in my father to viſit ſuch a forlorn and forſaken flock; therefore thou hadſt no cauſe to ſend my father to priſon for viſiting them, or for teaching, inſtructing, and directing them to Chriſt, their true teacher, who had ſo little comfort or benefit from their pretended paſtor, who comes amongſt them only to ſeck for his "gain from his quarter."</q> Upon this the juſtices fell a laughing; for it ſeems Dr. Crowder, the prieſt they ſpoke of, was then ſitting among them, though Thomas Lower did not know him; and he had the wit to hold his tongue, and not undertake to vindicate himſelf in a matter ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known to be true. But when Thomas Lower was come from them, the juſtices did ſo play upon Dr. Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he was pitifully aſhamed, and ſo nettled with it, that he threatened to ſue Thomas Lower in the biſhop's court, upon an action of defamation. Which when Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lower heard of, he ſent him word, he would anſwer his ſuit, let him begin it when he would; and would bring his whole pariſh in evidence againſt him. This cooled the doctor. Yet ſome time after he came to the priſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he had a mind to diſpute with me, and to talk with Thomas Lower about that buſineſs; and he brought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, he himſelf being then a prebendary at Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</p>
                  <p>When he came in, he aſked me, <q>What I was in priſon for?</q> 'Doſt not thou know that?' ſaid I. <q>Waſt not thou upon the bench, when juſtice Simpſon and Parker tendered the oath to me? And hadſt not thou an hand in it?</q> Then he ſaid, <q>It is lawful to ſwear; and Chriſt did not forbid ſwearing before a magiſtrate; but ſwearing by the ſun and the like.</q> I bid him prove that by the ſcriptures, but he could not. Then he brought that ſaying of Paul's. 'All things are lawful unto me,' 1 Cor. vi. 12. 'And if,' ſaid he, <q>all things were lawful unto him, then ſwearing was lawful unto him.</q> 'By this argument,' ſaid I, <q>thou mayſt alſo affirm, that drunkenneſs, adultery, and all manner of ſin and wickedneſs is lawful alſo, as well as ſwearing.</q> 'Why,' ſaid Dr. Crowder, <q>do you hold that adultery is unlawful?</q> 'Yes,' ſaid I, 'that I do.' <q>Why then,</q> ſaid he, 'this contradicts the ſaying of St. Paul.'
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:037441_0699_100D92CC15EC6D40"/>Thereupon I called to the priſoners and the gaoler, to hear what doctrine Dr. Crowder had laid down for orthodox, viz. <q>that drunkenneſs, ſwearing, adultery, and ſuch like things were lawful.</q> Then he ſaid, <q>He would give it under his hand;</q> and took a pen, but wrote another thing than what he had ſpoken. Then turning to Thomas Lower, he aſked him, <q>Whether he would anſwer what he had there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?</q> Who undertook it. Whereupon, when he had threatened Thomas Lower to ſue him in the biſhop's court for ſpeaking ſo abuſively (as he called it) of him before the juſtices, and Thomas had bid him begin when he pleaſed, for he would anſwer him, and bring his pariſhioners in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him, he went away in a great fret, grumbling to himſelf as he went. A few days after Thomas Lower ſent him an anſwer to the paper he had wrote and left with him; which anſwer a friend of Worceſter carried to him, and he read it, and ſaid, 'He would reply to it;' but he never did, though he often ſent him word he would do it.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the ſeſſions, the term coming on, an Habeas Corpus was ſent to Worceſter for the ſheriff to bring me up to the king's-bench-bar. Whereupon the under-ſheriff, having made Thomas Lower his deputy to convey me to London, we ſet out the twenty-ninth of the eleventh month, 1673, and came to London the ſecond of the twelfth month; the ways being very deep, and the waters out. Next day, notice being given that I was brought up, the ſheriff was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to bring me into court. I went accordingly, and did appear in court before judge Wild; and both he and the lawyers were pretty fair, ſo that I had time to ſpeak, to clear my innocency, and ſhew my wrong impriſonment. After the return of the writ was entered, I was ordered to be brought into court again next day; the order of court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as followeth:</p>

                  <p>Accordingly I went in the morning, and walked in the hall till the ſheriff came to me (for he truſted me to go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would) and it being early, we went into the court of King's Bench, and ſat among the lawyers almoſt an hour, till the judges came in, when the ſheriff took off my hat; and after awhile I was called. The Lord's preſence was with me, and his power I felt was over all. I ſtood and heard the king's attorney, whoſe name was Jones, who in deed ſpoke notably on my behalf, as did alſo another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor after him; and the judges, who were three, were all very moderate, not caſting any reflecting words at me. I ſtood ſtill in the power and Spirit of the Lord, ſeeing how the Lord was at work, and the earth was helping the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But when they had done, I applied myſelf to the chief juſtice, deſiring, 'That I might ſpeak;' and he ſaid, I might. <q>Then I related the cauſe of our journey, the manner of our being taken and committed, and the time of our impriſonment until the ſeſſions; with a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our trial at the ſeſſions, and what I had offered to the juſtices then, as a declaration that I could make or ſign, inſtead of the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy.</q> When I had done, the chief juſtice ſaid, <q>I was to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to the King's-bench, and the ſheriff of Worceſter to be diſcharged of me.</q> He ſaid alſo, <q>That they would conſider further of it; and if they found any error in the record, or in the juſtices proceedings, I ſhould be ſet at liberty.</q> So a tipſtaff was called to take me into cuſtody, and he delivered me to the keeper of the King's-bench, who let me go to a friend's houſe, where I lodged and appointed to meet me at Edward Man's in Biſhopſgate-ſtreet the next day. But after this, juſtice Parker, or ſome other of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, moved the court, that I might be ſent back to Worceſter. Whereupon another day was appointed for another hearing, and they had four counſel that pleaded againſt me. George Stroude, a counſellor, pleaded for me, and was pleading before I was brought into the court; but they bore him down, and prevailed with the judges to give judgment. <q>That I ſhould be ſent down to Worceſter ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</q> Only they told me I might put in bail to appear
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:037441_0701_100D92D087B1F880"/>at the ſeſſions, and to be of good behaviour in the mean time. I told them, <q>I never was of ill behaviour in my life; and that they, the four judges, might as well put the oath to me there, as ſend me to Worceſter to be enſnared by the juſtices, in their putting the oath to me, and then premuniring me, who never took oath in my life. I told them, if I broke my Yea or Nay, I was content to ſuffer the ſame penalty which they ſhould that break their oaths.</q> This alteration of the judges minds in my caſe proceeded, as was thought, from ſome falſe informations that my adverſary juſtice Parker had given againſt me: for between the times of my former appearance and this, he had ſpread abroad a very falſe and malicious ſtory, viz. <q>That there were many ſubſtantial men with me out of ſeveral parts of the nation when he took me, and that we had a deſign or plot in hand; and that Thomas Lower ſtaid with me in priſon long after he was ſet at liberty, to carry on our deſign.</q> This was ſpoken in the parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; inſomuch that if I had not been brought up to London when I was, I had been ſtopped at Worceſter, and Thomas had been re-committed with me. But although theſe lies were eafily diſproved and laid open to Parker's ſhame, yet would not the judges alter their laſt ſentence, but remanded me to Worceſter gaol; only this favour was granted, that I might go down my own way, and at my own leiſure; provided I would be without fail there by the aſſize, which was to begin the ſecond of the ſecond month following.</p>
                  <p>I ſtaid in and about London till towards the latter end of the firſt month 1674, and then went down leiſurely (for I was not able to abide haſty and hard travelling) and came into Worceſter the laſt of the firſt month 1674, being the day before the judges came to town. The ſecond day of the ſecond month I was brought from the gaol to an inn near the hall that I might be in readineſs if I ſhould be called. But not being called that day, the gaoler came at night, and told me, 'I might go home,' meaning to the gaol. Gerrard Roberts of London being with me, he and I walked down together to the gaol without any keeper. Next day being brought up again, they ſet a little boy about eleven years old to be my keeper. I came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand juſtice Parker and the clerk of the peace had given order that I ſhould not be put into the calendar, that I might not be brought before the judge; wherefore I got
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:037441_0702_100D92D217C63A38"/>the judge's ſon to move in court, <q>That I might be called:</q> whereupon I was called and brought to the bar before judge Turner, my old adverſary, who had ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me the oaths, and premunired me once before at Lancaſter. After ſilence made, he aſked me, <q>What I did deſire?</q> I anſwered, 'My liberty according to juſtice.' He ſaid, 'I lay upon the oath;' and aſked, <q>If I would take it?</q> 
                     <q>I deſired he would hear the manner of my being taken and committed;</q> and being ſilent, I gave him an account thereof at large, as is before ſet down, letting him alſo know, <q>That ſince my impriſonment I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my mother, who was an ancient, tender woman, and had deſired to ſee me before ſhe died, hearing that I was ſtopped and impriſoned in my journey, ſo that I was not likely to come to ſee her, it ſtruck her ſo, that ſhe died ſoon after, which was a very hard thing to me.</q> When I had done ſpeaking, he again aſked me, 'To take the oaths.' I told him, <q>I could not take any oath, for conſcience-ſake; and I did believe he and they all knew in their conſciences 'that it was for conſcience-ſake I could not ſwear at all. I declared amongſt them what I could ſay and what I could ſign, in owning of the king's right to the government, and in denying the pope and his pretended power, and all plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, plots, and conſpiracies againſt the government.</q> Some thought the judge had a mind to ſet me at liberty, for he ſaw they had nothing juſtly againſt me; but Parker, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me, endeavoured to incenſe him, telling him, <q>That I was a ringleader; that many of the nation followed me, and he knew not what it might come to;</q> with many more envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, which ſome took notice of; who alſo obſerved, that the judge gave him never a word in anſwer. However, the judge, willing to eaſe himſelf, referred me and my caſe to the ſeſſions again, bidding the juſtices make an end of it there, and not trouble the aſſizes any more with me. So I was continued priſoner, chiefly (as it ſeemed) through the means of juſtice Parker, who in this caſe was as falſe as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; for he had promiſed Richard Cannon of London, who had acquaintance with him, <q>That he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have me ſet at liberty;</q> yet he was the worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my I had in court, as ſome of the court obſerved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Other juſtices were very loving, and promiſed. <q>That I ſhould have the liberty of the town, and to lodge at a friend's houſe till the ſeſſions;</q> which accordingly I had, and the people were very civil and reſpectful to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="unknown:037441_0703_100D92D4847E0640"/>
Between this time and the ſeſſions I had ſome ſervice for the Lord with ſeveral that came to viſit me. At one time came three nonconformiſt prieſts and two lawyers to diſcourſe with me; and one of the prieſts undertook to prove, 'That the ſcriptures are the only rule of life.' Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had defeated his proof, I had a fit opportunity to open to them, <q>The right and proper uſe, ſervice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the ſcriptures; and alſo to ſhew, that the Spirit of God which was given to every one to profit withal, the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, and which hath appeared to all men, and teacheth them that obey it to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; that this, I ſay, is the moſt fit, proper, and univerſal rule which God hath given to all mankind to rule, direct, govern, and order their lives by.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another time came a common-prayer prieſt, and ſome people with him. He aſked me, <q>If I was grown up to perfection?</q> I told him, <q>What I was, I was by the grace of God.</q> He replied, 'It was a modeſt and civil anſwer.' Then he urged the words of John, <q>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive ourſelves, and the truth is not in us.</q> He aſked, 'What did I ſay to that?' <q>I ſaid with the ſame apoſtle, <q>If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us;</q> who came to deſtroy ſin, and to take away ſin. So there is a time for people to ſee that they have ſinned, and there is a time for them to ſee that they have ſin; and there is a time for them to confeſs their ſin, and to forſake it, and to know the blood of Chriſt to cleanſe from all ſin.</q> Then the prieſt was aſked, <q>Whether Adam was not perfect before he ſell? and whether all God's works were not perfect?</q> The prieſt ſaid, <q>There might be a perfection as Adam had, and a falling from it.</q> But I told him, <q>There is a perfection in Chriſt above Adam, and beyond falling; and that it was the work of the miniſters of Chriſt to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt; for the perfecting of whom they had their gifts from Chriſt; therefore they that denied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, denied the work of the miniſtry, and the gifts which Chriſt gave for the perfecting of the ſaints.</q> The prieſt ſaid. 'We muſt always be ſtriving.' I anſwered, <q>It was a ſad and comfortleſs ſort of ſtriving, to ſtrive with a belief that we ſhould never overcome.</q> I told him alſo, that 'Paul, who cried out of the body of death, did alſo
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:037441_0704_100D92D79AB91850"/>
                     <q>thank God, who gave him the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q> So there was a time of crying out for want 'of victory, and a time of praiſing God for the victory. 'And Paul ſaid, <q>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</q> The prieſt ſaid, <q>Job was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q> I told him, <q>God ſaid Job was a perfect man, and that he did ſhun evil; and the devil was forced to confeſs, that "God had ſet an hedge about him;" which was not an outward hedge, but the inviſible, heavenly power.</q> The prieſt ſaid, 'Job ſaid, <q>He chargeth his angels with folly, and the heavens are not clean in his ſight.</q> I told him, <q>That was his miſtake, it was not Job ſaid ſo, but Eliphaz, who contended againſt Job.</q> 'Well, but,' ſaid the prieſt, 'what ſay you to that ſcripture, <q>The juſteſt man that is ſinneth ſeven times a day?</q> 'Why truly,' ſaid I, 'I ſay there is no ſuch ſcripture;' and with that the prieſt's mouth was ſtopped. Many other ſervices I had with ſeveral ſorts of people between the aſſizes and the ſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>The next quarter-ſeſſions began the twenty-ninth of the ſecond month, and I was called before the juſtices. The chairman's name was—Street, he was a judge in the Welſh circuit, and he miſrepreſented me and my caſe to the country, telling them <q>That we had a meeting at Treding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton from all parts of the nation, to the terrifying of the king's ſubjects, for which we had been committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that for the trial of my fidelity the oaths were put to me; and, having had time to conſider of it, he aſked me if I would now take the oaths?</q> 
                     <q>I deſired liberty to ſpeak for myſelf; and, having obtained that, began firſt to clear myſelf from thoſe falſehoods he had charged on me and friends; declaring, that we had not any ſuch meeting from all parts of the nation, as he had repreſented it; but that (except the friend from whoſe houſe we came, and who came with us to guide us thither, and one friend of Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, who came accidentally, or rather providentially, to aſſiſt my wife homewards, after we were taken) they that were with me were in a ſenſe part of my own family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my wife, her daughter, and her ſon-in-law. And we did not meet in any way or manner that would occaſion terror to any of the king's ſubjects; for we met peaceably and quietly, without arms; and I did not believe there could be any one produced that could truly ſay he was terrified with our meeting. Beſides, I told them we were
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:037441_0705_100D92D9AC230AB0"/>but in our journey, the occaſion whereof I now related as before. As to the oaths, I ſhewed why I could not take them (ſeeing Chriſt hath forbidden all ſwearing) and what I could ſay or ſign in lieu of them, as I had done before. Yet they cauſed the oaths to be read to me, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards read an indictment, which they had drawn up in readineſs, having a jury ready alſo.</q> When the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was read, the judge aſked me, 'If I was guilty?' I ſaid, <q>Nay; for it was a great bundle of lies; which I ſhewed and proved to the judge in ſeveral particulars, which I inſtanced; aſking him, if he did not know in his conſcience they were lies?</q> He ſaid, 'It was their form.' I ſaid, 'It was not a true form.' He aſked me again, 'Whether I was guilty?' I told him, <q>Nay, I was not guilty of the matter, nor of the form; for I was againſt the 'pope and popery, and did acknowledge and ſhould ſet my hand to that.</q> Then the judge told the jury what they ſhould ſay and do, and what they ſhould write on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the indictment; and as he ſaid, they did. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the jury gave in their verdict, I told them, <q>It was for Chriſt's ſake, and in obedience to his and his apoſtle's command, that I could not ſwear; therefore,</q> ſaid I, <q>take heed what ye do, for before his judgment-ſeat ye ſhall all be brought.</q> The judge ſaid, 'This is canting.' I ſaid, <q>If to confeſs Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, and to obey his command, be called canting by a judge of a court, it is to little purpoſe for me to ſay more among you; yet ye ſhall ſee that I am a chriſtian, and ſhall ſhew forth chriſtianity, and my innocency ſhall be manifeſt.</q> So the gaoler led me out of the court; and the people were generally tender, as if they had been in a meeting. Soon after I was brought in again, and the jury found the bill againſt me, which I traverſed. Then I was aſked to put in bail till the next ſeſſions, and the gaoler's ſon offered to be bound for me. But I ſtopped him, and warned friends not to meddle, for I told them, 'There was a ſnare in that;' yet I told the juſtices, I could promiſe to appear if the Lord gave health and ſtrength, and I was at liberty. Some of the juſtices were loving, and would have ſtopped the reſt from indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me or putting the oath to me; but judge Street the chairman ſaid, 'He muſt go according to law.' So I was ſent to priſon again; yet within two hours after, through the moderation of ſome of the juſtices, I had liberty given me till next quarter-ſeſſions. Theſe moderate juſtices, as it
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:037441_0706_100D92DB43296ED8"/>was ſaid, deſired juſtice Parker to write to the king for my liberty, or for a Noli proſequi, becauſe they were ſatisfied I was not ſuch a dangerous perſon as I had been repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This, it was ſaid, he promiſed to do, but did it not.</p>
                  <p>After I had got a copy of the indictment, I went to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, viſiting friends as I went. When I came there, ſome that were earneſt to get me out of the hands of thoſe envious juſtices that ſought to premunire me at Worceſter, would needs be tampering again, to bring me before the judges of the King's Bench; whereupon I was brought again by an Habeas Corpus before them. I tendered them a paper, in which was contained what I could ſay inſtead of the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy, as followeth:</p>

                  <p>But the buſineſs being ſo far proceeded in at Worceſter, they would not meddle in it, but left me to appear again before the juſtices at the next general quarter-ſeſſions at Worceſter.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the yearly meeting of friends came on, at which I was preſent; and exceeding glorious the meetings were, beyond expreſſion; bleſſed be the Lord!</p>
                  <p>After the yearly meeting, I ſet forward for Worceſter, the ſeſſions drawing on, which were held in the fifth month.
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:037441_0707_100D92DD10385030"/>When I was called to the bar, and the indictment read, ſome ſcruple ariſing among the jury concerning it, the judge of the court, juſtice Street, cauſed the oaths to be read and tendered to me again. I told him, <q>I came now to try the traverſe of my indictment; and that his tendering me the 'oaths anew, was a new ſnare. I deſired him to anſwer me a queſtion or two; and aſked him, Whether the oaths were to be tendered to the king's ſubjects, or to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of foreign princes?</q> He ſaid, <q>To the ſubjects of this realm.</q> 'Then,' ſaid I, <q>You have not named me a ſubject in the indictment, and therefore have not brought me within the ſtatute.</q> The judge cried, <q>Read the oath to him.</q> I ſaid, 'I require juſtice.' Again I aſked him, <q>Whether the ſeſſions ought not to have been holden for the king, and the body of the county?</q> He ſaid, 'Yes.' 'Then,' ſaid I, you have there left the king out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; <q>how then can you proceed upon this indictment to a trial between the king and me, ſeeing the king is left out?</q> He ſaid, 'The king was in before.' But I told 'him, <q>The king's name being left out, here was a great error in the indictment, and ſufficient, as I was informed to quaſh it. Beſides, I told him that I was committed by the name of George Fox of London, but now I was indicted by the name of George Fox of Tredington in the county of Worceſter. I wiſhed the jury to conſider how they could find me guilty upon that indictment, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was not of the place the indictment mentioned.</q> The judge did not deny but there were errors in the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but ſaid, 'I might take my remedy in its proper 'place.' I anſwered, 'You know that we are a people that 'ſuffer all things, and bear all things; and therefore ye 'thus uſe us, becauſe we cannot revenge ourſelves; but we 'leave our cauſe to the Lord.' The judge ſaid, 'The oath 'hath been tendered to you ſeveral times, and we will have 'ſome ſatisfaction from you concerning the oath.' I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the ſame declaration inſtead of the oath, which I had offered to the judges above; but it would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Then I deſired to know, ſeeing they put the oath anew to me, whether the indictment was quaſhed or no? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwering me, the judge told the jury, 'They 'might go out.' Some of the jury were not ſatisfied; whereupon the judge told them, 'They had heard a man 'ſwear that the oath was tendered to me the laſt ſeſſions;' and then directed what they ſhould do, I told him, <q>He
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:037441_0708_100D92E023BD42F0"/>ſhould leave the jury to their own conſciences.</q> However, the jury, being put on by him, went forth, and ſoon after came in again, and found me guilty. I aſked them, <q>How they could ſatisfy themſelves to find me guilty upon that indictment, which was laid ſo falſe, and had ſo many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in it?</q> They could make but little anſwer; yet one who ſeemed to be the worſt of them, would have taken me by the hand: but I put him by, ſaying, <q>How now, 'Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, haſt thou betrayed me, and doſt thou now come with a kiſs?</q> So I bid him and them repent. Then the judge began to tell me, <q>How favourable the court had been to me.</q> I aſked him, <q>How he could ſay ſo? Was ever any man worſe dealt by than I had been in this caſe, who was ſtopped in my journey when travelling upon my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful occaſions, and impriſoned without cauſe; and now had the oaths put to me only for a ſnare? I deſired him to anſwer me in the preſence of the Lord, in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence we all are, whether this oath was not tendered to me in envy?</q> He would not anſwer that; but ſaid, <q>Would you had never come here, to trouble us and the country!</q> I anſwered, <q>I came not thither of myſelf, but was brought, being ſtopped in my journey. I did not trouble them, but they had brought trouble upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</q> Then the judge told me, <q>What a ſad ſentence he had to tell me.</q> I aſked him, <q>Whether what he was going to ſpeak was by way of paſſing ſentence, or for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? For I told him I had many things to ſay, and more errors to aſſign in the indictment, beſides thoſe I had already mentioned, to ſtop him from giving ſentence againſt me upon that indictment.</q> He ſaid, <q>He was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew me the danger of a premunire, which was the loſs of my liberty and of all my goods and chattels, and to ſuffer impriſonment during life.</q> But he ſaid, <q>He did not deliver this as the ſentence of the court upon me, but as an admonition to me.</q> Then he bid the gaoler <q>Take me away.</q> I expected to have been called again to hear the ſentence; but when I was gone, the Clerk of the peace (whoſe name was Twittey) aſked him, as I was informed, <q>Whether that which he had ſpoken to me ſhould ſtand-for ſentence?</q> And he, conſulting with ſome of the juſtices, told him, 'Yes, that was the ſentence, and ſhould ſtand' This was done behind my back, to ſave himſelf from ſhame in the face of the country. Many of the juſtices, and the generality of the people, were moderate and civil; and
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:037441_0709_100D92E25777C060"/>John Aſhley, a lawyer, was very friendly both the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and now, ſpeaking on my behalf, and pleading the errors of the indictment for me; but juſtice Street, the judge of the court, would not regard, but over-ruled all. This juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Street ſaid to ſome friends in the morning before my trial, <q>That if he had been upon the bench the firſt ſeſſions, he would not have tendered me the oath; but if I had been convicted of being at a conventicle, he would have proceeded againſt me according to that law; and that he was ſorry that ever I came before him;</q> yet he maliciouſly tendered the oath to me in the court again, when I was to have tried my traverſe upon the indictment. But the Lord pleaded my cauſe, and met with both him and juſtice Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who firſt enſnared me with the oath at the firſt ſeſſions; for Simpſon's ſon was arraigned not long after at the ſame bar for murder. And Street, who, as he came down from London, after the judges had returned me back from the King's Bench to Worceſter, ſaid, <q>Now I was returned to them, I ſhould lie in priſon and rot;</q> had his daughter (whom he ſo doted on that ſhe was called his idol) brought dead from London in an herſe to the ſame inn where he ſpoke thoſe words, and brought to Worceſter to be buried within a few days after. People took notice of the hand of God, how ſudden it was upon him; but it rather hardened than tendered him, as his carriage afterwards ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>After I was returned to priſon, ſeveral came to ſee me; amongſt others, the earl of Saliſbury's ſon, who was very loving, and troubled that they had dealt ſo wickedly by me. He ſtaid about two hours with me, and took a copy of the errors of the indictment in writing.</p>
                  <p>The ſeſſions being now over, and I fixed in priſon by a premunire, my wife came out of the north to be with me; and the aſſizes coming on in the ſixth month, the ſtate of my caſe being drawn up in writing, ſhe and Thomas Lower delivered it to judge Wild. In it was ſet forth the occaſion of my journey, the manner of my being taken and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the proceedings of the ſeveral ſeſſions againſt me, and the errors in the indictment by which I was premunired. When the judge had read it, he ſhook his head, and ſaid, <q>We might try the validity or invalidity of the errors, if we would;</q> which was all they could get from him.</p>
                  <p>While I lay in priſon, it came upon me to ſtate our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to the king: not with particular relation to my own

                        <p>THE principle of the Quakers is the Spirit of Chriſt, who died for us, and is riſen for our juſtification; by which we know we are his. He dwelleth in us by his Spirit, and by the Spirit of Chriſt we are led out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and ungodlineſs. It brings us to deny all plottings and contrivings againſt the king, or any man. The Spirit of Chriſt brings us to deny all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, as lying, theft, murder, adultery, fornication, all uncleanneſs, debauchery, malice, hatred, deceit, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening and cheating whatſoever, and the devil and his works. The Spirit of Chriſt brings us to ſeek the peace and good of all men, and to live peaceably, and leads us from ſuch evil actions as the magiſtrate's ſword takes hold upon. Our deſire and labour is, that all who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians may walk in the Spirit of Chriſt; that they through the Spirit may mortify the deeds of the fleſh, and by the ſword of the Spirit may cut down ſin and evil in themſelves. Then the judges and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates would not have ſo much work in puniſhing ſin in the kingdom; neither then need kings or princes fear any of their ſubjects, if they all walked in the Spirit of Chriſt, for the fruits of the Spirit are love, righteouſneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, temperance, &amp;c.

                           </gap>ll that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians did walk in the Spirit of Chriſt, and by it did mortify ſin and evil, it would be a great eaſe to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and rulers, and would free them from a great deal of trouble, for it would lead all <q>to do unto others as they would have others do unto them,</q> and ſo the royal law of liberty would be fulſilled. For if all called Chriſtians did walk in the Spirit of Chriſt, by it to have the evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and its fruits mortified and cut down in them, then, not being led by the evil ſpirit, but by the good Spirit of Chriſt, the fruits of the good Spirit would appear in all. For as people are led by the good Spirit of Chriſt, it leads them out of ſin and evil, which the magiſtrate's ſword takes hold of, and ſo would be an eaſe to the magiſtrates. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="195" facs="unknown:037441_0711_100D7F95CE5098B8"/>to execute the law upon the ſinners and tranſgreſſors of the good Spirit. That Spirit, which leads people from all manner of ſin and evil, is one with the magiſtrate's power, and with the righteous law; for the law being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe of tranſgreſſion, that Spirit which leads out of tranſgreſſion muſt needs be one with that law which is againſt tranſgreſſors. So that Spirit which leads out of tranſgreſſion is the good Spirit of Chriſt, and is one with the magiſtrates in the higher power, and owns it and them; but that ſpirit which leads into tranſgreſſion is the bad ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is againſt the law, againſt the magiſtrates, and makes them a great deal of troubleſome work. The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the good Spirit is given to every man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and no man can proſit in the things of God but by the Spirit of God, which brings to deny all ſin and evil. It is ſaid of Iſrael, Nehem. ix. <q>The Lord gave them his good Spirit to inſtruct them, yet they rebelled againſt it.</q> If all people did mind this manifeſtation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which God hath given to inſtruct them, it would lead them to forſake all manner of ſin and evil, enmity, hatred, malice, unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs, and to mortify it. Then in the Spirit of Chriſt they would have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and unity, which is the bond of peace; then would love and peace, which are the fruits of the good Spirit, flow among all that are called Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>We are a people, who, intenderneſs of conſcience to the command of Chriſt and his apoſtle, cannot ſwear; for we are commanded in Matth. v. and James v. to keep to Yea and Nay, and <q>not to ſwear at all; neither by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath, leſt we go into evil, and fall into condemnation.</q> The words of Chriſt are theſe: <q>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by (or to) them of old time, Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths.</q> Theſe were true and ſolemn oaths, which thoſe who made ought to have performed in old time; but theſe Chriſt and his apoſtle forbad in the goſpel-times, as well as falſe and vain oaths. If we could take any oath at all, we could take the oath of allegiance, knowing that king Charles was by the power of God brought into England, and ſet up king of England, &amp;c. over the heads of our old perſecutors; and as for the pope's ſupremacy, we utterly deny it. And the apoſtle having commanded us not to ſwear, but to keep to Yea and Nay, we dare not break their commands;
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:037441_0712_100D92E9239A5D58"/>therefore many knowing this have put the oaths to us as a ſnare, that they might make a prey of us.

                  <p>About this time I had a ſit of ſickneſs, which brought me very low and weak in my body; and I continued ſo a pretty while, inſomuch that ſome friends began to doubt of my recovery, I ſeemed to myſelf to be amongſt the graves and dead corpſes; yet the inviſible power did ſecretly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, and conveyed refreſhing ſtrength into me, even when I was ſo weak that I was almoſt ſpeechleſs.

For I had rather have lain in priſon all my days, than come out in any way diſhonourable to truth: wherefore I choſe to have the validity of my indictment tried before the judges. Having firſt the opinion of a counſellor upon it (Thomas Corbet of London, whom Richard Davis of Welchpool was well acquainted with, and recommended to me) an Habeas Corpus was ſent to Worceſter, to bring me up once more to the King's Bench bar, for the trial of the errors in my indictment.

I aſked him, 'If the law did not call them ſo?' He aſked me, <q>What I thought of the church of England? Were there no Chriſtians among them?</q> I ſaid, <q>They are all called ſo, and there are many tender people amongſt them.</q> We
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:037441_0714_100D92ECF623A268"/>came to London the eighth of the twelfth month, and the eleventh I was brought before the four judges at the King's Bench, where counſellor Corbet ſtarted a new plea. He told the judges, <q>They could not impriſon any man upon a premunire.</q> Whereupon the chief juſtice Hale ſaid, <q>Mr. Corbet, you ſhould have come ſooner, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the term, with this plea.</q> He anſwered, <q>We could not get a copy of the return and the indictment.</q> The judge replied, <q>You ſhould have told us, and we would have forced them to have made a return ſooner.</q> Then ſaid judge Wild, <q>Mr. Corbet, you go upon general terms; and if it be ſo as you ſay, we have committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors at the Old Bailey, and in other courts.</q> Corbet was poſitive that by law they could not impriſon upon a premunire. The judge ſaid, <q>There is ſummons in the ſtatute.</q> 'Yes,' ſaid Corbet, <q>but ſummons is not impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, for ſummons is in order to a trial.</q> 'Well,' ſaid the judge, <q>we muſt have time to look in our books, and conſult the ſtatutes.</q> So the hearing was put off till next day.</p>
                  <p>The next day they choſe rather to let this plea fall, and begin with the errors of the indictment; and when they came to be opened, they were ſo many and groſs, that the judges were all of opinion the <q>indictment was quaſhed and void, and that I ought to have my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> There were that day ſeveral great men, lords and others, who had the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy tendered to them in open court, juſt before my trial came on; and ſome of my adverſaries moved the judges that the oaths might be tendered again to me, telling them, 'I was a dangerous man to be at liberty.' But judge Hale ſaid, <q>He had indeed heard ſome ſuch reports, but he had alſo heard many more good reports of me;</q> ſo he, with the reſt of the judges, ordered me to be freed by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus after I had ſuffered impriſonment a year and almoſt two months for nothing, I was fairly ſet at liberty upon a trial of the errors of my indictment, without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any pardon, or coming under any obligation or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement at all; and the Lord's everlaſting power went over all, to his glory and praiſe.

<pb n="199" facs="unknown:037441_0715_100D92EF0314BDF8"/>deal of honour by pleading George Fox's cauſe ſo in court.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the time of my impriſonment in Worceſter (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my want of health, and being ſo often hurried to and fro to London and back) I wrote ſeveral books for the preſs, one whereof was called, <q>A warning to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</q> another was, <q>To the Jews, proving by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that the Meſſiah is come;</q> another, <q>Concerning inſpiration, revelation, and prophecy;</q> another, <q>Againſt all vain diſputes;</q> another, <q>For all biſhops and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to try themſelves by the ſcriptures;</q> another. <q>To ſuch as ſay, We love none but ourſelves;</q> another, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, 'Our teſtimony concerning Chriſt;' and another little book 'concerning Swearing,' being the firſt of thoſe two given to the parliament. Beſides theſe, I wrote many papers and epiſtles to friends, to encourage and ſtrengthen them in their ſervices for God, which ſome (who made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of truth, but had given way to a ſeducing ſpirit, and were departed from the unity and fellowſhip of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in which friends ſtand) endeavoured to diſcourage them from; eſpecially in their diligent and watchful care for the well-ordering and managing the affairs of the church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Being at liberty, I viſited friends in London; and having been very weak, and not yet well recovered, I went to Kingſton; and having viſited friends there, returned to London, wrote a paper to the parliament, and ſent ſeveral books to them. A great book againſt ſwearing had been delivered to them a little before; the reaſonableneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had ſo much influence, that it was thought they would have done ſomething towards our relief if they had ſat lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I ſtaid in and near London till the yearly meeting, to which friends came from moſt parts of the nation, and ſome from beyond ſea. A glorious meeting we had in the everlaſting power of God.</p>
                  <p>This meeting over, and the parliament riſen (who had done nothing for nor againſt friends) I was clear of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Lord at London. And having taken my leave of friends there, and had a glorious meeting with ſome of them at John Elſon's in the morning, I ſet forward with my wiſe and her daughter Suſan by coach (for I was not able to travel on horſeback) towards the north, many friends accompanying us as far as Highgate, and ſome to Danſtable, where we lodged that night. We viſited friends and were
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:037441_0716_100D93BA0803D1A0"/>viſited by them at Newport-Pagnel, Northampton, and Coſſel, where, amongſt others, came a woman, and brought her daughter for me to ſee how well ſhe was; putting me in mind, <q>That when I was there before, ſhe had brought her to me much troubled with the king's evil, and had then deſired me to pray for her.</q> Which I did, and ſhe mended upon it; praiſed be the Lord! From Coſſel we went by John Simcock's and William Gandy's to Warring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Preſton and Lancaſter.</p>
                  <p>I had not been at Lancaſter ſince I was carried priſoner from thence by the under-ſheriff and gaoler, towards Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough caſtle in Yorkſhire. I found the town full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for it was fair-time, and the trained bands were met upon a general muſter. Many friends were alſo in town from ſeveral parts of the county, becauſe the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to be there next day. I ſtaid two nights and a day at Lancaſter, and viſited friends both at their men's and women's meetings, which were very full, large, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for the Lord's power was over all, and none meddled with us. Here met us Thomas Lower and his wife, Sarah Fell, James Lancaſter, and Leonard Fell. The next day after the meeting, the twenty-fifth of the fourth month, we went over the ſands, with ſeveral other friends to Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>After I had been awhile at Swarthmore, ſeveral friends from divers parts of the nation came to viſit me, and ſome out of Scotland; by whom I underſtood, four young ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Aberdeen were convinced there this year, at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute held by Robert Barclay and George Keith with ſome of the ſcholars of that univerſity.</p>
                  <p>Among others, colonel Kirby paid me a viſit, who had been one of my great perſecutors; but now he ſaid he came to bid me welcome into the country, and carried himſelf in appearance very lovingly; yet before I left Swarthmore he ſent for the conſtables of Ulverſtone, and ordered them to tell me, <q>That we muſt have no more meetings at Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; for if we had, they were commanded by him to break them up, and were to come the next firſt-day.</q> That day we had a very precious meeting, the Lord's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was wonderful amongſt us, and the conſtables did not come to diſturb us. The meetings have been quiet ſince, and have increaſed.</p>
                  <p>The illneſs I got in my impriſonment at Worceſter had ſo much weakened me, it was long before I recovered my
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:037441_0717_100D7FA24B9A8CF0"/>natural ſtrength again. For which reaſon, and as I had many things lay upon me to write for public and private ſervice, I did not ſtir much abroad during the time I now ſtaid in the north; but when friends were not with me, ſpent pretty much time in writing books and papers for truth's ſervice. While I was at Swarthmore, I gave ſeveral to be printed; viz.</p>
                  <p>One, 'Concerning ſwearing.'</p>
                  <p>Another, ſhewing, <q>That none are ſucceſſors to the prophets and apoſtles, but who ſucceed them in the ſame power and Holy Ghoſt that they were in.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another, ſhewing, <q>That poſſeſſion is above profeſſion; and how the profeſſors now do perſecute Chriſt in ſpirit, as the profeſſing Jews did perſecute him outwardly in the days of his fleſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another little book, 'To the magiſtrates of Dantzick.'</p>
                  <p>Another, called, <q>Cain againſt Abel; or, An anſwer to the New-England men's laws.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another, 'To friends at Nevis, concerning watching.'</p>
                  <p>Another, 'A general epiſtle to all friends in America.'</p>
                  <p>Another, 'Concerning Caeſar's due, and God's due, &amp;c.'</p>
                  <p>Another, 'Concerning ordering of families.'</p>
                  <p>Another, intituled, 'The ſpiritual man judgeth all things.'</p>
                  <p>Another, 'Concerning the higher power.'</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, I wrote ſeveral epiſtles to friends, both in England and beyond the ſeas; and anſwers to divers papers concerning the <q>running out of ſome who had oppoſed the order of the goſpel,</q> had ſtirred up a great deal of ſtrife and contention in Weſtmoreland. Wherefore I was moved to write a few lines particularly to friends there.</p>

                        <p>ALL live in the power of God, in his light and Spirit, which did firſt convince you; that in it ye may keep in the ancient unity, in humility, in the fear of the Lord, and his gentle and peaceable wiſdom, which is eaſy to be intreated. That in the ſame power, light, and Spirit of God, ye may be ſerviceable in your men's and women's meetings, in the poſſeſſion of the goſpel-order; which goſpel, the power of God, hath brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light; that in this ye may ſee over him that hath darkened you. In this power no apoſtates can come; for the power of God was before apoſtates were, or the fall of

Therefore praiſe God in the eternal fellowſhip of the everlaſting goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, which is not of man, nor by man. And all friends in Weſt moreland, keep in the power of God, which will and muſt preſerve and cover you, if ye be preſerved. Let your faith ſtand in the power of God, and not in the wiſdom of men's words, leſt ye fall. In God's power ye have peace, life, and unity; and for want of keeping in God's power, in his righteouſneſs and Holy Ghoſt, is all this ſtrife come among you.</p>

                  <p>I alſo wrote the following general epiſtle to friends at the yearly meeting in London:</p>

                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>My dear friends and brethren,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>WHOM the Lord hath preſerved by his eternal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to this day, over and through many troubles, ſtorms, tempeſts, and priſons. Let every one's faith ſtand in the power of God, which is over the devil, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Your faith ſtanding in the inviſible power of God, it ſtands in that which does not change; and the faith that Chriſt Jeſus, the power of God, is the author of, muſt ſtand in the power of God, ſo then it ſtands in that which is over all, in which they are eſtabliſhed. This the apoſtle brought the church, the true Chriſtians, to: and ſo ought all the true Chriſtians faith now, which Chriſt is the author of, to ſtand in the power of God, in which the everlaſting kingdom ſtands. As every one's faith ſtands in this power, it keeps all in the power of godlineſs.</p>
                        <p>For as it was in the days of the apoſtles, when ſome were crying up Paul and Apollos, and ſo forth, he judged them as carnal; and exhorted and admoniſhed them that their faith ſhould not ſtand in men, nor in the words of man's wiſdom, but in the power of God. He ſaid, <q>He would not know the ſpeech of them, but the power amongſt them, for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</q> So it is to be now. Every one's faith muſt ſtand in the power of God, and not in men, nor their ſpeeches upon the good words. For we have ſeen by experience, when they begin to cry up men, and their faith ſtands in them; ſuch as would have people's faith to ſtand in them, love popularity, and bring not people's faith to ſtand in
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:037441_0719_100D92F462F858C8"/>the power of God. Such cannot exalt Chriſt; and when ſuch fall, they draw a great company after them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apoſtle would not know ſuch after the fleſh, but them that were in the power and Spirit; and ſtruck down every one's faith that ſtood in the words of man's wiſdom, that they might ſtand in the power of God. So it muſt be now. They whoſe faith doth not ſtand therein, cannot exalt his kingdom, that ſtands in power; therefore every one's faith muſt ſtand in the power of God.</p>
                        <p>The apoſtle denied popularity, when he judged the Corinthians for looking at Paul and Apollos, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: ſuch are carnal ſtill. Therefore all ſhould know one another in the Spirit, life, and power, and look at Chriſt; this keeps all in humility. They, whoſe faith ſtands in men, will make ſects; as in the days of J. N. J. P. and others. The faith of ſuch, Chriſt is not the author of; if he hath been, they have erred from it, and made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck of it. All that are in the true faith, that ſtands in the power of God, will judge them as carnal, and judge down that carnal part in them, that cries up Paul or Apollos; that their faith may ſtand in the power of God, and that they may exalt Chriſt, the author of it. For every one's eye ought to be to Jeſus, and every juſt man and woman may live by their faith, which Chriſt is the author and finiſher of. By this faith every man may ſee God, who is inviſible; which faith gives the victory, and thereby he hath acceſs to God. So every one's faith and hope ſtanding in the power of God, therein all have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, victory, and acceſs to God's throne of grace; in which faith they pleaſe God. By this faith they are ſaved, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the good report, and ſubdue all the mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and God.</p>
                        <p>This power hath preſerved friends over their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, over the wrath of men, above the ſpoiling of their goods, and impriſonments; as ſeeing God, that <q>created all, gives the increaſe of all, and upholds all by his word and power.</q> Therefore let every one's faith be in his power. In this no ſchiſm nor ſect can come, for it is over them, before they were, and will be when they are gone. But perfect unity is in the truth, in the Spirit, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſeth the body of death, puts off the ſins of the fleſh, and plunges it down with the Spirit. In the Spirit of God there is perfect fellowſhip; and Chriſt is the miniſter of this circumciſion and baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="204" facs="unknown:037441_0720_100D92F5F8A97670"/>
This is upon me from the Lord to write unto you, that every one of you, whoſe faith Jeſus is the author of, may ſtand in the power of God. From the Lord I warn you, and all every where of the ſame; for if a ſtar ſhould fall, which has been a light, either the earth or the ſea does receive it: that is, the earthly mind, or the foaming, raging people: though neither the ſeed, light, power, nor truth ever fell, nor the faith itſelf, the gift of God; but men going from it, become unſavoury.</p>
                        <p>Adam, whilſt he kept in truth, and obeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, was happy; but when he diſobeyed the Lord, he ſell under the power of Satan, and became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, though he might talk after of his experiences in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; but he had loſt his image, and his power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, that God created him in.</p>
                        <p>The Jews, after they received the law, as long as they kept the law of God, which was juſt, holy, good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it kept them good, juſt, holy, and ſavoury; but when they turned their backs on the Lord, and forſook his law, they came under the power of darkneſs, under the powers of the earth, and were trodden under as unſavoury.</p>
                        <p>The Chriſtians were called a <q>city ſet on a hill, the light of the world, and the ſalt of the earth;</q> but when they forſook the power of God, and their faith ſtood in words and men, and not in the power; then their walls fell down, though the power in itſelf ſtood; and they loſt their hill, their ſaltneſs, and their ſhining, And as Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom now confeſſeth, they are not in the ſame power and ſpirit the apoſtles were in, ſo not in the ſame ſalt, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame hill. So they came to be trod under, and the beaſt, the whore, and the falſe prophet are uppermoſt, the unſavoury. Their dead faith is in men, and in words; therefore they are full of ſects, and one againſt another.</p>
                        <p>And now th e everlaſting goſpel, the power of God, is preached again, which was before the devil was, that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened man; and by this power of God life and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is come to light again; therefore every one's faith is to ſtand in this power that hath brought life and immortality to light in them, and ſo to be heirs of the power of God, the goſpel. Herein all have a right to the power of God, which is the authority of men's and women's meetings, and of all other meetings ſet up thereby.</p>
                        <p>As the goſpel is preached again, if your faith doth not ſtand in the power, but in men, and in the wiſdom of
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:037441_0721_100D92F805FA0B68"/>words, you will grow carnal; and ſuch are for judgment, who cry up Paul or Apollos, and not Chriſt, the author of your faith. Thoſe that love to be popular would have people's faith ſtand in them; ſuch do not preach Chriſt, but themſelves. But ſuch as preach Chriſt and his goſpel would have every man and woman to be in the poſſeſſion of it, and every man and woman's faith to ſtand in Chriſt, the author of it, and in the power of God, in which, as their faith ſtands, nothing can get betwixt them and God; for if any ſhould fall amongſt us, as too many have done, that leads its followers either into the waters or into the earth.</p>
                        <p>If any ſhould go from the ſpirit of prophecy, that did open them, and from the power, they may ſpeak thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences the power opened to them formerly. So might Adam and Eve ſpeak of what they ſaw and enjoyed in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; ſo might Cain and Balaam, of what they ſaw; and alſo the Jews, Corah, and Dathan, who praiſed God on the banks, ſaw the victory over Pharaoh, ate of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, drak of the rock, came to mount Sinai, and ſaw the glory of the Lord. So might the falſe apoſtles ſpeak of their experiences, and all thoſe falſe Chriſtians that turned from the apoſtles and Chriſt. So may ſuch do now, that err from the Spirit, that are come out of ſpiritual Egypt and Sodom, and have known the raging of the Sodomites, as Lot did the outward; and the purſuit of the ſpiritual Egyptians, as the outward Jew did the outward Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yet if they do not walk in the Spirit of God, in the light, and in the grace, which keeps their hearts eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their words ſeaſoned, and their faith in the power of God, in which the kingdom ſtands, they may go forth like the falſe Chriſtians, like the Jews, like Adam and Eve, Cain, Corah, and Balaam and be wandering ſtars, trees without fruit, wells without water, and clouds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rain; and ſo come to be unſavoury, trodden down, and as Adam who loſt paradiſe, and the Jews who loſt the Holy Land, not walking in the law, and keeping the command of God; and as the Chriſtians who loſt the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the hill, the ſalt, and the light, ſince the apoſtles days, and came to be unſavoury, and to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
                        <p>Therefore let every one's faith ſtand in the Lord's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is over all, through which they may be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rock, the foundation of God, the ſeed Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:037441_0722_100D92FA91CB11A8"/>So all in Chriſt may be ever freſh and green; for he is the green tree that never withers, all are freſh and green that are grafted in him, abide in him, and bring forth heavenly freſh fruits to the praiſe of God. And tho' Adam and Eve fell from paradiſe, the Jews fell from the law of God, many of the Chriſtians fell form their prophecies, erred from the faith, the Spirit, and the grace; and the ſtars have fallen, as was ſpoken in the Revelations; yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, grace, faith, and power of God remains.</p>
                        <p>Many ſuch ſtates have I ſeen within theſe twenty-eight years; though there is a ſtate that ſhall never fall, nor be deceived, in the Elect before the world began, who are come to the end of the prophecies, and are in him, where they end, renewed up into the image of God (by Chriſt) which man was in before he fell; in that power, where he had dominion over all that God made; and not only ſo, but <q>attain to a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</q> who never fell. In him is the ſitting down in life eternal, where their feet ſtand ſure and faſt in the goſpel, his power. Here their bread is ſure; and he that eats this bread lives for ever.</p>
                        <p>And all friends and brethren, that declare God's eternal truth and word of life, live in it, be ſeaſoned with grace, and ſalted with the heavenly ſalt, that your lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations may preach wherever you come; that there be no rawneſs, nor no quenching of the Spirit, nor deſpiſing prophecy either in men or women.

                        <p>And friends that are miniſters, poſſeſs as if ye did not; be married as if ye were not; be looſe to the world in the Lord's power; for God's oil will be atop of all viſible things, which makes his lamps burn, and give light afar off.

                        <p>Now friends, concerning faithful men and women's meetings, which were ſet up in God's counſel, whoever
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:037441_0723_100D92FCB1867780"/>oppoſe them, oppoſe the power of God, which is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of them. They are no miniſters of the goſpel, nor of Chriſt, that oppoſe his power, which all are to poſſeſs. For the true miniſters of Chriſt, that preach his goſpel (which is to be preached to all nations) as deceit is gone over all nations, and all nations have drunk the whore's cup, and ſhe hath them in her cage, her unclean power from the beaſt and dragon, out of the power of God, and out of truth and the Spirit of God, the apoſtles were in; the power of God muſt come over all this again; and all true miniſters, that preach the goſpel, muſt bring people into the poſſeſſion of it again. I ſay, whoſoever preaches the goſpel of Chriſt and him to people and nations, thoſe people and nations receiving the goſpel, they receive the power of God, that brings life and immortality to light in them; and they ſee over the devil that hath darkened them, and the beaſt, the whore, and her cage. So by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, life and immortality is brought to light in them; then theſe men and women, being heirs of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the goſpel, are heirs of authority and power over the devil, beaſt, whore, and dragon.</p>
                        <p>It is their poſſeſſion and portion, and they are to labour in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>our men's and women's meetings, and other meetings in the name of Jeſus, the goſpel of Chriſt, the power of God, which is not of man, nor by man. In this are all to meet, and to worſhip God. By this are all to act, and in this have all fellowſhip, a joyful fellowſhip, a joyful and comfortable aſſembly. All faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men and women in every country, city, and nation, whoſe faith ſtands in the power of God, the goſpel of Chriſt, who have received the goſpel, and are in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof, have all right to the power in theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for they are heirs of the power, which is the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the men's and women's meetings.</p>
                        <p>So here is God's choice (and not man's) by his power, of his heirs; and they have all freedom therein to go to the meetings, the men to the men's, and the women to the women's, for they are heirs of the power, which is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Holy Ghoſt; and they ſee over enmity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, by the light, the life, and immortality, which is brought to light in them.</p>

The devil, the author of enmity, cannot get into this authority, power, order, nor fellowſhip of the goſpel, nor life, nor light, nor into the unity of the faith, which gives victory over him that hath ſeparated man from God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unity of this faith the ſerpent cannot come, nor into the worſhip of God in ſpirit and truth the devil cannot come, nor any enmity. And they that are in this, are in unity over him. Therefore, let every one's faith ſtand in the power of God, the glorious goſpel; all walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the goſpel and the order of it. As every one hath received Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord, ſo walk in him, and let him be their Lord and orderer. For the preaching of the goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus is to the intent that all might come to be heirs of the goſpel, into the poſſeſſion of it, to be heirs of Chriſt and of his government, to the increaſe of which there is no end; who is over all in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and over all in his light, life, power, and dominion. Therefore know one another in his power, his goſpel; know one another in Chriſt Jeſus, who is able to reſtore man out of the ſtate of the fall into the image of God, and into that power and dominion that man had before he fell, and into himſelf, that never fell, whence they ſhall go no more forth. Here is the rock and foundation of God that ſtands ſure.</p>
                        <p>And, friends, be tender to the tender principle of God in all. Shun the occaſion of vain diſputes and janglings, both amongſt yourſelves and others; for that many times is like a bluſtering wind, that hurts and bruiſes the tender buds and plants. For the world, though they have the words, are out of the life; and the apoſtle's diſputing with them was to bring them to the life. And thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters among the Chriſtians about genealogies, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the law, meats, drinks, and days, came to be the worſt ſort of diſputers, whom the apoſtles judged; for ſuch deſtroyed people from the faith. Therefore did the apoſtles exhort the churches, that every one's faith ſhould ſtand in the power of God, and to look at Jeſus the author of it. There every graft ſtands in Chriſt, the vine, quiet, where no bluſtering ſtorms can hurt them; there is the ſafety. There all are of one mind, one faith, one ſoul, one ſpirit, baptized into one body with the one ſpirit, and made all to drink into one ſpirit, one church, one head, that is heavenly and ſpiritual: and one faith in this head, Chriſt, who is the author of it, and hath the glory of it;
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:037441_0725_100D930021601CF8"/>one Lord to order all, who is the baptizer into this one body. So Chriſt hath the glory of his faith out of every man and woman; and the Father through him hath his glory, the Creator of all in his power, the goſpel that hath brought life and immortality to light in them; and their faith ſtanding in it, they know the immortal God, ſerve and worſhip him in his ſpirit and in his truth; by which they are made God's free men and women, from him that is out of the truth.</p>
                        <p>Now, friends, you that have been ancient labourers, and have known the dealings of the Lord theſe twenty years (more or leſs) as I have often ſaid to you, draw up what you can of that which the Lord hath carried you through by his power, the paſſages and ſufferings, and how by the Lord ye have been ſupported from the firſt; ſo that he may be exalted by his power now, and in ages to come, who hath been the only ſupport, defence, and ſtay of his people all along, over all to himſelf; to whom be all glory and praiſe for ever and ever. Amen. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it in his church throughout all ages, from his living members, who return the praiſe to the living God, who lives and reigns over all, bleſſed for ever; who is the life, ſtrength, health, and length of the days of his people. Therefore let there be no boaſting, but in the Lord, in his power and kingdom; that keeps all in humility.</p>
                        <p>And friends, in the Lord's power and truth, what good you can do for friends in priſon, or ſufferers, by informing or helping them, every one bend yourſelves to the Lord's power and ſpirit, to do his will and his buſineſs; and in that all will have a fellow-feeling of one another's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in bonds, or in what trials or tribulations ſoever; you will have a fellow-feeling one of another, having one head, one Lord, and being one body in him. For God's heavenly flail hath brought out his ſeed, his heavenly plough hath turned up the fallow ground, his heavenly ſeed is ſown by the heavenly man, which brings forth fruits to the heavenly ſower, in ſome fifty, ſixty, and an hundred fold in his life-time; and ſuch in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end will have life everlaſting.

                        <p>The Lord God of power preſerve you all in his power.
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:037441_0726_100D9301DA8C18C8"/>Let your faith ſtand therein, that you may have unity in the faith, and in the power; and by this faith and belief you may be all grafted into Chriſt, the ſure root and rock of ages, where the eternal Sun of righteouſneſs ſhines, in the heavenly and eternal day, upon his plants and graſts, This Sun never goes down, and the heavenly ſprings of life, and ſhowers are known to water and nouriſh the graſts, plants, and buds, that they may always be kept freſh and green, and never wither; bringing forth freſh, green, and living fruit, which is offered up to the living God; who is glorified, in that you bear much fruit. The Lord God Almighty keep you, and preſerve you all in his power, light, and life, over death and darkneſs; that therein you may ſpread his truth abroad, and be valiant for it upon the earth, anſwering that of God in all; that with it the minds of people may be turned to God, ſo that with it they may come to know Chriſt Jeſus in the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in which the knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the earth, as the waters do the ſea. His life muſt go over death, his light muſt go over darkneſs, and the power of God muſt go over the power of Satan.</p>
                        <p>So all you that are in the light, life, and power, keep the heavenly fellowſhip in the heavenly power, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly unity in the heavenly divine faith, and the unity of the ſpirit, which is the bond of the heavenly Prince of Princes peace; who bruiſes the head of the enemy, the adverſary, and reconciles man to God, and all things in heaven and earth. A bleſſed reconciliation! Let every one's faith ſtand in the power of God, which Jeſus Chriſt is the author of; that all may know their crown of life. For all outward things, without the ſubſtance, the life, the power, are as the huſk without the kernel, and do not nouriſh the immortal ſoul, nor the new-born Babe; but that which it is nouriſhed by, is the milk of the word, whereby it groweth in the heavenly life, ſtrength, and wiſdom. The goſpel is not of man, nor by man, but is the power of God, and anſwers the truth in all: all the poſſeſſors of it are to ſee that all walk according to it; which everlaſting order is ordained of God already, and all the poſſeſſors of him poſſeſs their joy, their comfort, and ſalvation. My love unto you all, with him that reigns, and is over all, from everlaſting to everlaſting.</p>
                        <p>Dwell in the love of God, which paſſeth knowledge, and edifieth the living members of the body of Chriſt;

There hath been ſome ſcruple about men's and women's meetings: men and women in the goſpel are heirs of the power, which was before the devil was; heirs of this, then enter into the poſſeſſion of it, and do the Lord's buſineſs therein.

                  <p>During this time, I collected together as many as I could of the epiſtles I had wrote in former years to friends. I made a collection too of the ſeveral papers I had wrote to Oliver Cromwel and his ſon Richard, in the time of their protectorſhips, and to the parliaments and magiſtrates, in their times. I collected alſo the papers I had wrote to king Charles the Second ſince his return, and to his council and parliaments, and the juſtices or other magiſtrates under him. I made another collection of certificates, which I had received from divers governors of places, judges, juſtices, parliament-men, and others, for the clearing of me from many ſlanders, which the envious prieſts and profeſſors, both here and beyond ſea, had caſt upon me. This I did for the truth's ſake, knowing that their deſign in ſlandering me was to defame the truth publiſhed by me, and hinder the ſpreading thereof amongſt the people. Beſides theſe, I made two books of collections; one was, a liſt or cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the names of thoſe friends who went out of the north of England, when truth firſt broke forth there, to proclaim the day of the Lord through this nation. The other was of the names of thoſe friends that went firſt to preach the goſpel in other nations, countries, and places, in what years, and to what p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rts they went.</p>
                  <p>I made another collection, in two books; viz. one of
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:037441_0729_100D930A04DFB610"/>epiſtles and letters from friends and others, on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to me; the other of letters of mine to friends and others.</p>
                  <p>I wrote alſo a book of the types and figures of Chriſt, with their ſignifications; and many other things, which will be of ſervice to truth and friends in time to come.</p>
                  <p>I took notice alſo of thoſe who had run out from truth, drawn others out after them, and turned againſt truth and friends, ſince the firſt breaking forth of truth in this latter age, and what became of them; noting particularly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and return of ſuch of them as came back to truth again. Some ran quite out, and never returned, but were cut off in their gainſaying and rebellion; for the word and power of God hath blaſted, and is blaſting them, and the holy ſeed hath ground, and is grinding them to pieces. I have obſerved that they, who have been convinced, and have not lived and walked in the truth, have been the worſt enemies to the truth, and done moſt hurt amongſt friends in the truth, and to others. In theſe I have ſeen fulfilled what the Lord did long ſince ſhew me, <q>That ſuch would be greater deceivers than all the prieſts and profeſſors.</q> For ſuch as came as far as Cain, Balaam, Corah, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who could 'preach Chriſt,' and ſay, <q>They had preached in his name;</q> ſuch as came to be apoſtles, and had taſted of the power of Chriſt, and then turned from it, ſuch could yet ſpeak their old experiences, and have good words like Corah and Balaam; but not keeping in the life and truth, they deceived the hearts of the ſimple. Such come to be of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>evil, who abode not in the truth; as Cain and all the Jews that abode not in the truth were. For though Cain did ſacrifice to God, and did talk with God, and the Jews could talk of Abraham, Moſes, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet Chriſt told them, <q>They were of their father the devil.</q> In like manner, though thoſe called Chriſtians can talk of Chriſt, and uſe his and his apoſtles and diſciples words, yet not abiding in the truth, power, and ſpirit the apoſtles were in, they are of the devil, out of truth, and do his work. So are all thoſe that have been convinced of God's eternal truth ſince it ſprang up in this nation, that have not abode in the light, in the ſpirit and power of Chriſt Jeſus, but have turned againſt the power, and have oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work thereof; though they may retain their former experiences, and be able to ſpeak many good words, yet not living in the life and power that gave them thoſe experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:037441_0730_100D930C7939A880"/>they live in the power of darkneſs, which is of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and by the light and truth both he and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and muſt own their condemnation, if ever they come to truth again. For to reſiſt the heavenly power, and to oppoſe the workings and divine manifeſtations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of through any, is not a light matter. And as I had been moved of the Lord to travel in his power round this nation, and in other parts, to preach the everlaſting goſpel, and to declare the word of life, which was in the beginning, through many impriſonments, hardſhips, ſufferings, and trials: ſo I was afterwards moved to travel in the ſame heavenly power about the nation again (and to write to ſuch places where I came not) to recommend unto friends the <q>ſetting up of the quarterly and monthly meetings in all counties, for looking after the poor, taking care for orderly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in marriages, and other matters relating to the church of Chriſt.</q> Though ſome meetings for this end were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled 'in the north of England in the year 1652.</p>
                  <p>After this alſo, truth ſtill ſpreading further over the nation, and friends increaſing in number, I was moved by the ſame eternal power to recommend the ſetting up women's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings alſo, that all, both male and female, who had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpel, the word of eternal life, might come into the order of the goſpel, brought forth by the power of God, and might act for God in the power, and therein do buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſervice for him in his church. All the faithful muſt labour in God's vineyard; they being his hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he having given them the earneſt of his Spirit. For a maſter that hires a ſervant, and gives him the earneſt of his hire, expects he ſhould do his work after he knows his will, in the outward creation; ſo all God's people that are of the new creation, and have received the earneſt of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ought to labour with, by, and in his Spirit, power, grace, and faith, in the light, in God's vineyard, that they may have their wages when they have done God's work and buſineſs in his day, which is eternal life. But none can labour in his vineyard, and do his work and will, but as they walk in the heavenly divine light, grace, and Spirit of Chriſt; which hath been, and is my travail and labour in the Lord to turn all to.</p>
                  <p>Some that profeſſed truth, and had made a great ſhew thereof, being gone from the ſimplicity of the goſpel into jangling, diviſion, and a ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to write the following epiſtle, and ſend it among friends, for the diſcovering of that ſpirit by which thoſe oppoſers were acted, its work and way by which it wrought, and to warn friends of it, that they might not be betrayed by it.</p>

But all that are in the life, ſpirit, light, grace, truth, and power of God, bar it out; and ſuch as ſit under their own vine, Chriſt Jeſus, and are grafted into him, have no need of their exhortation or counſel; for the true believers are entered into their reſt. Therefore all keep in the goſpel of peace, and they that be heirs of the kingdom keep your poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
                        <p>Some of this ſpirit have ſaid to me, <q>They ſee no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in women's meetings.</q> My anſwer is, and hath been to ſuch, If they be blind and without ſight, they ſhould not oppoſe others; for none impoſe any thing upon them, God never received the blind for a ſacrifice, neither can his people. But Chriſt has enlightened all; and to as many as receive him, he gives <q>power to become the ſons of God.</q> Such as are heirs of his power, and of his goſpel, which brings life and immortality to light, can ſee over him that has darkened thoſe; and all ſuch keep the order of the Goſpel, the power of God, and their meetings therein, which preſerves them in life and immortality. Theſe ſee the great ſervice of men's and women's meetings, in
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:037441_0732_100D9310F3679F48"/>the order of the goſpel, the power of God; for they are meet-helps in this power, which is the authority of their meetings. I ſay to all you that be againſt men's and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meetings, who ſay, <q>you ſee no ſervice for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meetings,</q> and oppoſe them; you are therein out of the power of God, and his Spirit you live not in. For God ſaw a ſervice for the aſſemblies of the women in the time of the law, about thoſe things that appertained to his worſhip and ſervice, and to the holy things of his taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; and they in his Spirit ſee now their ſervice in the goſpel, many things in theſe meetings being more proper for the women than the men; and they, in the power and wiſdom of God, may inform the men of ſuch things as are not proper for them; and the men may inform the women of ſuch things as are not proper for them, as meet-helps to each other. For in the time of the law, the women were to offer as well as the men; ſo in the time of the goſpel they are to offer their ſpiritual ſacrifices; for they are all called, both men and women, a royal prieſthood, the houſehold of faith, the living ſtones, that make up the ſpiritual building, which Chriſt is the head of; and are to be encouraged in their labour in the goſpel; for all things that both men and women do, are to be done in the power of God. Such as ſee no ſervice for theſe women's meetings, or the men's, but oppoſe them, and make ſtrife among friends, are in the ſpirit of the world that is againſt and forbids our other meetings, in the ſame ſpirit that hath been and is againſt women's ſpeaking in meetings, and ſay, <q>They muſt be ſilent,</q> &amp;c. though the ſame apoſtle commands, <q>That men ſhould keep ſilence as well as the women,</q> if there were not an interpreter. You may ſee the ſpirit of the world hath entered ſuch oppoſers, though they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another colour; for they would not have us to meet at all. Theſe are againſt women's meetings, and ſome of them againſt men's alſo, and ſay, <q>They ſee no ſervice for them;</q> then they may hold their tongues, and not oppoſe them that do ſee their ſervice for God in theſe meetings.</p>
                        <p>Therefore all you that ſeel the power of God, and your ſervice for God in them, both men and women, keep your meetings in the power of God, the authority of them, as they were ſettled in it; then ye will be preſerved both over this ſpirit that oppoſes them, and over the ſpirit of the world that oppoſes your other meetings; for it is all
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:037441_0733_100D93129AE90DA8"/>one in the ground, and would bring you into bondage. Such as are out of the peaceable goſpel oppoſe its order; and out of the faith that works by love, out of the wiſdom that is gentle, eaſy, and peaceable, &amp;c. and out of the kingdom that ſtands in peace and joy. Therefore keep over that ſpirit that ſows diſcord or diſſenſion, and would draw you from your habitation and poſſeſſion in the order of the goſpel; for it is the ſame ſpirit that deceived Adam and Eve, by which they loſt their habitation in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, and their dominion; ſo that ſpirit got over them, and it would get over you. One while it will tell you. "It ſees no ſervice for your meetings;" and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time oppoſe you. But I ſay, this is the blind ſpirit which is out of the power of God, and which the power of God is over. Therefore keep in the power, that ye may ſtand for your liberty in Chriſt Jeſus, males and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, heirs of him, of his goſpel, and his order. Stand up for your liberty in the goſpel, and in the faith, which Chriſt Jeſus hath been the author of; for if ye loſe it, and let another ſpirit get over you, ye will not ſoon regain it. I knew Satan would beſtir himſelf in his inſtruments, when men's and women's meetings came to be ſet up in the power, light, and truth, and the heirs of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to take their poſſeſſion of it in every county and city, therein to walk, watch over one another, and take care of God's glory and honour, and his precious truth, and to ſee that all walk in the truth as becomes the goſpel, and to ſee that nothing was lacking; and ſo whatſoever was decent, modeſt, virtuous, lovely, comely, righteous, and of good report, to follow after; and to admoniſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all that were not faithful, and to rebuke all that did evil. I knew this would give ſuch a check to all looſe ſpeakers, talkers, and walkers, that there would be an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt ſuch meetings. But heed it not, truth will come over them all, and is over them all, and faith muſt have the victory; for the goſpel and its order is everlaſting, the Seed (Chriſt) is the beginning and the ending, and will outlaſt all; the Amen, in whom ye have peace. I ſay, all that oppoſe the men's and women's meetings, or that marriages ſhould be laid before them, or the recording of condemnations of ſin and evil, or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing or exhorting ſuch as walk not in the truth, are of a looſe ſpirit, and their ſpirits tend to looſeneſs. Let thoſe take them that will; truth will not have them, nor any of
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:037441_0734_100D9315B1C24030"/>their ſacrifice: for nothing is accepted of God but what is done in truth, and in his Spirit, which is peaceable. The authority of our men's and women's meetings is the power of God; all the heirs of the goſpel are heirs of that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dignity; this is of God, and ſhall anſwer the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in all. The greateſt oppoſers of this practice and work are ſuch as have been convinced of God's truth, but have not lived in it. Such were the greateſt troublers of the church in Moſes's day, and in the days of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; but mark their end, and read what became of them all. Therefore all keep your habitation in the truth, and therein ye may ſee what became of all the oppoſers of it for twenty years paſt: they are all gone, and the truth lives and reigns; the Seed is over all, and all are one in it, in reſt, peace, and life everlaſting; and therein they ſit down together in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, the Amen.</p>

                  <p>While I was at Swarthmore, died William Lampit, prieſt of Ulverſtone (the pariſh that Swarthmore is in.) He was an old deceiver, and perverter of the right way of the Lord, and a perſecutor of the people of God. Much conteſt I had with him when I firſt came into thoſe parts. He had been an old falſe prophet: for in the year 1652 be prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied (and ſaid he would wage his life upon it) <q>that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers would all vaniſh and come to nought within half a year:</q> but he came to nought himſelf. For he continued in his falſe accuſing of God's people till a little before he died, and then cried for a little reſt. To one of his hearers, that came to viſit him before he died, he ſaid, <q>I have been a preacher a long time, and thought I had lived well; but I did not think it had been ſo hard a thing to die.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I had ſiniſhed the ſervices which lay upon me then to do, ſeeling my ſpirit drawn towards the ſouth (though I was but weak, and not able to travel far in a day) I left Swarthmore the twenty-ſixth of the firſt month 1677, and went to Thomas Pearſon's at Powbank in Weſtmoreland, where I had a meeting the next day; and from thence to Thomas Camm's at Camm's-gill, whither Robert Widders, with his wife and ſeveral other friends came to ſee me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I left the country, and to attend the meeting there the
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:037441_0735_100D9317B41B0510"/>next day, which was very large, and in which I was largely drawn forth in teſtimony to the truth. I had much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſome of that meeting, who were not in unity with the quarterly meeting they belonged to: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeveral of them, that were ſomewhat tender, came to ſee their error, and gave forth condemnations againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Next day John Blaykling came to Thomas Camm's, to bring me to his houſe at Drawell in Sedberg in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; whither I went with him, viſiting friends in the way. I ſtaid at Drawell two or three nights, having meetings there and thereabouts: for while I was there, the men's and women's meetings were held, which were very large and precious. The firſt-day following I had a meeting at Brig-flats, to which moſt of the friends from the ſeveral meetings round, with a great concourſe of other people, came; it was thought there were five or ſix hundred people. A very good meeting it was, wherein truth was largely declared and preciouſly opened, to the comforting and refreſhing the faithful, and the drawing near them that were afar off. I had another meeting at John Blaykling's, where came many friends that were going to the quarterly meeting at Kendal: with them my wife went back (who with her daughter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel had accompanied me thus far;) and I, having Leonard Fell with me, paſſed through Sedberg and Garſdale into Wenſydale, viſiting friends as we went. At night I reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Richard Robinſon's at Counterſide, where ſeveral friends came to me that evening; ſome of whom went with me next day to the widow Tenant's at Scarhouſe in Langſtroth-dale, whither we had much ado to get, the ſnow lay ſo deep, though it was a week in the ſecond month. Here on firſt-day we had a large meeting, friends coming to it from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts round about; and the Lord gave me a very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable teſtimony to bear amongſt them, which I did for ſeveral hours, to their great ſatisfaction and comfort. Thence paſſing through Biſhopſdale, Mildum, Barton, and by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Northallerton, I came to George Robinſon's at Burrowby, where alſo friends coming from ſeveral parts, we had a very large and good meeting, and very peaceable. Not long after, an envious juſtice, hearing I had a great meeting there, troubled friends about is, and made them appear at the ſeſſions, where he aſked them many enſnaring queſtions; for he knew not how to convict them, becauſe he had no proof againſt them. When he ſaw his queſtions did not catch them, he told them, <q>He had heard that
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:037441_0736_100D9319D46DC838"/>George Fox was at a large meeting with them, and they all ſat ſilent, and none ſpoke in the meeting.</q> This falſe ſtory he cunningly feigned, thinking thereby to have drawn ſome of the friends to have contradicted him, and have ſaid, 'That I had ſpoke in the meeting;' that he might have convicted them upon their own confeſſion, and have fined them. But friends ſtanding in the wiſdom of God, did not anſwer him according to his deſire, and ſo eſcaped his ſnare. But two friends that came out of Ireland having a meeting that evening about three miles off this evil-minded juſtice got information thereof, and fined friends, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them very ſorely for it.</p>
                  <p>I went from Burrowby to Iſaac Lindley's, calling upon friends as I went. Robert Lodge, and ſome friends with me, next day paſſed to York; and the day following, being firſt-day, I was at friends meeting at York, which was large and peaceable. The ſecond day alſo I ſtaid in York, and had two meetings with friends at John Taylor's, from whence I wrote to my wife, as followeth:</p>

In the power of the Lord I am brought to York, having had many meetings in the way. The way was many times deep and bad with ſnow, our horſes ſometimes were down, and we were not able to ride; ſometimes we had great ſtorms and rain, but by the power of the Lord I went through all. At Scarhouſe was a very large meeting, and another at Burrowby, to which friends came out of Cleveland and Biſhoprick; and many other meetings we have had. At York yeſterday we had a very large meeting, exceedingly thronged, friends being at it from many parts, and all quiet, and friends well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Oh! the glory of the Lord ſhined over all. This day we had a large men's and women's meeting, many friends, both men and women, and all was quiet. This evening we are to have the men's and women's meeting of the friends of the city. John Whitehead is here, with Robert Lodge and others: friends are mighty glad, above meaſure. So I am in my holy element, and holy work

                  <p>Leaving York, I viſited friends at Tadcaſter, Nottingly, Doncaſter, and Balby, having meetings as I went. At Balby I ſtaid the firſt-day meeting, and went next day to Thomas Stacy's at Ballowfield, where in the evening I had a meeting, to compoſe a difference that had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome that profeſſed truth, and they were reconciled.

I had a meeting with friends at his houſe that evening, and another the next day in friends publick meeting-houſe, which was peaceable and well.</p>
                  <p>I went the day following to John Fox's at Wymeſwould in Leiceſterſhire, where I had a meeting that evening: and next day to William Smith's at Sileby, where, it being firſt-day, we had a very large meeting: for beſides friends from ſeveral places, many of the town's-people, hearing I was there, came to the meeting, and heard the truth declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gladly. Next day I went to Leiceſter, where finding many friends come out of the country, to be at the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair next day, I had a very good meeting with them that night, and another next evening at William Wells's at Knighton, about a mile from Leiceſter. Next day I paſſed to Swanington, and had a meeting there: from thence to Samuel Fretwell's at Hartſhorn in Derbyſhire, where I had a meeting alſo; then to Henry Sidon's at Badgely in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire, and ſtaid the meeting there, which, being the firſt-day, was very large and peaceable, notwithſtanding a juſtice had threatened to come and break it up. I went in
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:037441_0738_100D931E8052FA30"/>the evening to Richard Baal's of Whittington, where ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral friends came to viſit me. Next day I went to Nathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Newton's at Hartſhill, where ſeveral friends met me, with whom I had good ſervice. After this I paſſed on, viſiting friends in divers places, till I came to Dingley, where a meeting was appointed before, which was very numerous, and truth was largely opened to the people: the meeting was peaceable, and the people generally ſober; ſaving that, while I was ſhewing how chriſtendom (ſo called) was gone from the pure religion that is underfiled, &amp;c. a man ruſhed out in a furious manner, and ſaid, 'I deny that.' After this meeting, I went with Thornas Charles to his houſe at Adingworth; and next day to Northampton, where I ſtaid the firſt-day meeting, which was very large and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I had much ſervice among friends beſides. Next day Edward Cooper of Northampton accompanied me to Olney in Buckinghamſhire, where I ſtaid at James Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie's, ſeveral friends coming to ſee me in the evening. Next day I went to a meeting at Turry in Bedfordſhire, to which friends came from ſeveral parts. It was a very large meeting. Here I met with William Dewſberry, who after the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing took me to his ſon-in-law John Ruſh's of Kempſton, where I ſtaid with William that night and moſt of the next day; paſſing thence towards the evening through Ampthill to Thomas Gamboll's of Bullocks-hill. William Dewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry went along with me, and ſeveral friends came to viſit vs. Next day, paſſing through Luton, I went to Market-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>treet, William Dewſberry accompanying me part of the way, and the day following Leonard Fell. I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Kenſworth, which was pretty large and peaceable; after which we viſited friends at Alban's, and next day at South Mims and Barnet. We came that night to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Haly's at Gutterſhedge in Hendon, Middleſex. Next day, being firſt-day, we had a very large meeting there, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends coming from London. I ſtaid ſecond-day, and the third went to William Mead's houſe at Highgate, with whom next day I went to London. It being fourth-day, I went to the meeting at Gracechurch-ſtreet, where friends and I were greatly refreſhed in each other in the Lord, and the Lord's power and Seed was ſet over all; bleſſed be his name for ever!</p>
                  <p>Thus it pleaſed the Lord to bring me ſaſe to London, tho' much wearied; for tho' I rode not very far in a day, yet thro' weakneſs of body, continual travelling was hard to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:037441_0739_100D9320DF1C2838"/>me. Beſides, I had not much reſt a-nights to refreſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for I often ſat up late with friends where I lodged, to inform and adviſe them in things wherein they were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when I was in bed, I was often hindered of ſleep by great pains in my head and teeth, occaſioned, as I thought, by cold I had taken by riding often in the rain. But the Lord's power was over all, and carried me through all, to his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>In my journey I obſerved a ſlackneſs and ſhortneſs in ſome that profeſſed truth, in keeping up the ancient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of truth againſt tithes: for where-ever that ſpirit got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance which wrought diviſion in the church, and oppoſed the men's and women's meetings, it weakened thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it in their teſtimony againſt tithes. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to give forth an 'Epiſtle to friends,' to ſtir up the pure mind in them, and to encourage and ſtrengthen them in their chriſtian teſtimony againſt that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian yoke of oppreſſion.</p>

                        <p>BE faithful to the Lord in your teſtimony for Jeſus, who hath ended the levitical prieſthood of Aaron that took tithes, and ſent his miniſters to give freely that which they had received of him freely, without a bag or a ſtaff. Chriſt's diſciples could not join with thoſe that made a trade of preaching. And as there was a teſtimony to be borne againſt thoſe tithes which were commanded in the law for Levi and Aaron, ſo there is a teſtimony to be borne againſt thoſe tithes which have been ſet up by man in the dark time of popery, and not ſet up by God nor Chriſt. To cry againſt the prieſts in words, and yet to give them means, and put into their mouths, that they may not prepare war againſt you, is a contradiction. Therefore take heed: for if the Lord bleſs you with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward creatures, and you beſtow them upon Baal's prieſts, he may juſtly require the outward things from you again which he hath given you; who ſaith, That his miniſters ſhould freely give, as they have freely received. So all the preachers for tithes and money, and the takers and payers of tithe, muſt be teſtified againſt in the Lord's power and Spirit; that all may ſtand up in their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for Jeſus Chriſt, in his power and ſpirit, againſt the tithe-mongers.

<pb n="224" facs="unknown:037441_0740_100D93226DFD9328"/>them, in this day of the Lord; and in the days of the martyrs they did witneſs againſt them.

Therefore in the power of the Lord maintain the war againſt the beaſt, and do not put into his mouth, leſt he cry peace to you; which peace you muſt not receive, but it muſt be broken and thrown out by the Spirit of God. Then in the ſame Spirit ye will receive the peace from the Son of peace, which the beaſt, the whore, and the world, with all their earthly teachers for the earth, made by man, cannot receive nor bereave you of.

                  <p>I came to London ten or twelve days before the yearly meeting; in which time I fell in with friends there in the ſervice of truth, viſiting them at the meetings. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament then ſitting, we prepared ſomething to lay before them, concerning ſeizing the third part of friends eſtates, as Popiſh recuſants; which was a great ſuffering, and a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we complained of; but no redreſs we got.</p>
                  <p>To the yearly meeting many friends came from moſt parts of the nation, and ſome out of Scotland, Holland, &amp;c. Very glorious meetings we had, wherein the Lord's power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preſence was very largely felt, and the affairs of truth were ſweetly carried on in the unity of the Spirit, to the ſatisfaction and comfort of the upright-hearted; bleſſed be the Lord for ever! After the yearly meeting, having ſtaid a week or two with friends in London, I went with William Penn to his houſe in Suſſex; John Burnyeate and ſome other friends being with us. As we paſſed through Surry, hearing the quarterly meeting for the county was that day, William Penn, John Burnyeate, and I went from the road to it; and after the meeting returning to our other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, went with them to William Penn's that night, which is forty miles from London. I ſtaid at Worminghurſt about three weeks, in which time John Burnyeate and I anſwered a very wicked and envious book, which Roger Williams, a prieſt of New-England (or ſome colony thereabouts; had written againſt truth and friends. When we had finiſhed that ſervice, we went with Stephen Smith to his houſ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Friends thereaway had been exceedingly plundered about two months before on the prieſt's account; for they took from Stephen Smith five kine (being all he had) for about fifty ſhillings tithes. From thence we went to Kingſton, and ſo to London, where I ſtaid not long: for it was upon me from the Lord to go into Holland, to viſit friends and to preach the goſpel there and in ſome parts of Germany. Wherefore ſetting things in order for my journey as faſt as I could, I took leave of friends at London, and with ſeveral other friends went down to Colcheſter in Eſſex, in order to my paſſage for Holland. Next day, being firſt-day, I was at the publick meeting of friends there, which was very large and peaceable. In the evening I had another large meeting, but not ſo publick, at John Furly's houſe, where I lodged. The day following was the women's meeting, which was alſo very large. Next day we paſſed to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, where Robert Duncon, and ſeveral other friends came to ſee us; and ſome from London that intended to go over with me. The packet-boat not being ready, we went to the meeting in the town, and a precious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we had together; for the Lord, according to his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed goodneſs, by his overcoming, refreſhing power, opened many mouths to declare his everlaſting truth, and to praiſe and glorify him. After the meeting, we returned to John Vandewall's, where I had lodged; and when the boat was ready (taking leave of friends) we that were bound for Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land went on board about the 9th hour in the evening, the 25th of the 5th month, 1677.</p>
                  <p>The friends that went over with me were William Penn, Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, John Furly and his brother, William Tailcoat, George Watts, and Iſabel Yeomans, one of my wife's daughters. About the firſt hour in the morning we weighed anchor, having a fair, briſk wind, which by the next morning brought us within ſight of Holland. But that day proving very clear and calm, we got forward but little till about the fourth hour in the afternoon, when a freſh gale aroſe, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us within a league of land. Then being becalmed, we caſt anchor for that night between the hours of nine and ten in the evening. But William Penn and Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay (underſtanding Benjamin Furly was come from Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam to the Briel to meet us) got two of the boatmen to let down a ſmall boat that belonged to the packet, and
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:037441_0742_100D932652F7AEB0"/>row them to ſhore: but before they could reach it, the gates were ſhut; and there being no houſe without the gate, they were fain to lie in a fiſher's boat all night. As ſoon as the gates were opened in the morning, they went in, and found Benjamin Furly, with other friends of Rotterdam, come to receive us; and they ſent a boat, with three young men in it, that lived with Benjamin Furly, who brought us to the Briel, where the friends received us with great gladneſs.</p>
                  <p>We ſtaid about two hours to refreſh ourſelves; and then took boat, with the Holland friends, for Rotterdam, where we arrived about the eleventh hour that day, the 28th of the fifth month 1677. I was very well this voyage, but ſome of the friends were ſea-ſick. A fine paſſage we had, and all came ſafe and well to land; bleſſed and praiſed be the name of the Lord for ever!</p>
                  <p>The next day, being firſt-day, we had two meetings at Benjamin Furly's, where many of the town's-people and ſome officers came in, and all were civil. Benjamin Furly or John Claus interpreted, when any friend declared. I ſpent the next day in viſiting friends. The day following, William Penn and I, with other friends, went towards Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, with ſome of that city, who came to Rotterdam to conduct us thither. We took boat in the afternoon, and, paſſing by Overkirk, came to Delft, through which we walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on foot; and then took boat again to Leyden, where we lodged that night at an inn. This is counted ſix Dutch miles from Rotterdam, which are eighteen Engliſh miles, and five hours ſail, or travelling; for our boat was drawn by an horſe that went on the ſhore. Next day taking boat again, we went to Harlem, fourteen miles from Leyden, where we had appointed a meeting, which proved very large. Many of the town's-people came in, and two of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Lord gave us a bleſſed opportunity, not only with reſpect to friends, but to other ſober people, and the meeting ended peaceably and well. After meeting we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Amſterdam, accompanied by ſeveral friends of that city and of Alkmaer.</p>
                  <p>Next day was the quarterly meeting at Amſterdam, to which came friends from Harlem, and Rotterdam, and with them thoſe of our company, whom we had left at Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, viz. Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, &amp;c. The meeting was at Gertrude Dirick Nieſon's. A very large and ſerviceable meeting it was. William Penn and I were drawn to open many things concerning the order of
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:037441_0743_100D932A07547ED0"/>the goſpel, and to ſhew the benefit and ſervice of yearly, quarterly and monthly meetings of men and women. We had another meeting at Gertrude's the next day, more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and very large, at which were profeſſors of ſeveral ſorts, unto whom the way of life and ſalvation was largely and livingly opened; which they hearkened very attentively to, none making any objection to what was declared. In the afternoon we had another meeting in the ſame place, but leſs, and more private. The day following we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of friends only, wherein by joint agreement were ſettled ſeveral meetings, to wit, monthly, quarterly, and a yearly meeting, to be held at Amſterdam for friends in all the United Provinces of Holland, and in Embden, the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Hamburgh, Frederickſtadt, Dantzick, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in and about Germany; which friends were very glad of, and it hath been of great ſervice to truth.</p>
                  <p>Next day an exerciſe came upon me concerning that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſpirit which wrought in ſome to make diviſions in the church, and the care of the churches being upon me, I was moved to write a few lines to warn friends of it, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>ALL friends, keep over that ſpirit of ſeparation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, in the peaceable truth, and in the Seed of life, which will wear it all out, and outlaſt it. For the Lamb will have the victory over all the ſpirits of ſtrife, as it hath had ſince the beginning; and they will wither, as others have done: but all that keep in the Seed, which is always green, ſhall never wither; as friends have been to this day kept. If any have backſlidden, thrown off the croſs, grown looſe and full, and gone into ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with their earthly ſpirits, and therein plead for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, this ſpirit taketh with looſe, earthly ſpirits, and cries impoſition to ſuch as admoniſh them to come to the life, light, Spirit, and power of God, that they may be made alive, and live again with the living. Upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition their ſpirits riſe into contention, ſtrife, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, turning againſt the living, in their looſe earthly ſpirits, which would have the name of truth, but are not in the nature of it, but are for eternal judgment of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seed. This is it which doth deceive, but it is judged by that which doth undeceive and ſave.</p>

This being firſt-day, we had a very large meeting, there coming to it a great concourſe of people of ſeveral opinions, Baptiſts, Seekers, Socinians, Browniſts, and ſome of the Collegians. Robert Barclay, George Keith, William Penn and I, did all ſeverally declare the everlaſting truth among them; opening the ſtate of man in the fall, and ſhewing by what way man and woman may come into the reſtoration by Chriſt Jeſus. The myſtery of iniquity and the myſtery of godlineſs were very plainly laid open, and the meeting ended quietly and well.</p>
                  <p>The day following, George Keith, Robert Barclay, and William Penn, leaving me and ſome other friends at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, ſet forward towards Germany, where they travelled many hundred miles, and had good ſervice for the Lord, Benjamin Furly going with them, and interpreting.</p>
                  <p>That day and the next I ſtaid at Amſterdam, viſiting friends, and aſſiſting them in ſome buſineſs concerning their meetings. Three Baptiſts came to diſcourſe with me, to whom I opened things to their ſatisfaction, and they parted from me in kindneſs. I wrote a letter alſo to the princeſs Elizabeth, which Iſabel Yeomans delivered to her, when George Keith's wife and ſhe went to viſit her.</p>

The wiſdom which is from above, by which all things
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:037441_0745_100D932E0C6CE0B0"/>were made and created, which the holy fear of God in the heart is the beginning of, keeps the heart clean. By this wiſdom are all God's children to be ordered, and with it come to order all things to God's glory. This is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is juſtified of her children. In this fear of God and wiſdom, my deſire is, that thou mayeſt be preſerved to God's glory. For the Lord is come to teach his people himſelf, and to ſet up his enſign, that the nations may flow unto it. There hath been an apoſtacy, ſince the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles days, from the divine light of Chriſt, which ſhould have given them the <q>light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus;</q> and from the Holy Spirit, which would have led them into all truth; and therefore have people ſet up ſo many leaders without them, to give them knowledge; and alſo from the holy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faith which Jeſus Chriſt is the author and finiſher of, which faith puriſies the heart, and gives victory over that which ſeparates from God; through which faith they have acceſs to God, and in which faith they pleaſe God, the myſtery of which is held in a pure conſcience. And alſo from the goſpel which was preached in the apoſtle's days (which goſpel is the power of God) which brings life and immortality to light in man and woman, by which people ſhould have ſeen over the devil that has darkened them; which goſpel will preſerve all them that receive it in life and immortality. For the eyes of people have been after men, and not after the Lord, who doth write his law in the hearts, and puts it into the minds of all the children of the new covenant of light, life, and grace; through which they all come to know the Lord, from the leaſt to the greateſt: ſo that the knowledge of the Lord may cover the earth, as the waters do the ſea. This work of the Lord is beginning again, as it was in the apoſtles days; people ſhall come to receive an unction in them from the Holy One, by which they ſhall know all things, and ſhall not need any man to teach them, but as the anointing doth teach them; and alſo to know what the righteouſneſs of faith ſpeaks, the word nigh in the heart and mouth to obey it, and to do it. This was the word of faith the apoſtles preached; which is now received and preached again, and is the duty of all true Chriſtians to receive. So now peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are coming out of the apoſtacy, to the light of Chriſt and his Spirit; to receive faith from him, and not from men; to receive the goſpel from him, their unction from
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:037441_0746_100D9330075E90F0"/>him, the Word; and as they receive him, they declare him freely, as his command was to his diſciples, and is ſtill to the learners and receivers of him. For the Lord God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt is come to teach his people, and to bring them from all the world's ways to Chriſt the way, the truth, and the life, who is the way to the Father; and from all the world's teachers and ſpeakers to him the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and teacher, as Heb. i. 1. and from all the world's worſhippers, to worſhip God in the Spirit and in the truth, which worſhip Chriſt ſet up above ſixtcen hundred years ago, when he put down the Jews worſhip at the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Jeruſalem, and the worſhip at the mourtain where Jacob's well was; and to bring people from all the world's religions, which they have made ſince the apoſtles days, to the religion that was ſet up by Chriſt and his apoſtles, which is pure and undeſiled before God, and keeps from the ſpots of the world; and to bring them out of all the world's churches and ſellowſhips, made and ſet up ſince the apoſtles days, to the church that is in God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Theſſ. i. 1. and to bring to the unity and fellowſhip in the Holy Spirit, that doth mortify, circumciſe, and baptize, to plunge down ſin and corruption, that has got up in man and woman by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. In this Holy Spirit there is holy fellowſhip and unity; yea, it is the bond of the Prince of Princes, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords peace: which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly peace all true Chriſtians are to maintain with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual weapons, not with carnal.</p>
                        <p>And now, my friend, the boly men of God wrote the ſcriptures as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt; and all Chriſtendom are on heaps about thoſe ſcriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not led by the ſame Holy Ghoſt as thoſe were that gave forth the ſcriptures; which Holy Ghoſt they muſt come to in themſelves, and be led by, if they come into all the truth of them, and to have the comfort of God, Chriſt, and them. For none can call Jeſus Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt; and all that call Chriſt Lord without the Holy Ghoſt, take his name in vain. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all that name his name are to depart from iniquity; then they name his name with reverence, in truth and righteouſneſs. O therefore feel the grace and truth in thy heart, that is come by Jeſus Chriſt, that will teach thee how to live, and what to deny. It will eſtabliſh thy heart, ſeaſon thy words, and bring thy ſalvation, and will be a
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:037441_0747_100D9331F8B6EBC0"/>teacher unto thee at all times. By it thou mayeſt receive Chriſt, from whence it comes; and as many as receive him, to them he gives power not only to ſtand againſt ſin and evil, but to become the ſons of God: if ſons, then heirs of a life, and a world and kingdom without end, and of the eternal riches and treaſures thereof. So in haſte, with my love in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who taſted death for every man, and bruiſes the ſerpent's head, that has been betwixt God and man, that through Chriſt man may come to God again, and praiſe him through Jeſus Chriſt the Amen, the ſpiritual, heavenly rock and foundation for all God's people to build upon, to the praiſe and glory of God, who is over all, bleſſed for evermore!</p>

                  <p>Next day John Claus and I paſſed to Buyckſlote, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merent, and Alkmaer, about thirty miles from Amſterdam. We went to a friend's whoſe name was Willem Willems, where I had a meeting that night. I had another next day, which was larger: ſeveral profeſſors came, and all was quiet and well. After the meeting I viſited ſome friends; then, taking boat, paſſed to Hoorn, counted the chief city in North Holland. We lodged at an inn; and, taking wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:037441_0748_100D933412CB0130"/>early next morning, we paſſed to Enckhuyſen, where we took ſhip for Frieſland; and, landing in the afternoon at Workum, took water, and rode upon the high bank of the Friezen ſeas, till we met two friends coming with a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to meet us, with whom we went to Harlingen, the chief ſea-port town in Frieſland. We went to Heſſel Jacobs's, whither ſeveral friends came to viſit us that night. Next day we viſited the friends of the place; and I wrote a paper, directed. <q>To all them that perſecute friends for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their faſt-day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day following being firſt-day, friends had a meeting there, to which we went, and many profeſſors came to it. I declared the everlaſting goſpel amongſt them, John Claus interpreting. They were all very civil, and heard attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and when the meeting was done, departed peaceably, without making any oppoſition. After meeting I went to Heſſel Jacobs's again, whither after awhile came a Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, to aſk me ſome queſtions, which I anſwered to his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and he departed friendly. Soon after he was gone, a preacher of the Collegians came to diſcourſe with me, who ſeemed well ſatisfied alſo, and we parted lovingly. That evening I had another meeting with the friends there, and next morning we paſſed to Leuwarden, the chief city in Frieſland, and lodged that night at a friend's houſe whoſe name was Sybrand Dowes.</p>
                  <p>Next morning early we paſſed to Dockum, and, walking through the city, took boat again to Strobus, which is the utmoſt part of Frieſland. There we baited at a commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's. Then taking boat, we paſſed to Groningen, the chief city of the province of Groningland. One of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates of that city came with us from Leuwarden, with whom I had ſome diſcourſe on the way; and he was very loving. We walked near three miles through the city; then took boat for Delfziel; and paſſing, in the evening, through Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingdalem, where had been a great horſe-fair that day, there came many officers ruſhing into the boat, who, being in drink, were very rude. I exhorted them to <q>fear the Lord, and beware of Solomon's vanities.</q> They were a ſort of boiſterous fellows; yet ſomewhat more civil afterwards. We landed at Delfziel about the tenth hour at night, having travelled much about fifty Engliſh miles that day. We went to an inn to lodge; and as we paſſed through the guards, they examined John Claus, whether I was not a
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:037441_0749_100D9335D0FC7708"/>militia ſoldier? He told them I was not, and they let us paſs peaceably.</p>
                  <p>Delfziel ſtands on the river Eems, over which we paſſed next day to Embden, where friends had been cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecuted, and from which they had been often baniſhed. I went to an inn, where I dined with ſome men that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Engliſh, with whom I had a fine time, and they were loving. Meanwhile John Claus went with his wife to her father's, in Embden; whither, after I had dined, I went alſo, underſtanding the old man was deſirous to ſee me. In the afternoon John Claus and I walked through the city, to the place where the waggon was to meet us: and while we tarried for it, the friends that were in the city came to the houſe where we were, and we had a little meeting. When the meeting was over, and the waggon came not, we ſent to know the reaſon. The maſter of the waggon ſent us word, he durſt not let his waggon go; for the biſhop of Munſter's ſoldiers were up in the country, and he was afraid they would take away his horſes. Being diſappointed of our paſſage, we returned to John Claus's father-in-law's houſe, where I left him, and went to my inn at night.</p>
                  <p>We took ſhipping next day, and paſſed about fifteen miles upon the river Eems, to a market-town in Eaſt Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, called Leer, where lived a friend that had been baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Embden. When we had viſited him, we hired a waggon, and paſſed to a garriſon-town called Strikehuyſen, where the guards examined us; and then we went to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, where hiring another waggon, we paſſed to another gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon town, where we were very ſtrictly examined. From thence we paſſed to Apre, in the king of Denmark's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where we lodged that night. In our travelling this day, we met the earl of Oldenburgh, going to the treaty of peace at Lembachie.</p>
                  <p>Next day we paſſed to Oldenburgh, lately a great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place, but then burnt down, and but few houſes left ſtanding in it. At this place we hired another waggon, and went to Delmenhurſt, where, after we had been examined by the guards, we went to a burgomaſter's to lodge, whoſe houſe was at an inn. There being many people, I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the way of truth to him and them, warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all evil-doers.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed next day to Bremen, a ſtately city in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and from thence, after a double examination, we went to a water called Overdeland, and there took boat to Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder;
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:037441_0750_100D933880E80E40"/>where finding pretty many people together, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the way of God to them, and exhorted them <q>to fear the Lord.</q> There we took waggon again, and travelled in the biſhop of Munſter's country, to Cloſter-Seven. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no inclination to ſtay there, we got freſh horſes, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to travel all night. Accordingly we went a little way; but it quickly grew ſo dark, and rained ſo hard, that we thought beſt to turn back again; for our waggon being open, we had no defence againſt the rain, and our cloaths were already wet with the rain that had fallen for ſeveral days before. So we went to an inn, and got a little freſh ſtraw; upon which we lay till about break of day, then ſet out and travelled to the city of Buxtehude.</p>
                  <p>The people in the biſhop of Munſter's country were very dark. As we paſſed amongſt them, I preached truth to them, warning them of the great and notable day of the Lord, exhorting them to ſoberneſs, and to mind the good Spirit of God in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It was on a firſt-day that we went through Buxtehude; and without the walls was a great fair of ſheep and geeſe that day. We ſtaid a little to refreſh ourſelves, and went on as faſt as we could to Hamburgh, partly by waggon, and partly by water.</p>
                  <p>We got to Hamburgh time enough to have a meeting there that evening. A good and glorious meeting it was. There were, amongſt others, a baptiſt teacher and his wife, and a great man of Sweden with his wife; and all was quiet, bleſſed be the Lord, whoſe power was exalted over all! Yet a hard, dark place this is, and the people are much ſhut up from truth.</p>
                  <p>At Hamburgh was a woman that had ſpoken againſt me in John Perrot's time, though ſhe had never ſeen me till now. She had been troubled for it ever ſince, and now was glad of an opportunity to acknowledge her ſault; which ſhe very readily did, and I as readily and freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave her.</p>
                  <p>We ſtaid that night at Hamburgh, encouraging and ſtrengthening the friends there in their teſtimony to the truth; and betimes next morning we ſet forwards towards Frederickſtadt, which is two long days journey from Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. We went the firſt-day to Elmſhoorn, where we baited, and then rode through a garriſon-town of the king of Denmark's; and, paſſing by the monument of the earl of Rantzow, came to the city of Itzeho, where we lodged that
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:037441_0751_100D933B55C49DD8"/>night. I had ſome ſervice in the evening, among the people in the inn, whom I exhorted to ſoberneſs, and to live in the fear of the Lord. Next morning we travelled to Hoghenhorn, where we dined at an inn with one of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Frederickſtadt; to whom, and to the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſent, I declared the truth, with which they ſeemed to be affected. Then travelling on, we came to a river cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Eyder, where we took boat and went to Frederickſtadt. We went to William Paul's, where ſeveral friends came to us, for there is a pretty company of friends in that city. We had a fine refreſhing meeting together that evening, which made us forget our wearineſs; for we were indeed very weary, having travelled hard thoſe two days, and were wet through our cloaths, having had much rain in our open waggons. But the Lord made all eaſy and good to us; and we were well and glad to ſee friends; bleſſed be his holy name for ever!</p>
                  <p>This city is in the duke of Holſtein's country, who would have baniſhed friends out of the city and country, and ſent to the magiſtrates of the city to do it; but they ſaid, they would lay down their offices rather than do it; inaſmuch as themſelves came to that city to enjoy the liberty of their conſciences. Friends ſtill enjoy their liberty there, and truth and they are of good report amongſt the people, both in city and country.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day I had a meeting here, to which many people came, and ſome rough ſpirits; but the power of the Lord bound them down, and the Seed of life was ſet over all. While I was here, I had a diſcourſe with a Levite concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coming of the Meſſiah; and he was much confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what he ſaid; yet he carried himſelf lovingly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to his houſe. I went, and there diſcourſed with a Jew, who ſhewed me their Talmud, and many other Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh books: but they are very dark, and do not underſtand their own prophets.</p>
                  <p>There was at this city a Baptiſt teacher, who had reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and belied friends; wherefore John Claus went, with two friends of the town, to the houſe where he lodged, cleared truth and friends from his reproaches, and laid his lies and ſlanders upon his own head, to his ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Before we left this place, I had another meeting with friends only, wherein I laid before them the uſefulneſs of a monthly meeting, for looking after the poor, and taking care that marriages, and all other things relating to the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:037441_0752_100D933CE650BF10"/>church, were performed in an orderly manner. The thing anſwered the witneſs of God in their conſciences, ſo they readily agreed to have monthly meetings thenceforward amongſt themſelves, that both men and women might take care of the outward concerns of the church.</p>
                  <p>Feeling my ſpirit clear of that place, we took leave of friends, whom we left in good order, and turned back for Hamburgh. When we had travelled one day's journey, and came to an inn at night to lodge, I enquired whether there were any tender people in the town that feared God, or that had a mind to diſcourſe of the things of God? The inn-keeper told me, there were few ſuch in that town. Next night we got to Hamburgh, and having paſſed the guards, went to a friend's houſe, being very weary; for we had been up thoſe two mornings before the third hour, and had travelled each day hard and late. Here we met with John Hill, an Engliſh friend, who had been travelling in Germany; and being in a ſhip bound for Amſterdam that waited for a wind, he had lain ſick on board about two weeks; and now hearing that I was in the country got off from the ſhip, and came hither to meet me, and go along with me.</p>
                  <p>We had a very good meeting here, and very peaceable. After which I had diſcourſe with a Swede, an eminent man in his own country; who having been baniſhed from thence upon the account of his religion, was come to Hamburgh, and was at the meeting I had there before. When I had done with him, I had another diſcourſe with a Baptiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſacraments, ſo called: in both which I had good ſervice, having opportunity thereby to open truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>Being clear of Hamburgh, we took leave of friends there, whom we left well; and taking John Hill with us, paſſed by boat to a city in the duke of Lunenburgh's country; where, after we were examined by the guards, we were had to the main guard, and there examined more ſtrictly; but after they found we were not ſoldiers, they were civil to us, and let us paſs. In the afternoon we travelled by waggon, and the waters being much out, by reaſon of the great rains that had fallen, when it drew towards night we hired a boy to guide us through a great water. When we came to it the water was ſo deep, before we could come at the bridge, that the waggoner was ſain to wade, and I drove the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. When we were come upon the bridge, the horſes broke part of it down, and one of them fell into the water,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:037441_0753_100D933F18C602B0"/>the waggon ſtanding upon that part of the bridge which remained unbroken. It was the Lord's mercy to us, that the waggon did not run into the brook. When they had got the horſe out, he lay awhile as if he had been dead; but at length they got him up, put him to the waggon again, laid the planks right, and then, through the goodneſs of the Lord to us, we got ſafe over.</p>
                  <p>After this we came to another water, which finding to be very deep, and it being in the night, we hired two men to help us through. Theſe men put cords to the waggon to hold it by, that the force of the water might not drive it beſide the way. But when we came into it, the ſtream was ſo ſtrong it took one of the horſes off his legs, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him down the ſtream; which I ſeeing, called to the waggoner to pluck him to him by his reins, which he did, and the horſe recovered his legs, and with much difficulty we got over the bridge, and went to Bormer-haven, the town where the waggoner lived. It was the laſt day of the ſixth month that we eſcaped theſe dangers, and being about the eleventh hour in the night when we came in here, we got ſome freſh ſtraw, and lay upon it till about four in the morning. Then getting up, we ſet forward again towards Bremen, going part of the way by waggon, and part by boat. In the way I had good opportunities to publiſh truth, eſpecially at a market-town where we ſtaid to change our paſſage; where I declared the truth to the people, warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all fleſh; and exhorting them to righteouſneſs, telling them, 'that God was come to teach his people himſelf,' and that they ſhould turn to the Lord, and hearken to the teachings of his Spirit in their own hearts.</p>
                  <p>At Bremen we were examined, and after went to an inn, and ſtaid till another waggon was provided to carry us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Though I felt the Lord's power was over the city, and kept the wicked and unruly ſpirits down, yet my ſpirit ſuffered much in this place for the people's ſake. When our waggon was ready we left Bremen, and travelled to Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, where we lodged at an inn, and early next morning ſet out for Oldenburgh. It was a lamentable ſight to ſee ſo great and brave a city burnt down. We went to an inn, and though it was firſt-day the ſoldiers were drinking, and playing at ſhovel-board, and at thoſe few houſes that were left, the ſhops were open, and the people trading one with another. I was moved to declare the truth among them,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:037441_0754_100D9340AF2EC028"/>and warn them of the judgments of God; and though they heard me quietly, and were civil towards me, yet I was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with their wickedneſs. Many times in mornings, and at noons and nights, at the inns, and on the ways, as I travelled, I ſpoke to the people, preaching the truth to them, warning them of the day of the Lord, and exhorting them to turn to the light and Spirit of God in themſelves, that thereby they might be led out of evil.</p>
                  <p>Next day, paſſing through many great waters, we came to Leer, and the day following to Embden, where John Claus's wife's father lived; at whoſe houſe, when we went into Germany, we left a young man ſick, who travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with me, and uſed to write for me; whom now we found pretty well recovered. John Claus went to his father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law's, John Hill and I to an inn, where we dined. After dinner we went alſo to John Claus's father's, and had a good meeting there in the evening.</p>
                  <p>The day following we took ſhipping at Embden, and paſſed to Delfziel, and went to an inn, where a friend came to us that then lived in Delfziel, having been often baniſhed from Embden: he was a goldſmith by trade, and had a houſe and ſhop in Embden, and ſtill as they baniſhed him he went again. Then they impriſoned him, fed him with bread and water, and at length took his goods from him, and baniſhed him, his wife and children, leaving them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place to come to, nor any thing to ſubſiſt on. We comforted and encouraged him in the Lord, exhorting him to be faithful, and ſtand ſteadfaſt in the teſtimony committed to him. When we had taken leave of him, we paſſed the ſame day to Groningen, where we met with Cornelius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries, a friend, that had alſo ſuffered much by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and baniſhment at Embden. We went with him to his houſe, and the next day we had a good meeting in that city, to which ſeveral profeſſors came, who were very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and attentive. After meeting we paſſed by boat to Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, and Dockum, where we lodged that night at an inn. Taking boat again next morning, we paſſed to Leuwarden, the chief city of Frienſtand, where I found my daughter Yeomans, who was come from Amſterdam thither to meet me. That day we had a precious meeting at Sybrand Dowes's houſe. After the meeting I had diſcourſe with ſome that were at the meeting, who had been formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of truth; but were not come into obedience to it.
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:037441_0755_100D9343D3365D90"/>We ſtaid there that night; but John Hill left us, and went that day to Harlingen, and ſo to Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>Next day we paſſed down the river to the lake of Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-Sarmer, and thence by the lake Lugmer, and ſo to a town called Anderigo; from whence ſailing through the lake Whiſpool, we came to Gardick within night. We lodged at an inn; and the next day, being firſt-day, we were at friends meeting there, which was very large, many of the town's-people coming in. I declared the truth in the power of the Lord, that was upon me; which tendered the people, and they were very ſober. After the meeting we ſtaid to refreſh ourſelves, and went to take boat again; but the people obſerving us, gathered together at a bridge we were to paſs, and there I declared the way of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto them, and they were very attentive and civil.</p>
                  <p>We went back that evening to Leuwarden, being twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven miles; but before we could reach it, the gates were ſhut and the bridges drawn up, ſo that we could not get into the city, but were fain to lie in the boat all night; and a man being killed in the city that night, it was late before the gates were opened. When we could get in, we went to a friend's houſe, where we ſtaid awhile; then taking boat, we paſſed through Franeker to Harlingen, to Haſſel Jacobs's, where we found ſeveral Dutch friends come to be at the meeting there next day. William Penn, returning two or three days before out of Germany, had been at a large meeting at Amſterdam on firſt-day; and after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, underſtanding I was at Harlingen, came thither to me.</p>
                  <p>Next day was the monthly meeting for men and women, to which we went. It was large and good. And there it was agreed, <q>a meeting ſhould be held there once a month, both for the men and for the women, to take care of the outward concerns of the church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the afternoon we had a publick meeting, to which came people of ſeveral ſorts. Socinians, Baptiſts, Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c. amongſt whom was a doctor of phyſich and a prieſt. After I had declared the truth pretty largely open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happy ſtate that man and woman were in whilſt they kept under God's teaching, and abode in paradiſe; and the wo and miſery that came upon them when they went from God's teaching, hearkened to the ſerpent's, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed God's command, and were driven out of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God; and ſet forth the way whereby man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might come into that happy ſtate again: the prieſt, an
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:037441_0756_100D93456289DF88"/>ancient grave man, ſtood up juſt as I had done ſpeaking, and, putting off his hat, ſaid, <q>I pray God to proſper and conſirm that doctrine, for it is truth, and I have nothing 'againſt it.</q> He would willingly have ſtaid till the meeting had been ended, but being to preach that evening, he could not ſtay longer, the time for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>own worſhip being come. Wherefore, when he had made confeſſion of the truth, he haſtened away, that he might come again; and did come, it ſeems, to the meeting-place, but the meeting was ended firſt. After which we went to Haſſel Jacobs's, where I had a meeting with friends, and the doctor of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick came thither to diſcourſe with William Penn, who had a good opportunity to open truth to him. By this doctor the prieſt ſent his love to me, wiſhing him to tell me, that he had left preaching that evening half an hour ſooner than he uſed to do, that he might come to our meeting again to hear more of that good doctrine. I heard afterwards, that his hearers queſtioned him for what he had ſaid in our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that, he ſtanding by his words, they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of him for it to the other prieſts of the city, who called him to account about it; but the reſult I could not learn.</p>
                  <p>Early next morning William Penn, taking John Claus with him, paſſed from Harlingen for Leuwarden, where he had appointed a meeting, intending to travel into ſome other parts of Germany to viſit a tender people there. I, with thoſe friends that were with me, took ſhip the ſame day for Amſterdam, where we arrived a little after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; but the gates being ſhut, we lay on board till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: then went to Gertrude Dirick Nieſon's, where many friends came to ſee us, being glad of our ſafe return. Next day, ſeeling a concern upon my mind, with relation to thoſe ſeducing ſpirits that made diviſion among friends, and being ſenſible that they endeavoured to inſinuate themſelves into the affectionate part, I was moved to write a few lines to friends concerning them, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>ALL theſe that ſet themſelves up in the affections of the people, ſet themſelves up, and the affections of the people, and not Chriſt. But friends, your peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able habitation in the truth, which is everlaſting, and changes not, will outlaſt all the habitations of thoſe that are out of the truth, although they be never ſo full of words. So thoſe that are ſo keen for J. S. and J. W. let
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:037441_0757_100D934742380228"/>them take them, and the ſeparation; and you that have given your teſtimony againſt that ſpirit, ſtand in your teſtimony, till they anſwer by condemnation. Do not ſtrive, nor make bargains with that which is out of the truth; nor ſave that alive to be a ſacrifice for God, which ſhould be ſlain, leſt you loſe your kingdom.</p>

                  <p>The firſt-day following, I was at friends meeting at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, to which many people came, and were very civil and attentive, hearing truth declared ſeveral hours. John Roeloffs interpreted for me.</p>
                  <p>Before this ſeveral of the friends that came over with me were returned to England again, as Robert Barclay, George Keith's wife, and others; and now my daughter Yeomans went back alſo: ſo that I was left alone at Amſterdam. While I was there, it came upon me to viſit my ſuffering friends at Dantzick with a few lines, to encourage and ſtrengthen them in their ſufferings, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Dear friends,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>TO whom is my love in the Lord's truth, that is over all, and by which all God's people are made free men and women, being thereby ſet free from him who is out of the truth; that walking in the truth, they may anſwer the witneſs of God in all people: which truth all muſt come to, if they be made free. Therefore be ſaithful unto what the Lord manifeſts unto you. I am glad the Lord hath witneſſes in that city, to ſtand for his glory and name, and for Chriſt Jeſus, the great prophet, whom God hath raiſed up, who is to be heard in all things; ſo that ye need none of the prophets which men have raiſed up. Therefore ſtand faithful to Chriſt Jeſus, your Shepherd, that he may ſeed you; hear his voice, and follow him, who has laid down his life for you; but follow none of the ſhepherds and hirelings that are made by men, though they may be angry becauſe ye will not follow them to their dry and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren mountains, who have been and are the thieves, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and robbers, that climb up another way than by Chriſt. Set up Chriſt to be your counſellor and leader, and then ye will have no need of any of the counſellors and leaders of the world; for Chriſt is ſufficient, whom
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:037441_0758_100D934AABF069C0"/>God has given you. Set up Chriſt Jeſus to be your biſhop and overſeer, who is ſufficient to overſee you, that you go not aſtray from God; by which ye may ſee over all the hireling-overſeers made by men, which keep the people, that they do not go from the rudiments, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, faſhions, and cuſtoms of the world, which hath been and is their work. I am glad that ye are come to own Chriſt Jeſus, your high prieſt, who is holy, harmleſs, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners, and made higher than the heavens, as the church and the apoſtle did own him in their days, Heb. vii. who is the high prieſt over the houſehold of faith; which faith Chriſt Jeſus is the author and ſiniſher of: and this do all the children of the new covenant witneſs, who walk in the new and living way. Therefore my diſire is, that ye all may be ſteadfaſt, whether in bonds or out, in the faith of Chriſt Jeſus, which is the gift of God; by which faith the valiants overcame the devil and all their enemies; in which faith they had victory and acceſs to God, and in that was their unity; which myſtery of faith is held in a pure conſcience, hidden from the world. I do believe, that your impriſonments and ſufferings in that place will be for good in the end (as it hath been in other places) ye ſtanding faithful to the Lord, who is all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For your ſufferings and trials will try their teachers and religions, churches and worſhips, and make manifeſt what birth they are of; even that which perſecutes him that is born of the Spirit: for ye know that there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Jeſus; therefore it is time to leave them, when there is no ſalvation by or in any of them. Now, friends, I deſire that you would take a liſt of the names of all thoſe that belong to the king of Poland, where they live, and how ye may ſend books and epiſtles to them, and keep a correſpondence with them; alſo the name of the biſhop or cardinal that I heard was with you; and if ye can get any that belong to the king to come to viſit the priſoners, that they may inform the king of their cruel ſufferings. Alſo I deſire you to get as many books of mine as you can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of, that ſet forth your ſufferings, and the cruelty of the magiſtrates of Dantzick; and give them to the king, his council, attendants, and biſhops. And ſome of the women may ſpeak to the queen, if they can, that ſhe may ſignify to the king their cruel ſufferings; and eſpecially ſome of the ſufferers wives, if there be any of capacity to
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:037441_0759_100D934CB4726FF8"/>do it. You may likewiſe give his attendants any other friends books; what books ye lack, ſend for to Amſterdam, where ye may be furniſhed with them, to anſwer every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deſirer, and inquiring mind after the Lord. So let all your minds be bended with the Lord's power, to ſpread his truth abroad; and where ye hear of any, or have any correſpondence in trading with any ſober people, far or near, ſend them books, that their underſtandings may be opened after the Lord. The Lord God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you! To his protection, in his eternal power, do I commend you all, in bonds or at liberty, with my love to you in the everlaſting ſeed of God Chriſt Jeſus, who bruiſes the head of the ſerpent, that makes you to ſuffer. Chriſt is over him, and will be when he is gone, who is Firſt and Laſt, over all, from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, in whom ye have life, knowledge, wiſdom, and ſalvation, and through him live to the praiſe and glory of God, who is bleſſed for evermore, Amen.</p>

                  <p>The next day, the fourth of the week and the nineteenth of the month, I had a large meeting at Amſterdam, many profeſſors being at it, and truth was largely opened to them, in the demonſtration of the heavenly power. The day following I went by boat, many friends going with me, to Landſmeer in Waterland (a town in which, they ſay, there are above an hundred bridges) where I had a very good meeting, to which ſeveral profeſſors came. After the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I returned with friends to Amſterdam again, where I ſtaid till the firſt-day following, and went to their meeting which was large. Many profeſſors of ſeveral ſorts were at it, and heard the truth declared with great attention.</p>
                  <p>I tarried next day, and the night following had a great exerciſe upon my ſpirit concerning that looſe ſpirit that was run into ſtrife and contention among friends, and had drawn ſome after it into diviſion and ſeparation; the way, work, and end whereof the Lord opened to me; wherefore, feeling the motion of life upon me, I got up in the morning and wrote the following epiſtle to friends.</p>

                        <p>KEEP your firſt love in the truth, power, and ſeed of life in Chriſt Jeſus; for this laſt night, as I was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my bed at Amſterdam, I had a great travail in the holy ſeed of life and peace, and my ſpirit was troubled with that ſpirit of ſtrife and ſeparation. I ſaw it was a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, and did ſeek not only to get over the ſeed, but to deſtroy it, and to eat out the minds of the people from it by ſtrife and contention; and under pretence of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ancient truth, its work is to root it out and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the appearance of it, to ſet up itſelf. It is a creeping ſpirit, ſeeking whom it can get into; and what it cannot do itſelf it ſtirreth up others to do, and ſetteth their ſpirits on float, with the dark wiſdom to deſtroy the ſimple. This ſpirit is managed by the prince of the air, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome to do things they would have been aſhamed to have done, as men, which doth unman them; and they would not have ſuffered them, if they had kept to the tender principle of God, which leadeth to peace. It is a deſpiſing, backbiting, ſecret-whiſpering ſpirit, a ſower of diſſenſion, and a taker of advantage of all prejudiced ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are diſobedient to their firſt principle and love and truth, and begetteth into hatred; ſo it begetteth all into that ſpirit, whoſe work is to deſtroy both the good within and the good order without. Nay, it would, if it could, deſtroy the government of Chriſt and the order of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to ſet up its own will and ſpirit, which is not of God, and, under pretence of crying down man, is ſetting up man, and gathering into a ſeparation of diſobedient men, who float above their conditions. This ſpirit, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liveth in the truth nor its order, but oppoſeth them that do. I cannot expreſs it as I ſec it and its work, whoſe end will be accordingly. Therefore, friends, I am to warn you all that have not loſt your ſimplicity, not to touch it, nor to have any unity with it, leſt you be defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, loſe your conditions of your eternal eſtate, and your everlaſting portion; and that your inward man, which is after God, may be preſerved, and Chriſt may reign in all your hearts. And they that are joined with them, it will be very hard for them ever to come down to truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſee their own conditions, and to have that ſpirit of ſtrife and contention (which eateth as a canker) brought down in them: which is carnal, and ſlayeth the tender babe, which was once begotten in themſelves. The
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:037441_0761_100D934FE46640A8"/>Philiſtine is got up in them, that ſtoppeth the wells and ſprings, maketh a great buſtle, and is crying up men, and pleading for them inſtead of Chriſt. So, friends, ſtrive not with them, but let thoſe take them that cry them up. Keep you to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with his light, that cometh from him, that he may be your Lord, and ye in him may be all in unity, in one light, life, power, and dominion in Chriſt, your head. The God of Peace and Power preſerve you all in Chriſt Jeſus your Saviour, and out of and from that miſchievous ſpirit which is idle and ſlothful, as to the work of the Power, Spirit, and Light of God and Chriſt. Its very act worketh ſtrife and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance againſt the peace of the church of Chriſt. It thinks in its wilfulneſs, ſtubbornneſs, and unrulineſs to ſet up itſelf, and in that to have peace; but deſtruction will be the end of it: and it is ſealed for the fire and eternal judgment. Therefore let Chriſt the Seed be the head and crown of every one of you, that nothing may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and the Lord God. Be not deceived with vain, feigned, or rough words: for Satan is transforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an Angel of Light to deceive, but God's founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtandeth ſure, and God knoweth who are his, and will preſerve his upon the rock and foundation of life, in his peaceable truth and habitation, that in the ſame they may grow. Keep out of ſtrife and contention with it, after ye have borne your teſtimony in the Lord's power and truth againſt it, then keep in the truth; for it hath a life in ſcribbling, ſtrife, and jangling, becauſe it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large its hell, and bring others into its miſery with the airy power, and would get power over the good, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join people from it, and ſo commit rapes upon the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by its ſubtilty. But I do believe the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his people, though he may try them and exerciſe them with this ſpirit for a time, as he hath done it days paſt, in other veſſels it hath made uſe of as it doth of theſe now, who have a more ſeeming fair outſide, but foul, rough, and rugged enough within, againſt the Seed Chriſt, as ever were the Phariſees to deſtroy it. They, under a pretence of preaching Chriſt, are deſtroyers and crucifiers of him, and killers of the juſt, not only in themſelves, but are endeavouring with all their might to deſtroy it in others where it is born. Pharaoh and Herod ſlay the young Jews in the ſpirit as the old did: I ſeel it worrying of them. That is got up to be king, which knew not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:037441_0762_100D9352A432B558"/>Joſeph. But God will plague him, and the Seed will have more reſt, and be better entertained in Egypt than under Herod, into whom old Pharaoh's ſpirit is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear, and an eye to ſee, let him ſee how this ſpirit hath transformed in all ages againſt the juſt and righteous; but mark what hath been its end. The Seed reigneth; glory to the Lord God over all for ever! His truth ſpreadeth, and friends here are in unity and peace, and of good report, anſwering the good or that of God in people. My deſires are, that all God's people may do the ſame in all places, that the Lord may be glorified in their bringing forth much fruit that is heavenly and ſpiritual. Amen.</p>

                  <p>After I had given forth the foregoing epiſtle, whereby my ſpirit was in ſome meaſure eaſed of the weight that lay upon it, I went in the afternoon to the monthly meeting of friends at Amſterdam; where the Lord was preſent with us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed our ſpirits together in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I thought to have gone next day to Harlem: but there being a faſt appointed to be kept that day, I was ſtopped in my ſpirit, and moved to ſtay at friends meeting at Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. We had a very large meeting, a great concourſe of people coming to it, and amongſt them many great perſons. The Lord's power was over the meeting, in the openings whereof I was moved to declare to the people, <q>That no man by all his wit and ſtudy, nor by reading hiſtory in his own will, could declare or know the generation of Chriſt, who was not begotten by the will of man, but by the will of God. After I had largely opened this, I ſhewed them the difference between the true faſt and the falſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting that the profeſſed Chriſtians, Jews, and Turks, were out of the true faſt, and faſted for ſtrife and debate, being under the band and fiſts of iniquity and oppreſſion, wherewith they were ſmiting one another; but the pure hands were not lifted up to God. And though they did all appear to men to faſt, and did hang down their heads for a day like a bulruſh, yet that was not the faſt which God did accept; but in that ſtate all their bones were dry, and when they called upon the Lord he did not anſwer them, neither did their health grow; for they kept their
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:037441_0763_100D9354DC3B3FC8"/>own faſt, and not the Lord's. I exhorted them to keep the Lord's faſt, which was to faſt from ſin and iniquity, ſtrife and debate, violence and oppreſſion, and to abſtain from every appearance of evil.</q> Theſe things were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the aſtoniſhment of the faſters, and the meeting ended peaceably and well.</p>
                  <p>I went to Harlem the day following, having before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a meeting. Peter Hendricks and Gertrude Dirick Nieſon went with me, and a bleſſed meeting we had. There were profeſſors of ſeveral ſorts, and a prieſt of the Lutherans, who ſat very attentive for ſeveral hours while I declared the truth. Gertrude interpreting. When the meeting was done, the prieſt ſaid, <q>He had heard nothing but what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, and deſired the bleſſing of the Lord might reſt upon us and our aſſemblies.</q> Others alſo confeſſed to the truth, ſaying, <q>They had never heard things ſo plainly opened to their underſtandings before.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſtaid that night at Harlem at a friend's houſe, whoſe name was Dirick Klaſſen; and returning next day to Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, went to Gertrude's houſe; where we had not been long before a prieſt of great note, who had formerly belonged to the emperor of Germany, and another German prieſt, came, deſiring to have ſome conference with me. I took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to declare the way of truth, opening unto them how they might come to know God and Chriſt, and his law and goſpel; and ſhewing them, that they could never know it by ſtudy, nor philoſophy, but by divine revelation through the Spirit of God, opening to them in the ſtillneſs of their minds. The men were tender, and went away well ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>The firſt-day following I was at friends meeting at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, where, amongſt ſeveral ſorts of profeſſors, was a doctor of Poland, who for his religion was baniſhed from the place he lived in, and being affected with the teſtimony of truth in the meeting, he came afterwards to have ſome diſcourſe with me: and after we had been ſome time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and I had opened things further to him, he went away very tender and loving.</p>
                  <p>While I was at Amſterdam, I ſpent much of my time in writing books, papers, or epiſtles on truth's behalf. I wrote ſeveral epiſtles from Amſterdam to friends in England and elſewhere, on ſeveral occaſions, as the Lord moved me by his Spirit thereunto. I wrote alſo from thence, <q>A warning to the inhabitants of the city of Oldenburgh, which was
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:037441_0764_100D9356F784EBD0"/>lately burned down;</q> alſo, <q>A warning to the inhabitants of the city of Hamburgh.</q> I wrote alſo an epiſtle to the ambaſſadors that were treating about a peace at Nimeguen. To the magiſtrates and prieſts of Embden I wrote, ſhewing them their unchriſtian practices in perſecuting friends. I wrote ſeveral other books there, in anſwer to prieſts and others, of Hamburgh, Dantzick, and other places, to clear the truth and friends from their falſe charges and ſlanders.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time George Keith and William Penn came back from Germany to Amſterdam, and had a diſpute with one Galenus Abrahams (one of the moſt noted Baptiſts in Holland) at which many profeſſors were preſent; but not having time to finiſh the diſpute then, they met again two days after, and the Baptiſt was much confounded, and truth gained ground. Between theſe two diſputes we had a very great meeting at friends meeting-place, at which many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people were; ſome of high rank in the world's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. An earl, a lord, and divers other eminent perſons were preſent, who all behaved themſelves very civilly. But, when the meeting was ended, ſome prieſts began to make oppoſition; which when William Penn underſtood, he ſtood up again, and anſwered them to the great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, who were much affected with the ſeveral teſtimonies they had heard. After the meeting ſeveral of them came to Gertrude's, where we were, with whom George Keith had much diſcourſe in Latin.</p>
                  <p>Having now finiſhed our ſervice at Amſterdam, we took leave of friends there, and paſſed by waggon to Leyden, about twenty-five miles; where we ſtaid a day or two, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and viſiting ſome tender people that we heard of there. We met with a German, who was partly convinced. He informed us of an eminent man that was inquiring after truth. Some ſought him out and viſited him, and found him a ſerious man. I alſo ſpoke to him, and he owned the truth. William Penn and Benjamin Furly went to viſit another great man, that lived a little out of Leyden, who, they ſaid, had been general to the king of Denmark's forces. He and his wife were very loving to them, and heard the truth with joy.</p>
                  <p>From Leyden we went to the Hague, where the prince of Orange kept his court; and viſited one of the judges of Holland, with whom we had much diſcourſe. He was a wiſe tender man, and put many objections and queries to us, which when we had anſwered, he was ſatisfied, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:037441_0765_100D93590376DB28"/>with us in much love. Leaving the Hague, we went to Delft, and from thence that night to Rotterdam, where we ſtaid ſeveral days, and had ſeveral meetings. While I was here, I gave forth a book for the Jews, with whom, when I was at Amſterdam, I had a deſire to have had ſome diſcourſe; but they would not. Here alſo I reviewed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other books and papers, which I had given forth before, and were now tranſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Finding our ſpirits clear of the ſervice which the Lord had given us to do in Holland, we took leave of friends of Rotterdam, and paſſed by boat to the Briel, in order to take paſſage that day in the packet-boat for England, ſeveral friends of Rotterdam accompanying us, and ſome of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, who were come to ſee us again before we left Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But the packet-boat not coming in till night, we were fain to lodge at the Briel; and next day, the one-and-twentieth of the eighth month, and the firſt-day of the week, we went on board, and ſet ſail about the tenth hour, viz. William Penn, George Keith and I, and Gertrude Dirick Nieſon, with her children.</p>
                  <p>We were in all about ſixty paſſengers, and had a long and hazardous paſſage: for the winds were contrary, and the weather ſtormy; the boat alſo very leaky, inſomuch that we were fain to have two pumps continually going day and night, ſo that it was thought there was twice as much water pumped out as the veſſel would have held. But the Lord, who is able to make the ſtormy winds to ceaſe and the raging waves of the ſea to be calm, yea, to raiſe them and ſtop them at his pleaſure, he alone did preſerve us; praiſed be his name for ever! Though our paſſage was hard, yet we had a fine time, and good ſervice for truth on board among the paſſengers, ſome of whom were great folk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and were very kind and loving. We arrived at Harwich the 23d of the eighth month at night, having been two nights and almoſt three days at ſea. Next morning William Penn and George Keith took horſe for Colcheſter; but I ſtaid, and had a meeting at Harwich; and there being no Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter coach there, and the poſt-maſter's wife being unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in her demands for a coach, and deceiving us of it alſo after we had hired it, we went to a friend's houſe about a mile and an half in the country, and hired his waggon, which we bedded well with ſtraw, and rode in it to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</p>
                  <p>I ſtaid in Colcheſter till firſt-day, having a deſire to be at
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:037441_0766_100D935B97FAB7B8"/>friends' meeting there that day; and a very large and weighty meeting it was: for friends hearing of my return from Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, flocked from ſeveral parts of the country; and many of the town's people coming alſo, it was thought there were about a thouſand people at the meeting, and all was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Having ſtaid a day or two longer at Colcheſter, I travelled through Eſſex, viſiting friends at Halſted. Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, Felſted, and Saling, and having meetings with them. At Chelmsford I had a meeting in the evening. There being many friends priſoners, they got liberty, and came to the meeting, and we were well refreſhed together in the Lord. Next day, the 9th of the ninth month, I got to London, where friends received me with great joy; and the firſt-day following went to Gracechurch-ſtreet meeting, where the Lord viſited us with his refreſhing preſence, and the glory of the Lord ſurrounded the meeting; praiſed be the Lord!</p>
                  <p>After I had been a little while in London, I wrote the following letter to my wife:</p>

                  <p>About this time I received letters from New-England, which gave account of the magiſtrates and rulers cruel and unchriſtian proceedings againſt friends there, whipping and abuſing them very ſhamefully; for they whipped many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men friends. One woman they tied to a cart, and dragged her along the ſtreet, ſhe being ſtripped above the waiſt.
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:037441_0767_100D935D29B23990"/>Yea, they whipped ſome maſters of ſhips, that were not friends, only for bringing friends thither. At that very time, while they were perſecuting friends in this barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Indians ſlew threeſcore of their men, took one of their captains, and flayed the ſkin off his head while he was alive, and carried it away in triumph: ſo that the ſober people ſaid, <q>The judgments of God came upon them for perſecuting the Quakers:</q> but the blind, dark prieſts ſaid, "It was becauſe they did not perſecute them enough." Great exerciſe I had in ſeeking relief here for poor ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends there, that they might not lie under the rod of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Upon this and other ſervices for truth I ſtaid in London a month or five weeks, viſiting meetings, and helping and encouraging friends to labour for the deliverance of their ſuffering brethren in other parts. Afterwards I went to Kingſton, and viſited friends there and thereaway. Having ſtard a little among friends there, overlooking a book which I had then ready to go to the preſs, I went into Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire, viſiting friends, and had ſeveral meetings amongſt them at Amerſham, Hungerhill, Jordans, Hedgerly, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and Turvil-heath. Im ſome of which, thoſe that were gone out from the unity of friends in truth, into ſtrife, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and diviſion, were very unruly and troubleſome; particularly at the men's meeting at Thomas Ellwood's at Hungerhill, where the chief of them came from Wickham, endeavouring to make diſturbance, and to hinder friends from proceeding in the buſineſs of the meeting. When I ſaw their deſign, I admoniſhed them to be ſober and quiet, and not trouble the meeting, by interrupting the ſervice thereof; but rather, if they were diſſatisfied with friends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and had any thing to object, let a meeting be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed on purpoſe ſome other day. So friends offered to give them a meeting another day; which at length was agreed to be at Thomas Ellwood's the week following. Accordingly friends met them there, and the meeting was in the barn; for there came ſo many, the houſe could not receive them. After we had ſat awhile, they began their jangling. Moſt of their arrows were ſhot at me; but the Lord was with me, and gave me ſtrength in his power to caſt back their darts of envy and falſehood upon themſelves. Their objections were anſwered; things were opened to the people; and a good opportunity it was, and ſerviceable to the truth; many that before were weak, were now ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:037441_0768_100D935F424F08B0"/>and confirmed; ſome that were doubting and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſatisfied and ſettled; and faithful friends were refreſhed and comforted in the ſpringing of life amongſt us: for the power roſe, and life ſprung, and in the ariſings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many living teſtimonies were borne againſt that wicked, dividing, rending ſpirit, which thoſe oppoſers were joined to and acted by: and the meeting ended to the ſatisfaction of friends. That night I lodged, with other friends, at Thomas Ellwood's; and the ſame week I had a meeting again with thoſe oppoſers at Wickham, where they again ſhewed their envy, and were made manifeſt to the upright-hearted.</p>
                  <p>After I had viſited friends in that upper ſide of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire, I called at Henley in Oxfordſhire, and went by Cauſham to Reading, where I was at meeting on firſt-day, and in the evening had a large meeting with friends. Next day there being another meeting about ſettling a women's meeting, ſome of thoſe that had let in the ſpirit of diviſion fell into jangling, and were diſorderly for awhile, till the weight of truth brought them down. After this I paſſed on, viſiting friends, and having meetings in ſeveral places, through Berkſhire and Wiltſhire, till I came to Briſtol, which was on the 24th day of the 11th month, juſt before the fair.</p>
                  <p>I ſtaid at Briſtol the time of the fair, and ſometime after. Many ſweet and precious meetings we had; many friends being there from ſeveral parts of the nation, ſome on account of trade, and ſome in the ſervice of truth. Great was the love and unity of friends that abode faithful in the truth, though ſome who were gone out of the holy unity, and were run into ſtrife, diviſion, and enmity, were rude and abuſive, and behaved themſelves in a very unchriſtian manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. But the Lord's power was over all; by which being preſerved in the heavenly patience, which can bear injuries for his name's ſake, I felt dominion therein over the rough, rude, and unruly ſpirits; and left them to the Lord, who knew my innocency, and would plead my cauſe. The more theſe laboured to reproach and vilify me, the more did the love of friends, that were ſincere and upright-hearted, abound towards me; and ſome, that had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by the adverſaries, ſeeing their envy and rude beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, broke off from them; who have cauſe to bleſs the Lord for their deliverance.</p>
                  <p>When I left Briſtol, I went with Richard Snead to a houſe of his in the country, and from thence to Hezekiah
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:037441_0769_100D9360D63C3AF0"/>Coale's at Winterburn in Glouceſterſhire, whither came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends that were under great ſufferings for truth's ſake, whom I had invited to meet me there.

                     </gap>ith, Richard Snead, and I, drew up a breviate of their ſufferings, ſetting forth the illegal proceedings againſt them; which was delivered to the judges at the aſſizes at Glouceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and they promiſed to put a ſtop to thoſe illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Next day we paſſed to Sudbury, and had a large meeting in the meeting-houſe, which at that time was of very good ſervice. We went next day to Nathaniel Crips's at Tedbury, and from thence to Nailſworth; where on firſt-day we had a brave meeting and large. From thence we went to the quarterly meeting at Finchcomb, where were ſeveral of the oppoſite ſpirit, who (it was thought) intended to have made diſturbance amongſt friends; but the Lord's power was over, and kept them down, and good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Lord we had at that meeting. We returned from Einchcomb to Nailſworth, and had another very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meeting there, to which friends came from the ſeveral meetings thereabouts; which made it very large alſo.</p>
                  <p>We went from Nailſworth the firſt of the firſt month, 1677-8, and travelled, viſiting friends, and having many meetings at Cirenceſter, Crown-Allins, Cheltenham, Stoke-Orchard, Tewkſbury, &amp;c. ſo went to Worceſter, where I had formerly ſuffered impriſonment above a year for the truth's ſake; and friends rejoiced greatly to ſee me there again. Here I ſtaid ſeveral days, and had many very precious meetings in the city, and much ſervice amongſt friends. After which I had meetings at Perſhore and Eveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; then ſtruck to Ragley in Warwickſhire, to viſit the lady Conway, who I underſtood was very deſirous to ſee me, and whom I found tender and loving, and willing to have detained me longer than I had freedom to ſtay. About two miles from hence I had two meetings at a friend's houſe, whoſe name was John Stanley, whither Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dewſbury came, and ſtaid with me about half a day. I viſited friends in their meetings at Stratford, Lamcoat, and Armſcott (from whence I was ſent priſoner to Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the year 1673) and thence paſſed into Oxfordſhire, viſiting friends, and having meetings at Sibbard, North-Newton, Banbury, Adderbury, &amp;c. Then viſiting friends through Buckinghamſhire, at Long-Crendon, Iſmer, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, Weſton, Cholſberry, Cheſham, &amp;c. I came to Iſaac Penington's, where I ſtaid a few days; then turning into
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:037441_0770_100D93638979EB28"/>Hertfordſhire, viſited friends at Charlewood. Watford, Hempſtead, and Market-ſtreet, at which places I had meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with friends. From Market-ſtreet I went in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Luten in Bedfordſhire, to ſee John Crook, with whom I ſpent good part of the day, and went towards evening to Alban's, where I lay that night at an inn. And viſiting friends at South-Mims, Barnet, and Hendon, where I had meetings, I came to London the eighth of the third month. It being the fourth-day, I went to Gracechurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet meeting, which was peaceable and well; many friends, not knowing I was come to town, were very joyful to ſee me there, and the Lord was preſent with us, refreſhing us with his living virtue; bleſſed be his holy name!</p>
                  <p>The parliament was ſitting when I came to town, and friends having laid their ſufferings before them, were waiting on them for relief againſt the laws made againſt Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, which they knew we were not; though ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious magiſtrates took advantage to proſecute us in ſeveral parts of the nation upon thoſe ſtatutes. Friends being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that ſervice, when I came, I joined them therein; and ſome probability there was that ſomething might have been obtained towards friends eaſe and relief in that caſe, many of the parliament-men being tender and loving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as believing we were much miſrepreſented by our adverſaries. But when I went one morning with George Whitehead, to the parliament-houſe, to attend them on friends behalf, on a ſudden they were prorogued though but for a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>About two weeks after I came to London the yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing began, to which friends came out of moſt parts of the nation, and a glorious heavenly meeting we had. Oh the glory, majeſty, love, life, wiſdom and unity, that was amongſt us! The power reigned over all, and many teſtimonies were borne therein againſt that ungodly ſpirit which ſought to make rents and diviſions amongſt the Lord's people; but not one mouth was opened amongſt us in its, defence, or on its behalf. Good and comfortable accounts alſo we had, for the moſt part, from friends in other countries; of which I find a brief account in a letter which ſoon after I wrote to my wife, the copy whereof here follows:</p>

                        <p>TO whom is my love in the everlaſting Seed of life, that reigns over all. Great meetings here have been,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:037441_0771_100D7F9F8B98AC78"/>and the Lord's power hath been ſtirring through all, the like hath not been. The Lord hath in his power knit friends wonderfully together, and his glorious preſence did appear among friends. And now the meetings are over (bleſſed be the Lord!) in quietneſs and peace. From Holland I hear that things are well there. Some friends are gone that way, to be at the yearly meeting at Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. At Embden, friends that were baniſhed are got into the city again. At Dantzick, friends are in priſon, and the magiſtrates threatened them with harder impriſonment; but the next day the Lutherans roſe, and plucked down or defaced the Popiſh monaſtery, ſo they have work enough themſelves. The king of Poland did receive my letter, and read it himſelf; and friends have ſince printed it in High Dutch. By letters from the half-yearly meeting in Ireland I hear they are all in love there. At Barbadoes friends are in quietneſs, and their meetings ſettled in peace. At Antigua alſo and Nevis truth proſpers, and friends have their meetings orderly and well. Likewiſe in New-England, and other places, things concerning truth and friends are well; and in thoſe places the men's and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meeting are ſettled; bleſſed be the Lord! So keep in God's power and Seed, that is over all, in whom ye all have life and ſalvation; for the Lord reigns over all, in his glory, and in his kingdom; glory to his name for ever, Amen! So in haſte, with my love to you all, and to all friends.</p>

                        <p>O king!</p>
                        <p>WE deſire thy proſperity both in this life and that which is to come. And we deſire that we may have our Chriſtian liberty to ſerve and worſhip God under thy dominion: for our principle leads us not to do anything prejudicial to the king or his people. We are a people that exerciſe a good conſcience towards God through his Holy Spirit, and in it do ſerve, worſhip, and honour him; and
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:037441_0772_100D936596C72188"/>towards men in the things that are equal and juſt, doing to them as we would have them do unto us; looking unto Jeſus, who is the author and finiſher of our faith; which faith purifies our hearts, and brings us to have acceſs to God; without which we cannot pleaſe him: by which faith all the juſt live, as the ſcripture declares. That which we deſire of thee, O king, is, that we may have the liberty of our conſciences to ſerve and worſhip God, and to pray unto him in our meetings together in the name of Jeſus, as he commands: with a promiſe that he will be in the midſt of them. The king, we hope, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay that this duty and ſervice is due to God and Chriſt; and we give Caeſar his due, and pay our tribute and cuſtom equal with our neighbour, according to our proportion. We never read in all the ſcriptures of the New Teſtament, that ever Chriſt or his diſciples did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or impriſon any that were not of their faith or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would not hear them, or gave any ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but, on the contrary, let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harveſt, and the harveſt is the end of the world. Then Chriſt will ſend his angels to ſever the wheat from the tares. He rebuked ſuch as would have had fire from heaven to conſume thoſe that would not receive Chriſt; and told them they did not know what ſpirit they were of; he came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them.</p>
                        <p>We deſire the king to conſider how much perſecution has been in Chriſtendom, ſince the apoſtles days, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religion. Chriſt ſaid, They ſhould go into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment that did not viſit him in priſon; then what will become of them that impriſon him in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, where he is manifeſt. None can ſay the world is ended; therefore how will Chriſtendom anſwer the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible God at his day of judgment, that have perſecuted one another about religion before the end of the world, under a pretence of plucking up tares; which is not their work, but the angels at the end of the world? Chriſt commands men to love one another, and to love enemies; and by this they ſhould be known to be his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. O that all Chriſtendom had lived in peace and unity, that they might by their moderation have judged both Turks and Jews; and let all have their liberty, that own God and Chriſt Jeſus, and walk as becomes the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Our deſires are,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:037441_0773_100D9367A95252C8"/>that the Lord God of heaven may ſoften the king's heart to all tender conſciences that fear the Lord, and are afraid of diſobeying him.</p>
                        <p>We intreat the king to read ſome of the noble expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſeveral kings, and others, concerning liberty of conſcience; and eſpecially Stephanus king of Poland's ſayings, viz. <q>It belongeth not to me to reform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; I have always gladly given that over to God which belongeth to him; and ſo ſhall I do now, and alſo for the future. I will ſuffer the weeds to grow till the time of harveſt, for I know that the number of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are but ſmall: therefore,</q> ſaid he, when ſome were proceeding in perſecution, <q>I am king of the people, not of their conſciences.</q> He alſo affirmed, that <q>religion was not to be planted with fire and ſword.</q> Chron. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Religion, Part 2.</p>
                        <p>Alſo a book wrote in French by W. M. anno 1576, hath this ſentence, viz. <q>Thoſe princes that have ruled by gentleneſs and clemency added to juſtice, and have exerciſed moderation and meekneſs towards their ſubjects, always proſpered and reigned long; but, on the contrary, thoſe princes that have been cruel, unjuſt, prejudiced, and oppreſſors of their ſubjects, have ſoon fallen, they and their eſtates, into danger or total ruin.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Veritus ſaith, <q>Seeing Chriſt is a Lamb, whom you profeſs to be your head and captain, then it behoveth you to be ſheep, and to uſe the ſame weapons which he made uſe of: for he will not be a ſhepherd of wolves and wild beaſts, but only of ſheep. Wherefore, if you loſe the nature of ſheep,</q> ſaid he, <q>and be changed into wolves and wild beaſts, and uſe fleſhly weapons, then will you exclude yourſelves out of his calling, and forſake his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and then will not he be your captain,</q>&amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Alſo we find it aſſerted by king James, in his ſpeech to the parliament, in the year 1609, <q>That it is a pure rule in divinity, that God never planted his church with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of blood.</q> And further he ſaid, <q>It was uſually the condition of Chriſtians to be perſecuted, but not to perſecute.</q>

                        <p>It is remarkable, that till the time of Juſtinian the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, Anno Domini 525. <q>the Catholicks and Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians had churches indifferently permitted, even in Rome itſelf.</q>
                        </p>
                        <q>And Paul preached the kingdom of God, teaching thoſe things which concerned the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all conſidence, and no man forbad him; and this he did for the ſpace of two years in his own hired houſe at Rome, and received all that came to him.</q>
                        <p>Now, O king, ſeeing theſe noble teſtimonies concerning liberty of conſcience of kings, emperors, and others, and the liberty that Paul had at Rome in the days of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then emperor, our deſire is, that we may have the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty at Dantzick to meet together in our own hired hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which cannot be any prejudice either to the king or the city of Dantzick, for us to meet together to wait upon the Lord, and pray unto him, and to ſerve and worſhip him in Spirit and truth in our own hired houſes; ſeeing our principle leads us to hurt no man, but to love our enemies, and to pray for them, yea, them that perſecute us. Therefore, O king, conſider, and the city of Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:037441_0777_100D93706BDC35E0"/>would you not think it hard for others to force you from your religion to another, contrary to your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? And if it be ſo, that you would think it hard to you, then <q>do you unto others as you would have them do unto you,</q> do not you that unto others which you would not have men do unto you; for that is the royal law, which ought to be obeyed. And ſo in love to thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul, and for thy eternal good this is written.</p>

                  <p>I continued yet in and about London ſome weeks, the parliament ſitting again, and friends attending to get ſome redreſs of our ſufferings, which about this time were very great and heavy upon many friends in divers parts of the nation; they being very unduly proſecuted upon the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:037441_0778_100D9372075F63E0"/>made againſt popiſh recuſants; though our perſecutors could not but know friends were utterly againſt popery, having borne teſtimony againſt it in word and writing, and ſuffered under it. But though many of the members of parliament in either houſe were kind to friends, and willing to have done ſomething for their eaſe; yet having much buſineſs they were hindered from doing the good they would, ſo that the ſufferings upon friends were continued.</p>
                  <p>But that which added much to the grief and exerciſe of friends was that ſome, who made profeſſio of the ſame truth with us, being gone from the ſimplicity of the goſpel into fleſhly liberty, and labouring to draw others after them, did oppoſe the order and diſcipline which God by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had ſet up and eſtabliſhed in his church; and made a great noiſe and clamour againſt preſcriptions; whereby they eaſily drew after them ſuch as were looſely inclined, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a broader way than the path of truth to walk in. Some alſo that were more ſimple, but young in truth, or weak in judgment, were apt to be betrayed by them, not knowing the depths of Satan in theſe wiles: for whoſe ſake I was moved to write the following paper, for the undeceiving the deceived, and opening the underſtandings of the weak in this matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>ALL that deny preſcriptions without diſtinction, may as well deny all the ſcriptures, which were given forth by the power and Spirit of God. For do they not preſcribe how men ſhould walk towards God and man, both in the Old Teſtament and in the New? Yea, from the very firſt promiſe of Chriſt in Geneſis, what people ought to believe and truſt in; and all along, till ye come to the prophets? Did not the Lord preſcribe to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the fathers, and then by his prophets? Did he not preſcribe to the people how they ſhould walk, though they turned againſt the prophets in the old covenant for declaring or preſcribing to them the way how they might walk to pleaſe God, and keep in favour with him? In the days of Chriſt, did he not preſcribe and teach how people ſhould walk and believe? and after him, did not the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles preſcribe unto people how they might come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and receive the goſpel and the kingdom of God, directing unto that which would give them the knowledge of God, and how they ſhould walk in the new covenant in the days of the goſpel, and by what way they ſhould
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:037441_0779_100D937451B737A0"/>come to the holy city? And did not the apoſtles ſend forth their decrees by faithful choſen men (that had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded their lives for Chriſt's ſake) to the churches, by which they were eſtabliſhed? So you, that deny preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given forth by the power and Spirit of God, do thereby oppoſe the Spirit that gave them forth in all the holy men of God. Were there not ſome all along in the days of Moſes, in the days of the prophets, in the days of Chriſt, and in the days of his apoſtles, who did withſtand that which they gave forth from the Spirit of God? And hath there not been the like ſince the days of the apoſtles? How many have riſen, ſince truth appeared, to oppoſe the order which ſtands in the power and Spirit of God? who are but in the ſame ſpirit which hath oppoſed the Spirit of God all along from the beginning. See what names or titles the Spirit of God gave that oppoſing ſpirit in the old covenant, and alſo in the new; which is the ſame now; for after the Lord had given ſorth the old covenant, there were ſome among themſelves that did oppoſe; which were worſe than publick enemies. And likewiſe in the days of the new covenant, in the goſpel-times, you may ſee what ſort oppoſed Chriſt and the apoſtles after they came to ſome ſight of the truth; and how they turned againſt Chriſt and his apoſtles? See what liberty they pleaded for and ran into in the apoſtles days, who could not abide the croſs, the yoke of Jeſus. We ſee the ſame rough and high ſpirit crie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So with the everlaſting power and Spirit of God this ſpirit is fathomed, its riſe beginning, and end; and it is judged. This Spirit cries, <q>We muſt not judge conſcience, we muſt not judge matters of faith, we muſt not judge ſpirits, nor religions,</q> &amp;c. Yes: they that are in the pure Spirit and power of God, which the apoſtles were in judge of conſcience, whether it be a ſeared conſcience, or a tender conſcience; they judge of faith, whether it be a dead one, or a living one; they judge of religion, whether it be vain, or pure and undefiled; they judge of ſpirits, and try them. whether they be of God, or no; they judge of hope, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that of hypocrites, or the true hope that purifies. even as God is pure; they judge of belief, whether it be
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:037441_0780_100D9377815A11C0"/>that which is born of God, and overcometh the world, or that which runs into the ſpirit of the world, which luſts to envy, and doth not overcome the world; they judge of worſhips, whether they be will-worſhips, and the worſhip of the beaſt and dragon, or the worſhip of God in Spirit and in truth; they judge of angels, whether they be fallen, or thoſe that keep their habitation; they judge the world, that grieves and quenches the Spirit, hates the light, turns the grace of God into wantonneſs, and reſiſts the Holy Ghoſt. They judge of the hearts, ears and lips, which are circumciſed, and which are uncircumciſed. They judge of miniſters, apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es, and meſſengers, whether they be of Satan or of Chriſt. Judge of differences in outward things, in the church or elſewhere; yea, the leaſt member of the church hath power to judge of ſuch things, Laving the one true meaſure and true weight to weigh things and meaſure things withal, without reſpect to perſons. This judgment is given, and all theſe things are done by the ſame power and Spirit the apoſtles were in. Such alſo can judge of election and reprobation, and who keep their habitation, and who not; who are Jews, and who are of the ſynagogue of Satan; who are in the doctrine of Chriſt, and who are in the doctrines of devils; who preſcribes and declares things from the power and Spirit of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all in the power and Spirit of God, and who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and declares things from a looſe ſpirit, to let all looſe from under the yoke of Chriſt, the power of God, into looſeneſs and liberty. Theſe likewiſe can judge and diſcern who brings people into the poſſeſſion of the goſpel of light and life, over death and darkneſs, and into the truth where the devil cannot get in; and who brings them into the poſſeſſion of death and darkneſs, out of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the goſpel, and of Jeſus Chriſt, his faith, truth, Spirit, light, and grace. For there is no true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but in that; and that liberty anſwers the grace, the truth, the light, the Spirit, the faith, the goſpel of Chriſt in every man and woman, and is the yoke to the contrary in every man and woman. That makes it rage, and ſwell, and puff up; for that is reſtleſs, unruly, out of patience, and ready to curſe his God, and that which reigns over him, becauſe it hath not its will. It works with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and evaſion with its reſtleſs ſpirit, to get in and defile the minds of the ſimple, and to make rapes upon the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin minds. But as they receive the heavenly wiſdom, by
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:037441_0781_100D9379145EE7A0"/>which all things were made (which wiſdom is above that ſpirit) through this wiſdom they will be preſerved over that ſpirit. And Chriſt hath given judgment to his ſaints in his church, though he be judge of all; and the ſaints, in the power and Spirit of God, had and have power to judge of words and manners, of lives and converſations, growths, and ſtates, from a child to a father in the truth; and to whom they are a ſavour of death, and to whom they are a ſavour of life; and who ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and preach him, and who preach themſelves, and ſerve themſelves; and who talk of the light, of faith, of the goſpel, of hope, of grace, and preach ſuch things; yet in their works and lives deny them all, and God and Chriſt, and preach up liberty, from that in themſelves to that in others, which ſhould be under the yoke and croſs of Chriſt, the power of God. So the ſaints in the power and Spirit of Chriſt can diſcern and diſtinguiſh who ſerves God and Chriſt, and who ſerves him not; and can put a diſtinction between the prophane and the holy. But ſuch as have loſt their eye-ſalve, and their ſight is grown dim, loſe this judgment, diſcerning, and diſtinction in the church of Chriſt; and ſuch come to be ſpewed out of Chriſt's mouth, except they repent: and if not, they come to corrupt the earth, and burden it, that it vomits them out of it. Therefore all are exhorted to keep in the power and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, in the word of life and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God (which is above that which is below) in which they may keep their heavenly underſtandings and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcernings; and ſo ſet the heavenly ſpiritual judgment over that which is for judgment, which diſhonours God, which leads into looſe and falſe liberty; out of the unity which ſtands in the heavenly Spirit, which brings to be conformable to the image of the Son of God, and his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the power of God (which was before the devil was) and his truth (which the devil is out of) in which all are of one mind, heart, and ſoul, and come to drink into one Spirit, being baptized into one Spirit, and ſo into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which Chriſt is the head of; and ſo keep one fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Spirit, and unity in the Spirit, which is the bond of peace, the Prince of Princes peace. And thoſe that cry ſo much againſt judging, and are afraid of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether they be apoſtles, profeſſors, or prophane, are the moſt judging with the cenſorious ſalſe ſpirits and judgment; yet cannot bear the true judgment of the Spirit
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:037441_0782_100D937B4DED75D0"/>of God, nor ſtand in his judgment. This hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the beginning, they having the falſe meaſures and the falſe weights: for none have the true meaſure and the true weight, but who keep in the light, power, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt. There is a looſe ſpirit that cries for liberty, and againſt preſcriptions, yet is preſcribing ways, both by words and writings. The ſame ſpirit cries againſt judging, and would not be judged, yet is judging with a wrong ſpirit. This is given forth in reproof to that ſpirit.</p>

Next day a freſh exerciſe came upon me, with reſpect to thoſe unruly and diſorderly ſpirits which were gone out from us, and were labouring to draw others after them into a falſe liberty.

Next day I went to Baldock where I had a meeting that evening, and after had meetings at Hitchin and Aſhwell. Then paſſing through part of Bedfordſhire, where I had a meeting or two, I went to Huntingdon, in which county I ſtaid ſeveral days, having many meetings, and much ſervice amongſt friends;

Leaving me in Great Bowden in Leiceſterſhire, he went towards Weſtmoreland.

                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>DEAR friends of the quarterly and monthly meetings every where: My deſire is, that you may all ſtrive to be of one mind in the Lord's power and truth, which is peaceable (into which ſtrife and enmity cannot come) and alſo in the wiſdom of God, which is pure, peaceable, and eaſy to be intreated (which is above that which is below, that is earthly, deviliſh, and ſenſual) and that in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdom that is peaceable, and eaſy to be intreated, you may be all ordered, and do what ye do to God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And dear friends, if there ſhould happen at any time any thing that tends to ſtrife. diſpute, or contention in your monthly or quarterly meetings, let it be referred to half a dowen, or ſuch a like number to debate and end out of yoar meetings, as it was at firſt, that all your monthly and quarterly meetings may be kept peaceable. And then they may inform the meeting what they have done; that the weak and youth amongſt you may not be hurt, through hearing of ſtrife on contention in your meetings,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:037441_0785_100D9382A87B5F70"/>where no ſtrife or contention ought to be: but all to go on, and determine things in one mind, in the power of God, the goſpel-order; in which goſpel of peace ye will preſerve the peace of all your meetings. If any man or woman have any thing againſt any one, let them ſpeak to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and end it betwixt themſelves; if they cannot ſo end it, let them take two or three to end it. In caſe theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it not, let it be laid before the church; and let half a dozen, or a proper number out of your monthly or quarterly meeting hear it, and finally end it, without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of perſons. Let all prejudice be laid aſide and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; alſo all ſhortneſs one towards another; and let love, which is not puffed up, envies not, ſeeks not her own, but bears all things, have the dominion in all your meetings; for that doth edify the body which Chriſt is the head of, and this will rule over all ſounding braſs and tinkling cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals. This love will ſuffer long, and is kind; will keep down that which would vaunt itſelf, be puffed up, behave itſelf unſeemly, or is eaſily provoked: it hath a ſway over all ſuch fruits which are not of the Spirit, the fruit of which is love, &amp;c. And that with this Holy Spirit ye may all be baptized into one body, and be made to drink into one Spirit; in which Spirit ye will have unity, in which is the bond of the King of kings and the Lord of lords his peace. They that dwell in love, dwell in God, for God is love: therefore let every one keep his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My love to you in Chriſt Jeſus, the everlaſting Seed, which is over all.</p>

                  <p>Out of Staſſordſhire I went to viſit John Gratton at Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaſh in Derbyſhire, with whom I tarried one night, and went next day to William Shaw's, of the Hill in Yorkſhire, where I appointed a meeting to be on firſt-day following. Many friends out of Derbyſhire, and from ſeveral meetings in Yorkſhire came, and a precious, comfortable meeting it was; wherein was opened the bleſſed eſtate that man was in before he fell; the means by which he fell, the miſerable condition into which he ſell, and the right way of coming out of it into a happy ſtate again by Chriſt, the promiſed Seed.</p>
                  <p>I ſpent about two weeks in Yorkſhire, and many heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:037441_0786_100D938520E03AB0"/>meetings I had in that county. Then viſting Robert Widders at Kellet in Lancaſhire, I paſſed to Arnſide in Weſtmoreland, where I had a precious living meeting in the Lord's bleſſed power, to the great ſatisfaction and comfort of friends, who came from divers parts to it. The next day I went to Swarthmore: and it being the meeting-day there, I had a ſweet opportunity with friends; our hearts being opened in the love of God, and his bleſſed life flowing amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>I had not been long at Swarthmore ere a concern came upon me to viſit the churches of Chriſt, by an epiſtle as ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>

                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Dear friends,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>TO you is my love in the heavenly Seed, in whom all nations are bleſſed. Oh, keep all in this Seed, in which ye are bleſſed, and in which Abraham and all the ſaithful were bleſſed, without the deeds of the law: for the promiſe was and is to and with the Seed, and not with the law of the fiſt covenant. In this Seed all nations and ye are bleſſed, which bruiſeth the head of the ſeed that brought the curſe, and ſeparated man from God. This is the Seed which reconciles you to God; and this is the Seed in which ye are bleſſed both in temporals and ſpirituals; through which ye have an inheritance among the ſanctified, that cannot be defiled, neither can any defiled thing enter into its poſſeſſion; for all defilements are out of his Seed. This is that which leavens into a new lump, and bruiſeth the head of the wicked ſeed that leavens into the old lump, upon whom the ſun of righteouſneſs goes down and ſets, but never goes down and ſets to them that walk in the Seed in which all nations are bleſſed; by which Seed they are brought up to God, which puts down that ſeed which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them from God, ſo that there comes to be nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and God. Now all my dear friends, my deſires are, that ye may all be valiant in this heavenly Seed for God and his truth upon the earth, and ſpread it abroad, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that of God in all; that with it the minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be turned towards the Lord, that he may come to be known, ſerved, and worſhipped, and that ye may all be as the ſalt of the earth, to make the unſeaſoned ſavoury. And in the name of Jeſus keep your meetings, who are gathered into it, in whoſe name ye have ſalvation; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of you, whoſe name is above every name
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:037441_0787_100D93882E9913C0"/>under the whole heaven. So ye have a Prophet, Biſhop, Shepherd, Prieſt, and Counſellor (above all the counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, prieſts, biſhops, prophets, and ſhepherds under the whole heaven) to exerciſe his offices among you, in your meetings, gathered in his name. For Chriſt's meeting and gathering is above all the meetings and gatherings under the whole heaven; and his body, his church, and he the head of it, is above all the bodies, churches, and heads under the whole heaven. And the faith that Chriſt is the author of, and the worſhip that he hath ſet up, and his fellowſhip in the goſpel, is above all hiſtorical faiths, and the faiths that men have made, together with their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and fellowſhips under the whole heaven. And now, dear friends, keep your men's and women's meetings in the power of God, the goſpel, the authority of them, which brings life and immortality to light in you; and this goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the power of God, will preſerve you in life and in immortality (which hath brought it to light in you) that ye may ſee over him that hath darkened and kept from the knowledge of the things of God: for it is he and his inſtruments (which hath darkened you from life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality) that would throw down your men's and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meetings (which were ſet up in the power of God, the goſpel) and would darken you again from this life and immortality which the goſpel hath brought to light, and will preſerve you therein, as your faith ſtands in this power of God, the goſpel, in which every one ſees your work and ſervice for God. Every heir in the power of God, the goſpel, hath right to this authority, which is not of man not by man; which goſpel, the power of God, is everlaſting, an everlaſting order, an everlaſting fellowſhip: and in the goſpel is everlaſting joy, comfort, and peace, which will outlaſt all thoſe joys, comforts, and peaces that will have an end, and that ſpirit alſo that oppoſes its order and glorious fellowſhip, peace and comfort in it. And, my dear friends, my deſire is, that ye may keep in the unity of the Spirit, that baptizes you all into one body, which Chriſt is the heavenly and ſpiritual head of, ſo that ye may ſee and bear witneſs to your heavenly and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al head, and ſo all drink into the one Spirit, which all people on the earth are not like to do, while they grieve, quench, and rebel againſt it, nor to be baptized into one body, and to keep the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace, yea the King of kings and Lord of lords
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:037441_0788_100D938A41B13658"/>his peace; which is the duty of all true Chriſtians to keep, who are inwardly united to Chriſt. My love to you all in the everlaſting Seed.</p>

                  <p>There were about this time ſeveral friends in priſon for bearing teſtimony to the truth; to whom I was moved to write a few lines to comfort, ſtrengthen, and encourage them; having a true ſenſe of their ſufferings upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a ſympathizing with them therein. That which I wrote was after this manner:</p>

                        <p>WHO are ſufferers for the Lord Jeſus ſake, and for the teſtimony of his truth, the Lord God Almighty with his power uphold and ſupport you in all your trials and ſufferings, and give you patience and content in his will that ye may ſtand valiant for Chriſt and his truth upon the earth, over the perſecuting deſtroying ſpirit, which makes to ſuffer in Chriſt (who bruiſes the head) in whom ye have both election and ſalvation. For his elect's ſake the Lord hath done much from the foundation of the world, as may be ſeen throughout the ſcriptures of truth. They that touch them touch the apple of God's eye, they are ſo tender to him; and therefore it is good for his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering children to truſt in the Lord, and to wait upon him; for they ſhall be as mount Sion, that cannot be removed from Chriſt their rock and ſalvation, the ſoundation of all the elect of God, of the prophets and apoſtles, and of God's people now and to the end; glory to the Lord and the Lamb over all! Remember my dear love to all friends, and do not think the time long; for all time is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's hand, his power.

<pb n="273" facs="unknown:037441_0789_100D938BD687B728"/>opening the principles and doctrines of truth to the world, that they might come to have a right underſtanding thereof, and be gathered thereunto. Several epiſtles alſo I wrote to friends in this time. One was to the yearly meeting held in London this year, 1679; a copy of which here follows:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>My dear friends and brethren,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>WHO are aſſembled together in the name and power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, fill all your hearts, and eſtabliſh you in his grace, mercy, and peace upon Chriſt, the holy living Rock and Foundation, who is the Firſt and Laſt, and over all the foundations and rocks in the whole world; a Rock and Foundation of life for all the living to build upon, which ſtands ſure in his heavenly, divine light, which is the life in him; by whom all things were made, who is the precious Stone laid in Sion (and not in the world) which all the wiſe maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builders rejected, who pretended to build people up to heaven with the words of the prophets, and the law from mount Sinai, but out of the life of both: therefore ſuch builders could not receive the law of life from Chriſt, the precious Stone laid in Sion, nor the word from heavenly Jeruſalem. But you, my dear friends, that have received this law from heavenly Sion, and the word from heavenly Jeruſalem, in the new convenant, where the life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is enjoyed, you ſee the end and aboliſhing of the Jews law and ceremonies from mount Sinai. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my deſire is, that you may all keep in the law of life and love, which ye have in Chriſt Jeſus, by which love the body is edified, knit, and united together to Chriſt Jeſus, the Head. Which love doth bear all things, fulfils the law, will preſerve all in humility, and in it to be of one mind, heart, and ſoul. So all may come to drink into that one Spirit, that doth baptize them and circumciſe them, plunging down and cutting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, that is got up in man and woman by their tranſgreſſing of God's commands. So that in this holy pure Spirit all may ſerve and worſhip the pure God in ſpirit and in truth. which is over all the worſhips that are out of God's Spirit and his truth. In this Spirit ye will all have a ſpiritual unity and fellowſhip over all the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the unclean ſpirits, which are out of truth in the world. By this holy Spirit all your hearts, minds, and
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:037441_0790_100D938E7275E860"/>ſouls may be knit together to Chriſt, from whence it comes; and by the grace and truth, which is come by Jeſus Chriſt, which all ſhould be under the teachings of in the new covenant, and not under the law, as the outward Jews were in the old covenant. By this grace and truth in the new covenant, all may be made God's free men and women, to ſerve God in the new life, the new and living way; ſhewing forth the fruits of the new heart and new Spirit, in the new covenant, over death and darkneſs. Glory be to the Lord for ever! In this grace and truth is heavenly, gracious, and true liberty to every ſpiritual mind, which makes you free from him that is out of truth, where your bondage was. Alſo your liberty in the holy, divine, and precious faith, which gives you victory over that which once ſeparated you from God and Chriſt, by which faith ye have acceſs to God again through Jeſus Chriſt. So in this divine and holy faith, ye have divine, holy, and precious liberty, yea and victory over him that ſeparated you from God; and this faith is held in a pure conſcience. So the liberty in the ſpirit of God is in that which baptizes and plunges down ſin and iniquity, and puts off the body of death and ſins of the fleſh, that are got up by tranſgreſſing God's command. And alſo the liberty of the goſpel, which is ſent from heaven by the Holy Ghoſt, which is the power of God, which was and is again to be preached to all nations; in this goſpel is the true liberty, and the goſpel-fellowſhip and order. So that the evil ſpirit or conſcience, or falſe dead faith, that which is ungracious, out of truth, and not in the Spirit of God, nor in his goſpel, nor in the divine faith, its liberty is in the darkneſs; for all true liberty is in the goſpel, and in the truth that makes free; in the faith, in the grace, and in Chriſt Jeſus, who deſtroys the devil and his works, that hath brought all mankind into bondage. So in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, peaceable Spirit, truth, and faith, which works by love, and in the goſpel of peace, and in Chriſt Jeſus is all the ſaints peace, and pure, true, and holy liberty; in which they have ſalt, ſome, feeling, diſcerning, and ſavour, yea and unity and fellowſhip one with another, and with the Son and the Father, that heavenly, eternal fellowſhip. So all being ſubject to the grace and truth, and to the faith and goſpel (the power of God) and to his good Spirit, in this they diſtinguiſh all true, pure, and holy liberty from that which is falſe. This will bring all to ſit low; for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:037441_0791_100D93909D3F55D0"/>runs the race, and the Lamb muſt have the victory; and not the rough, unruly, and vain talkers, unbaptized, uncircumciſed, and unſantified. Such travel not in the way of regeneration, but in the way of unregeneration: neither go they down into the death with Chriſt by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Such are not like to reign with him in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, who are not buried with him in baptiſm. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all muſt go downward into the death of Chriſt, and be crucified with him, if they will ariſe and follow him in the regeneration before they come to reign with him. And, friends, many may have precious openings; but I deſire all may be comprehended in that which doth open to them, and that they may all keep in the daily croſs; then they keep in the power that kills and crucifies that which would lead them amongſt the beaſts and goats, to leaven them into their rough, unruly ſpirit; that through the croſs, the power of God, that may be crucified, and they in the power might follow the Lamb. For the power of God keeps all in order, ſubjection, and humility, in that which is lovely, virtuous, decent, comely, temperate, and moderate; ſo that their moderation comes to appear to all men. My deſire is, that all your lights may ſhine as from a city ſet upon a hill, that cannot be hid; and that ye may be the ſalt of the earth, to ſalt, ſeaſon, and make it ſavoury to God, and you all ſeaſoned with it. Then all your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices will be a ſweet ſavour to the Lord, and ye will be as the lilies and roſes, and garden of God, which gives a ſweet ſmell unto him: whoſe garden is preſerved by his power, the hedge that hedges out all the unruly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury, the deſtroyers and hurters of the vines, buds, and plants, and God's tender blade, which ſprings up from his ſeed of life, who waters it with his heavenly water and word of life every moment, that they may grow and be fruitful; that ſo he may have a pleaſant and fruitful garden. Here all are kept freſh and green, being watered every moment with the everlaſting holy water of life from the Lord, the fountain. My dear friends, my deſire is, that this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſeed, that bruiſes down the head of the ſerpent both within and without, may be your crown and life, and ye in him one another's crown and joy, to the praiſe of the Lord God over all, bleſſed for evermore. This holy ſeed will outlaſt and wear out all that which the evil ſeed ſince the fall of man hath brought forth and ſet up. As every one hath received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:037441_0792_100D939356E0F6D0"/>in the humility which he teaches: and ſhun the occaſions of ſtrife, vain janglings, and diſputings with men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, who are deſtitute of the truth; for the truth is peaceable, the goſpel is a peaceable habitation in the power of God; his wiſdom is peaceable and gentle, and his kingdom ſtands in peace. Oh! his glory ſhines over all his works! in Chriſt Jeſus ye will have peace, who is not of the world; yea a peace that the world cannot take away; for the peace which ye have from him was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, and will be when it is gone. This keeps all in that which is weighty and ſubſtantial over all chaff. Glory to the Lord God over all for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
                        <p>And now, my dear friends, the Lord doth require more of you than he doth of other people, becauſe he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more to you.

The next day having a ſenſe upon me that ſome who had received the truth, and had openings thereof, for want of keeping low had run out therefrom, I was moved to give forth the following epiſtle, as a <q>warning and exhortation to all to dwell in humility.</q>

                        <p>WHOM the Lord in his tender mercies hath viſited with the day-ſpring from on high, and hath opened you to confeſs and bow to his name; keep low in your minds, and learn of Chriſt who teacheth you humility, to keep in it; ſo that in no wiſe ye that be younger be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, puffed up, or conceited through your openings, and by that means loſe your conditions, by being carried up into preſumption; then fall into deſpair, and ſo abuſe the power of God. For it was the apoſtles care, that none ſhould abuſe the power of the Lord God; but in all things their faith was to ſtand therein, that they all might be comprehended into the truth which they ſpoke to others, that they might not be preachers to others and themſelves caſt-aways. Therefore it doth concern you to be comprehended into that which ye preach to others, and keep low in it; then the God of truth will exalt the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his truth, light, grace, power, and Spirit, and in his wiſdom to his glory.

About the latter end of this year I was moved of the Lord to travel into the ſouth again. I ſet forward the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt month, 1679-80, and paſſing through part of Weſtmoreland and Lancaſhire, I viſited friends at ſeveral meetings, and came into Yorkſhire. Divers large and weighty meetings I had in Yorkſhire, before I came to York city. When I came there it was the aſſize-time, and there being many friends in priſon for truth's ſake, I put thoſe at liberty upon drawing up the ſufferings of the friends in priſon, that they might be laid before the judges; and I affiſted them therein. The quarterly meeting of friends was alſo at that time, ſo I had a brave opportunity amongſt them. Many weighty and ſerviceable things did the Lord open through me to the meeting, relating to the inward ſtate of man; how man by faith in Chriſt comes to be graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into him, and made a member of his ſpiritual body; and alſo the outward ſtate of the church, how each member ought to walk and act, according to its place in the body. I ſpent ſeveral days in York, having divers meetings; and all was peaceable and well. I went alſo to the caſtle, to viſit the priſoners; with whom I ſpent ſome time, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and ſtrengthening them in their teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>Then leaving York, I travelled ſouthward, having meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings amongſt friends, till I came to Burton in Lincolnſhire; where on firſt-day I had a large and precious meeting. Then turning into Nottinghamſhire, I travelled through good part of that county, in which I had ſeveral very good meetings, and then paſſed into Derbyſhire, Leiceſterſhire, and Warwickſhire, having meetings all along as I went, till I came to Warwick: there William Dewſbury came to me, and ſeveral other friends; and we had a little meeting in that town. Then paſſing through Southam and Radway, at each of which places I had a very good meeting, I came to Nathaniel Ball's, of North-Newton, in Oxfordſhire, and ſo to Banbury to a monthly meeting there. After I had viſited friends at their meetings in the bordering parts of Oxfordſhire, Glouceſterſhire, and Northamptonſhire, I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Richard Baker's, of Biddleſden, in Buckinghamſhire; and the next day, being firſt-day, I had a very large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Biddleſden, at an old abbey-houſe, which a friend rented and dwelt in. Many friends and people came to this meeting out of Oxfordſhire, Northamptonſhire, and the parts adjacent; and of good ſervice it was. After this, I viſited friends in thoſe parts, having meetings at Lilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:037441_0796_100D939BCB273598"/>Lovel, and Bugbrook. Then going to Stony-ſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I went into ſome parts of Bedfordſhire, till I came to Edward Cheſter's of Dunſtable. Whence paſſing on by Market-ſtreet, I had a meeting at Albans; and calling on friends at Mims and Barnet, I came to the widow Haly's, at Gutterſhedge, in Hendon, Middleſex, on a ſeventh-day night, and had a very large and good meeting there the day following.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed from thence to London the third-day following, and went directly to the Peel-meeting at John Elſon's, and next morning to the meeting at Gracechurch-ſtreet, which was very large and quiet; and friends rejoiced in the Lord to ſee me. The yearly meeting was in the week following, to which many friends came out of moſt parts of the nation, and a bleſſed opportunity the Lord gave us together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ancient love was ſweetly felt, and the heavenly life flowed abundantly over all. After the yearly meeting, I continued about a month or five weeks in and about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, labouring in the work of the Lord both in and out of meetings; for beſides the publick teſtimony, which the Lord gave me to bear both to friends and to the world in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I had much ſervice lay upon me with reſpect to friends ſufferings, in ſeeking to get eaſe and liberty for them in this and other nations. Much pains and time I ſpent while I was at London, in writing letters to friends in divers parts of England, and in Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and ſeveral other parts of America.</p>
                  <p>After this I was moved of the Lord to viſit friends in ſome parts of Surrey and Suſſex. I went to Kingſton by water, and tarried certain days; for while I was there, the Lord laid it upon me to write both to the great Turk and the dey of Algiers ſeverally, to warn them and the people under them to turn from their wickedneſs, and fear the Lord, and do juſtly, leſt the judgments of God ſhould come upon them, and deſtroy them without remedy. To the Algerines I wrote more particularly, concerning the cruelty they exerciſed towards friends and others, whom they held captives in Algiers. When I had finiſhed that ſervice, and viſited friends in their meetings at Kingſton, I went further into the country, and had meetings amongſt friends at Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſdon, Guildſord, Eſher, Capell, Patchgate, Worming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt. Bletchington, Horſham, I field, Ryegate, Gatton, &amp;c. and ſo came back to Kingſton again, and from thence to Hammerſmith. And having ſpent ſome days in the ſervice
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:037441_0797_100D939DE6808588"/>of truth amongſt friends at Hammerſmith, Batterſea. Wandſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, and thereabouts I croſſed over, by Kenſington, to Hendon, where I had a very good meeting on firſt-day; and went from thence to London.</p>
                  <p>When I had been about ten days in London, I was drawn again to viſit friends in the country; and went to Edmonton to Chriſtopher Taylor's, who kept a ſchool for the education of friends children. I had ſome ſervice amongſt the youth, and then went towards Hertford, viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends in the way. At Hertford I met with John Story, and ſome others of his party; but the teſtimony of truth went over them, and kept them down, ſo that the meeting was quiet. It was on a firſt-day, and the next day being the men's and women's meeting for buſineſs, I viſited them alſo; and the rather becauſe ſome in that place had let in a diſeſteem of them. Whereupon I was moved to open the ſervice of thoſe meetings, and the uſefulneſs and benefit thereof to the church of Chriſt, as the Lord opened the thing in me; and it was of good ſervice to friends. I had a meeting alſo with ſome of thoſe that were gone into ſtrife and contention, to ſhew them wherein they were wrong; and having cleared myſelf of them. I left them to the Lord. After another publick meeting in the town <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London by Waltham-abbey, where I had a publick meeting the firſt-day following, and another with friends in the evening. Next day I went to Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When I had finiſhed that ſervice, I went to London by Shacklewell, where was a ſchool kept by friends, for the breeding up young maidens that were friends daughters.</p>
                  <p>I abode at London moſt part of this winter, having much ſervice for the Lord there, both in and out of meetings; for as it was a time of great ſufferings among friends, I was drawn in ſpirit to viſit friends meetings more frequently, to encourage and ſtrengthen them by exhortation and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

To clear our innocency and ſtop the mouths of our adverſaries, I drew up a ſhort paper to be delivered to the parliament; as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>IT is our principle and teſtimony to deny and renounce all plots and plotters againſt the king, or any of his ſubjects; for we have the Spirit of Chriſt, by which we have the mind of Chriſt, who came to ſave men's lives, and not to deſtroy them. We deſire the ſafety of the king and all his ſubjects. Wherefore we do declare, that we will endeavour, to our power, to ſave and defend him and them, by diſcovering all plots and plotters, which ſhall come to our knowledge, that would deſtroy the king or his ſubjects. This we do ſincerely offer unto you. But as to ſwearing and fighting, which in tenderneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience we cannot do, ye know that we have ſuffered theſe many years for our conſcientious refuſal thereof. And now that the Lord hath brought you together, we diſire you to relieve and free us from thoſe ſufferings, and that ye will not put upon us to do thoſe things which we have ſuffered ſo much and ſo long already for not doing; for if ye do, ye will make our ſufferings and bonds ſtronger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of relieving us.</p>

                  <p>About this time I received two very envious books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt truth and friends; one of them by a doctor (ſo called) of Bremen, in Germany, the other by a prieſt, of Dantzick, in Poland. They were both full of groſs falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and reproachful ſlanders. I found it upon me to anſwer them, and that I might not be over-much interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other buſineſs and company, I went to Kingſton upon Thames, where I wrote an anſwer to each of them,

                        <p>YOU that bear the name of Chriſtian magiſtrates, my deſire is that you may all be found in Chriſt, and not only have the name, but be made partakers of his divine nature; that ye may be not only ſayers of the word, but doers of the word, not only profeſſors of Chriſt, and talkers of Chriſt, but let Chriſt rule in your hearts by faith, and be walkers in Chriſt. For as Chriſt's great apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſaith, <q>As every one hath received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo let him walk in him; for in him there is peace.</q> If all that profeſs Chriſt did walk in Chriſt, they would walk in peace, and be in unity; for the apoſtle exhorted the Chriſtians in his day to keep the unity of the Spirit. which is the bond of peace, yea of Chriſt the King of kings peace. All Chriſtians who have the ſcriptures, and are not in this Spirit of Chriſt, are not in unity one with another, and ſo have broken this bond of peace, which ſhould knit and unite them together. Likewiſe all that profeſs the truth of Chriſt ſhould live in it; for it is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the goſpel is the goſpel of peace; which if all Chriſtians lived in, they would be at peace one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and in the glorio the glorious fellowſhip of the goſpel. And if all Chriſtians kept in the fear of God, which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the pure, heavenly, peaceable, and gentle wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is eaſy to be intreated (above that wiſdom which is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh, and deſtroying) there
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:037441_0800_100D93A4CFD690C0"/>would be no difference and deſtroying about matters of religion.</p>
                        <p>I do declare the mighty day of the Lord is come and coming, and the Lord God is come to teach his people himſelf by his Son (Hebrews i.) who bruiſes the ſerpent's head, that falſe teacher, that led Adam and Eve from God their Teacher. God will teach his people by his Son, the Teacher of Adam and Eve in paradiſe, before they fell, diſobeyed the Lord and forſook him, and followed the ſerpent; whoſe head Chriſt bruiſeth, and renews man and woman up again into the image of God which Adam and Eve were in before they fell: glory and honour be to God through Jeſus Chriſt, who hath called us by his Son into his glorious image, to ſerve and worſhip him in his Spirit and truth; which holy Spirit and truth the devil is out of, and cannot come into.</p>
                        <p>I deſire all Chriſtian magiſtrates to take heed of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting any, though they diſſer from you in matters of faith, worſhip, and religion. For Chriſt ſaith, <q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harveſt;</q> and he forbad ſuch as would be plucking up tares: the reaſon was, "Leſt they ſhould pluck up the, wheat alſo;" for Chriſt ſaid, it ſhould be his angels work to ſeparate the tares from the wheat. Moreover Chriſt ſaid, they ſhould go into everlaſting puniſhment that did not viſit him in priſon in his members; then what will become of them that caſt him into priſon, where he is made manifeſt in his members! Oh! lay theſe things to heart! A day of jud ment will come, vengeance and recompenſe upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to their works.</p>
                        <p>To thoſe diſciples, who would have had fire to come down from heaven to conſume them that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, he turned about, rebuked, and told them, <q>They did not know what ſpirit they were of; for he came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore let all magiſtrates and prieſts, in that which is called Chriſtendom, conſider who have deſtroyed men and women's lives ſince the apoſtles days, becauſe they could not receive the religions, ways, and worſhips, which they have made and ſet up; have they known that ſpirit they have been of?

So God may be glorified by all and in all through Jeſus Chriſt, who is over all, who calls all to peace, and is bleſſed for ever.</p>
                        <p>I would have you to be as noble as the Bereans, and ſearch the ſcriptures of Chriſt and the apoſtles. Where did he or they give any command to impriſon, baniſh, perſecute, or put to death any that would not receive or conform to them, or that were contrary-minded to them in religion, or differed from them in matters of worſhip?</p>
                        <p>Again I deſire all Chriſtian magiſtrates to ſearch both criptures and chronicles, and ſee what was the end of all perſecutors, and what judgments came upon them. What fell upon Cain, who was the firſt perſecutor for matters of faith and ſacrifice? Did not he become a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth? What became of the old world that grieved God, and Noah, a preacher of righteouſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ſs? What became of Sodom that vexed juſt Lot? What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of Pharaoh that perſecuted God's people in Egypt? (though the more he perſecuted them the more they grew) What became of Ahab and Jezebel that perſecuted the Lord's prophets? And what became of Haman that would have deſtroyed the Jews? What became of the Jews and Jeruſalem that perſecuted Chriſt and the apoſtles? What was the end of all theſe? Are they not become vagabonds in the earth, and driven away from their native country? Therefore I beſeech you in the love and fear of God, be ſo noble as to ſearch both ſcripture and hiſtory, and let not your divine underſtanding be clouded. What will become of the beaſt and whore ſpoken of in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with their falſe prophets, that have drunk the blood of the ſaints, martyrs, and prophets of Jeſus? Muſt they not all go with the devil, who is a murderer, deſtroyer, an I adverſary of mankind, into the lake of ſire that burns with brimſtone? Ye may be ſure that ſpirit that ſtirs you up to perſecution, let it be in whomſoever it will, is not of Chriſt, and of his lamb-like nature, who takes away the ſins of the world, not the lives of men.</p>
                        <p>Paul was a perſecutor a haler to priſon, before he was
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:037441_0802_100D93A8CA650A90"/>converted to Chriſtianity, but never after. And therefore are not all in Saul's nature, let them be of what name or profeſſion ſoever, that are perſecutors, and unconverted into Paul's life of Chriſtianity? He ſaid the life that he lived after he was converted, was by faith in the Son of God; and that he lived, yet not he, but <q>Chriſt lived in him,</q> who came to ſave men's lives, and not to deſtroy them. This life ſhould be the life of all Chriſtians now, which Paul in his converted ſtate lived in. And the apoſtle ſaith, <q>The law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs, for the ungodly and ſinners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers of fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for manſlayers, for whoremongers, and for them that defile themſelves with mankind, for men-ſtealers, liars, and perjured perſons,</q> 1 Tim. i. So the law in its place is good againſt ſuch. Again the apoſtle ſays, <q>The law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion,</q> Gal. iii. 19. Here all magiſtrates may ſee what the law in its place is good againſt, and what it was made for and againſt, and what evils, the apoſtle ſays, it takes hold upon. He does not ſay, the law ſhould be laid upon men that differed from them in their religion and judgment, nor upon right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous men. So you may ſee in what condition the law is good, and what it was made againſt; not againſt righteous men, againſt whom they have nothing, only becauſe they differ from them in matters of religion; letting manſlayers, whoremongers, perjured perſons, ungodly, prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, liars, &amp;c. go unpuniſhed; ſo do not uſe, nor execute the law lawfully, as the apoſtle ſays; <q>The law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully.</q> Therefore it ought to be uſed lawfully; which law, the apoſtle ſays, is for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil-doers, and a praiſe to them that do well, as may be ſeen, Rom. xiii. So, as the apoſtle ſaid, <q>We do not break the law, nor make it void; but we eſtabliſh the law,</q> Rom. iii. 31.</p>
                        <p>This is from him who deſires the eternal good and ſalvation of you all in Chriſt Jeſus, Amen.</p>

After I had finiſhed theſe ſervices, I returned to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where I ſtaid about a month, labouring amongſt friends in the work of the Lord, both in publick meetings for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in thoſe relating to the outward affairs of the church. Then feeling my ſpirit drawn to viſit friends about Enfield, I went to Waltham Abbey, where I had a very precious meeting, and another at Flamſtead Heath. Having ſpent ſome time amongſt friends thereabouts, and had divers good meetings at Edmonton, Enfield, Winchmore-hill, and other places, I came back to London a little before the yearly meeting, which was in the third month 1681. It was a very precious meeting, in which the glorious preſence and power of the Lord was eminently felt and enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>Some time after it came upon me to write the following epiſtle:</p>

                        <p>CHRIST, the ſecond Adam, who is both head and huſband of his church, the Redeemer, Purchaſer, Saviour, Sanctifier, and Reconciler of his ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to God, I ſay his preſence (to wit Chriſt's) feel among you, to exerciſe his prophetical office, in opening you with his light, grace, truth, power, and ſpirit; and to exerciſe his office, as he is a biſhop, to overſee you with his light, grace, power, and ſpirit, that ye do not go aſtray from God. As Chriſt is a ſhepherd, feel, ſee, and hear him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing that office, who has laid down his life for his ſheep, is feeding them in his living paſtures of life, and makes them to drink of his living, eternal ſprings.

So all ye ſubjects to Chriſt's kingdom of peace, if ye want wiſdom, knowledge, life, or ſalvation, Chriſt is the treaſure; feel him the treaſure among you. And every one, as ye have received Chriſt, walk in him in whom ye have peace; who bruiſes the head of the ſerpent, the author of all ſtrife, diſtraction, and confuſion: yea, you have peace with God, and one with another, though the trouble be from the world and the world's ſpirit.

Whatever ye do, let it be done in the name of Jeſus, to the praiſe of God the Father, keeping in unity in the Holy Spirit of God, which was before the unholy ſpirit was: which Holy Spirit is your bond of peace, yea, the holy King of Kings and Lord of Lords his peace.

                  <p>About this time I had occaſion to go to ſeveral of the judges chambers, upon a ſuit about tithes. For my wife and I, with ſeveral other friends, were ſued in Cartmel Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentake Court in Lancaſhire, for ſmall tithes, and we had demurred to the juriſdiction of that court. Whereupon the plaintiff proſecuted us in the exchequer court at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; where they run us up to a writ of rebellion, for not anſwering the bill upon oath, and got an order of court to the ſerjeant to take me and my wife into cuſtody. This was a little before the yearly meeting, at which time it was thought they would have taken me up; and according to outward appearance it was likely, and very eaſy for him to have done it, I lodging at the ſame places where I uſed to lodge, and being very publick in meetings. But the Lord's power was over them, and reſtrained them, ſo that they did not take me. Yet underſtanding a warrant was out againſt me, as ſoon as the yearly meeting was well over, I took William Mead with me, and went to ſeveral of the judges chambers, to let them underſtand both the ſtate of the caſe, and the ground and reaſon of our refuſing to pay tithes. The firſt we went to was judge Gregory, to whom I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered mine and my wife's anſwer to the plaintiſſ's bill; in
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:037441_0805_100D93AF6D6EAD20"/>which was ſet forth, That my wife had lived three-and-forty years at Swarthmore, and in all that time there had been no tithe paid nor demanded: and an old man, who had long been a tithe-gatherer, had made affidavit that he never gathered tithe at Swarthmore Hall in judge Fell's time, nor ſince. There were many particulars in our anſwer, but it would not be accepted without an oath. I told the judge, that both tithe and ſwearing among Chriſtians came from the pope; and it was matter of conſcience to us not to pay tithes, nor to ſwear; for Chriſt bid his diſciples, who had freely received, give freely; and he commanded them, <q>Not to ſwear at all.</q> The judge ſaid. There was tithe paid in England before popery was. I aſked him by what law or ſtatute they were paid then? but he was ſilent. Then I told him, there were eight poor men brought up to London out of the north about two hundred miles, for ſmall tithes; one of them had no family, but himſelf and his wife, and kept no living creature but a cat. I aſked him alſo, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could take a man and his wife, and impriſon them both for ſmall tithes, and ſo deſtroy a family? If they could, I deſired to know by what law? He did not anſwer me; but only ſaid, That was an hard caſe. When I found there was no help to be had there, we left him, and went to judge Montague's chamber. With him I had a great deal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning tithes. Whereupon he ſent for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's attorney; and when he came, I offered him our anſwer. He ſaid, If we would pay the charges of the court, and be bound to ſtand trial, and abide the judgment of the court, we ſhould not have the oath tendered to us. I told him, they had brought thoſe charges upon us, by requiring us to put in our anſwer upon oath; which they knew before we could not do for conſcience-ſake; and as we could not pay any tithe, nor ſwear, ſo neither ſhould we pay any of their charges. Upon this he would not receive our anſwer. So we went from thence to judge Atkyns's chamber; and he being buſy, we gave our anſwers and our reaſons againſt tithes and ſwearing to his clerk; but neither could we find any encouragement from him to expect redreſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving him, we went to one of the moſt noted counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and ſhewed him the ſtate of our caſe, and our anſwers: he was very civil to us, and ſaid, <q>This way of proceeding againſt us was ſomewhat like an inquiſition.</q> A few days after, thoſe eight poor friends, that were brought up ſo far out of the north, appeared before the judges and the Lord
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:037441_0806_100D93B1CC533A48"/>was with them, and his power was over the court, ſo that the friends were not committed to the Fleet. Our cauſe was put off till the next term (called Michaelmas term) and then it was brought before the four judges again. William Mead told the judges, that I had engaged myſelf never to meddle with my wife's eſtate. The judges could hardly believe that any man would do ſo; whereupon he ſhewed them the writing under my hand and ſeal; at which they wondered. Then two of the judges and ſome of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers ſtood up and pleaded for me, that I was not liable to the tithes; but the other two judges and divers lawyers 'preſſed earneſtly to have me ſequeſtered, alleging that I 'was a publick man. At length they prevailed with one of the other two judges to join with them, and then granted a ſequeſtration againſt me and my wife together. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, by advice of counſel, we moved for a limitation, which was granted; and that much defeated our adverſary's deſign in ſuing out the ſequeſtration; for this limited the plaintiff to take no more than was proved. One of the judges, baron Weſton, was very bitter, and broke forth in a great rage againſt me in the open court: but in a little time after he died.</p>
                  <p>After the yearly meeting I tarried about a month in London; then went into Suſſex to viſit friends there, amongſt whom I had many large and very precious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in divers parts of that county. Yet I ſpent not much time in Suſſex, but returned pretty ſoon to London, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I felt drawings in my ſpirit; and had very good ſervice for the Lord there, both in publick meetings and amongſt friends. When I had tarried ſometime in London, I went to Edmonton; and from thence into Buckinghamſhire, where I viſited friends at ſeveral meetings in the upper ſide of that county; and then went by Henley to Reading, where I tarried ſeveral meetings. I went no farther weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at this time than Ore, where I had a very large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after which, ſtriking through the edge of Oxfordſhire, I had a large and very precious meeting at Warborough, in which the glory of the Lord ſhined over all. Many friends came to this meeting out of Berkſhire, Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Hampſhire. From thence I paſſed to Ilmore in the Vale of Buckinghamſhire, where we had a glorious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The day following I returned to Mary Penington's. From whence I viſited the men's and women's monthly meetings at Hungerhill, and ſome other meetings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts;
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:037441_0807_100D93B38B95E588"/>then paſſed to Watford, where was a marriage of two friends, at which I was preſent. A very large meeting we had on that occaſion, and the Lord's power was over all. I went from Watford to Longford in Middleſex, viſiting friends at Uxbridge in the way. At Longford we had a large meeting, it being on firſt-day, and the preſence of the Lord was preciouſly felt amongſt us; bleſſed be his name! I paſſed from Longford to Kingſton, viſiting friends as I went, at Staines and Sunbury. At Kingſton I abode with friends two meetings, wherein we were ſweetly refreſhed together in the Lord. Paſſing from thence towards London, I had a very precious meeting at Wandſworth: then croſſing over to Hammerſmith. I had a good meeting there; which was the larger by reaſon of a burial, and there being a pretty open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs in the people on that occaſion, I had a fine opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to open the way of truth amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>After I was come to London, I was moved to write the following paper, concerning that ſpirit which had led ſome who profeſſed truth, into ſtrife and diviſion, and to oppoſe the way and work of the Lord:</p>

                        <p>YOU that keep your habitation in the truth that is over all, do ſee that it is the ſame ſpirit which leads the backſliders and apoſtates now from the ſpiritual fellowſhip and unity of the church of Chriſt, that led Adam and Eve from God. This ſpirit was the ſame that was in the world, which got into the Jews when they were gone from the Spirit of God; and then turned againſt God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and againſt Chriſt and his apoſtles. That ſpirit led them to be as bad as Pilate, or worſe. The enmity or adverſary was got within them againſt the truth, and thoſe that walked in it, and the Spirit of the Lord; ſo that they killed and deſtroyed the Juſt. This was the ſpirit of the devil, the deſtroyer, who ſought not only to deſtroy the truth, but the order of it, and thoſe that walked in it, when true Chriſtianity was planted among the poſſeſſors of the light, grace, and truth, the holy goſpel faith and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who enjoyed Chriſt in their heart. But when ſome began to err from the Spirit and faith, to hate the light, diſobey the goſpel, turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, walk deſpitefully againſt the Spirit of grace, turn from the truth, crucify to themſelves Chriſt afreſh, and put him to open ſhame; theſe were they that let in the ſpirit of the
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:037441_0808_100D93B6C3545350"/>world, who held the form of godlineſs, but denied the power thereof; and troubled the churches in the apoſtles days. When the ſpirit of Satan had got into ſuch, they were more troubleſome to the church than the open perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors without. Theſe got into the aſſemblies to deceive the hearts of the ſimple; having the good words and fair ſpeeches, the ſheep's clothing. Paul, Peter, John, Jude, and James had much to do with ſuch, to keep them from troubling the church of Chriſt; for they are out of the light, power, and Spirit; therefore the apoſtles of Chriſt exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaints to keep to the Word of life within; to the Anointing: to the grace, truth, and Holy Spirit in their hearts. This foul ſpirit will profeſs all the ſcriptures in words; but by the Spirit of God, which is holy, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is tried, and its fruits. So the apoſtates went from the power and Spirit of God, and turned againſt the prophets and martyrs of Jeſus; and became the whore, whoſe cup all nations drank of. The dragon with his tail threw down many of the ſtars, and would have devoured the woman with his flood; but the woman, the true church, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt her; and then the dragon made war with her Seed. So the dragon, the whore, beaſt, and falſe prophets, all made war againſt the Lamb and the ſaints, but the Lamb and the ſaints will overcome them, and have the victory. And now the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goſpel is preached again to all nations, tongues, and people; and many are gathered into the goſpel, the power of God, turned to the light, which is the life in Chriſt, grafted into him, and are come to walk in the order of the new covenant of light and life, in the goſpel of peace and ſalvation. The ſame ſpirit that oppoſed the apoſtles and the churches in their days, oppoſes now; yea, it is the ſame that oppoſed Chriſt and diſdained him, that diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God's ſervants now. The ſame that oppoſed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and rebelled againſt Moſes, oppoſes and rebels againſt God's ſervants and people now. It is the ſame dark, blind, diſobedient, faithleſs, wilful, jealous ſpirit, that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes ſome with the hands, and others with the tongue. It is the ſame ſpirit that is now going about ſometimes like a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lion, ſometimes like a twiſting ſerpent to tempt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and to devour, in thoſe that have fair ſpeeches and good words, the ſheep's clothing, in a form of godlineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of light and liberty, but deny the power thereof, and inwardly are ravening wolves. If it were poſſible they
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:037441_0809_100D93B856828320"/>would deceive the very elect. But the elect are in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of light and life, in the power of God over them, and in Chriſt, who will grind them to pieces, and ſlay all his enemies with his ſpiritual ſword, who will not have him to rule over or in them. In Chriſt all his people have reſt and peace, who is their ſanctuary over all ſtorms and tempeſts. In Chriſt, the ſanctuary, no deceiver nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer can come; for he is a place of ſweet reſt and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hallelujah! praiſe the Lord for his ſanctuary, Amen.</p>

                  <p>Sufferings continuing ſevere upon friends at London, I found my ſervice lay moſtly there: wherefore I went but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of town, and not far; being frequent at the moſt publick meetings, to encourage friends, both by word and example, to ſtand faſt in the teſtimony to which God had called them. At other times I went from houſe to houſe, viſiting thoſe friends that had their goods taken away for their teſtimony to truth. And becauſe the wicked inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were grown very audacious, by reaſon they had much countenance and encouragement from ſome juſtices, who, truſting wholly to their information, proceeded againſt friends without hearing them: whereby many were made to ſuffer, not only contrary to right, but even contrary to law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. I adviſed with ſome friends about it; and we drew up a paper, which was delivered to moſt of the magiſtrates in and about the city, as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>WHEREAS informers have obtained warrants of ſome juſtices of peace, who have convicted many of us without hearing us, or once ſummoning us to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; by which proceedings many have had their goods ſeized and taken away, being generally ſined ten pounds apiece for an unknown ſpeaker: and ſome of thoſe perſons ſo fined have not been at the meetings they were fined for; and the ſpeaker notwithſtanding hath himſelf been fined for the ſame meeting, the ſame day the others were fined for the unknown ſpeaker. The juſtices may ſee the wickedneſs of theſe informers, by whoſe falſe oaths we have been convicted for an unknown preacher, when the preacher hath been both known and fined. Alſo in their ſwearing ſuch perſons to have been at ſuch a meeting ſuch a day, when indeed thoſe ſo ſworn againſt have not
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:037441_0810_100D7F9E05D19BD8"/>been at that meeting. By which proceedings ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the king's peaceable ſubjects are like to be ruined, if a ſpeedy ſtop be not put thereunto. Therefore we hope and deſire that you, the king's juſtices, for the time to come, when any informers ſhall come to any of you with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt any of us, will ſummon ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to appear before you, and hear us and our accuſers face to face; that none may ſuffer for what they are not guilty of. For Pilate the governor heard Chriſt and his accuſers face to face before he condemned him, John xix. The council and chief prieſts heard Stephen and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, with the witneſſes that were brought againſt him, face to face, before they condemned him, Acts vii. The Roman captain heard Paul and his accuſers face to face. Acts xxiii. Felix the governor heard Paul and Ananias the high-prieſt, and the elders that accuſed Paul, face to face, Acts xxiv. And when the high-prieſts and chief of the Jews accuſed Paul to Feſtus, he heard Paul and his accuſers, and them that witneſſed againſt him, face to face, Acts xxv. Doth the law of God, or did the Roman law, or doth the law of the land judge any man before he and his accuſers, and they that witneſs againſt him, be heard face to face?</q>

                  <p>This ſomewhat moderated the juſtices: and after this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends, who had been illegally proſecuted and fined, entered their appeals; upon trial whereof they were acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the informers caſt: which was a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the informers, and ſome relief to friends.</p>
                  <p>A little before the time for chooſing new ſheriffs for the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe who put up to be choſen deſiring our friends to give their voices for them, I wrote a few lines, tending to diſcover what ſpirit they were of, and how they ſtood affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to true liberty; it was by way of inquiry, thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>DO any here in London, who ſtand to be choſen ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, own that Chriſt, who was crucified without the gates of Jeruſalem, to be the light of the world, that "en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man that cometh into the world," who ſaith, <q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light?</q> Is any of you againſt perſecuting people for their religion and worſhip of God in Spirit and truth, as Chriſt commandeth? For Chriſt ſaid. <q>I am not of this world nor my kingdom:</q> therefore he doth not uphold his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:037441_0811_100D93BC25C33898"/>worſhip and pure religion with worldly and carnal weapons. Chriſt ſaid, "Swear not at all;" and his apoſtle James ſaith the ſame: but will not you force us to ſwear, and break Chriſt's and his apoſtle's commands, in putting oaths to us? Chriſt ſaith to his apoſtles, <q>Freely ye have received, freely give:</q> Will not you force us to give tithes and maintenance to ſuch teachers as we know God hath not ſent? Shall we be free to ſerve and worſhip God, and keep his and his Son's commands, if we give our voices freely for you? for we are unwilling to give our voices for ſuch as will impriſon and perſecute us, and ſpoil our goods.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever the candidates were, I obſerved heat and ſtrife in the ſpirits of the people that were to chooſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wrote a few lines to be ſpread amongſt them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</p>

                        <p>I had ſome inclination to go into the country to a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but hearing there would be a buſtle at our meetings, and feeling great diſquietneſs in people's ſpirits in the city about chooſing ſheriffs, it was upon me to go to the meeting in Gracechurch-ſtreet on firſt-day. William Penn went with me, and ſpoke in the meeting. While he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the truth, a conſtable came in with his great ſtaff, and bid him give over, and come down: but William Penn held on, declaring truth in the power of God. After awhile the conſtable drew back; and when William Penn had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>. I ſtood up and declared to the people <q>the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:037441_0812_100D93C02031C688"/>goſpel which was preached in the apoſtles days, and to Abraham; which the church in the apoſtles days did receive, and came to be heirs of. This goſpel, I declared, was ſent from heaven by the Holy Ghoſt in the apoſtles days, and is ſo now; and was not of man, neither by man, but by the revelation of the Holy Ghoſt. And now this goſpel is preached again (as John ſaw, and ſaid it ſhould be) to all nations, tongues, and people; and all people now are to hear Chriſt the Prophet, in this his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the new covenant. For as Moſes ſaid, <q>Like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me will God raiſe up a prophet, and him ſhall ye hear in all things:</q> ſo ſaid I, this prophet Chriſt is come, and all the Jews in Spirit, the true believing Chriſtians in the light, who have the law of God written in their hearts, and put into their minds, are to hear Chriſt in his goſpel, new teſtament, and new covenant, which is the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, who bruiſes the ſerpent's head (which is the head of enmity) and makes free from the law of ſin and death. I ſhewed, that all whom Chriſt quickens and makes alive, he makes to ſit together in the heavenly places in himſelf. So that they do not wander up and down, like the fool's eye in the corners of the earth; nor are their eyes abroad in the world, to ſit down in the world's invented ſeats of religion; but they ſit together in him, as the ſaints did in the apoſtles days. So Chriſt was and is their treaſure of wiſdom, life, knowledge, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q> As I was thus ſpeaking, two conſtables came in with their great ſtaves, and bid me, <q>give over ſpeaking and come down.</q> But I, feeling the power of the Lord with me, ſpoke on therein, both to the conſtables, and to the people. To the conſtables I declared, <q>That we were a peaceable people, who meet to wait upon God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip 'him in Spirit and in truth; and therefore they needed not to have come with their ſtaves againſt us, who were met in a peaceable manner, deſiring and ſeeking the good and ſalvation of all people.</q> Then turning my ſpeech to the people again, I declared what further was upon me to them. While I was ſpeaking, the conſtables drew towards the door, and the ſoldiers ſtood with their muſkets in the yard. When I had done ſpeaking, I kneeled down, and prayed, deſiring the Lord to open the eyes and hearts of all people, high and low, that their minds might be turned to God by his Holy Spirit: that he might be glorified in all and over all. After prayer the meeting roſe, and friends

One of them came to us ſoon after, but without his ſtaff; which he choſe to do, that he might not be obſerved; for he ſaid, <q>The people told him, he buſied himſelf more than he needed.</q> We deſired to ſee his warrant; and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in found the informer was one Hilton, a north country man, reputed a Papiſt. The conſtable was aſked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would arreſt us by his warrant on that day, it being firſt-day, which in their law was called the Lord's day? He ſaid, 'He thought he could not.' He told us alſo, <q>He had charged the informer to come along with him to the meeting, but he had run away from him.</q> We ſhewed the conſtable, that both he and we were clear; yet to free him from all fear of danger, we were free to go to the alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that granted the warrant. A friend preſent ſaid, He would go with the conſtable to ſpeak with the alderman; which they did, and came preſently back again, the alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being gone from home. We ſeeing the conſtable in a ſtrait, and finding him a tender man, bid him ſet an hour to come to us again, or ſend for us, and we would come to him. So he appointed the fifth hour in the afternoon, but neither came nor ſent for us; and a friend meeting him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the evening, the conſtable told him, <q>He thought it would come to nothing, and therefore did not look after us.</q> So the Lord's power was over all; to him be the glory!</p>
                        <p>The fourth-day following, it was upon me to go to Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church-ſtreet meeting again: for I had heard they would come to break up the meeting that day. The neighbours, it ſeems, were informed ſo, a juſtice had granted a warrant for that purpoſe, and the conſtable told a friend that Hilton the informer had been with him about it. The conſtable would have had the informer to have gone with him to the meeting, but he would not; and would have the conſtable go without him: whether that put the conſtable by I know not; but he did not come.

For I teſtify again to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a debtor to the whole law.

                        <p>THE Spirit of God, which he hath poured upon all, giveth an underſtanding to all that are led by it; and to thoſe who do not quench the motions of it, it giveth knowledge and underſtanding to diſtinguiſh good from evil, light from darkneſs, Chriſt from Antichriſt, the old teſtament or covenant from the new, the old way from the new and living way; the ſheep and lambs from the goats

Thoſe who believe in the light, which is the life in Chriſt, become the children of light, and are the lambs of Jeſus. Theſe lambs follow the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world; they will not follow the hirelings, nor the ſtrangers to be led into ſtrange ways, doctrines, religions, and churches: for the lambs of Chriſt follow Chriſt the Lamb of God, and know his heavenly voice. They know alſo, that thoſe who are without Chriſt are dogs and wolves, adulterers, idolaters, liars, and unbelievers, who would devour the lambs: but theſe are in the hand of the Lord, which is his power, that is over all; ſuch do good in his power unto all; for they have the mind of Chriſt, who would have all come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved. Thoſe that do good to all, do hurt to none: for that ſpirit, that doth hurt to any, is not of God; but that Spirit, which doth good to all, and eſpecially to the houſehold of faith, is of God. Chriſt came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them: it is the devil that is the deſtroyer of men's lives abour religion, who corrupts men and women, makes them deaf and blind to the things of God, and to halt out of, God's way.

I went in the morning; and William Mead being to appear at the ſeſſions for not going to the ſteeple-houſe worſhip, came once or twice from Hicks's-hall to me at the Peel; which ſome ill-minded people obſerving, went and informed the juſtices at the bench, that he was gone to a meeting at the Peel. Whereupon they ſent a meſſenger to ſee if there was a meeting; but this being in the forenoon, there was no meeting, ſo the meſſenger went back and told them. Then others informed the juſtices that there would be a meeting there in the afternoon: whereupon they ſent for the chief conſtable, and aſked him, <q>Why he ſuffered a meeting to be at the Peel, ſo nigh him?</q> He told them, 'He did not know of any meeting there.' They aſked him, 'How he could but know it, and live ſo nigh it?' He ſaid, <q>He was never there in his life, and did not know there was a meeting there.</q> They would have perſuaded him that he muſt needs know of it; but he ſtanding ſteadfaſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it, they ſaid, <q>They ſhould take order to have it looked after in the afternoon.</q> But a multitude of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs coming before them at the ſeſſions, when dinner-time came, they haſtened to their dinner, without giving order; and when they came to the bench again after dinner, the Lord put it out of their minds, ſo the meeting was quiet, beginning and ending in peace; and a bleſſed meeting we had, the Lord's preſence being preciouſly amongſt us. Many friends had a concern upon their minds, when they ſaw me come into the meeting, leſt I ſhould have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but I was freely given up to ſuffer, if it was the Lord's will, before I went, and had nothing in my mind concerning it but the Lord's glory. I do believe that the Lord put it out of their minds, that they ſhould not ſend to
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:037441_0820_100D93D1D44623C8"/>break up our meeting that day. Yet the firſt-day after, three or four juſtices (as I heard) came to the Peel, and put friends out of their meeting-houſe, and kept them out: and inquired for William Mead, but he was not there.</p>
                  <p>That day I was moved to go to Gracechurch-ſtreet meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it was expected that the officers would come to break up the meeting, or keep friends out; and many hundreds of people came to ſee what would be done to us. But the officers came not; ſo we were in peace and quietneſs; and many of the people that came to look on, ſtaid all the time; and a glorious, precious meeting we had, for the Lord's preſence was plentifully amongſt us, and his power came over all; glory to his name for ever, who is over all!</p>
                  <p>I had ſeen the mayor's printed ſpeech for putting the laws in execution againſt diſſenters: and it was much in my mind that we ſhould draw up a paper to ſend to the mayor and aldermen, to clear ourſelves from being ſuch as thoſe laws were made againſt; and to ſet forth our peaceable behaviour both towards the king and the government. Accordingly a paper was drawn up, ſigned, and delivered to the mayor; and copies thereof delivered to the aldermen, and the biſhop of London, who generally took it kindly, and were civil to the friends that delivered it.</p>
                  <p>About this time I was moved to write the few lines fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to friends:</p>

                  <p>Not long after, I received an account by letter, from ſome friends that were priſoners at Denbigh in Wales, that many friends there were under great ſufferings for the teſtimony of a good conſcience. In the tender ſenſe whereof I was moved in the love of God to viſit them with a few lines, as a word of conſolation to them in their ſufferings; and of exhortation, to ſtand faſt in the teſtimony committed to them, after this manner:</p>

                        <p>DEAR ſuffering lambs for the name and command of Jeſus! be valiant for his truth, and faithful, and ye will feel the preſence of Chriſt with you. Look at him who ſuffered for you, hath bought you, and will feed you, who ſaith, 'Be of good comfort, I have overcome the world:' who deſtroys the devil and his works, and bruiſes the ſerpent's head. I ſay, look at Chriſt your ſanctuary, in whom ye have reſt and peace. To you it is given not only to believe, but to ſuffer for his name's ſake. They that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution by the ungodly profeſſors of Chriſt Jeſus who live out of him. Therefore be valiant for God's truth upon the earth, and look above that ſpirit that makes you ſuffer, up to Chriſt, who was before it was, and will be when it is gone. Conſider all the prophets, Chriſt, and the apoſtles, who ſuffered and were perſecuted; but they were never perſecuted as true men, but as deceivers, and yet true. Chriſt is the ſame to-day as yeſterday, a rock and foundation for your age and generation, for you to build upon. I have written concerning you (after I heard your letter) to friends in Cheſhire to viſit you, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that you belong to their quarterly meeting: I deſire ſome friends of your county would go, and lay your ſuffering condition before the monthly or quarterly meeting in Cheſhire.

                  <p>Becauſe the magiſtrates were many of them unwilling to have fines laid upon meeting-houſes, they kept friends out in many places, ſetting officers and guards of ſoldiers at the doors and paſſages; yet ſometimes friends were fined for ſpeaking or praying, though it were abroad. One firſt-day it was upon me to go to Devonſhire-houſe meeting in the afternoon; and becauſe I had heard friends were kept out there that morning (as they were that day at moſt meetings about the city) I went ſomewhat the ſooner, and got into the yard, before the ſoldiers came to guard the paſſages: but the conſtables were got there before me, and ſtood in the door-way with their ſtaves. I aſked them to let me go in: they ſaid, <q>They could not, nor durſt not; for they were commanded the contrary, and were ſorry for it.</q> I told them, I would not preſs upon them; ſo I ſtood by, and they were very civil. I ſtood till I was weary; then one gave me a ſtool to ſit down on: and after awhile the power of the Lord began to ſpring up among friends, and one began to ſpeak. The conſtables ſoon forbad him, and ſaid, he ſhould not ſpeak; and he not ſtopping, they began to be wroth. But I gently laid my hand upon one of the conſtables, and wiſhed him to let him alone. The conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble did ſo, and was quiet; and the man did not ſpeak long. After he had done, I was moved to ſtand up and ſpeak: and in my declaration ſaid, <q>They need not come againſt us with ſwords and ſtaves; for we were a peaceable people, and had nothing in our hearts but good-will to the king and magiſtrates, and to all people upon the earth. We did not <q>meet under pretence of religion to plot and contrive againſt the government, or to raiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections</q> but to worſhip God in Spirit and in truth. We had Chriſt to be our Biſhop, Prieſt, and Shepherd, to feed us and overſee us, and he ruled in our hearts; ſo we could all ſit in ſilence, enjoying our teacher. So to Chriſt, their Biſhop and Shepherd, I recommended them all.</q> I ſat down, and after awhile was moved to pray, and the power of the Lord was over all; and the people, with the conſtables and ſoldiers, put off their hats. When
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:037441_0823_100D93D74E7FD678"/>the meeting was done, and friends began to paſs away, the conſtable put off his hat, and deſired the Lord to bleſs us: for the power of the Lord was over him and the people.</p>
                  <p>After this I went up and down, viſiting friends at their houſes, who had their goods taken from them for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God. We took an account of what had been taken from them: and ſome friends met together about it, and drew up the caſe of the ſufferings of our friends in writing, and gave it to the juſtices at their petty ſeſſions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they made an order, <q>That the officers ſhould not ſell the goods of friends which they had in their hands, but keep them till the next ſeſſions;</q> which gave ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the informers, and put a little ſtop to their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The next firſt-day it was upon me to go to the meeting at the Savoy; and by that time it was gathered, the beadle came in; and after him the wild people, like a ſea, but the Lord's power chained them all. The Spirit of the Lord went through and over all, and they were quiet, and we had a glorious, peaceable meeting; bleſſed be the Lord for his unſpeakable goodneſs! This was in the twelfth month 1682.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt month 1683 I went to Kingſton upon Thames. As I went to the meeting, I met the chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable who had been at the meeting-place, and had ſet watchmen to keep us out; yet he was pretty civil, and the watchmen let friends have a couple of forms out, to ſit upon in the highway: ſo friends met together there, and a very precious meeting we had; for the refreſhing preſence of the Lord was with us, in which we parted in peace.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited and encouraged friends there, I returned to London, and went to the meeting at Bull and Mouth, where the conſtables with their watchmen kept a guard, to keep friends out of the houſe. So we met in the ſtreet; and when any friend ſpoke, the officers and watchmen made a great buſtle to pull him down, and take him into cuſtody. After ſome other friends had ſpoken, it was upon me to ſpeak. I ſaid, <q>Heaven is God's throne, and earth is his footſtool: and will ye not let us ſtand upon God's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool to worſhip and ſerve the living God?</q> While I ſpoke, they were quiet: and after I had cleared myſelf, we broke up our meeting in peace. This was on the ſixth day of the week.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt-day following I was moved to go to the
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:037441_0824_100D93DB33624048"/>meeting at Gracechurch-ſtreet. When I came there, I found a guard ſet at the entrance in Lombard-ſtreet, and another at the gate in Gracechurch-ſtreet, to keep friends out of the meeting-place; ſo we were fain to meet in the ſtreet. After ſome time I got a chair, ſtood up in it, and ſpoke largely to the people, <q>Opening the principles of truth to them, and declaring many weighty truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning magiſtracy, and the Lord's prayer.</q> There was, beſides friends, a great multitude of people, and all was very quiet; for the Lord's power was over all, and in his time we broke up our meeting, and departed in peace.</p>
                  <p>Next day I went to Guildford in Surry; and having vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited friends there, paſſed to Worminghurſt in Suſſex, where I had a very bleſſed meeting among friends, free from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. While I was there, James Claypole of London (who with his wife was there alſo) was ſuddenly taken very ill with ſo violent a fit of the ſtone, that he could neither ſtand nor lie; but through the extremity of pain cried out like a woman in travail. When I heard it, I was much exerciſed in ſpirit for him, and went to him. After I had ſpoken a few words to him, to turn his mind inward, I was moved to lay my hand upon him, and prayed the Lord to rebuke his infirmity. As I laid my hand on him, the Lord's power went through him; and by ſaith in that power he had ſpeedy eaſe, ſo that he quickly fell into a ſleep. When he awaked, the ſtone came from him like dirt; and he was ſo well, that the next day he rode with me five-and-twenty miles in a coach, though he uſed formerly (as he ſaid) to lie ſometimes two weeks, ſometimes a month, with one of thoſe fits of the ſtone. But the Lord was intreated for him, and by his power ſoon gave him eaſe at this time: bleſſed and praiſed be his holy name therefore!</p>
                  <p>After I had had ſome meetings in Suſſex and Surry, and viſited friends thereaway, I returned to London by Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where I had a meeting on the firſt day of the ſecond month, being firſt-day. We were kept out of the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe by a conſtable and watchmen, ſo were fain to meet in the highway. But it being the monthly meeting day, and many people being there, the meeting was pretty large, and very quiet; and the Lord's bleſſed preſence was amongſt us; bleſſed be his name for ever!</p>
                  <p>Being come to London, I went to the meeting at Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-ſtreet near Spitalſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lds, which that day proved very large, and a gloricus, bleſſed meeting it was: for the Lord's power
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:037441_0825_100D93DEE87A9450"/>and truth was over all, and many deep and weighty things were opened to the people to their great ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I tarried in and near London, viſiting meetings, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the ſervice of the goſpel, till the yearly meeting came on, which began the 28th of the third month. It was a time of great ſufferings; and much concerned I was, leſt friends, that came up out of the country on the church's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſhould be taken and impriſoned at London. But the Lord was with us, his power preſerved us; and gave us a ſweet and bleſſed opportunity to wait upon him, and be refreſhed together in him, and to perform thoſe ſervices for his truth and people, for which we met. As it was a time of great perſecution, and we underſtood that in moſt counties friends were under great ſufferings either by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments or ſpoiling of goods, or both, a concern was weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily upon me, leſt any friends, eſpecially traders and dealers in the world, ſhould hazard the loſing of other men's goods or eſtates through their ſufferings. Wherefore, as the thing opened in me, I drew an epiſtle of caution to friends in that caſe, which I communicated to the yearly meeting; and from thence it was ſent among friends throughout the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a copy of which here followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <opener>
                           <salute>Dear friends and brethren in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</salute>

                        <p>WHO is your only ſanctuary in this day of ſtorm andperſecution, ſpoiling of goods and impriſonments! Let every one's eye be unto him, who has all power in heaven and earth given unto him; ſo that none can touch an hair of your head, nor you, nor any thing ye have, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be permitted or ſuffered in this day to try his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether their minds be with the Lord or in outward things. Dear friends, take care that all your offerings be free, and of your own, that has coſt you ſomething; ſo that ye may not offer of that which is another man's, or that which ye are intruſted withal (and not your own) or fatherleſs or widows eſtates; but all ſuch things ſettle and eſtabliſh in their places. You may remember many years ago, in a time of great perſecution, divers friends, who were traders, ſhop-keepers, and others, had the concerns of widows and fatherleſs, and other people's eſtates in their hands. And when a great ſuffering, perſecution, and ſpoiling of goods came upon friends, eſpecial care was taken that all might offer up to the Lord in their ſufferings what was really their own, and not any other people's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:037441_0826_100D93E091EFACC0"/>or goods which they had in their hands; and that they might not offer up another body's, but that which they had bought and paid for, or were able to pay for. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeveral letters came out of the country to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at London, from friends that had goods of the ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers at London upon credit, which they had not paid for; who wrote to their creditors, intreating them to take their goods again. And ſome friends came to London themſelves, and treated with their creditors, letting them underſtand <q>they lay liable to have all they had taken from them;</q> and told them, <q>they would not have any man to ſuffer by them; neither would they by ſuffering offer up any thing but what was really their own, or what they were able to pay for.</q> Upon which ſeveral took their goods again. This wrought a very good favour in the hearts of many people, when they ſaw ſuch a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, juſt, and honeſt principle in friends, that would not make any ſuffer for their teſtimony; but what they did ſuffer for the teſtimony of Jeſus ſhould be really and truly their own, not other people's. In this they owed nothing to any but love. So in this every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtands in the free offering, a free people, whether it be ſpiritual or temporal which is their own; and in that they wrong no man, neither inwardly nor outwardly. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan ſaid unto David, <q>I give thee the threſhing-floor, &amp;c. and the oxen for burnt-offerings: and the threſhing-inſtruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering, I give it all.</q> But king David ſaid unto Ornan, <q>nay, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt-offerings without coſt,</q> 1 Chron. xxi. 22, &amp;c. So it ſhould be his own, and ſo ſhould it be every man's that offers. You may ſee here, that David would not accept of another man's gift for an offering to the Lord; he would not offer up that which coſt him nothing, but what ſhould be really his own, Pſal. cxii. 5. <q>A good man— will guide his affairs with diſcretionf.</q>

Some time after the yearly meeting I went to Kingſton upon Thames to viſit friends; and while I was there, it came upon me to write the following epiſtle to friends in general, as a ſalutation of love, and to ſtir up the pure mind in them.</p>

                        <p>WHO are turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God, who are believers in the light, which is the life in Chriſt, and are become children of the light and of the day, grafted into Chriſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam, the Lord from heaven, and are gathered in the name of Jeſus, in whom ye have ſalvation, and not in any other name under the whole heaven. For Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith, <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</q> Matth. xviii. 20. So you being gathered in the name of Jeſus, he is in the midſt of you, a Saviour, a Mediator, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a Shepherd, a Biſhop, a Leader, a Counſellor, the Captain of your Salvation, who bruiſes the Serpent's head, and deſtroys the devil and his works. Therefore, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt Jeſus, exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. For you are made partakers of Chriſt, if ye hold faſt the beginning of your confidence ſteadfaſt to the end, Hebr. iii. 14. Therefore hear Chriſt's voice; for he is in the midſt of you a teacher. Take heed leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the living God, as there is in too many in this day of provocation and temptation. While it is to-day hear his voice, and let us conſider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works. Let us hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promiſed, and hath called you) not forſaking the aſſembling of ourſelves together, as the manner of ſome is: mark, "as the manner of ſome is," that did and do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the aſſembling of themſelves together; but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more as you ſee the day of light appearing. For if we ſin wilfully after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, Hebr. x. Therefore it is good not to forſake the aſſembling of ourſelves together, but exhort one another
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:037441_0828_100D9493416479D0"/>daily; for Chriſt is in the midſt of his people a teacher and a prophet, who ſaith, <q>Learn of me, the way, the truth, and the life.</q> We being many are one body in Chriſt, gathered in his name, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is given us, whether they be prophecy, let us propheſy according to the proportion of faith; and let thoſe that miniſter wait on their miniſtry; thoſe that be teachers on their teaching; and he that exhorteth on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; he that gives, let him do it with ſimplicity; and he that ruleth, with diligence; and he that ſheweth mercy is to do it with cheerfulneſs. Abhor that which evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one towards another, with brotherly love, in honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one another. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <q>be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good;</q> and, if it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, "live peaceably with all men;" Rom. xii. This is and was the practice of the church of Chriſt. And now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt. I myſelf alſo am perſuaded of you, my brethren, that ye alſo are full of goodneſs, filled with all knowledge, and are able alſo to admoniſh one another, Rom. xv. 13, 14. Here the church of Chriſt, in which he was in the midſt, a teacher and the head of the church, were and are able through him to admoniſh one another. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye are alſo called into one body, to wit, of Chriſt. Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom. teaching and admoniſhing one another, &amp;c. Col. iii. <q>Whatſoever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, giving thanks to God and the Father by him;</q> and above all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs. The apoſtle ſaith to Timothy, <q>Be not thou aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, according to the power of God, who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</q> 2 Tim. i. 8, 9. It concerns every one not to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, who hath called them by his grace; and not to be aſhamed of any of Chriſt's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:037441_0829_100D7FA8D3FA6140"/>and afflicted ones for Chriſt's and his goſpel's ſake, who aboliſhes death, and brings life and immortality to light through his goſpel; you that believe in the light, know it. Peter ſaith in his general epiſtle to the church of Chriſt, "As every man," mark every man, <q>hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the gift, ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God,</q> ſo not of men. <q>If any man miniſter let him do it as of the ability which God gives,</q> ſo not of the ability of men's arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <q>that God in all things may be glorified through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</q> &amp;c. For theſe gifts and grace come from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus into the hearts of the members of his church, whom he is in the midſt of. And if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorify God, &amp;c. Every true Chriſtian hath the preſence of Chriſt, who hath all power in heaven and in earth given him, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port "them with his power, light, and life. Chriſt ſaith "to his believers, <q>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will ſcourge you in the ſynagogues, and you ſhall be brought before governors and kings for my name's ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye ſhall ſpeak; for it ſhall be given you in the ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak: for it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you. And ye ſhall be hated of all men for my name's ſake; but he that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved. The diſciple is not above his maſter, nor the ſervant above his lord; it is enough for the diſciple that he be as his maſter, and the ſervant as his lord; for if they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, what will they do to his ſervant? Fear not them which kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but are not able to kill the ſoul, &amp;c. A ſparrow ſhall not fall to the ground without your heavenly Father, &amp;c. The hairs of your head are all numbered, ye are of more value than many ſparrows. Whoſoever therefore ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in heaven; but whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in heaven. And whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> &amp;c. Matth. x. Again Chriſt ſaith, <q>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words in this adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:037441_0830_100D93DCCDA30B08"/>and ſinful generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with his holy angels,</q> Mark viii. 38. And Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples, <q>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that ſent me; he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous man's reward. Whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a diſciple, verily I ſay unto you he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward,</q> Matth. x. 40, 41, 42. Here ye may ſee how Chriſt encourages his diſciples, and them that receive them. And John ſaith, <q>Among the chief rulers of the Jews many believed in Chriſt; but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the ſynagogue,</q> John xii. 42. Too many ſuch believers are now-a-days, who dare not confeſs Chriſt, leſt they ſhould loſe the favour of men. But Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the faithful diſciples, and told them, they would put them out of their ſynagogues; yea, that the time ſhould come, that whoſoever killed them would think they did God ſervice. "Theſe things," ſaid he, <q>will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor me. But theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come ye may remember that I told you of them,</q> John xvi. 2, 3, 4. Here ye may ſee what Chriſt told his Diſciples ſhould come to paſs to them. And Saul, before he was converted, did compel the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to blaſpheme, and make havock of the Church of Chriſt, Acts viii. and chap. 22 and 26. Did not the beaſt in the Revelations compel both ſmall and great to worſhip him and his image? And did not all worſhip it, but thoſe who had their names written in the Lamb's book of life? Did not Nebuchadnezzar ſet up an image of ſixty cubits high, and ſix cubits broad? And did not he cauſe a herald to cry aloud, <q>It is commanded that all people, and nations, and languages fall down and worſhip the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar hath ſet up; and whoſo falleth not down and worſhippeth ſhall the ſame hour be caſt into the midſt of the ſiery furnace?</q> And were not Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego caſt into the furnace? Dan. iii. But God delivered them. Therefore it is good to be faithful to God and his worſhip in ſpirit
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:037441_0831_100D93E58F2A04E0"/>and truth. The Jews agreed, that if any man ſhould confeſs Chriſt he ſhould be put out of their ſynagogue, John ix. 22. So it was for Chriſt's ſake they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated out of their ſynagogues. But, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <q>Behold I lay in Sion a ſtumbling-ſtone, and a rock of offence; and whoſo believes on him ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</q> So Chriſt is a ſtumbling-ſtone and a rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to all the unbelievers in the light, which is the life in Chriſt, whether they be Jews, Chriſtians, or Gentiles. The Jews did believe Chriſt was to come, from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Chriſtians believe he is come, by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but do not believe in the light as Chriſt commands, and ſo do not become children of the light. Therefore ye that are believers in the light, and are become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light, walk in Chriſt, your way, life, and ſalvation.</p>

                        <p>MY love is to you all in the holy ſeed that reigns over all. And my deſire is that every one, both male and female, may feel the ſeed Chriſt in you, which is heir of the promiſe of life eternal, that ye may all grow up in Chriſt Jeſus, your head, and be built upon him the rock and foundation that God hath laid, which ſtands ſure over all rocks and foundations in the world. That ye may eat and drink of this ſpiritual rock, the ſpiritual water and food; ſo that ye may truly and inwardly ſay, your rock and foundation, your bread and water of life is from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and your bread and water is ſure; alſo that ye know his voice that feeds, and leads you into the paſtures of life, which are always freſh and green. In this your affections are ſet on things above, ſeeking that which comes down from above more than that which is from below, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, making interceſſion for you; who is your mediator, making peace betwixt God and you; and your heavenly biſhop to overſee you, that ye keep in his light, life, and power, and do not go aſtray from his heavenly fold and paſture, that he your
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:037441_0832_100D93E743C71638"/>ſhepherd may feed you therein. He is your prophet, to open to you the fulfilling of the promiſes and prophecies, himſelf being the ſubſtance; that ye may live in him, and he in you, yea, and reign in your hearts; there to exerciſe his offices, his prophetical, prieſtly, and kingly office, who is heavenly and ſpiritual. That ye may know the three that bear witneſs in the earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, which is the Life of Chriſt, which cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all ſin; the Water that waſhes and refreſhes you, the Spirit that baptizes, circumciſes, and leads you into all truth; that ye may come all to drink into one Spirit, and keep the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of the heavenly peace. So being led by the Spirit of God, ye are his ſons and daughters, and by his Spirit will come to know the three that bear witneſs in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt. Theſe are the three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that are in heaven, that bear record of all things; for he is God in the heaven, and God in the earth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire that ye may all feel his love ſhed in your hearts, and in it live (above the love of the world, which is enmity) and in that you will keep in the excellent way, For love edifies the body of Chriſt, builds his church up, and keeps out of the enmity; for it is above it, and brings and keeps all in true humanity, and in the true divinity; and to be courteous, kind, and tender one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And ſhew forth the nature of Chriſt, and true chriſtianity, in all your lives and converſations, that the bleſſings of the Lord may reſt upon you, as ye all live in the ſeed of the goſpel, the ſeed of the kingdom of God, in which all nations are bleſſed. In that ye will all have a care of God's glory. There is the hill or mountain where the light ſhines to the anſwering the witneſs of God in all, and the ſalt that is a good favour to the witneſs of God in the hearts of all; which favour and ſalt being kept in, it doth not come under the feet of men. So my love to you all in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath given to be a ſanctuary for all his people, who is from above, and not of this world, in whom ye have life, peace, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In him God Almighty keep and preſerve you all to his glory, Amen.

                  <p>Having viſited friends at and about Kingſton I returned to London; for it being a ſuffering time with friends there, I had not freedom to be long from the city. I went to the meeting at the Peel; which but a little before the juſtices and conſtables had broken up, and had carried themſelves very roughly; but that day the meeting was in the houſe, and quiet, and a glorious meeting it was, bleſſed be the Lord.</p>
                  <p>On firſt-day following I went to the meeting at Grace-church-ſtreet, where I found three conſtables in the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, who kept friends out; ſo we met in the court. After I had been ſome time in the meeting, I ſtood up, and ſpoke to the people, and continued ſpeaking a pretty while. Then one of the conſtables came, took hold of my hand, and ſaid, 'I muſt come down.' I deſired him to be patient, and went on ſpeaking to the people; but after a little time he plucked me down, and had me into the meeting-houſe. I aſked them, if they were not weary of this work? One of them ſaid, 'Indeed they were.' They let me go into the widow Foſter's houſe, which joined to the meeting-houſe, where I ſtaid, being hot. When the meeting was ended, for one prayed after I was taken away, the conſtables aſked ſome friends, <q>Which of them would paſs their words that I ſhould appear, if they ſhould be queſtioned about me?</q> But the friends telling them, <q>They need not require that, for I was a man well known in the city to be one that would neither fly nor ſhrink;</q> they came not to me, but went their way, and I heard no further of it. The ſame week I was at the meeting at the Savoy, which uſed to be kept out and diſturbed; but that day it was within doors and peaceable, and a precious meeting it was. The firſt-day after it was upon me to go to the meeting at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, where uſed to be great diſturbances: but there alſo the meeting was within doors that day, and was very large. The Lord's power was over all, and kept all quiet and ſtill; for though many looſe ſpirits were there, yet they were
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:037441_0834_100D93ECB7E51118"/>bound down by the power and Spirit of the Lord, that they could not get up to make diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>About this time I was moved to write the following epiſtle:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Friends and brethren,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>WHO have received the peaceable truth, let the fruits of its peaceableneſs, and of your quiet ſpirit appear in all your meetings and in all your words and actions; for he that inhabits eternity dwells with an humble heart, and he gives grace to the humble, and reſiſteth the proud. Heaven is his throne, and the earth ye walk upon is his footſtool: happy are ye that ſee and know him that is inviſible. And now, friends, let all things be done in your meetings and otherwiſe, in love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrife, or vain-glory. For love fulfils the law, love overcomes and edifies the body of Chriſt. There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelf, nor envy in love, neither is it puffed up; but abides and bears all things. See that this love of God have the ſway in you all, and over you all. Chriſt ſaith, <q>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted. Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth. Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled. Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy. Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Bleſſed are the peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the children of God. Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye when men ſhall revile you and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my ſake; rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for ſo perſecuted they the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were before you.</q> Now friends, here is a great deal in theſe words. All muſt be in theſe ſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, if they have theſe bleſſings. The children of God are peace-makers, and ſtrive to make peace in the truth; and to live in peace with all men, if it be poſſible. So live in the peace and the good-will to all men; which good-will is both for their ſanctification and ſalvation. And friends, conſider, the wiſdom of God, which is from above, is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:037441_0835_100D93EE50A24148"/>Dear friends, let this pure, peaceable, gentle, wiſdom that is from above, that is eaſy to be intreated, and is full of mercy and good fruits, be exerciſed and practiſed in all the true churches of Chriſt; that wiſdom may be juſtified of her children. For the works of the fleſh, or fleſhly ſpirit, are hatred, variance, wrath, ſtrife, envyings, drunkenneſs, revellings, adultery, fornication, laſciviouſneſs, uncleanneſs, &amp;c. and they which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruits of the Spirit of God are love, joy, peace, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance, &amp;c. So, dear friends and brethren, ſtrive to exceed one another and all people upon the earth in humility, in meekneſs, in gentleneſs, in temperance, in love, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in pureneſs, and in mercy; then ye will ſhew forth the fruits of the Spirit of God, and of his heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is from above. In this, wiſdom will be juſtified of her children; and ye will be the ſalt of the earth, and a light to the world ſet on an hill, that cannot be hid: and your moderation will appear to all men. Be ye juſt and righteous, faithful and true in all your words, dealings, and converſations; that ye may anſwer the truth in all people: for Chriſt ſaith, his father is glorified by ſuch as bring forth fruits, when men ſee their good works; for he that doth righteouſneſs, is accepted with God. And he that dwells in love, dwells in God; for love is his habitation. Let that be the habitation of every one that hath received the truth: for if it be not, ſuch do not dwell in God, let them profeſs what they will. Therefore my deſire is, that all you, who have received Chriſt the ſeed, which bruiſes the ſerpent's head, may walk in him your ſanctuary, life, and ſalvation, your reſt and peace, Amen.</p>

                  <p>I continued yet at London, labouring in the work and ſervice of the Lord both in and out of meetings; ſometimes viſiting friends in priſon for the teſtimony of Jeſus, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them in their ſufferings, and exhorting them to ſtand faithful and ſteadfaſt in the teſtimony which the Lord had committed to them to bear: ſometimes alſo viſiting thoſe that were ſick and weak in body, or troubled in mind, helping to bear their ſpirits up from ſinking under their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:037441_0836_100D93F02DCAABE8"/>Sometimes our meetings were quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſometimes they were diſturbed and broken up by the officers. One firſt-day it was upon me to go to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Savoy, which was large: for many profeſſors and ſober people were there. The Lord opened many precious weighty things in me to the people, which I declared amongſt them, and <q>directed them to the ſpirit of God in themſelves, which the Lord had given them a meaſure of; that all by the Spirit might underſtand the Scriptures, which were given forth from the Spirit of God; and that by the Spirit of God they might know God, and Chriſt whom God hath ſent, whom to know is eternal life; and that by the Spirit they might all come into Chriſt, and know him to be their ſanctuary, who deſtroys the devil, the deſtroyer, and his works, and bruiſes the ſerpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s head. For Chriſt was a ſanctuary to them to whom he was a Saviour, whom he ſaved from the deſtroyer. And Chriſt did baptize them with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, and did thoroughly purge his floor, and burn up their chaff with unquenchable fire; that is, ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which is got into man and woman by their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: but Chriſt gathereth his wheat into his garner. So all that are baptized with Chriſt's baptiſm, their wheat is in God's garner; and no ſpoiler can get into God's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to meddle with the wheat there, though they may be permitted to meddle with the outward goods, &amp;c. As I was ſpeaking in the power of the Lord, and the people were greatly affected therewith, on a ſudden the conſtables, with the rude people, came in like a ſea. One of the conſtables ſaid, Come down,</q> and laid hands on me. I aſked him, 'Art thou a Chriſtian? We are chriſtians.' He had hold on my hand, and was very fierce to pluck me down; but I ſtood ſtill, and ſpoke a few words to the people; deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord, that the bleſſings of God might reſt upon them all. The conſtable ſtill called upon me to come down, and at length plucked me down, and bid another man with a ſtaff, 'Take and carry me to priſon.' That man had me to another officer's houſe, who was more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and after awhile they brought in four friends more, whom they had taken. I was very weary, and in a great ſweat; and ſeveral friends hearing where I was, came to me in the conſtable's houſe: but I bid them all go their ways, leſt the conſtables and informers ſhould ſtop them. After awhile the conſtables had us almoſt a mile to a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:037441_0837_100D93F24EEDFDB0"/>who was a fierce, paſſionate man: who, after he had aſked me my name, and his clerk had taken it in writing, upon the conſtable's informing him, <q>That I preached inthe meeting,</q> ſaid in an angry manner, <q>Do not you know that it is contrary to the king's laws to preach in ſuch conventicles, contrary to the liturgy of the church of England?</q> There was preſent one Shad (a wicked inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who was ſaid to have broken gaol at Coventry, and to have been burnt in the hand at London) who hearing the juſtice ſpeak ſo to me, ſtepped up to him, and told him, <q>That he had convicted them on the act of the 22d of king Charles the Second.</q> 'What! you convict them?' ſaid the juſtice. 'Yes,' ſaid Shad, <q>I have convicted them, and you muſt convict them too upon that act.</q> With that the juſtice was angry with him, and ſaid, <q>You teach me! What are you? I'll convict them of a riot.</q> The informer hearing that, and ſeeing the juſtice angry, went away in a fret; ſo he was diſappointed of his purpoſe. I thought he would have ſworn ſomebody againſt me: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſaid, <q>Let no man ſwear againſt me, for it is my principle, Not to ſwear;</q> and therefore I would not 'have any man ſwear againſt me.' The juſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſked me, 'If I did not preach in the meeting?' I told him. <q>I did confeſs what God and Chriſt had done for my ſoul; and did praiſe God. I thought I might have done that in the ſtreets, and in all places, viz. praiſe God, and confeſs Chriſt Jeſus; which I was not aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. Neither was this contrary to the liturgy of the church of England.</q> The juſtice ſaid, <q>The laws were againſt ſuch meetings as were contrary to the liturgy of the church of England.</q> I ſaid. <q>I knew no ſuch laws againſt our meetings; but if he did mean that act that was made againſt ſuch as did meet to plot, contrive, and raiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections againſt the king, we were no ſuch people, but did abhor all ſuch actions; and did bear true love and good-will to the king, and to all men upon the earth.</q> The juſtice then aſked me, 'If I had been in orders?' I told him. No. Then he took his law-books, and ſearched for laws againſt us, bidding his clerk take the names of the reſt the mean time. But when he could find no other law againſt us, the clerk ſwore the conſtable againſt us. Some of the friends bid the conſtable <q>take heed what he ſwore, leſt he were perjured; for he, took them in the entry, and not in the meeting.</q> Yet the conſtable, being an ill man,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:037441_0838_100D93F723CDCD50"/>ſwore, 'That they were in the meeting.' However, the juſtice ſaid, <q>Seeing there was but one witneſs, he would diſcharge the reſt; but he would ſend me to Newgate, and I might preach there.</q> I aſked him, <q>If it ſtood with his conſcience to ſend me to Newgate for praiſing God, and for confeſſing Chriſt Jeſus?</q> He cried, <q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience! conſcience!</q> but I felt my words touched his <q>conſcience. He bid the conſtable take me away, and he would make a mitrimus to ſend me to priſon when he had dined.</q> I told him, <q>I deſired his peace, and the good of his family; and that they might be kept in the fear of the Lord.</q> So I paſſed away, and as I went the conſtable took ſome friends word that I ſhould come to his houſe the next morning by the eighth hour. Accordingly I did go with thoſe friends, and the conſtable told us he went to the juſtice for the mittimus after he had dined; and the juſtice bid him, 'Come again after the evening ſervice;' which he did; and then the juſtice told him, <q>He might let me go.</q> So, ſaid the conſtable, you are diſcharged. I blamed him for turning informer, and ſwearing againſt us. He ſaid, 'He would do ſo no more.' Next day, the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice meeting with Gilbert Laty, aſked him. <q>If he would pay twenty pounds for George Fox's fine?</q> He ſaid, 'No.' 'Then.' ſaid the juſtice, <q>I am diſappointed; for, being but a lodger, I cannot come by his fine; and he having been brought before me, and being of ability him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I cannot lay his fine on any other.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I was diſcharged, I went into the city. The ſame week the ſeſſions coming on, where many friends were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſome as priſoners, and ſome on trials of appeals upon the conventicle act, I went to a friend's houſe not far off, that I might be in readineſs to aſſiſt thoſe friends with counſel, or otherwiſe, as occaſion ſhould offer; and I found ſervice in it. But as my ſpirit was concerned on behalf of friends, with reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </opener>
                        <p>MANY foundations have been laid ſince the apoſtles days, by ſuch as have gone from Chriſt the true and ſure foundation: and their foundations have proved rotten, and come to nought, and themſelves have come to loſs. Many ſince the day of Chriſt, and the truth hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this nation, have had ſome openings and ſights, and come among us for a time, and then gone from us again; who have been the comers and goers, like thoſe in the apoſtles days. Such had an outward profeſſion of the truth, and have gone from the true feundation Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſo from the heavenly ſociety and unity of the faints in light. Then they ſet up foundations of their own, and having a form of godlineſs, but out of the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, out of the order thereof, ſuch have turned to janglings and vain diſputings. This ſpirit you have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, who have kept your habitations in Chriſt Jeſus, the Firſt and the Laſt. And you are not inſenſible of the ſcurrilous and filthy books of lies and defamations which have been ſpread abroad in this nation and beyond ſea againſt the faithful. It is very well that the Lord hath ſuffered them to publiſh their own ſhame in print, that truth's enemies may be diſcovered; their fruits and ſpirits have appeared, and manifeſted themſelves both in print and otherwiſe. And I believe the Lord will yet ſuffer this ſpirit ſo to publiſh its ſruits, its ſhame and nakedneſs, to profeſſor and profane, and to all ſober, moderate and innocent people, that its ſhame and nakedneſs may more fully appear. Though for a time it hath been hid and covered with the ſig-leaves of an outward profeſſion, and ſometimes with fawning and ſlattering words (as at other times it hath diſcovered itſelf by rough, lying, and defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words) vet the Lord God will blaſt all ſuch vain talkers, that do not walk in the order of life, truth, and the goſpel. Therefore, ye that are ſaithful, ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemment. It is upon his ſhoulders: he bears it up: of
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:037441_0840_100D93FB86AD7CE8"/>the increaſe of it and of its peace there is no end. For all quarrellers againſt his order and government are not in him, nor in his heavenly, ſpiritual government and peace. Therefore, ye faithful ones, who have ſtood the trial through many perſecutions, impriſonments, ſpoilings of goods you know there is a crown of glory laid up for you. You that ſuffer with Chriſt, ſhall reign with him in his kingdom of glory; ye that die with Chriſt, ſhall live with him in eternal life, in the world that bath no end, who have gone through the ſufferings without, and within by falſe brethren, by comers and goers, that have cauſed the way of truth to be evil ſpoken of, and have been perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the faithful with their tongues; and by printing and publiſhing their lying, defaming books againſt the faithful.

But God hath brought them to light, and their fruits and ravenous ſpirit are ſeen, ſavoured, and known; who are become Judas's and ſons of perdition, to betray Chriſt now within (where he is made manifeſt) to the prieſts, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and profane, as Judas betrayed Chriſt without to the prieſts and Pilate. Though ſome of the magiſtrates and ſober people ſee their envy and folly, and that they have more malice than matter againſt the faithful. The Lord will conſume this Judas, or ſon of perdition! The Lord will conſume him with the Spirit of his mouth, and deſtroy him with the brightneſs of his coming! So let all the faithful look unto the Lord. And let that wicked ſon of perdition know, though he may be got as high as Judas (who was partaker of the miniſtry with the apoſtles) <q>the Lord will conſume him with the Spirit of his mouth, and deſtroy him with the brightneſs of his coming.</q> That is his portion. The brightneſs of the Lord will deſtroy him, and the Spirit of his mouth will conſume him. And when he is deſtroyed and conſumed, there will not be a ſon of perdition to betray Chriſt in his people, and his people that live and walk in Chriſt, who hath all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (mark, in heaven) and in earth given to him; and with his holy and glorious power he limits and orders; ſo that nothing ſhall be done againſt his people, but what is ſuffered for their trial and their good, neither by apoſtates, perſecutors with the tongue, Judas's, ſons of perdition to

Every one's faith is to ſtand in him and his power. Such rejoice in his power, and ſee the increaſe of his righteous, holy, heavenly, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, peaceable government, in which the glorious, holy order of life is lived and walked in by all his ſons and daughters; and in his Spirit is the holy unity and bond of peace. Though ye be abſent in body one from another, yet all joying and rejoicing, being preſent in his Spirit, and beholding in the ſame Spirit your ſpiritual order, unity, fellowſhip, and the ſteadfaſtneſs of your faith in Chriſt Jeſus, who is ſteadfaſt for ever, the Firſt and the Laſt, whoſe preſence is among his people, and who is their head. Here is heavenly Sion known, and heavenly Jeruſalem, and the innumerable company of angels (which are ſpirits) and the ſpirits of the juſt men made perfect.

                           <p>I tarried a little in London, viſiting friends and meetings, and labouring in the work of the Lord. And being on a firſt-day at the Bull and Mouth, where the meeting had long been kept without, it was that day in the houſe, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and large: the people were ſo affected with the truth, and refreſhed with the powerful preſence of the Lord, that when the meeting ended, they were loth to go away.</p>
                           <p>After ſome time, having ſeveral things upon me to write, I went to Kingſton, that I might be free from interruptions. When I came there, I underſtood the officers had been very rude at the meeting, abuſing friends, and had driven them out of the meeting-place, and very abuſive they continued to be for ſome time. Whilſt I was there I wrote a little book (printed ſoon after) the title whereof was: <q>The ſaints heavenly and ſpiritual worſhip, unity, and communion, &amp;c. wherein is ſet forth what the true goſpel-worſhip is, and in what the true unity and communion of the ſaints ſtands;
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:037441_0842_100D940008A564E8"/>with a diſcovery of thoſe that were gone from this holy unity and communion, and were turned againſt the ſaints that abode therein.</q>

                  <p>When I had finiſhed the ſervices for which I went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had viſited the friends, I returned to London, and viſited moſt of the meetings in and about the city. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I went to viſit a friend in Eſſex; and returning by Dalſton, I made ſome ſtay at the widow Stot's, where I wrote an epiſtle to friends, which may be read amongſt my other printed books.</p>
                  <p>I came from Dalſton to London, and the next day was ſent for in haſte to my ſon Rouſe's at Kingſton; whoſe daughter Margaret lay very ſick, and had a deſire to ſee me. I tarried at Kingſton about a week, and then returned to London; where I continued moſt part of the winter and the ſpring following, until the general meeting in 1684 (ſave that I went once as far as Enfield, to viſit friends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.) In this time I ceaſed not to labour in the work of the Lord, being frequent at meetings, and viſiting friends that were priſoners. or that were ſick, and in writing books for the ſpreading of truth, and opening the underſtandings of people to receive it.</p>
                  <p>The yearly meeting was in the third month. A bleſſed, weighty meeting it was, wherein friends were ſweetly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed together; for the Lord was with us, and opened his heavenly treaſures amongſt us. And though it was a time of great difficulty and danger, by reaſon of informers and perſecuting magiſtrates, yet the Lord was a defence and place of ſafety to his people.</p>
                  <p>Now I had drawings in Spirit to go into Holland, to viſit the ſeed of God in thoſe provinces. And as ſoon as the yearly meeting was over, I prepared for my journey. There went with me from London Alexander Parker. George Watts, and Nathaniel Braſſey, who alſo had draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings into that country. We took coach the 31ſt of the third month 1684, and got to Colcheſter that night. Next day, being firſt-day, we went to the meeting there; and though there was no notice given of my coming, our being there was preſently ſpread over the town, and in ſeveral places in the country, at ſeven and ten miles diſtance; ſo that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of friends came in double-horſed, which made the meeting very large. I had a concern and travail in my mind, leſt this great gathering ſhould have ſtirred up the town, and been more than the magiſtrates could well bear;
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:037441_0843_100D940245577650"/>but it was very quiet and peaceable, and a glorious meeting we had, to the ſettling and ſtabliſhing of friends both in the town and country: for the Lord's power was over all; bleſſed be his name for ever! Truly, the Lord's power and preſence was beyond words; for I was but weak to go into a meeting, and my face (by reaſon of a cold) was ſore: but God manifeſted his ſtrength in us and with us, and all was well; the Lord have the glory for evermore for his ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power. After the meeting came, I think, above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred friends of the town and country to ſee me at John Furley's. Very glad we were to ſee one another, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſhed we were together, being filled with the love and riches of the Lord; bleſſed be his name for ever!</p>
                  <p>We tarried at Colcheſter two days more; which we ſpent in viſiting friends, both at their meetings for buſineſs, and at their houſes. Early in the morning on fourth-day we took coach for Harwich, where we met William Bingley and Samuel Waldenfield, who went over with us. About the eighth hour at night we went on board the paquet-boat, Richard Gray, maſter; but by reaſon of contrary winds it was the firſt hour in the morning before we ſailed. We had a very good paſſage; and about the fifth hour in the afternoon next day we landed at the Brill in Holland, where we ſtaid that night. Early next morning we went to Rotterdam, where we abode ſome days. The next day after we came to Rotterdam, one Wilbert Frouzen, a burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and kinſman of Aarent Sunneman's, hearing I was there, invited me to his country-houſe, having a deſire to ſpeak with me about ſome buſineſs relating to Aarent Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neman's daughters. I took George Watts with me, and a brother of Aarent Sunneman's had us thither. The burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter received us very kindly, was glad to ſee me, and entering into diſcourſe about his kinſman's daughters, I found he was apprehenſive that, their father being dead, and having left them conſiderable portions, they might be ſtolen, and married to their diſadvantage. Wherefore I told him, <q>It was our principle and practice, that none ſhould marry amongſt us, unleſs they had a certificate of the conſent of their relations or guardians; for it was our Chriſtian care to watch over and look after all young people that came among us, eſpecially thoſe whoſe relations were dead. And as for his kinſiman's daughters, we ſhould take care that nothing ſhould be offered to them but what ſhould be agreeable to truth and righteouſneſs, and that they
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:037441_0844_100D940490C5CED8"/>might be preſerved in the fear of God, according to their father's mind.</q> This ſeemed to give him great ſatisfaction. While I was with him, there came many great people to me; and <q>I exhorted them all to keep in the feat of God, and to mind his good Spirit in them, to keep their minds to the Lord.</q> After I had ſtaid two or three hours, and diſcourſed with them of ſeveral things, I took my leave, and he very kindly ſent me to Rotterdam in his chariot.</p>
                  <p>Next day, being firſt-day, we were at the meeting at Rotterdam, which was pretty large, and declared to the people by an interpreter. The day following alderman Gaul came to ſpeak with me, with whom we had much diſcourſe about religious matters; wherewith he ſeemed to be well ſatisfied, and was very tender. Several other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of account intended to have come to ſpeak with me, but being hindered by extraordinary buſineſs (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) they came not.</p>
                  <p>We went next day from Rotterdam to Amſterdam, where we had a large and very precious meeting. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I was at another meeting with friends there, about buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>There is a yearly meeting at Amſterdam for the friends of Holland and Germany, &amp;c. which begun now the eighth of the fourth month, and ended the twelfth. Here we had a fine opportunity of ſeeing friends from divers parts, and of being refreſhed together in the love of God. After this meeting, before thoſe that came out of the ſeveral provinces were gone, we had a meeting with ſome particular friends, about the places and countries into which we, who came out of England in the work of the miniſtry, were to travel; and to inquire who among them were ſuitable perſons to go along with us as interpreters. This concluded on, William Bingley and Samuel Waldenfield took ſhipping for Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with Jacob Claus their interpreter.</p>
                  <p>Alexander Parker and George Watts remained with me. We tarried a few days longer at Amſterdam, where I had further ſervice. Before I left Amſterdam. I went to viſit Galenus Abrahams, a teacher of chief note among the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonites, or Baptiſts. I had been with him when I was in Holland about ſeven years before; and William Penn and George Keith had diſputes with him. He was then very high and very ſhy, ſo that he would not let me touch him, nor look upon him (by his good-will) but bid me "Keep my eyes off him; for," he ſaid, "they pierced him." But
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:037441_0845_100D9406C8A0B1C8"/>now he was very loving and tender, and confeſſed in ſome meaſure to truth: his wife alſo and daughter were tender and kind, and we parted from them very lovingly. Feeling our ſpirits drawn toward Frieſland, Alexander Parker, George Watts, and I, having John Claus of Amſterdam with us for our interpreter, took ſhipping at Amſterdam for Frieſland, and having ſailed nine or ten leagues, we left the ſhip and travelled through Frieſland, viſiting friends and tender people in the towns and villages, having commonly one, ſometimes two meetings in a day. After we had been at Leuwarden, we paſſed by Franeker to Harlingen in Weſt-Frieſland, which was the furtheſt place we went to that way. And having been out ſix days from Amſterdam, and had very good ſervice in that time, in viſiting friends and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing truth amongſt the people, we took ſhip at Harlingen for Amſterdam the 26th of the fourth month, and arrived there that night. The firſt-day following we were at the meeting at Amſterdam, which was very large and precious. Many of the people were there, and ſome of their teachers, ſome great perſons alſo. They ſeemed very attentive, and a good opportunity we all had, one after another, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the word of the Lord and open the way of truth amongſt them, John Claus interpreting for us. I tarried the next day at Amſterdam; but George Watts went to a burial at Harlem, where many hundreds of people were; amongſt whom he had a good opportunity and came back at night to us.</p>
                  <p>The day following we went by boat to Oſanoverton in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terland, and from thence in another ſmall boat about a league over a ſmall river, where we paſſed over and by an hundred bridges, and ſo to Lanſmeer to a friend's, whoſe name was Timon Peters; where we had a very good meeting. We returned to Amſterdam at night, and were at the meeting there next day. Many were at this meeting beſides friends, among the reſt the great Baptiſt-teacher Galenus, who was very attentive to the teſtimony of the truth, and when the meeting was done came and got me by the hand very lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>We went next day by boat to Alkmaer, about eight leagues from Amſterdam, paſſing through Sardam, the great town of ſhip-carpenters, and ſeveral other towns in the way. At Alkmaer, which is a pretty city, we ſtaid and had a meeting next day at William Williams's. There were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides friends, many very ſober people at this meeting, who
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:037441_0846_100D940A17127A98"/>were very attentive to the teſtimonies of truth that were borne by Alexander Parker, George Watts, and myſelf, John Claus being our interpreter. This was on a ſixth-day, and on the ſeventh we returned to Amſterdam, being willing to be at the meeting on firſt-day, becauſe it was like to be the laſt meeting we ſhould have there. Accordingly we were at it, and a very large and open meeting it was. Many great perſons were preſent, ſome earls, we were told, with their attendants, out of Germany, who were very grave and ſober; and the everlaſting goſpel was preached unto them.</p>
                  <p>After this meeting we took leave of the friends of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, and next morning departed to Harlem, where we had a meeting at a friend's, whoſe name is Abraham Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg. Great numbers of people were at this meeting, and of great ſervice it was. After the meeting, a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker of Amſterdam, who with his wife was at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſired to ſpeak with me concerning religion. I had pretty much diſcourſe with him, and both he and ſhe were very low and tender, received with gladneſs what I ſpoke to them, and ſeemed to depart well ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>We went next day to Rotterdam, where we tarried two meetings, and the ſixteenth of the fifth month went to the Brill, to take ſhip for England.</p>
                  <p>About four in the afternoon, we went on board the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-boat, William Sherman, maſter, and ſet ſail from the Brill. When we had gone over the Maſe about a league, we caſt anchor at a place called the Pit, becauſe it is near the ſands, where we tarried till about four next morning; when having a pretty fair wind, and the tide with us, we weighed anchor, and by four next day were within five leagues of Harwich, over againſt Alborough caſtle; but the wind falling ſhort, and the tide being weak, it was the firſt hour in the afternoon before we came ſo near Harwich that boats could come to receive the paſſengers and goods. There were on board about forty paſſengers in all, of which ſome were Engliſh, ſome Scots, ſome Dutch, ſome French, ſome Spaniſh, ſome Flemiſh, and ſome Jews.</p>
                  <p>I ſpent a day with friends at Harwich, while Alexander Parker and George Watts went to viſit friends at Ipſwich, and returned at night. Next morning early we all took coach for Colcheſter, and were at the meeting there, which was large and peaceable; after the meeting we travelled to Witham and lodged there that night. Next day, William
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:037441_0847_100D940BA75AA948"/>Mead meeting us on the way at Hareſtreet, I went with him to his houſe, and the other friends went for London.</p>
                  <p>Here, being weak with travel and continual exerciſe, I ſpent ſome time to reſt myſelf and recover my health; viſiting in the meantime friends in that part of the country as I was able to get abroad. When I was a little recovered I went to Enfield, viſiting friends there and thereabouts, ſo to Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton to ſee the widow Stot, and from thence to London; ſome friends being come over from New-Jerſey in America about buſineſs which I was deſired to be preſent at.</p>
                  <p>It was the latter end of the ſummer when I came to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where I ſtaid the winter following; ſave once or twice, my wife being in town with me, I went with her to her ſon Rouſe's at Kingſton. And though my body was very weak, yet I was in continual ſervice either in publick meetings, when I was able to bear them, or in particular buſineſſes among friends, and viſiting thoſe that were ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for truth, either by impriſonment or loſs of goods. Many things alſo in this time I wrote, ſome for the preſs and ſome for particular ſervice; as letters to the king of Denmark, and one to the duke of Holſtein, on behalf of friends that were ſufferers in his dominions; whereof the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is a copy:</p>

                        <p>Whom I do intreat in the love of God to read over this which is ſent in love to him.</p>
                        <p>I UNDERSTAND that formerly, by ſome evil-minded perſons, it was reported to thee, when Elizabeth Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dricks came to Frederickſtadt to viſit the people called Quakers, <q>that it was a ſcandal to the chriſtian religion that a woman ſhould be ſuffered to preach in a publick aſſembly religiouſly gathered together,</q> &amp;c. Upon which thou gaveſt forth an order to the rulers of Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickſtadt, <q>to make the ſaid people leave that place forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or to ſend them away.</q> But the ſaid Rulers being Arminians, and they or their fathers being come to live there as a people perſecuted in Holland, not much above threeſcore years ago, made anſwer to the duke, <q>they were not willing to perſecute others for conſcience-ſake, who had looked upon perſecution on that account in their own caſe as antichriſtian,</q> &amp;c. But after that, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:037441_0848_100D940E283FAA48"/>of God, in ſcorn called Quakers, did write to thee, from Frederickſtadt; and ſince that time they have had their liberty, and their meetings peaceable, to ſerve and worſhip God almoſt theſe twenty years at Frederickſtadt and thereabouts, freely without moleſtation; which liberty they have acknowledged as a great favour and kindneſs from thee.</p>
                        <p>And now, O duke, thou profeſſing chriſtianity from the great and mighty name of Chriſt Jeſus who is King of kings and Lord of lords, and the holy ſcriptures of truth of the Old and New Teſtament, do not you uſe many women's words in your ſervice and worſhip out of the Old and New Teſtament? The apoſtle ſaith, <q>Let your women keep ſilence in the churches;</q> and that he <q>did not permit a woman to ſpeak, but to be under obedience; and if ſhe will learn any thing, to aſk her huſband at home; for it is a ſhame for a woman to ſpeak in the church.</q> And 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12. <q>Women are to learn in ſilence, and not ſuffered to teach, nor to uſurp authority over the man, but to be in ſilence,</q> 1 Cor. xiv. 34. Here the duke may ſee what ſort of women were to be in ſilence and ſubjection, whom the law commands to be ſilent, and not to unſurp authority over the man, nor to ſpeak in the church; theſe were unruly women. In the ſame chapter he commands <q>not to plait nor broider their hair, nor to wear gold, pearls, or coſtly array.</q> Theſe things were forbidden by the apoſtle, and women that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But do not ſuch women as theſe that wear gold and ſilver, pearls and gaudy appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or coſtly array, and plait and broider their hair, ſpeak in your church, when your prieſt ſets them to ſing pſalms? Don't they ſpeak when they ſing pſalms? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, O duke! Yet you ſay, <q>Your women muſt keep ſilence in the church, and muſt not ſpeak in the church;</q> but when they ſing pſalms in your churches are they ſilent? Though the apoſtle forbids ſuch women as before-mentioned to ſpeak in the church, yet in another place he encourages the good or holy women to be teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of good things, Tit. ii. 3.4. The apoſtle alſo ſaid, <q>I intreat thee, true yoke-follow, help thoſe women which laboured with me in the goſpel, and with other my follow-labourers, whoſe names are written in the book of life.</q>
                           <pb n="333" facs="unknown:037441_0849_100D9410EDAF2120"/>Here he owns theſe holy women, and encourages them which laboured with him in the goſpel, and did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them, Phil. iv. 2, 3. He likewiſe commends Phoebe unto the church of the Romans, calls her a <q>ſervant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church of Cenchrea,</q> ſends his epiſtle by her to the Romans from Corinth, and deſires the church at Rome to "receive her in the Lord, as becometh ſaints;" and to aſſiſt her, <q>in whatſoever buſineſs ſhe had need of; for ſhe had been a ſuccourer of many, and of him alſo:</q> And he ſaid, <q>Greet Priſcilla and Aquila, my helpers in Chriſt Jeſus, who have for my life laid down their necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but alſo all the churches of the Gentiles.</q> Now here the duke may ſee, theſe were good holy women, whom the apoſtle did not forbid ſpeaking. Rom. xvi. 1, 2, 3, 4. but commended them. And Priſcilla and Aquila <q>inſtructed and expounded unto Apollos the way of God more perfectly,</q> Acts xviii. 26. So here Priſcilla was an inſtructor as well as Aquila, which holy women the apoſtle doth not forbid. Neither did he forbid Philip's four daughters, who were virgins, to propheſy. Women might pray and propheſy in the church, 1 Cor. xi. 5. The apoſtles ſhewed to the Jews the fulfilling of Joel's prophecy: <q>That in the laſt days God would pour out of his Spirit upon all fleſh, and their ſons and daughters, ſervants and handmaids, ſhould propheſy with the Spirit of God.</q> So the apoſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages daughters and handmaids to propheſy, as well as ſons; and if they do propheſy, they muſt ſpeak to the church or people, Joel ii. 28. Acts xvii. 18. Did not Miriam the propheteſs ſing unto the Lord, and all the women with her, when the Lord had delivered the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael from Pharaoh? Did not ſhe praiſe the Lord, and propheſy in the congregation of the children of Iſrael? Was not this in the church? Exod. xv. 21. Moſes and Aaron did not forbid her propheſying or ſpeaking; but Moſes ſaid, <q>Would God all the Lord's people were prophets!</q> And the Lord's people are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well as men. Deborah was a judge and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs; and do not you make uſe of Deborah's and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam's words in your ſervice and worſhip? See Jud. v. 1. to 31. Deborah's large ſpeech or ſong. Barak did not forbid her, nor none of the Jewiſh prieſts. Did not ſhe make this ſpeech or ſong in the congregation or church of Iſrael? In the book of Ruth there are good ſpeeches of
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:037441_0850_100D9412E1F4F288"/>thoſe good women, which were not forbidden. Hannah prayed in the temple before Eli, and the Lord anſwered her prayer. See what a ſpeech Hannah makes, and a praiſing of God before Eli the high prieſt, who did not forbid her, 1 Sam. ii. 1. to 10. Joſiah the king ſent his prieſt, with ſeveral others, to aſk counſel of Huldah the propheteſs, who dwelt at Jeruſalem in the college, 2 King. xxii. 14.2 Chron. xxxiv. 22. So here the king and his prieſts did not deſpiſe the counſel of this propheteſs; and ſhe propheſied to the congregation of Iſrael, as may be ſeen in theſe chapters. In Luke i. 41. to 55. ſee what a godly ſpeech Mary made alſo. Mary ſaid, <q>that the Lord did regard the low eſtate of his handmaid,</q> &amp;c. And don't you make uſe in your worſhip and ſervice of Mary's and Elizabeth's words from Luke ii. 41. to 55. in your churches, and yet forbid women's ſpeaking in your churches, and but to be in ſilence? Yet all ſorts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeak in your churches when they ſing, and ſay Amen. In Luke ii. there was Anna the propheteſs, a widow, of about fourſcore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but ſerved God with faſting and prayer night and day. Did not ſhe confeſs Chriſt Jeſus in the temple, and give thanks to the Lord, <q>and ſpeak of Chriſt to all that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem?</q> Luke ii. 36, 37, 38. So ſuch holy women were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to ſpeak in the church, neither in the law nor goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Was it not Mary Magdalen and other women that firſt preached Chriſt's reſurrection to the apoſtles? The woman indeed (namely Eve) was firſt in tranſgreſſion; ſo they were women that firſt preached the reſurrection of Chriſt Jeſus; for Chriſt ſaid to Mary, &amp;c. <q>Go to my brethren and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and to your Father, and to my God and to your God,</q> John xx. 17. And Luke xxiv. 10. It was Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen, Johanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told the apoſtles, <q>Chriſt was riſen from the dead; and their words and theſe women's words were as idle tales to the apoſtles, and they believed them not,</q> ib. 11. Ver. 22. <q>Certain women alſo of our company made us aſtoniſhed,</q> they ſaid. So here it may be ſeen that the women's preaching the reſurrection of Chriſt did aſtoniſh the apoſtles. Chriſt ſent theſe women to preach his reſurrection; ſo it is no ſhame for ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:037441_0851_100D941472CD62E8"/>to preach Chriſt Jeſus, neither are they to be ſilent when Chriſt ſends them. The apoſtle ſays, <q>Every tongue ſhall confeſs to God,</q> Rom. xiv. 11, and <q>Every tongue ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God the Father,</q> Philip. ii. 11. So here it is clear that women muſt confeſs Chriſt as well as men, if every tongue muſt confeſs. And the apoſtle ſaith, <q>There's neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus,</q> Gal. iii. 28.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is ſaid, <q>women muſt aſk their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at home,</q> &amp;c. the duke knows very well, virgins have no huſbands, nor widows; for Anna, the propheteſs, was a widow; and if Chriſt be the huſband, men muſt aſk counſel of him at home, as well as women, before they teach. And ſet the caſe that a Turk's wife ſhould be a Chriſtian, or a Papiſt's wife ſhould be a Lutheran, or a Calviniſt, muſt they aſk and learn of their huſbands at home before they confeſs Chriſt Jeſus in the congregation of the Lord? Their counſel will be to them to turn Turks or Papiſts.</p>
                        <p>I intreat the duke to conſider theſe things. I intreat him to mind God's grace and truth in his heart, that is come by Jeſus Chriſt, that by his Spirit of grace and truth he may come to ſerve and worſhip God in his Spirit and truth; ſo that he may ſerve the living eternal God that made him, in his generation, and have his peace in Chriſt that the world cannot take away. And I do deſire his good, peace, and proſperity in this world, and his eternal comfort and happineſs in the world that is everlaſting, Amen.</p>

The yearly meeting coming on, I was much concerned for friends that came up to it out of the country, leſt they ſhould meet with any trouble or diſturbance in their paſſage up or down; and the rather, becauſe about that time a great buſtle aroſe in the nation upon the duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth's landing in the Weſt. But the Lord, according to his wonted goodneſs, was graciouſly pleaſed to preſerve friends in ſafety, and gave us a bleſſed opportunity to meet together in peace and quietneſs, and accompanied our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his living, refreſhing preſence: bleſſed for ever be his holy name!</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the hurries that were in the nation, it came upon me at the cloſe of this meeting to write a few lines to friends, <q>to caution all to keep out of the ſpirit of the world, in which trouble is, and to dwell in the peaceable truth;</q> as followeth:</p>

                        <p>WHOM the Lord hath called and choſen in Chriſt Jeſus, your Life and Salvation, in whom ye have reſt and peace with God; the Lord by his mighty power, which is over all, hath preſerved and ſupported you to this day, to be a peculiar holy people to himſelf, ſo that by his eternal Spirit and power ye might be all kept out of the world; for in the world is trouble. In this great day of the Lord God Almighty, he is ſhaking the heavens and the earth of outward profeſſions, their elements are in a heat, their ſun and their moon are darkened, the ſtars falling, and the mountains and hills ſhaking and tottering, as it was among the Jews in the day of Chriſt's appearing. Therefore, dear friends and brethren, dwell in the Seed, Chriſt Jeſus, the Rock and Foundation, that cannot be ſhaken; that ye may ſee with the light and Spirit of Chriſt, that ye are as fixed ſtars in the firmament of God's power; and in this his power and light you'll ſee over all the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſtars, clouds without water, and trees without fruit. That which may be ſhaken will be ſhaken, as will all that are wandered from the firmament of God's power.</p>
                        <p>Dear friends and brethren, you that are redeemed from the death and fall of Adam, by Chriſt the ſecond Adam, in him ye have life, reſt, and peace; for Chriſt ſaith, <q>In me ye ſhall have peace, but in the world trouble.</q> And the apoſtle ſaith, <q>They that believe are entered into their Reſt,</q> namely Chriſt, who bath overcome the world,
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:037441_0854_100D941B3AC2C150"/>bruiſeth the ſerpent's head, deſtroys the devil and his works, and fulfils the types, figures, and ſhadows of the Old Teſtament, and the prophets. In whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are Yea and Amen; who is the Firſt and Laſt, Beginning and Ending, the Eternal Reſt. So keep and walk in Chriſt, your Reſt, every one that have received him.</p>
                        <p>Dear friends and brethren, whatever buſtlings and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tumults or outrages, quarrels and ſtrife, ariſe in the world, keep out of them all; concern not yourſelves with them; but keep in the Lord's power and peaceable truth, that is over all ſuch things; in which power ye ſeek the peace and good of all men. Live in the love which God hath ſhed abroad in your hearts through Chriſt Jeſus; in which love nothing is able to ſeparate you from God and Chriſt, neither outward ſufferings, perſecutions, nor any outward thing that is below and without; nor to hinder or break your heavenly fellowſhip in the light, goſpel, and ſpirit of Chriſt, nor your holy communion in the Holy Ghoſt, that proceeds from the Father and the Son, which leads you into all truth. In this Holy Ghoſt, in which is your holy communion, that proceeds from the Father and the Son, you have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, and one with another. This is it which links and joins Chriſt's church or body together to him the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual head, and in unity in his Spirit, which is the bond of peace to all his church and living members, in whom they have eternal reſt and peace in Chriſt, and with God everlaſting, who is to be bleſſed and praiſed for ever, Amen!</p>
                        <p>Dear friends, forſake not the aſſembling of yourſelves together, who are gathered in the name of Jeſus, your prophet, whom God has raiſed up in the New Teſtament, to be heard in all things; who opens to you, and no man can ſhut, who ſhuts and no man can open; He is your prieſt, made higher than the heavens by the power of an endleſs life; by him you are made a royal prieſthood, to offer up to God ſpiritual ſacrifice; He is the biſhop of your ſouls, to overſee you, that you do not go aſtray from God; He is the good ſhepherd that hath laid down his life for his ſheep, and they hear his voice and follow him, and he gives to them eternal life.</p>
                        <p>Dear friends and brethren, abide in Chriſt the vine, that ye may bring forth fruit to the Glory of God. As
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:037441_0855_100D941CD0F01EE0"/>every one hath received Chriſt, walk in him, who is not of the world that lies in wickedneſs; ſo that ye may be preſerved out of the vain faſhions and cuſtoms of the world which ſatisfy the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world that paſſes away. Whoever joins to that which is not of the Father, or encourages it, draws the mind from God the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore let Chriſt rule in your hearts, that your minds, ſouls, and ſpirits may be kept out of the vanities of the world in their words, ways, and actions, that ye may be a peculiar people, zealous of good works, ſerving the Lord through Jeſus Chriſt, to the praiſe and glory of God; that by the Word of his grace your words may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and in your lives and converſations ye may ſhew forth righteouſneſs, holineſs, and godlineſs, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty may be glorified in you all, and through you all, who is above all, bleſſed and praiſed for ever, Amen.</p>

                        <p>The apoſtle Peter ſaith (in 1 Pet. iii.) of the women's adorning; <q>Let it not be (mark, let it not be: this is a poſitive prohibition) that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner in old time the holy women alſo, who truſted in God, adorned themſelves.</q>

<pb n="340" facs="unknown:037441_0856_100D941E871CADC0"/>which was in the ſight of God of great price, which the holy women who truſted in God adorned themſelves with. But the unholy women, that truſt not in God, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The apoſtle Paul ſaith. 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10. <q>In like manner alſo that women adorn themſelves in modeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, with ſhameſacedneſs and ſobriety, not with broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered hair or gold, or pearls, or coſtly array; but, which becometh women profeſſing godlineſs, with good works.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here ye may ſee what the women were not to adorn themſelves with who profeſſed godlineſs: they were not to adorn themſelves with who profeſſed godlineſs: they were not to adorn themſelves with broidered hair, nor gold, nor pearls, nor coſtly array; for this was not looked upon to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt apparel for holy women that profeſſed godlineſs and good works. But this adorning or apparel is for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt, unſhamefaced, unſober women. that profeſs not godlineſs, neither follow thoſe good works that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Therefore it doth not become men and women, who proſeſs true Chriſtianity and godlineſs, to be adorned with gold. or chains, or pearls, or coſtly array, or with broidered hair; for theſe things are for the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and pride of life, which is not of the Father. All holy men and women are to mind that which is more precious than gold; <q>being redeemed not with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot. Therefore as obedient children to God, not faſhioning yourſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your former luſis in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation</q> 1 Pet. i. 14.15.</p>

                        <p>I read of a wiſe moral philoſopher, who, meeting a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her neck and breaſt Lare, laid his hand upon her and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Therefore take heed of calling the proud happy; for <q>the Lord will ſcatter the proud in the imagination of their own hearts, and exalt them of low degree.</q> You may read in the Revelations (Chap. xvii. 4. and xviii. 16.) of the falſe church, how ſhe was outwardly decked, but full of abomination, and came to a downfal at laſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good for all that profeſs the truth, to uſe this world as not abuſing it; <q>for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. The Lord taketh pleaſure in his people, he will beautify the meek with ſalvation,</q> Pſal. cxlix. 4. All that know the truth as it is in Jeſus, are to be beautified and clothed with this ſalvation, which ſalvation is a ſtrong wall or a bulwark againſt that ſpirit that would lead you further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſall from God, into thoſe things which the fallen man and woman delight in, beautify, or adorn themſelves with. Therefore, all that profeſs the truth, be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſincere, and fervent, following the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is not of this world; in whom ye have life and peace with God.</p>

After ſome weeks I returned to London. Among other ſervices that I found there, one was to aſſiſt in drawing up a teſtimony to clear our friends of being concerned in the late rebellion in the weſt, and from all plots againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; which accordingly was done, and delivered to the chief juſtice, who was then to go into the weſt with commiſſion to try priſoners.</p>
                  <p>I tarried ſome time in London, viſiting meetings, and labouring among friends in the ſervice of truth. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my health much impaired for want of freſh air, I went to Charles Bathurſt's country-houſe at Epping-foreſt, where I ſtaid a few days. There it came upon me to write the following epiſtle to friends:</p>

                        <p>WHO are called, choſen and faithful in this day of trial, temptations, and ſufferings, whom the Lord by his right hand hath upholden in all your ſufferings (and ſome to death) for the Lord and his truth's ſake. Chriſt ſaith, <q>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world; in me ye have peace, but in the world ye have trouble.</q> The children of the Seed, which be heirs of the kingdom, know this is true. And though ye have trials by falſe brethren, Judaſes, and ſons of perdition, that are got into the temple of God, and exalted above all that is called God, whom the Lord will deſtroy with the breath of his mouth and the brightneſs of his coming; and though ye be tried by powers and principalities, yet there is nothing able to ſeparate you from the love of God which ye have in Chriſt Jeſus. In that love dwell, which bears all things, and fulfils the law; in which edify one another, and be courtcous, kind, and humble; for to ſuch God giveth his grace plentifully, ſuch he teacheth. And pray in the Holy Ghoſt, which proceeds from the Father and the Son; in it keep your holy communion and unity in the Spirit, the bond of peace, which is the King of kings heavenly peace. In that you are all bound to good behaviour, to keep peace among yourſelves, to ſeek the peace of all men, and to ſhew forth the heavenly, gentle, and peaceable wiſdom to all, in righteouſneſs and truth, anſwering the good in all people in your lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations (for the Lord is glorified in your bringing forth piritual fruit:) that ye may eye and behold the Lord in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Whether ye be the Lord's priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for his name and truth's ſake, or at liberty, in all things labour to be content, for that is a continual feaſt; and let no trouble move you; then ye will be as Mount Sion that cannot be removed. In all things exerciſe the word of patience, which word will ſanctify all things to you. Study to be quiet, and do the Lord's buſineſs that he requires of you, and your own, in truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Whatſoever ye do, let it be done to the praiſe and glory of God in the name of Jeſus Chriſt. All that make God's people ſuffer, make the ſeed ſuffer in their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieulars, and impriſon the juſt there. Such will not-viſit the ſeed in themſelves, but caſt it into priſon-in others, and not viſit it in priſon. You may read that Chriſt, ſaith, "Such muſt go into everlaſting puniſhment." That is a ſad puniſhment and priſon. All ſuch as are become apoſtates and backſliders, that crucify to themſelves Chriſt afreſh, put him to open ſhame, trample under feet the blood of the Son of God by which they were cleanſed, and come to be unclean; ſuch grieve, vex, quench, and rebel againſt the Spirit of God in themſelves, and then ſuch rebel againſt them that walk in the Spirit of God. Such are unfaithful to God and man, and are enemies to every good work and ſervice of God; but their end will be according to their works, who are like the earth that hath often received rain, but brings forth briers and thorns, which are to be rejected, and are for the fire. Therefore, dear friends, in all your ſufferings feel the Lord's eternal arm and power, which hath ſupported you to this day, and will to the end, as your faith ſtands in it, and as you are ſettled upon the rock and foundation Chriſt Jeſus, that cannot be removed, in whom ye have life and peace with God. The Lord God Almighty, in him, give you do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and preſerve you all to his glory, that in all your ſufferings ye may feel his preſence, and that, when ye have finiſhed your teſtimony, ye may receive the crown of glory which God hath laid up for them that fear and ſerve him, Amen.</p>

                  <p>Having ſpent about a week in the country, I returned to London; where I continued about two months, viſiting
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:037441_0860_100D94258D304C08"/>meetings, and labouring to get relief for friends from their ſufferings, which yet lay heavy upon them in many parts of the nation. I alſo wrote ſeveral papers relating to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of truth, one of which was concerning order in the church of God, which ſome that were gone out of the unity of friends did much oppoſe. It was as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>AMONG all ſocieties, or families, or nations of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world, they have among them ſome ſort of order. There was the order of Aaron in the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, and there was the order of Melchiſedeck before that, after whoſe order Chriſt Jeſus came, and he did not deſpiſe that order. God is a God of order in his whole creation, and in his church; and all believers in the light, the life in Chriſt, that paſs from death to life, are in the order of the Holy Spirit, power, light, life, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt Jeſus, of the increaſe whereof there is no end. This is a myſtery to all thoſe diſorderly people, who have written and printed ſo much againſt order, which the Lord's power and Spirit hath brought forth among his people. And you that cry ſo much agianſt order, is it not manifeſt that you are gone into a land of darkneſs, thick as darkneſs itſelf, and of the ſhadow of death, into diſorder, and where the light is as darkneſs? Is not this your condition ſeen by all them that live and walk in the truth, and whoſe converſations are according to the goſpel of life and ſalvation?</p>
                        <p>The devil, Satan, dragon, the firſt and ſecond beaſt, the whore and falſe prophets, and their worſhippers and followers, all are out of the truth, abode not in it, nor in the order of it: and the truth is over them all. In Salem is God's tabernacle; and his tabernacle is in Shiloh: theſe are far beyond the tabernacles of Ham, Pſalm lxxvi, and lxxviii.</p>
                        <p>All the figures and ſhadows were and are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in time; but Chriſt the ſubſtance is the beginning and the ending. And all trials, troubles, perſecutions, and temptations came up in time: but the Lord's power, which is everlaſting, is over all ſuch things; in which is ſafety.</p>
                        <p>The black world of darkneſs lieth in wickedneſs, and by their wiſdom know not God that made the world and all things therein: for the god of the world and prince of the air ruleth in the hearts of all that diſobey the living
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:037441_0861_100D94272312AB10"/>God who made them. So the god of this wicked world hath blinded the eyes of the inſidels or heathen; ſo that this wicked world by their wiſdom doth not know the living God.</p>
                        <p>In the Old Teſtament the Lord ſaid, <q>With all thy offerings thou ſhalt offer ſalt.</q> Levit. ii. 13. And Chriſt ſaith in his new covenant. <q>Every one ſhall be ſalted with fire, and every ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt. Salt is good; but if the ſalt have loſt its ſaltneſs, wherewith will you ſeaſon it? Have ſalt in yourſelves, and have peace one with another,</q> Mark ix. 48, 49, 50.</p>
                        <p>We have received the earneſt of the Spirit, which is the carneſt of the inheritance that fadeth not away. For God poureth out of his Spirit upon all fleſh. It is God's Spirit, which is above our natural ſpirit (by which alone we do not know God;) for it is by the Spirit of God that we know the things of God. And the Spirit of God doth witneſs to our ſouls and ſpirits, that it ſelf is the earneſt of an eternal inheritance. <q>God opens his people's ears to diſcipline, and commands that they turn from iniquity. If they obey and ſerve him, they ſhall ſpend their days in proſperity, and their years in pleaſure: but if they obey him not, they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and they ſhall die without knowledge,</q> Job xxxvi. 10, 11, 12. So the diſobedient, that do not turn from their iniquity, have not this proſperity and pleaſure; but die without the knowledge of God; and their ears are ſhut to this diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which God opens to his people.</p>

                     <body>
                        <p>YOU may ſee, when the Jews rebelled againſt the good Spirit of God, which he gave to inſtruct them, they forſook him and his law, way, and worſhip, went a whoring after Balaam's ways, and became like the <q>wild aſs's colt, ſnuffing up the wind,</q> Jer. ii. 24. In Jer. iii. ſee how Judah played the harlot under every green tree, and upon every high mountain; therefore the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced Judah, as he had divorced Iſrael when ſhe forſook his way, and followed the ways of the heathen. Though the Lord had fed them to the full, yet they <q>forſook him, committed adultery, and aſſembled themſelves together in harlots houſes,</q> Jer. v. 7. <q>And with their whoredom they defiled the land, and committed adultery with ſtocks and ſtones.</q> Jer. iii. 9. Here you may ſee, when they forſook the living, eternal God, they followed the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and worſhips of other nations, whoſe gods were made of ſtocks and ſtones, which the Jews worſhipped, and committed adultery withal. When they forſook the living God, and his way and worſhip, they forſook the worſhip at Jeruſalem at the temple, and followed the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens worſhips in the mountains and fields: So it was called adultery and whoredom, to join with other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and forſake God, Jer. xiii. 27.</p>
                        <p>And now, if the children of the New Jeruſalem that is above would forſake the worſhip that Chriſt in his New Teſtament ſet up. (which is in Spirit and in truth) and follow the worſhip of nations, which men have ſet up; will not they commit adultery with them, in forſaking God's worſhip, and Chriſt the new and living way?</p>
                        <p>In Jer. xliv. ye may ſee how the children of Judah provoked the Lord againſt them, by worſhipping the works of their own hands, and following the gods of the land of Egypt. In this they committed adultery, forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the living God, their huſband, and his worſhip; and there ye may ſee God's judgments pronounced againſt them to their deſtruction. What will become of thoſe that forſake the worſhip in Spirit and truth, which Chriſt ſet up; and worſhip the works of their own hands in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Egypt, and follow ſpiritual Egypt's will-worſhip, which they invented? May not this be called whoredom

And they that forſake the Lord's way and his worſhip, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the world's ways and worſhips, do not they, whoſe way they follow, become at laſt their enemies? as in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. See how the Jews forſook the Lord's way and worſhip, and doted on other lovers (the Aſſyrians, &amp;c.) and with all their idols were defiled; and how they retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whoredoms brought from Egypt, and were polluted with the Babylonians bed: read Ezek. xxiii. When they forſook the Lord, his way and worſhip, and followed the way and worſhip of the heathen; then it was ſaid, <q>They went a whoring after others, and committed adultery with them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ye may ſee Ezek. xvi. the ſtate of the Jews was liken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that of their ſiſter Sodom, which had played the harlot with the Aſſyrians, committed fornication with the Egyptians, and increaſed their whoredoms, in following their abominable idols; therefore the Lord carried away the two tribes, that forſook him, into Babylon; ſee Ezek. xvii. 20. And they that forſake Chriſt, the new and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Way, and the worſhip of God in Spirit and truth, which Chriſt ſet up in his New Teſtament, go into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in ſpiritual Babylon.</p>
                        <p>Hoſea ii. you may ſee how the prophet diſcovers the whoredoms and idolatry of the Jews who forſook the Lord, and compares them to an harlot. And in chap. iii. ye may ſee the deſtruction threatened againſt the Jews for their impiety and idolatry. In ch. ix. alſo the diſtreſs and captivity of the Jews is threatened for their ſins and idolatry; and again they are reproved and threatened for their impiety and idolatry, Hoſ x. This was for forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord and his way, and following the ways of their own inventions, and the ways of the heathen.</p>
                        <p>Doth not Iſaiah ſay, <q>That the Lord would viſit Tyre, and that ſhe ſhould commit fornication with all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon the face of the earth?</q> therefore the Lord threatened deſtruction upon her, ch. xxiii. In ch. lvii. you may ſee how the Lord reproved the Jews for their whoriſh idolatry, ſaying, <q>Upon an high and loſty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain haſt thou ſet thy bed, even thither wenteſt thou up to offer ſacrifices. Thou haſt enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them, thou loveſt their bed where thou ſaweſt it.</q> This was a joining to the heathen's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,

And now in the New Teſtament God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "poured his Spirit upon all fleſh." that by it all might come to be a <q>royal prieſthood, to offer up ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſacrifices to God by Jeſus Chriſt;</q> all that err from the Spirit of God. and rebel againſt it, are not like to offer ſpiritual ſacrifices to God; the ſacrifice of ſuch God doth not accept, no more than he did that of the heathens or the Jews, who rebelled againſt his good Spirit that he gave them to inſtruct them.</p>
                        <p>You may ſee in the 17th, 18th, and 19th chapters of the Revelation the puniſhment of the great whore, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the mother of harlots, and the victory of the Lamb, and how he calleth God's people out of Babylon; for <q>in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of the ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth.</q> There ye may read her judgment and downfal. This whore are they that are whored from the Spirit of God, and ſo from God. from his holy worſhip in ſpirit and truth, from the pure undefiled religion that keeps from the ſpots of the world, from the new and living way of Chriſt Jeſus; theſe are whored from the Spirit of God into falſe religions, ways, and worſhips, and ſo have corrupted the earth with her abominations. But her judgment and downfal are ſeen, over whom Chriſt hath the victory; and the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Lamb is come, glory to the Lord for ever! And God's pure religion, and pure worſhip in Spirit and truth Chriſt hath ſet up, as it was in the apoſtles days, Hallelujah.</p>

                  <p>I ſoon returned to London, but made no long ſtay there, my body not being able to bear the cloſeneſs of the city long together. While I was in town, beſides the uſual ſervices of <q>viſiting friends, and taking care about their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to get them eaſed,</q> I aſſiſted the friends of the city in diſtributing certain ſums of money, which our friends of Ireland had charitably and very liberally raiſed, and ſent over hither for the relief of their brethren who ſuffered for the teſtimony of a good conſcience; which monies were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

                  <p>Before I left the city I heard of a great doctor lately come from Poland, whom I invited to my lodging, and had a great deal of diſcourſe with him. After I had informed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by him of ſuch things as I had a deſire to know, I wrote a letter to the king of Poland on behalf of friends at Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick, who had long been under grievous ſufferings.

Oh king!</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>THE magiſtrates of the city of Dantzick ſay it is thy order and command that theſe innocent and afflicted people ſhould ſuffer ſuch oppreſſion. Now this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is inflicted upon them only becauſe they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, their Redeemer and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who died for their ſins, and is riſen from the dead for their juſtification, who is their prophet, whom God hath raiſed up like unto Moſes; whom they ought to hear in all things in this day of the goſpel and new covenant; who went aſtray like ſcattered ſheep, but now are returned to the Chief, Shepherd and Biſhop of their Souls, 1 Pet. ii. 25. <q>Who has given his life for his ſheep, and they hear his voice and follow him;</q> who leads them into his "paſtures of life," John x.</p>
                        <p>Now, O king! I underſtand thou openly proſeſſeſt Chriſtianity, and the great and mighty name of Jeſus Chriſt, who is King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom is given all power in heaven and earth, who rules all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a rod of iron. Therefore, O king, it ſeems hard to us, that any who openly confeſs Chriſt Jeſus (yea the magiſtrates of Dantzick do the ſame) ſhould inflict thoſe puniſhments upon an innocent and harmleſs people, by reaſon of their tender conſciences only, becauſe they
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:037441_0866_100D94326B4B6F60"/>come together to ſerve and worſhip the Eternal God, who made them, in Spirit and in truth; which worſhip Chriſt Jeſus has ſet up ſixteen hundred years ago, as we read in John iv. 23, 24.</p>
                        <p>I beſeech the king that he would conſider, whether Chriſt in the New Teſtament ever gave ſuch a command to his apoſtles that they ſhould ſhut up any in priſon, and feed them with bread and water, who were not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in every particular to their religion, faith, and worſhip? Where did the apoſtles exerciſe ſuch things in the true church after Chriſt's aſcenſion? Is not this the doctrine of Chriſt and the apoſtles, that Chriſt's followers ſhould <q>love their enemies, and pray for them that hate, perſecute, and deſpitefully uſe them?</q> Mat. v.</p>
                        <p>Is it not a ſhame to Chriſtendom among the Turks and others, that one Chriſtian ſhould perſecute another for the doctrine of faith, worſhip, and religion? They cannot prove that Chriſt ever gave them ſuch a command, whom they profeſs to be their Lord and Maſter. For Chriſt ſays, that his believers and followers ſhould "love one another;" and by this they ſhould be known to be his diſciples. And did not Chriſt reprove thoſe who would have <q>fire to come down from heaven</q> to deſtroy them who would not receive him? Did not he tell them, <q>they did not know what ſpirit they were of?</q> Have all who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted men, or taken away their lives becauſe they would not receive their religion, known what ſpirit they were or are of? Is it not good for all to know by the Spirit of Chriſt what ſpirit they are of? The apoſtle ſays, Rom. viii. 9. <q>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his.</q> And 2 Cor. x. 4. <q>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but ſpiritual, &amp;c. We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs,</q> &amp;c. Thus we ſee, the fight of the firſt Chriſtians and their weapons in the days of the apoſtles were ſpiritual.</p>
                        <p>Would not the king and the magiſtrates of Dantzick think it contrary to their conſciences, if they ſhould be forced by the Turk to his religion? Would it not in like manner, ſeem hard to the magiſtrates of Dantzick, and contrary to their conſciences, if they ſhould be forced to the religion of the king of Poland? or the king of Poland, if he ſhould be compelled to the religion of the magiſtrates of Dantzick?

                        <p>We beſeech the king with all Chriſtian humility, and the magiſtrates of Dantzick, that they would order their proceedings in this matter according to the royal law of God, which is, <q>to do unto others as they would have others do unto them, and to love their neighbour as themſelves.</q> For we have this charity, that we hope and believe the king of Poland and his people, with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of Dantzick, own the writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as of the Old; therefore we beſeech the king and the magiſtrates of Dantzick, to take heed that their work of impriſoning an innocent people, for nothing but their meeting together in tenderneſs of conſcience to ſerve and worſhip God, their Creator, may not be contrary and oppoſite to the royal law of God, and to the glorious and everlaſting goſpel of truth.</p>
                        <p>We deſire the king, in Chriſtian love, earneſtly and weightily to conſider theſe things, and to give order to ſet the innocent priſoners, our friends, called Quakers, at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from their ſtrict confinement in Dantzick, that they may have freedom to ſerve and worſhip the Living God in Spirit and in truth, and go home to their habitations, and follow their trades and calling, to maintain their wives, children and families. And we believe that the king, in doing ſuch a noble, glorious, yea Chriſtian work, will not go unrewarded from the Great God who made him, whom we ſerve and worſhip, who has the hearts of kings, and their lives and length of days in his hand.</p>
                        <p>From him who deſires the king and all his miniſters may be preſerved in the fear of God, and receive his word of wiſdom, by which all things were made and created, that by it he may come to order all things to the glory of God, which God has put under his hand; that both he and they may enjoy the comforts and bleſſings of the Lord in this life, and in that which is to come life eternal, Amen.</p>

After this I went into Enfield, where, and in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereabouts ſeveral friends had country-houſes, amongſt whom I tarried ſome time viſiting and being viſited by friends, and having meetings with them. Several things I wrote in this time relating to the ſervice of truth. one whereof was concerning judging; for ſome, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the truth, were ſo afraid of truth's judgment, that they made it much of their buſineſs to cry out againſt judging. Wherefore I wrote a paper, proving by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth, that the church of Chriſt hath power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to judge thoſe that profeſs to be of it, not only with reſpect to outward things relating to this world, but with reſpect to religious matters alſo. A copy of which follows:</p>

                                 <q>THE natural man receiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned; but he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things (mark) all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man,</q> 1 Cor. ii. 14, 15. So the natural man cannot judge of thoſe things he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not, for they are fooliſhneſs to him; but he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the ſpiritual man, and his fooliſhneſs, and is judged, though he cannot judge the ſpiritual man.</p>
                              <p>"Do not ye judge them that are within?" ſaith the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. This power the church had and hath, <q>therefore put away from amongſt yourſelves that wicked perſon.</q> Did not this wicked perſon, think you, profeſs and plead for liberty for his wickedneſs, and his freedom, as he was a Chriſtian, who was looked upon as a member of the church?</p>
                              <p>The apoſtle ſaith, <q>For I verily, as abſent in body, yet preſent in Spirit, have judged already, as though I were preſent, concerning him that hath done this wicked deed,</q> 1 Cor. v. 3, 12. Here the apoſtle did judge, though afar off, and ſet up judgment in the church againſt falſe liberty, under what pretence ſoever it was.</p>
                              <p>And the apoſtle ſaith, <q>Dare any of you, having a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt a brother, go to law before the unjuſt and not before the ſaints?</q> Here the ſaints, the church, are to judge of things amongſt themſelves, and not the unjuſt to judge of their matters. <q>Do ye not know the ſaints ſhall
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:037441_0869_100D9438983FFA30"/>judge the world?</q> So the ſaints are to judge the unjuſt, and not the unjuſt to judge their matters.</p>
                              <p>And farther the apoſtle ſaith, <q>If the world ſhall be judged by you (to wit, the ſaints) are you unworthy to judge the ſmaller matters amongſt you?</q>

                              <p>Again, <q>Know ye not, that we ſhall judge the angels? (and angels are ſpirits) how much more the things which pertain to this life?</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>If ye then have judgment of things pertaining to this life. ſet them up to judge who have leaſt eſteem in the church,</q> 1 Cor. iv. 6. Here it is clear the church of Chriſt has a judgment in the power and Spirit of God, not only to judge in "things that pertain to this life;" but alſo to judge of things betwixt brethren, without bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going to law with brother before unbelievers; which was a fault, and to be judged, if they did ſo.</p>
                              <p>But all the ſaints have a judgment to judge angels that kept not their habitations, and the world. Jude <q>judged the angels that kept not their habitations, their firſt ſtate.</q> Did not he judge in divine matters here? He judged the ſtate of Cain, Balaam, and Core, and ſuch Chriſtians as were got into their ſteps, and were gone as far as they, though they profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians? Here again he judged in divine matters, and of their ſtates and beings, who ſtood in the divine principle, and who were fallen from it.</p>
                              <p>The apoſtle ſaith, <q>Try the ſpirits, and believe not every ſpirit,</q> 1 John 4. Here again was a judgment in divine matters; and he judged ſuch as went out from them, which whilſt they were with them they had ſight of things and openings, but when they went from them, they went from the anointing; therefore he exhorts the ſaints to keep to the anointing. Such as went from them that had the anointing, came to be the ſeducers and falſe prophets that went into the world.</p>
                              <p>John had a judgment to try ſacrifices, and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cain's from Abel's, and by the Spirit of God knew which God accepted, and which he did not accept, 1 John
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:037441_0870_100D943BB0A87778"/>iii. 1.2. Paul judged and tried ſuch meſſengers and apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and transformers of themſelves like to the apoſtles of Chriſt, and would have the church to try ſuch, and have the ſame judgment as he had, 2 Cor. xi.</p>
                              <p>Peter judged Ananias and Sapphira, and the thoughts of Simon Magus, who would have been a worker of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for money. Was not all this judgment in divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? The apoſtle Paul judged the preachers of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both in the Romans and Galatians. For it was the faith and liberty of thoſe preachers to preach up circumciſion, though it was a wrong faith. Did not the apoſtle here again judge in divine matters?</p>
                              <p>James judged in matters of faith, and manifeſted the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith from the dead one. He alſo judged in matters of religion, the vain religion from the pure religion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed them.</p>
                              <p>Paul judged of the <q>falſe brethren that would ſpy out the liberty of the true, to whom he would give no place by fubjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel might continue with the ſaints,</q> Gal. ii. Did not the apoſtle here judge in divine matters? And he judged concerning the matters of the goſpel, when ſome came to pervert them with another goſpel, and ſaid, <q>The goſpel which I received is not of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</q> Gal. i. 12. So here was a judgment to diſtinguiſh the goſpel of Chriſt from all other goſpels which were accurſed, which after man are received of man, and taught of man, and not by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal. i. And he had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know, <q>Who made the goſpel chargeable, and who kept it without charge.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>He ſet up a judgment in the church, that the believers ſhould not be unequally yoked, and to ſee when men had a communion in the light, and when they had it in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when with Chriſt and when with Baal, with the believer and unbeliever, with the temple of God and with Idols, as in 2 Cor. 6. Did he not ſet up a clear judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here in divine matters in the church?</p>
                              <p>And the apoſtle judged ſuch libertines through their knowledge that could ſit at meat in the idol-temple, which cauſed the weak brother to periſh, through his knowledge and liberty, for whom Chriſt died. Theſe, it is like, did profeſs it was their faith and their liberty, yet did not keep
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:037441_0871_100D943DDBC07E00"/>in the unity of the true faith, but went aſtray to deſtroy it, 1 Cor. viii.</p>
                              <p>Peter gives judgment upon the angels that ſinned and were caſt down into hell, of the ſtate of the old world, and of Sodom, and the ſtate of the falſe prophets then amongſt them, that could ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity, and whilſt they promiſed them liberty were themſelves the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of corruption. Had not Peter here a judgment in divine matters? Theſe were ſuch, whoſe work was to bring into bondage, being like the dog and ſow that were waſhed; which ſhews that they had been waſhed, but were turned into the mire again. The apoſtle Paul had a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſuch with their fair words and men's wiſdom, that deceived the hearts of the ſimple, and upon ſuch as <q>ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies, and were enemies to the croſs of Chriſt.</q> He had a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcerning who lived in the croſs of Chriſt, and who did not, and exhorted all to live in the croſs of Chriſt, the righteous power of God, that ſlew all deceit and the deeds of the old man; agreeable to Chriſt's words. <q>He that will be my diſciple, muſt take up his croſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</q> Was not here a judgment again in divine matters, of ſuch as walked in the divine power, and ſuch as did not?</p>
                              <p>Chriſt ſets up a judgment in his ſeven churches, and commends them that did keep in his judgment, and had tried them which ſaid, "They were apoſtles," who might pretend they were ſent of God and Chriſt, and were not; but the Church of Chriſt had found them liars. Chriſt commended this judgment of the church of Epheſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had <q>not borne with them that were evil, but had tried thoſe falſe apoſtles;</q> and Chriſt commends this church, for that they had <q>hated the deeds of the Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans, which he alſo bated;</q> and had not theſe Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſprung from Nicholas, one of the deacons? and were not thoſe become a ſect of Chriſtians? Though they might talk and preach of Chriſt, yet Chriſt hated their doctrine.</p>
                              <p>Chriſt ſaith to the Church of Smyrna, <q>I know the blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jews, and are not; but are of the ſynagogue of Satan.</q> So the Church is to have a judgment upon theſe blaſphemers, and are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the Jews in the Spirit from ſuch as are not, but of the ſynagogue of Satan.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="356" facs="unknown:037441_0872_100D943F6E029468"/>
The Church in Pergamos Chriſt had a "few things againſt, becauſe," ſaid he, "thou haſt there them that hold the doctrines of Balaam, &amp;c. And alſo them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate." Theſe that held the doctrine of Balaam, and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, were got into the church, and might look upon themſelves to be high Chriſtians, and take great liberty to go into Balaam's and Nicholas's doctrine, which was hated by Chriſt; but the church was to keep a ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and divine judgment upon the heads of all theſe.</p>
                              <p>To the church of Thyatira, ſaith Chriſt, <q>I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt the woman Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel to teach, which ſeduces my people,</q> &amp;c. Here was a ſuffering which ſhould have been a judgment by Chriſt's Spirit upon that Jezebel which was erred from his Spirit, and ſo from Chriſt. Such as theſe were high preachers. Is not the church to beware of ſuffering ſuch now, leſt ſhe ſhould come under the reproof of Chriſt for not paſſing judgment againſt the falſe teacher and ſeducer?</p>
                              <p>The church of Sardis "had a name to live, but was dead, and her works were not found perfect before God." There is a judgment to be ſet up in the church, to judge all imperfect works, and ſuch as would have a name, but not the nature; a name to live yet are dead. The living of every member of the true church muſt be in Chriſt their life. Theſe living members live to his name. This church had a few names, <q>who had not deſiled their garments, that did walk in white;</q> but ſuch as have a name to live but are dead, whilſt they are in a dead ſtate cannot walk in white, nor judge in divine matters. "Behold," ſaid Chriſt, <q>I will make them of the ſynagogue of Satan, which ſay they are Jews, but are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and to worſhip before my feet.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>And to the church of Laodicea, that was "neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm; I would thou wert either hot or cold: I will ſpew thee out of my mouth, becauſe thou ſaidſt thou waſt rich, and wanted nothing;" when they were "wretched, miſerable, poor, blind, and naked." This was for want of living in the power and Spirit of Chriſt. Theſe could talk of high experiences and great enjoyments, but were naked, miſerable, and blind; ſo lived not in the power, Spirit, light, and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which they might be clothed, and have the eternal riches. So the church of Chriſt had a ſpiritual
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:037441_0873_100D9441C683FFD0"/>judgment given to them that are faithful in his power and Spirit and light, to judge of temporal things and the things of this life, and to judge of eternal and divine things and ſtates, and of angels and wicked men, and ſuch as go from truth, and of the ſtates of election and reprobation, yea and of the devils who are out of truth; theſe being in Chriſt Jeſus who is the Firſt and Laſt, from whom they have the eternal judgment, to judge eternal, ſpiritual, and divine things; and in this word of power and wiſdom, by which all things were made and are upheld, to order all things to God's glory, and to judge of all things in righteouſneſs.</p>
                              <p>The apoſtle judged, and ſet up a judgment in the church, of gifts, of prophecies, of myſteries of faith, and of giving the body to be burned, and of giving goods to the poor, and of ſpeaking with tongues of men and angels; that yet, if they had not love, all this was nothing, but as a ſounding braſs and tinkling cymbal. Therefore they are to be tried by the fruits of the good Spirit, which is love. The apoſtle not only judged himſelf in divine matters, but ſet up a judgment in the church in thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and divine matters.</p>
                              <p>The apoſtle James judges of fountains and of fig-trees, of the wiſdom below, and of the wiſdom from above. and the fruits of both, James iii. And Paul judged in divine matters, when he ſaid, <q>The Spirit ſpoke expreſsly, that in the latter times ſome ſhould depart from the faith,</q> 1 Tim. iv. He judged in divine matters, when he judged all thoſe teachers that were high-minded, and had got the form of godlineſs, but denied the power, and termed them like Jannes and Jamores, which withſtood Moſes coming out of outward Egypt, as theſe with their form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs oppoſe Chriſt and his power that brings them out of ſpiritual Egypt now. Was not he a judge here in divine matters, who judged ſuch as had gotten the form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but denied the divine power? 2 Tim. iii.</p>
                              <p>When the apoſtle Paul ſaid, "The prieſthood of Aaron was changed, and the law was changed, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment diſannulled, that gave them their tithes," did not he judge in divine and ſpiritual matters? and was not the law ſpiritual, which ſerved till the Seed came?</p>
                              <p>Did not the apoſtle judge in divine and ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the ſixth of the Hebrews, where he ſaith, <q>Let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:037441_0874_100D9443E3BB7218"/>repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, and of the doctrine of baptiſms, and of laying on of hands, and of the reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and this will we do, if God permit,</q> &amp;c. and does not the apoſtle judge here, <q>That it was impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and taſted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and had taſted of the good word of God, and of the power of the world to come, if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, ſeeing they crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame?</q> Heb. vi. Were not theſe ſpiritual, eternal, and divine matters and ſtates that the apoſtle judged of? and have not the ſaints the ſame judgment given unto them in the ſame ſpirit? Have not the apoſtles and the church a ſpiritual judgment to judge of prophets, myſteries, faith, apoſtles, angels, world, and the devil? And is not this judgment given them of God in divine matters, beſides the judgment giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them in matters pertaining unto this life?</p>
                              <p>And had not they judgment to diſcern the true goſpel from the falſe? and all ſuch as had a profeſſion of the form, and did not live in the power? and ſuch as ſpoke of the things of God, in the words that man's wiſdom did teach? which things of God were not to be ſpoken in the wiſdom which man's words taught; but in the word which the Holy Ghoſt taught. Therefore did not the apoſtle exhort to know the power, and that their faith might ſtand in the power of God? that the kingdom of God ſtands not in word, but in power?</p>
                              <p>Had not all the prophets a judgment to judge in divine matters? as Jeremiah, when he judged the prophets; and Ezekiel judged all ſuch as came with a pretence of the Word of the Lord, uſing their tongues, and ſaying, <q>Thus ſaith the Lord; when the Lord never ſpoke unto them.</q> Jeremiah xxiii. Ezekiel xiii. and many other places might be inſtanced. Did he not judge Hananiah, who propheſied falſely? and did not this Hananiah pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak the word of the Lord to the prieſts and people? Jeremiah xxviii.</p>
                              <p>Did not Iſaiah judge in divine matters, when he judged the watchmen and the ſhepherds? Iſa. lvi. Did not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah judge in divine and ſpiritual matters, when he ſaid he <q>was full of the power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment?</q> Did not he judge of prieſts, prophets, and
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:037441_0875_100D9445ED6D8828"/>judges, though they would lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord amongſt us, and no evil can come unto us; yet did not he let them ſee their ſtates and conditions, and "divided the precious from the vile?" Mich. iii. And ſo the reſt of the prophets. You may ſee they judged for God in his divine matters, <q>who ſerved him, and who ſerved him not; who lived in truth, and who not;</q> and likewiſe the apoſtles. And this divine, ſpiritual, heavenly judgment was given of God to his holy men and women.</p>
                              <p>They that judge in God's divine matters, muſt live in his divine Spirit, power, and light now, as they did then; which ſpiritual and divine judgment Chriſt has given to his Church, the living ſtones, and living members, that make up his ſpiritual houſehold; to try Jews, apoſtles, and prophets; to try faiths and religions, trees and fruits, ſhepherds and teachers, and to try ſpirits. So the living members have a living divine judgment in the church of Chriſt, which he is the Head of, the judge of all.</p>
                              <p>Nay, the church has a power given them, which is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a judgment: for what they <q>bind on earth, is bound in heaven by the power of God;</q> and what they "looſe on earth is looſed in heaven by the power of God." This power has Chriſt given to his living members, the church.</p>

                  <p>I returned to London in the firſt month 1686, and ſet myſelf with all diligence to look after friends ſufferings, which we had now ſome hopes of getting relief from. The ſeſſions came on in the ſecond month at Hicks's Hall, where many friends had appeals to be tried; with whom I was from day to day to adviſe, and ſee that no opportunity was ſlipt, nor advantage loſt: and they generally ſucceeded well. Soon after, the king was pleaſed, upon our often laying our ſufferings before him, <q>To give order for the releaſing all that were impriſoned for conſcience-ſake; which were in his power to diſcharge.</q> Whereby the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-doors were opened, and many hundreds of friends, ſome of whom had been long in priſon, were ſet at liberty. Some of them, who had many years been reſtrained in bonds, came up to the yearly meeting, which was in the third month this year. This cauſed great joy to friends, to ſee

                        <p>MY love is to you all in the holy Seed Chriſt Jeſus, that bruiſes the ſerpent's head, and deſtroys the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his works; and who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him. Let every one's faith ſtand in him, and in his power, who is the author and finiſher of your faith. To you who have been partakers of his power, and are ſenſible of it in this day of his power, which is over darkneſs and its power; by whoſe power the hearts of the king and rulers have been opened; and by which your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priſon-doors have been ſet open for your liberty. My deſires are, that all may be preſerved in humility and thankfulneſs, in the ſenſe of the mercies of the Lord; and live in the peaceable truth that is over all: that ye may anſwer God's grace, and his light and Spirit in all; in a righteous, godly life and converſation. Let none be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by their outward liberty, neither let any be caſt down by ſuffering for Chriſt's ſake; but all live in the ſeed (which is as wheat) which is not ſhaken nor blown away by the winds and ſtorms, as the chaff is. Which Seed of life none below can make higher or lower: for the children of the Seed are the children of the everlaſting, unchangeable kingdom of Chriſt and God. In Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath given you for a ſanctuary. God Almighty keep you, in whom ye have life everlaſting, and wiſdom from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits; that all may be exerciſed in it, and may practiſe this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in holy lives and converſations; that this wiſdom may be juſtified of all her children, and they exerciſed and preſerved in it in this day of the power of Chriſt; in which all his people are made a willing people, to ſerve and worſhip God in righteouſneſs and holineſs, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth.</p>
                        <p>Let none abuſe the power of the Lord, nor grieve his Spirit, by which you are ſealed and kept to the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and redemption; but always exerciſe yourſelves to

Glory to his name over all forever, Amen! Chriſt has called you by his grace into one body, to him the holy head; therefore live in charity, and in the love of God, which is the bond of perfectneſs in his body; which love edifies the body of Chriſt: which body and all its members are knit together, and increaſed with the increaſe of God, from whom they receive nouriſhment. For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, and have been made all to drink into one Spirit; in which Spirit the body and all its members have fellowſhip with Chriſt the head, and one with another. The unity of this holy Spirit is the bond of peace of all the living members of Chriſt Jeſus, of which he is the ſpiritual head, rock, and foundation. In the midſt of his church of living members Chriſt exerciſes his ſpiritual prophetical office, to open to them the myſteries of his kingdom. He is a ſpiritual biſhop to overſee them, that they do not go aſtray from the living God that made them; a ſhepherd that feeds them with bread and water of life from heaven, and none is able to pluck his ſheep out of his hands. He is a prieſt that died for them, ſanctifieth them, and preſents them to God, who ruleth in their hearts by the divine faith, which he is the author and finiſher of. His living members praiſe God through Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they have life and ſalvation, who reconciles them to God, that they can ſay they have <q>peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt;</q> and ſo praiſe God through him that was dead and is alive, reigns over all, and liveth for everrnore, bleſſed for ever, Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
                        <p>Greet one another with an holy kiſs of charity. Love or charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. It envieth not, vaunteth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For though many were releaſed out of priſon, yet ſome remained priſoners ſtill for tithes, &amp;c. and ſufferings of ſeveral ſorts lay heavy on friends in many places. Yet inaſmuch as many who had been priſoners were now ſet at liberty; I felt a concern upon me that none might look too much at man, but might eye the Lord therein, from whom deliverance comes.

                        <p>THE Lord by his eternal power hath diſpoſed the heart of the king to open the priſon-doors, by which about fifteen or ſixteen hundred are ſet at liberty, and hath given a check to the informers, ſo that in many places our meetings are pretty quiet.

So in Chriſt male and female are all one; for whether they be male or female, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, they are all one in Chriſt. And there can be no ſchiſm, rent, or diviſion in him, nor in the worſhip of God in his holy Spirit and truth, nor in the pure and undefiled religion that keeps from the ſpots of the world, nor in the love of God that beareth and endureth all things, nor in the word of God's grace, for it is pure and endureth for ever. Many, you ſee, have loſt the word of patience, and the word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. Then they run into the wiſdom that is below, that is "earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh," and very uneaſy to be intreated. They go from the love of God that beareth all things, endureth all things, thinks no evil, and doth not behave itſelf unſeemly; them they cannot bear, but grow brittle, are eaſily provoked, run into unſeemly things, and are in that, that vaunteth itſelf, are puffed up, raſh, heady, high-minded, and fierce, and become as ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing braſs or a tinkling cymbal; but this is contrary to the nature of the love of God.

                  <p>A little after it came upon me to write ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of the church and the true members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>Concerning the church of Chriſt being clothed with the ſun and having the moon under her feet.</p>
                        <p>THEY are living members, living ſtones, built up a ſpiritual houſehold, the children of the promiſe, and
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:037441_0882_100D9454D97885E8"/>of the ſeed and fleſh of Chriſt; as the apoſtle ſaith, <q>fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone.</q> They are the good ſeed, the children of the everlaſting kingdom written in heaven, who have put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. They ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt, are clothed with the Sun of righteouſneſs, Chriſt Jeſus, and have the moon under their feet, Revel. xii. So all changeable things that are in the world, all changeable religions changeable worſhips, changeable ways, fellowſhips, churches, and teachers in the world, are as the moon; for the moon changes, but the ſun doth not change. The Sun of righteouſneſs never changeth, or ſets, nor goes down; but all the ways, religions, worſhips, fellowſhips of the world, and the teachers thereof, change like the moon. But the true church, which Chriſt is the head of, which is in God the Father, and is called "the pillar and ground of truth," whoſe converſation is in heaven; this church is clothed with the Sun, Chriſt Jeſus her head, who doth not change, and hath all changeable things under her feet. Theſe are the living members, born again of the immortal ſeed by the word of God, who feed upon the immortal milk, and live and grow by it. Such are the new creatures in Chriſt Jeſus, who makes all things new, and ſees the old things paſs away. His church, his members, which are cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſun, their worſhip is in the Spirit and in the truth, which doth not change, which truth the devil, the foul, unclean ſpirit, is out of, and cannot get into this worſhip in Spirit and truth. Their religion is pure and undefiled before God, that keeps from the ſpots of the world, and their way is the new and living way, Chriſt Jeſus. So the church of Chriſt, that is clothed with the Sun, that hath the moon and all changeable religions and ways under her feet, hath an unchangeable worſhip, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and way, an unchangeable rock and foundation, Chriſt Jeſus, an unchangeable high prieſt, and ſo are children of the New Teſtament, and in the everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of light and life.</p>
                        <p>All that proſeſs the ſcriptures both of the New and Old Teſtament, and are not in Chriſt Jeſus, the apoſtle tells them they are "reprobates if Chriſt be not in them." Theſe that are not in Chriſt cannot be clothed with Chriſt, the Sun of righteouſneſs, that never changes. They are under the changeable moon in the world, in the changeable things, the changeable religions, ways, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:037441_0883_100D945817677098"/>teachers, rocks, and foundations. But Chriſt, the Son of God and Sun of righteouſneſs, doth not change; in whom his people are gathered, and ſit together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in him, clothed with Chriſt Jeſus, the Sun, who is the mountain that filleth the whole earth with his divine power and light. So all his people ſee him and feel him both by ſea and land. He is in all places of the earth felt and ſeen of all his. He ſaith to the outward profeſſors, the Jews, <q>I am from above, ye are from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ye are of this world.</q> So their religions, worſhips, ways, teachers, faiths, beliefs, and creeds, are made by men, and are below, of this world that changeth like the moon. You may ſee their religions, ways, worſhips, and teachers, are all changeable like the moon; but Chriſt, the Sun, with which the church is clothed, doth not change, nor his church; for they are ſpiritually-minded, and their way, worſhip, and religion is ſpiritual, from Chriſt, who is from above and not of this world. Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from this world, their changeable rudiments and elements, and old things, and their changeable teachers, and from their changeable faiths and beliefs. For Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of his church's faith, who ſaith, <q>Believe in the Light, that ye may become children of the Light.</q> And it is given them not only to believe, but to ſuffer for his name. So this faith and belief is above all faiths and beliefs, which change like the moon. God's people are an holy nation, a peculiar people, a ſpiritual houſehold, and royal prieſthood, offering up ſpiritual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and are zealous of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, godly, good works, and their zeal is for that which is of God againſt the evil which is not of God. Chriſt took upon him the ſeed of Abraham, he doth not ſay the corrupt ſeed of the Gentiles; ſo according to the fleſh he was of the holy ſeed of Abraham and David, and his holy body and blood was an offering and a ſacrifice for the ſins of the whole world, as a lamb without blemiſh, whoſe fleſh ſaw no corruption. By the one offering of himſelf in the New Teſtament or New Covenant, he has put an end to all the offering and ſacrifices amongſt the Jews in the Old Teſtament. Chriſt, the holy Seed, was crucified, dead, and buried according to the fleſh, and raiſed again the third day, and his fleſh ſaw no corruption. Though he was crucified in the fleſh, yet quickened again by the Spirit and is alive, and liveth for evermore, and hath all
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:037441_0884_100D9459A8FBF568"/>power in heaven and earth given to him, and reigneth over all, and is the One Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus. Chriſt ſaid, <q>He gave his fleſh for the life of the world;</q> and the apoſtle ſaith, <q>his fleſh ſaw no corruption;</q> ſo that which ſaw no corruption he gave for the life of the corrupt world to bring them out of corruption. Chriſt ſaid again, <q>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; for my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. And he that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</q> He that eats not his fleſh and drinks not his blood, which is the life of the fleſh, hath not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. As the apoſtle ſaith, "All died in Adam;" then all are dead. Now all coming ſpiritually to eat the fleſh of Chriſt, the ſecond Adam, and drink his blood, his blood and fleſh gives all the dead in Adam life, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them out of their ſins and treſpaſſes in which they were dead; ſo they come to fit together in the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, and are living members of the church of Chriſt that he is the head of, and are clothed with the Sun of righteouſneſs, the Son of God, that never changes, and have the changeable moon under their feet, and all changeable worldly things, inventions, and works of men's hands. Theſe ſee the people how they change from one worſhip to another, from one religion to another, from one way to another, and one church to another, yet their hearts are not changed. The letter of the ſcripture is read by the Chriſtians like the Jews, but the myſtery is hid; they have the ſheep's clothing, the outſide, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened from the Spirit, which ſhould bring them into the Lamb's and Sheep's nature. The ſcripture ſaith, "All the uncircumciſed muſt go down into the pit;" there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all muſt be circumciſed with the Spirit of God, which puts off the body of death and ſins of the fleſh, that came into man and woman by their diſobedience and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God's commands. I ſay, all muſt be circumciſed with the Spirit, which puts off the body of death and ſins of the fleſh, before they come up into Chriſt, their Reſt, that never fell, and be clothed with him the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>Towards the latter end of this year I went to my ſou Rouſe's near Kingſlon. While I was there I wrote a paper
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:037441_0885_100D945C10B00C88"/>concerning the 'falling away,' foretold by the apoſtle Paul, 2 Theſſ. ii. 3. as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>THE apoſtle ſaith that there muſt be "a falling away" firſt before the wicked one, and man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, be revealed, which betrayeth Chriſt within, as the ſon of perdition betrayed Chriſt without; and they that betray Chriſt within crucify to themſelves Chriſt afreſh, and put him to open ſhame. Before the apoſtles deceaſed, this man of ſin and ſon of perdition was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for they ſaw antichriſt come, the falſe prophets, falſe apoſtles, and deceivers come, having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof. They ſaw the wolves dreſſed in the ſheep's clothing, and ſuch as went in Cain's, Corah's, and Balaam's way, and Jezebel's, and the whore of Babylon, the whore of confuſion, the mother of harlots, and ſuch as were enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, that ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own bellies. Theſe Chriſt ſaw ſhould come, and ſaid, <q>If it were poſſible they ſhould deceive the elect,</q> and commanded his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers not to go after them. The apoſtle ſaid, <q>Turn away from ſuch,</q> and Chriſt and his apoſtles warned the church of Chriſt of ſuch. In this day of Chriſt and his goſpel, after the long night of apoſtacy from the light, grace, truth, life, and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, the ſon of perdition, the wicked one, the man of ſin is revealed again, and the inwardly ravening wolves in ſheep's clothing, and the ſpirit of Cain, Corah, Balaam, Jezebel, the antichriſts, falſe prophets, and falſe apoſtles, and ſuch as are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, who ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies, and crucify Chriſt to themſelves, and put him to open ſhame. This ſpirit have we ſeen in this goſpel-day of Chriſt; but Chriſt will conſume them with the Spirit of his mouth, and deſtroy them with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming. But God's people, whom he hath choſen unto ſalvation in Chriſt from the beginning, through the ſanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth, ſtand ſteadfaſt in Chriſt Jeſus, and are thankful to God by and through his Son, their rock and ſalvation, their happineſs, and eternal inheritance.</p>
                        <p>The apoſtle ſaith, <q>Ye were as ſheep going aſtray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Biſhop of your Souls.</q> So when people are returned to Chriſt, their Shepherd, they know his voice and follow him, and are
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:037441_0886_100D945E357B8B28"/>returned to the Biſhop of their Souls; then they believe in him and receive wiſdom and underſtanding from him who is from above, heavenly and ſpiritual. Then they act like ſpiritual holy men and women, and come to be members of the Church of Chriſt. Then a ſpiritual care cometh upon the elders in Chriſt, that all the members walk in Chriſt, in his light, grace, Spirit, and truth, that they may adorn the confeſſion and profeſſion of Chriſt, and ſee that all walk in the order of the holy Spirit, and the everlaſting goſpel of peace, life, and ſalvation. This order keeps out of confuſion; for the goſpel of peace, the power of God, was before confuſion was. All the heirs of the goſpel are heirs of its order, and are in this goſpel which brings life and immortality to light in them, by which all men and women may ſee their work and ſervice in it, to look after the poor widows and fatherleſs, to ſee that nothing be lacking, and that all honour the Lord in their lives and converſations.</p>
                        <p>When the whole houſe of Iſrael were in their graves and ſepulchres, and were called "the ſcattered, dry bones," yet they could ſpeak, and ſay <q>their bones were dry, their hope was loſt. or they were without hope, and they were cut off.</q> They were alive outwardly, and could ſpeak outwardly. So that which is called Chriſtendom may very well be called "the ſcattered dry bones," and be ſaid to be in their graves and ſepulchres, dead from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly breath of life, the Spirit and word of life, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth to God. Though they can ſpeak, and are alive outwardly, yet they remain in the congregations or churches of the dead, that want the virtue of life. For the Jews, whom God poured his Spirit upon and gave them his law, when they rebelled againſt the Spirit of God. and turned from God and his law, they came to be dry ſcattered bones, and were turned into their graves and ſepulchres. So Chriſtendom that is turned from the grace, truth, and light of Chriſt, and the Spirit that God poureth upon all fleſh, they are become the ſcattered dry bones, are in their graves and ſepulchres, and are the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or churches of the dead, though they can ſpeak and are alive outwardly.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſaith, <q>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. He gave his fleſh for the life of the world.</q> And he ſaith, <q>I am the reſurrection and the life. I am the way, the truth, and
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:037441_0887_100D9460D7B127B0"/>the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</q> Chriſt is the quickening Spirit. All being dead in Adam are to be quickened and made alive by Chriſt, the ſecond Adam. And when they are quickened and made alive by him, they meet together in the name of Jeſus Chriſt their Saviour, who died for their ſins and is riſen for their juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and ſo was dead and is alive, and liveth for evermore. All whom he hath quickened and made alive (even all the living) meet in the name of Jeſus who is alive, and he their living Prophet, Shepherd, and Biſhop is in the midſt of them, and is their living Rock and Foundation, and a living Mediator between them and the living God. So the living praiſe the living God through Jeſus Chriſt, through whom they have peace with God. All the living have reſt in Chriſt their life, he is their ſanctification, their righteouſneſs, their treaſure of wiſdom, knowledge, and underſtanding, which is ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. He is the ſpiritual tree and root, which all the believers in the light, the life in Chriſt, that paſs from the death in Adam to the life in Chriſt, and overcome the world, and are born of God, are grafted into Chriſt, the heavenly tree, which beareth all the ſpiritual branches or grafts. Theſe meet in his name, are gathered in him, and ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, their Life, who hath quickened and made them alive. So all the living worſhip the living God in his holy Spirit and truth, in which they live and walk. Into this worſhip the ſoul, unclean ſpirit, the devil, cannot get; for the holy Spirit and truth is over him, and he is out of it. This is the ſtanding worſhip which Chriſt ſet up in his new covenant. And they that are quickened by Chriſt are the living ſtones, living members, and ſpiritual houſehold and church, or congregation of Chriſt, who is the living head and huſband. They that are made alive by Chriſt are a living church, have a living head, and are come from the congregations or churches of the dead in Adam, where death and deſtruction talk of God, and of his prophets and apoſtles, in their wiſdom that is below, earthly, and deviliſh, in the knowledge that is brutiſh, and in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that comes to nought. For what they know is natural, by their natural tongues, arts, and ſciences, in which they corrupt themſelves. This is the ſtate of the
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:037441_0888_100D9462695B8640"/>dead in Adam; but the quickened, that are made alive by Chriſt, diſcern between the living and the dead.</p>

                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>NOAH and his family were called into the ark, before the old world was deſtroyed with the flood. And all the faithful generation, that lived before, were taken away, and died in the faith, before that flood of deſtruction came upon the wicked old world.</p>
                        <p>The Lord did call Lot out of Sodom, before he did deſtroy and conſume it, and the wicked there.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſaid; <q>It cannot be, that a prophet periſh out of Jeruſalem;</q> and he ſaid; <q>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings! but ye would not,</q> Luke xiii. 33, 34. And he ſaid to the Jews; "Therefore alſo ſaid the wiſdom of God, <q>I will ſend them prophets and apoſtles, and ſome of them they ſhall ſlay and perſecute; that the blood of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which was ſhed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; from the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, which periſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the altar and the temple. Verily, I ſay unto you, it ſhall be required of this generation,</q> Luke xi. 49, 50, 51. And he ſaid to the Jews, <q>Behold, your houſes ſhall be left unto you deſolate,</q> Matth. xxiii. 34, &amp;c. Chriſt told his diſciples, that the temple at Jeruſalem ſhould be thrown down, and there ſhould not be one ſtone left upon another, that ſhould not be thrown down, Matth. xxiv. 2. Alſo, that he muſt go to Jeruſalem, and <q>ſuffer many things of the Jews, elders, and chief prieſts, and be killed, and raiſed again the third day,</q> Matth. xvi. 21. And Chriſt ſaid, <q>When ye ſhall ſee Jeruſalem compaſſed with armies, then know, the deſolation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is nigh.</q> He foretold, that the Jews ſhould fall by the edge of the ſword, and ſhould be led away <q>captive into
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:037441_0889_100D9464039F2B78"/>all nations; and Jeruſalem ſhould be trodden down of the Gentiles,</q> Luke xxi. 20, 24. Here you may ſee how Jeruſalem was often warned by Chriſt, and how often he would have "gathered them, but they would not," be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſcattered over or into all nations, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes left deſolate, and their temple and Jeruſalem beſieged with armies, deſtroyed, and thrown down. And though the diſciples and apoſtles of Chriſt did meet, with the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and church at Jeruſalem, after Chriſt was riſen, yet Euſebius reporteth in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, that the Chriſtians at Jeruſalem had a viſion, or a revelation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of Jeruſalem. Being forewarned alſo by Chriſt, that <q>when they ſhould ſee Jeruſalem compaſſed with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, its deſolation was nigh; and that the temple ſhould be thrown down, and not one ſtone left upon another;</q> it is ſaid, the Chriſtians did depart out of bloody Jeruſalem, before it and the temple were deſtroyed by Titus the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who beſieged it with his armies. He was of the Gentiles, and deſtroyed the temple and Jeruſalem, as Chriſt had foreſpoken to his diſciples, becauſe of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the Jews, and the innocent blood that they had ſhed in it. So the Lord called his people out of bloody Jeruſalem, before he deſtroyed it. And it is ſaid, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus deſtroyed the temple and Jeruſalem about two-and-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after Chriſt was crucified and riſen again, and that with ſo great a deſtruction, that the Jews never did build again the city of Jeruſalem, nor the temple (as Sodom was never built again, nor the cities of the old world). But the Jews for above theſe thouſand years have been, and are a ſcattered people in all nations to this day; and Chriſt (whom they crucified) and his doctrine is preached, and ſet over them: and the Gentiles, whom they hated, have received and do receive him and his doctrine, and praiſe God for it through Jeſus Chriſt, Amen.</p>

                        <p>John ſaith, he heard a voice, ſaying; <q>Come out of her, my people (to wit, out of Babylon, the falſe church) that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: for her ſins have reached to
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:037441_0890_100D94675FCF0930"/>heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities,</q> Rev. xviii. 4, 5. Here ye may ſee, that God did call his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of ſpiritual Babylon before he deſtroyed her, and caſt her down, to be utterly burnt with fire, ver. 8, 9, and 21.</p>
                        <p>Was not Nebuchadnezzar's empire thrown down and ended by Cyrus and Darius, who were of the ſeed of the Medes, before Cyrus and Darius gave forth their procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for all the Jews to go into their own land out of Babylon's captivity? and was there not a prophecy of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <q>That he ſhould ſubdue nations, and that the Lord would looſe the loins of kings before him, and break in pieces the gates of braſs, and cut in ſunder the bars of iron, and open the two-leaved gates; and that the gates ſhould not be ſhut?</q> And the Lord ſaid; <q>This is for Jacob, my ſervant's ſake, and for Iſrael mine elect,</q> Iſa. xlv. Was not this fulfilled in Cyrus's and Darius's time? For did not then the Jews go out of captivity into their own land? Ezra i. 2, 3, 4, and chap. vi. 1. and 12. and Iſa. xliv. 28. and xlv. 13. Was not this prophecy of Iſaiah fulfilled, when the children of Iſrael came out of Babylon? Were not the Aſſyrians, that carried away the ten tribes ſubdued? and the Babylonians, that carried away the two tribes, were they not ſubdued in the days of Cyrus and Darius, in whoſe days the <q>loins of kings were looſed, and the two-leaved gates of braſs and iron were opened?</q> and had not Iſrael and Jacob their liberty by them in their days, to go into their own Land?</p>
                        <p>And here in England, was it not obſerved, that moſt of the honeſt and ſober people were turned out of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and their commiſſions, offices, and places taken from them, becauſe they could not join with others in their cruelty and perſecuting? and others laid down their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions themſelves, and came out from amongſt thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, before they were overthrown, and brought to confuſion. All that are wiſe, ſee theſe things, and learn by ſuch examples and way-marks to ſhun ſuch bogs.

While I was at Kingſton, one day meditating on the things of God, ſome particular obſervations aroſe in my mind concerning the firſt, and the 'ſecond or laſt Adam. As that—</p>
                  <p>The firſt man Adam was made on the ſixth day of the week; and Chriſt, the ſecond Adam, was crucified on the ſixth day of the Week.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Adam was betrayed by the ſerpent in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden: Chriſt our Saviour, the ſecond Adam, was betrayed by Judas in a garden near Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt aroſe from the dead on the firſt-day of the week; and they that do believe on him are entered into Chriſt their reſt: the chriſtians meet together to worſhip God on the firſt day of the week; and on the firſt day of the week it was, that God ſaid, <q>Let there be light, and there was light.</q> The Jews reft was on the ſeventh day of the week, which was given to them as a ſign of the eternal reſt of the Lord, ſanctifying them, after they came out of the land of Egypt: for before that time the Lord had not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to man and woman his outward Sabbath-day to keep, neither in the old world, nor after in Abraham's time, nor in Iſaac's, nor in Jacob's time; until the Jews came out of Egypt to Mount Sinai in the wilderneſs. Then the Lord gave the law, and his Sabbath, as a ſign in the old covenant, of Chriſt the eternal reſt in the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and they that believe do enter into Chriſt their reſt.</p>
                  <p>Adam, the firſt man, is the root from whence we all ſpring naturally: and Chriſt is called the laſt or ſecond Adam, becauſe he is the beginning and root of all that are ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Adam was made a living ſoul: and Chriſt the laſt Adam is a quickening ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt by the grace of God taſted death for every man, that they might all come into favour with God; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs, that <q>Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wrote alſo a paper there, concerning the two ſeeds, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the ſeed wherein the bleſſing is received, from the ſeed which the curſe remains upon. Of which the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is a copy:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>THE Lord ſaid to Abraham, <q>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed,</q> Gen. xxii. 18.
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:037441_0892_100D946B94141360"/>
                           <q>And thy ſeed ſhall be as the ſtars of heaven, and as the ſand which is upon the ſea-ſhore, and as the duſt of the earth, that cannot be numbered,</q> chap. xiii. 16. and xv. 5. and xxii. 17. In this ſeed all nations and families of the earth are bleſſed; but not in the ſeed of evil-doers and of falſehood, nor in the ſeed of adultery and the whore, Iſa. i. 4. and lvii. 3, 4. <q>For the ſeed of the wicked ſhall be cut off, ſaith the Lord,</q> Pſal. xxxvii. 28. The Lord ſaid to David, "That his ſeed ſhould endure for ever," Pſal. lxxxix. 36. And again it is ſaid, Pſal. cii. 28. <q>The children of thy ſervants ſhall continue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee.</q> Here is a diſtinction betwixt the two ſeeds: for the ſeed of evil-doers, of the adulterer, whore, and of the wicked ſhall be cut off; ſo it is not bleſſed. But Chriſt bruiſes the head of the ſerpent and his ſeed, which he ſoweth in them, that diſobey and tranſgreſs God's command, and rebel againſt Gods good Spirit. This wicked ſeed of the ſerpent is curſt, and is an enemy to the ſeed, in whom all are bleſſed. But Chriſt bruiſes the head of this curſed ſeed of enmity, and deſtroys the devil and his works; and in his ſeed are all bleſſed, and all are in unity in this ſeed. All the children of the ſeed are the children of the kingdom of God and Chriſt, and are bleſſed with faithful Abraham. Whoever are of the ſaving, divine, precious faith, are of Abraham, walk in the ſteps of the ſeed and faith of Abraham, and are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, yea, of all nations, and all the families of the earth.</p>
                        <p>The Lord ſaid to Abraham, "Thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerve them; and they ſhall afflict them four hundred years: and that nation, whom they ſhall ſerve, will I judge; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhall they (to wit, Gods ſeed) come out with great ſubſtance," Gen. xv. 13, 14. Here ye may ſee, that which afflicts God's ſeed, he will judge, and did judge; for he did deſtroy the firſt-birth of Pharaoh, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him and his hoſt.</p>
                        <p>An holy man ſaid; "Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a ſeed or remnant, we had been as Sodom," &amp;c. that is deſtroyed. But in the ſeed, which deſtroys the devil and his works, and bruiſes the head of the ſerpent and his ſeed, are all nations and families of the earth bleſſed.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt, according to the fleſh, was of Abraham and of
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:037441_0893_100D946D29CADE28"/>David: for he took not on him the nature of angels, but the ſeed of Abraham; in which ſeed all nations and families of the earth are bleſſed. And ſo they, that are of his ſeed, are of the generation of Chriſt; are <q>fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone.</q>—Now all nations and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth muſt be in this holy ſeed, if they have the bleſſings, and are bleſſed. And, <q>out of the mouth of this ſeed's ſeed ſhall not God's word depart;</q> but ſhall remain and abide in the mouth of this ſeed's ſeed, in which they are bleſſed, Iſa. lix. 21. So it is not the firſt-birth's talking of the words of Chriſt, the ſeed, in whoſe mouth the word of God doth not abide, that makes an outward profeſſion, like the Jews, that did kill and perſecute the prophets, and crucify Chriſt the ſeed and ſubſtance of the law and prophets, which the Jews profeſſed in words, but they denied Chriſt, the ſeed and life. All Chriſtians (ſo called) that profeſs the ſcriptures in words, and are not in the ſeed Chriſt, are in the confuſion, and are like the Jews. So neither Jews nor Chriſtians are bleſſed, except they be in Chriſt, the ſeed of life.</p>
                        <p>But though Chriſt is ſaid to be the ſeed of David, and of Abraham, as his generation is declared by Matthew and Luke; yet Chriſt was not born of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. For he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the ſon of Joſeph, but was the ſon of God. His name was called Jeſus, becauſe he ſhould <q>ſave his people from their ſins;</q> and Emanuel, God with us. Chriſt took not upon him the nature of angels, but the ſeed of Abraham (as I ſaid before) and ſo was made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh, and <q>declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſs, by the reſurrection from the dead,</q> Rom. i. 4. So the generation of Chriſt is a myſtery. Chriſt ſaw his ſeed or word grow up in his diſciples; and <q>Chriſt in you the hope of glory,</q> the apoſtle calls <q>the myſtery, which hath been hid from ages and generations; but now is made manifeſt to the ſaints, or ſanctified ones,</q> Col. i. 26, 27. <q>Whom we preach; warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</q> v. 28. For in Chriſt, the ſecond Adam, all are made perfect and complete; and in Adam in the fall, all are deformed and made imperfect; ſo out of Chriſt all mankind are imperfect and deformed;
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:037441_0894_100D946FC9271038"/>let them paint and dreſs themſelves with the ſheep's cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with the form of godlineſs, of the prophets, Chriſt's and his apoſtles words never ſo much; yet if Chriſt be not in them, they are incomplete, imperfect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, reprobates. But the apoſtle tells the church of Chriſt, <q>Ye are complete in Chriſt, which is the head of all principality and power,</q> Col. ii. 10. (for he hath <q>all power in heaven and earth giver to him,</q> Matth. xxviii. 18.) So all the ſaints are made perfect and complete in Chriſt Jeſus; bleſſed be the Lord God over all for ever, through Jeſus Chriſt, Amen, Amer</p>

                  <p>Quickly after this I returned to London, and continued there a month in the ſervice of the Lord; being daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed either in public meetings, or more particular ſervices relating to the church of Chriſt: as viſiting ſuch as were ſick or afflicted, writing books or papers for the ſpreading of truth, or reſuting of error. As it was a time of general liberty, the Papiſts appeared more open in their worſhip than formerly, and many unſettled people going to view them, a great talk there was of their praying to ſaints, and by beads, &amp;c. whereupon I wrote a ſhort paper concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer; as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>CHRIST Jeſus, when he taught his diſciples to pray, ſaid unto them, <q>When ye pray, ſay; Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,</q> &amp;c. Chriſt doth not ſay, they ſhould pray to Mary, the mother of Chriſt; nor doth he ſay, they ſhould pray to angels, or to ſaints that were dead. Chriſt did not teach them to pray to the dead, nor for the dead. Neither did Chriſt or his apoſtles teach the believers to pray by beads, nor to ſing by outward organs; but the apoſtle ſaid, he would ſing and pray in the ſpirit: for the Spirit itſelf <q>maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; and the Lord, that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth the mind of the ſpirit.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To take counſel of the dead, was forbidden by the law of God; they were to take counſel of the Lord. He hath given Chriſt in the new covenant, in his goſpel-day, to be a counſellor and a leader to all believers in his light. Men are not to run to the dead for the living; for the law
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:037441_0895_100D94720A218950"/>and teſtimony of God forbids it. Thoſe Jews, that refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the running waters of Shiloh, the floods and waters of the Aſſyrians and Babylonians came over them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them into captivity: and they that refuſe the waters of Chriſt are overflowed with the flood of the world, that lieth in wickedneſs. They that aſked counſel of ſtocks and ſtones, were in the ſpirit of error and whoredom; they were "gone a whoring from God," Hoſea iv. 12. And they, that "joined themſelves to Baal-Peor, and ate the ſacrifices of the dead, provoked the Lord's anger, and brought the Lord's diſpleaſure upon them," Pſal. cvi. 28, 29. So here ye may ſee, the ſacrifices of the dead were forbidden. The living know that they ſhall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward: for the memory of them is forgotten, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. ix. 5. "Wo to the rebellious children, ſaith the Lord, that take counſel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my ſpirit, that they may add ſin to ſin," Iſa. xxx. 1.</p>

                  <p>When I had ſtaid about a month in London, I got out of town again: For by reaſon of the many hardſhips I had undergone in impriſonments, and other ſufferings for truth's ſake, my body was grown ſo infirm and weak, that I could not bear the cloſeneſs of the city long together; but was fain to go a little into the country, where I might have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the freſh air.

                              <head>A Diſtinction between the true offering and ſacrifice, and "the falſe, in the old and new covenant.</head>
                              <p>THE Lord ſaith, <q>He that ſacrificeth to any god, ſave unto the Lord only, he ſhall be utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> Exod. xxii. 20. So no god is to be minded, nor ſacrificed to, but the Lord God. It is death to ſacrifice to any other god, ſave the Lord. The Lord ſaith alſo, <q>Thou ſhalt not offer the blood of my ſacrifice with leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened bread,</q> Exod. xxiii. 18. So that ſour heavy leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en muſt not be offered with the Lord's ſacrifice. Again the Lord ſaith; <q>Thou ſhalt not build an altar of hewn

Thereſore have a care of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting the altar with your own tools, you that profeſs to offer the ſpiritual ſacrifice.</p>
                              <p>Jonah ſaid; <q>He would ſacrifice unto the Lord with the voice of thankſgiving,</q> when he was in the ſiſh's belly; and there he prayed unto the Lord, Jonah ii. For Jonah in the whale's belly had no lambs, nor rams, nor outward ſacrifices to offer.</p>
                              <p>The Lord forbids his people to ſacrifice with harlots, Hoſea iv. 14. And the Lord forbids his people to offer ſacrifice of the blind, lame, ſick, or that which was deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or had any blemiſh: as in Mal. i. and many other places. So they that offer ſpiritual ſacrifice, muſt not offer the blind, lame, blemiſhed, or deformed ſacrifice to God.</p>
                              <p>The ſcribe ſaith unto Chriſt, <q>To love God with all the heart, and with all the underſtanding, and with all the ſoul, and with all the ſtrength, and to love his neighbour as himſelf, is more than all whole burnt offerings and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</q> Mark xii. 33. <q>And when Jeſus ſaw, that he anſwered diſcreetly, he ſaid unto him; Thou art not far from the kingdom of God,</q> v. 34. To love God, and their neighbour as themſelves, was more than whole burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings and ſacrifices in the time of the law; thereſore all offerings and ſacrifices in the time of the goſpel, if there be not love to God and to their neighbour as themſelves, avail nothing.</p>
                              <p>David ſaid, <q>Let them ſacrifice a ſacrifice of thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and declare his works with rejoicing,</q> Pſal. cvii. 22. 'Theſe are the ſacrifices that the Lord requires of his people, more than outward ſacrifices. David ſaid, <q>Let my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be ſet forth before thee as incenſe; and the lifting up of mine hands as the evening ſacrifice,</q> Pſal. cxli. 2. Here David looks upon his prayer to the Lord, and the lifting up of his hands to him, to be accepted with the Lord, as much as the outward incenſe, and the outward evening ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Again David ſays, <q>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe,</q> Pſal. li. 17. (See alſo Iſa. lvii. 15. and chap. lxvi. 2.) Theſe are the ſacrifices that David ſaid God would accept, and not deſpiſe; which are beyond the unbroken ſpirit, and uncontrite heart, with outward offerings and ſacrifices.</p>
                              <p>

The adverſaries of the Jews would have joined with them towards the building of the temple, ſaying, <q>Let us build with you, for we ſeek your God, as ye do; and we do ſacrifice unto him.</q> But the Jews refuſed them, and ſaid; <q>Ye have nothing to do with us, to build an houſe unto our God,</q> Ezra iv. 2, 3. Here ye may ſee God's people refuſed their building with them, and their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Solomon ſaith, <q>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</q> Prov. xv. 8. (See alſo Iſa. i. 11. and chap. lxvi. 3.) Solomon alſo ſaith, <q>Better is a dry morſel, and quietneſs therewith, than an houſe full of ſacrifices with ſtrife,</q> Prov. xvii. 1. Now let all people conſider what good your houſe full of ſacrifices doth with ſtrife, when a dry morſel, and quietneſs therewith, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Conſider all people, if ye live in wickedneſs, your ſacrifice is an abomination to the Lord.</p>
                              <p>Again, Solomon ſpeaking of the ſacrifice of fools, ſaith; "They conſider not, that they do evil," Eccleſ. v. 1. Fools are ſuch as do not walk in the Spirit of God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the ſpirit, and end in the fleſh, like the fooliſh Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: for the Spirit of God is the Spirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, and cannot join with the ſacrifices of the dead, nor of the fools, nor of the wicked, whoſe ſacrifice is abominable; who grieve and quench the Spirit of God: by which the ſpiritual and righteous offer up ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                              <p>The apoſtle Paul ſaith, he was the <q>miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt to the Gentiles, miniſtering the goſpel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt,</q> Rom. xv. 16. So ye may ſee, that all the acceptable offerings and ſacrifices to God muſt be ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt. The ſame apoſtle ſaith to the Corinthians; <q>Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God, in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are God's,</q> 1 Cor. vi. 20. And to the Romans, he ſaith; <q>I beſeech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice,</q> Rom. xii. 1. This is the duty of all true Chriſtians.</p>
                              <p>Peter alſo ſaith, in his general epiſtle to the church of Chriſt; <q>Ye alſo, as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al houſe, an holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</q> 1 Pet. ii. 5.

For as Chriſt ſaith, "Every ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt," Mark ix. 49. And in the Old Teſtament ye may ſee, all their outward offerings they were" to ſeaſon with ſalt," Levit. ii. 13. A type and figure of Chriſt, who <q>gave himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God, for a ſweet-ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</q> Epheſ. v. 2. Therefore all his people muſt be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, that they may be ſalted with fire, and every ſacrifice ſalted with ſalt, with the Spirit of grace, that is poured upon all: ſo that they may offer up this ſpiritual ſacrifice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

So ye may ſee, all offerings and ſacrifices are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if there be not an hearkening to the Lord in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and an obeying of his voice. Chriſt told the Jews, who were outward ſacrificers, that he would have mercy and not ſacrifice and bid them <q>go and learn what that meaneth,</q> Matth. ix. 13.</p>

                  <p>By that time the yearly meeting was over, I was very much wearied and ſpent: wherefore about a week after I got out of town to a friend's houſe a little beyond Edmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where, and at South-ſtreet, I abode ſome time, and had meetings amongſt friends there; and at Winchmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill and Berry-ſtreet. Having my mind continually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the things of God, the ſenſe of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy to mankink, in viſiting them, after they had tranſgreſſed and rebelled againſt him, and providing a way and means for their return to him again, was very much upon me; and in the opening of the Spirit of truth, I writ the following paper on that ſubject:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>GOD, who made all men and women, though they have tranſgreſſed his commands and laws, rebelled againſt him, hated his light, grieved his Spirit, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſpitefully againſt his Spirit of grace; yet he who is merciful, would have all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. All that come to the knowledge of the truth, muſt know it in their inward parts; I ſay, the grace and truth, which comes by Jeſus, all that know and find it, know and find it in their hearts. Such find the hidden man of the heart, the pearl, the leaven, the loſt piece of ſilver, and the kingdom of heaven within. For until all come to the light and truth in their hearts, they have been ſtrangers to theſe things, in Adam in the fall, from the image of God, his light, power and ſpirit, and kingdom. But Chriſt, that never fell, brings man and woman again, that follow him, to know theſe things, and to know the truth, him the Saviour, and brings them into his image, and his everlaſting kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The devil, who is out of the truth, tempted man and woman to diſobey God; and ſo drew them into the fall
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:037441_0901_100D947E37A9ADF8"/>from the truth. It is the devil that hath ſtopped men's eyes, ears, and hearts from the truth, who is called the god of the world; who hath blinded the eyes of infidels, or heathen. But Chriſt, who bruiſes the ſerpent's head, and deſtroys the devil and his works, doth open men's hearts, eyes, and ears, who is their Saviour and Redeemer, and giveth life eternal to his people, that obey him and his truth. Bleſſed be the Lord for ever through Jeſus Chriſt, who hath taſted death for all men, to bring them out of the death of Adam; and is a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, and gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified of in due time. For as by Adam's tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and diſobedience death and condemnation came upon all men, ſo by Chriſt's obedience unto death, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life is come upon all men: and <q>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Chriſt hath eternal life; but he that doth not is condemned already.</q> But God would have all men to be ſaved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth, as it is in Jeſus, who is their Saviour; and in him there is no condemnation.</p>

                  <p>After I had been awhile here, I went to a monthly meeting at Enfield, and from thence with ſome friends to Hertford; where I ſtaid three or four days, viſiting friends both at their public meetings on firſt-day, and at their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meetings of men and women: and good ſervice for the Lord I had amongſt them.

Now, what is the means by which God doth draw his people to his Son, but by his holy Spirit, who "poureth out of his Spirit upon all fleſh," that is, all men and women. By this holy Spirit the holy and righteous God doth draw people from their unrighteouſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs to Chriſt, the righteous and holy One, the great Prophet in his New Covenant and New Teſtament, whom Moſes in the Old Covenant and Teſtament ſaid, God would raiſe up like unto him, whom people ſhould <q>hear in all things; and they that would not hear him ſhould be cut off.</q> They that do not hear the Son of God, the great Prophet, do not mind the drawing of the Father by his holy Spirit to his Son; but they that mind the drawings of the good Spirit of the Father to his Son, the Spirit doth give them underſtanding to know God and Jeſus Chriſt, which is eternal life. Then they know that Jeſus Chriſt is the way, the truth, and the life, and that none can come unto God but by and through his Son, who is their ſhepherd to feed them in his paſtures and ſprings of life; and his ſheep know his holy voice, in whom there was no ſin, and in whoſe mouth there was no guile, and an hireling they will not hear, for he careth not for the ſheep: for they are not the hireling's but Chriſt's, who hath laid down his life for his ſheep.

They know that Chriſt is the biſhop of their ſouls, to ſee that they do not go aſtray from God nor 'out of his paſtures of life. They know that Chriſt is their mediator, who makes their peace with God.

                        <p>Peter, in his firſt general epiſtle to the church of Chriſt, ſaith, "As new-born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby," 1 Pet. ii. 2. And he
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:037441_0906_100D948A1B514940"/>tells them they were <q>a choſen generation, a royal prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,</q> that they ſhould <q>ſhew forth the praiſes of him who had called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</q> ver. 9. And that <q>as lively ſtones they were built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</q> ver. 5. Did not theſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born babes, theſe lively ſtones, ſpiritual houſehold, royal prieſthood, holy nation, and choſen generation, who were called out of darkneſs into Chriſt's marvellous light, ſee and enter into his holy kingdom, being heirs of the ſame? who were <q>born again, not of corruptible ſeed but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever,</q> 1 Pet. i. 23. And had not ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance miniſtered to them into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                        <p>James, in his general epiſtle to the church of Chriſt, ſaith, <q>Hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promiſed to them that love him?</q> James ii. 5. The apoſtle Paul ſaith, <q>God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman, &amp;c. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them that were under the law, that we may receive the adoption of ſons; and becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a ſervant but a ſon, and if a ſon then an heir of God through Chriſt,' Gal. iv. 4, 5, 6, 7. The ſame apoſtle ſaith, As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the ſons of God;</q> and tells the ſaints at Rome, <q>Ye have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. The Spirit itſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together,</q> (namely with Chriſt) Rom. viii. 14, 15, 16, 17. Now ſeeing they are the ſons of God that are led by the Spirit of God, and the Spirit beareth witneſs unto their ſpirit that they are the children of God, heirs of God, and joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt, are not all theſe children of God heirs of the righteous glorious kingdom of God? And do they not ſee it and enter into it?</p>
                        <p>The Lord ſaith in Hoſea i. 10. <q>Where it was ſaid unto them, ye are not my people, there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, ye are the ſons of the Living God.</q> Did not
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:037441_0907_100D948CC4D6B560"/>this relate to the goſpel-days of the New Covenant? See Rom. ix. 26. And what the Lord ſaid by the prophet: Jeremiah, chap. xxxi. 1. the apoſtle applies to the goſpel-day, and ſays, <q>Be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaith the Lord Almighty,</q> 2 Cor. vi. 16. Are not theſe the children that ſee and enter into the righteous kingdom of God, that ſeparate from that which is unclean and touch it not?</p>
                        <p>The Lord faith alſo by Iſaiah, <q>I will ſay to the north, give up, and to the ſouth, keep not back; bring my ſons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth,</q> Iſa. xliii. 6. Then doth not he bring them to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory, that ſtands in righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
                        <p>The Lord ſaid to Job, <q>When the morning-ſtars ſang together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy,</q> Job. xxxviii. 7. Where did theſe ſons of God ſhout for joy? Was it not in his kingdom of glory?</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſaith, <q>The leaſt in the kingdom of God is greater than John,</q> Luke vii. 28. And in chap. xvi. 16. he ſays, <q>The law and the prophets were until John; ſince that time (viz. ſince the law and the prophets and John) the kingdom of God is preached, and every man preſſeth into it.</q>

                        <p>Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, <q>Fear not little flock, for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</q> Luke xii. 32. "I appoint to you a kingdom," ſaid Chriſt, "as my Father hath appointed to me." chap. xxii. 29. The Lord ſaid, <q>He that overcometh ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things, and I will be his God and he ſhall be my ſon,</q> Rev. xxi. 7. And John ſaith, <q>I have written unto you, young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and the

                        <p>He ſaid, <q>Wo unto you ſcribes and Phariſees, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, for ye ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men; for ye neither go in yourſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entering to go in,</q> Matt. xxiii. 13. <q>Wo unto you, lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in yourſelves, and them that were entering in ye hindered,</q> Luke xi. 52. Chriſt gives unto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the keys of the kingdom, his Spirit; but the ſcribes, phariſees, and lawyers, great profeſſors, who were erred from the Spirit, like the great profeſſors in our age, that ſcoff at the Spirit, and draw people from the Spirit of God within, theſe ſhut up the kingdom from men, and draw people from the key of knowledge, and the key of the kingdom. <q>For no man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God;</q> for the things of God are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned. The Spirit is the key, by which the kingdom of God and the things of God are revealed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and known, according to 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 13, 14. The apoſtle names ſome in his epiſtle to the Coloſſians, and ſays, <q>Theſe are my fellow-workers unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</q> Col. iv. 11. And he tells that church, that <q>God hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</q> chap. i. 13. So ye may ſee theſe were born again that were tranſlated into the kingdom of Chriſt, and were fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-workers unto the kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt exhorts his diſciples to love and to do good, that they might be the children of their Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Matt. v. 45. He bids them be perfect, even as their Father which is in heaven is perfect, ver. 48. The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſaith to the church at Philippi, <q>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation;</q> amongſt whom ye ſhine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, &amp;c. Phil. ii. 15, 16. And writing to the church of the Theſſalonians, he puts them in mind how he had exhorted them that they would <q>walk worthy of God, who had called them into his kingdom and glory,</q> 1 Theſſ. ii. 12.</p>
                        <p>The Lord had promiſed by the prophet Joel, that he
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:037441_0909_100D94906B32D298"/>would "pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh," and that <q>Sons and daughters ſhould propheſy, old men ſhould dream dreams, and young men ſee viſions,</q> Joel ii. 28. The cauſe that ſons and daughters, hand-maids, ſervants, young men, and old men have not theſe heavenly viſions, dreams, and prophecies, is becauſe they are <q>erred from the Spirit of God,</q> which he poureth upon them; but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are led by the Spirit of God are the ſons of God.</p>
                        <p>John ſaith Chriſt was the true light, "which lighteth every man that cometh into the world," John i. 9. And that <q>as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, ver. 12. which were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God,</q> ver. 13. The reaſon why people do not become the ſons of God, is becauſe they do not receive Chriſt. The Jews, the great profeſſors, who had the promiſes, prophecies, figures, and ſhadows of him, would not receive him when he came. And now the prieſts and high profeſſors of Chriſt are ſo far from receiving the light of Chriſt, and believing in it, that they hate the light and ſcoff at it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it a natural conſcience, and ſome, <q>Jack in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn.</q> Such are not like to become the ſons of God, nor to ſee the glorious kingdom of Chriſt, which ſtands in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. For the light that ſhines in the heart gives the <q>light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus.</q> They that do not receive Chriſt Jeſus, but hate his light (which is the life in him) and yet profeſs him in words, neither know the children of the light, nor true fellowſhip in the light, nor the kingdom of God, that ſtands in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; but by the light they are condemned. <q>And this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that light is come into the world, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved,</q> John iii. 19, 20. But the children of the light, that walk in the light, come to heavenly Jeruſalem, to the city of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, to the innumerable company of angels, and to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, that are written in heaven, and can ſing Hallelujah.</p>

Having been more than a quarter of a year in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I returned to London ſomewhat better in health than ſormerly, having received much benefit by the country air. And it being a time of general liberty and great openneſs amongſt the people, I had much ſervice for the Lord in the city, being almoſt daily at publick meetings, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken up in viſiting friends that were ſick, and in other ſervices of the church. I continued at London about three months; then finding my ſtrength much ſpent with continual labouring in the work of the Lord, and my body much ſtopped for want of freſh air, I went to my ſon Rouſe's by Kingſton, where I abode ſome time, and viſited friends at Kingſton. While I was there, it came upon me to write a paper concerning the Jews, ſhewing, <q>How by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and rebellion they loſt the holy city and land.</q> By which example the profeſſed Chriſtians may ſee what they are to expect, if they continue to diſobey and provoke the Lord. The copy here followeth:</p>

                        <p>THE Lord gave the Jews in the Old Teſtament the land of Canaan, and they built the temple at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to worſhip in. It was called "the Holy temple," and Jeruſalem was called "the Holy City," and Canaan <q>the Holy Land.</q> But when the Jews rebelled againſt the good Spirit which God gave them to inſtruct them, and rebelled againſt his law, and ſet up idols and images, and defiled the land and the city, the Lord ſent his prophets to cry againſt them, to bring them back again to his Spirit, and to his law, and ſo to God, to ſerve and worſhip him, that they might not worſhip images and idols, the works of their own hands. But inſtead of hearkening to God's prophets, they perſecuted them, and at laſt killed his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and perſecuted his apoſtles. But Chriſt told the Jews that both their city and temple ſhould be laid waſte, and they ſhould be ſcattered over all nations; and it was ſo. Titus the Roman Emperor came and took Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and deſtroyed the city and temple, which was a day of vengeance upon the Jews for all their idolatries, thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Jews had never power to get the land ſince, nor to build Jeruſalem nor the temple; but the Turk hath both the land of Canaan and that which is called <q>the City of
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:037441_0911_100D94957620D790"/>Jeruſalem.</q> Now the Turk neither makes images nor worſhips images; ſo it is a juſt hand of the Lord that he ſhould be over the perſecuting, idolatrous Jews, ſo that they cannot defile the land of Canaan now with images and idols, for the Turk hath not, who neither makes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges nor idols, nor worſhips them. The Jews muſt never hope, believe, nor expect, that ever they ſhall go again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of Canaan, to ſet up an outward worſhip at Jeruſalem, and there for their prieſts to offer outward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of rams, ſheep, and heifers, &amp;c. for burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for Chriſt, the one offering, hath offered himſelf once for all, and by this one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified. And Chriſt hath changed the prieſthood of Aaron, that offered ſacrifices, which was made after the power of a carnal commandment; but Chriſt was made after the power of an endleſs life, a prieſt for ever, who was holy, harmleſs, and ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and is a prieſt made higher than the heavens. This is the prieſt that gives power to all that receive him to become the ſons and daughters of God; and Jeruſalem that is above is the mother of all the ſons and daughters of God, which is free; but Jeruſalem that is below is in bondage with her children. They that are the children of Jeruſalem that is above do not look down at Jeruſalem that is below; but they look at Jeruſalem that is above, which is their mother. Chriſt ſaid, <q>Neither at outward Jeruſalem, nor in the mountain of Samaria ſhould God be worſhipped; but God ſhould be worſhipped in Spirit and in truth; for he is a Spirit, and ſuch he ſeeks to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him,</q> John iv. This is the worſhip that Chriſt ſet up above ſixteen hundred years ago; therefore the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Jews muſt never think to offer their outward offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices, nor ſet up their outward worſhip at Jeruſalem, in the holy land of Canaan more. For Chriſt, by the offering up of himſelf once for all, for the ſins of the whole world, hath ended all the Jews offerings, and changed the prieſthood, and the law by which it was made, and hath blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, which commanded both prieſts and offerings, and triumphed over them. So he is the offering and ſacrifice of all the children of the New Teſtament, New Covenant, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly New Jeruſalem that is above. He is their Prophet 'that openeth to them, their Shepherd that ſeeds them, their Biſhop that overſecs them, and Prieſt that died for their

And the water that Chriſt doth give ſhall be in him that drinks it "a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life," John iv. 14. Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <q>Search the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which teſtify of me: And ye will not come to me that ye might have life;</q> John v. 39, 40. Here ye may ſee, the eternal life is to be found in Chriſt, and not in the ſcriptures which teſtify of him, the life. Chriſt's ſheep that hear his voice, know, and follow him; he gives unto them eternal life, and they ſhall not periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of his hand. They ſhall not pluck Chriſt's ſheep, to whom he hath given eternal life, out of his eternal hand. Chriſt ſaid to Martha, "I am
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:037441_0913_100D9499345E4BB8"/>the reſurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead (mark, though he were dead) yet ſhall he live (mark, live though he were dead); and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou this?" Martha ſaid, "Yea, Lord," John xxv. 26. This is the true ſubſtantial belief, which they that believe ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. John ſaith, <q>This is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son,</q> John v. 11. <q>The life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it and bear witneſs, and ſhew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us,</q> 1 John i. 2. So theſe were the believers that had eternal life in the Son of God, and ſhewed it unto others. <q>He that hath the Son hath life,</q> ſaith John, <q>and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life,</q> 1 John v. 12. Chriſt ſaith, <q>Every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's ſake, ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life,</q> Matt. xix. 29. The wicked that do not receive Chriſt ſhall go into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the righteous into everlaſting life. The true ſervants of God have their fruits unto holineſs, and their end is everlaſting life. For <q>the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is everlaſting life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q> Such have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that God's people may endure all things, that they may obtain this ſalvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus, with eternal glory. For Chriſt, being made perfect, became the author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him. This eternal ſalvation is above an external ſalvation; for they come to receive an eternal inheritance, and live in the poſſeſſion of the everlaſting goſpel of joy, comfort, peace, and ſalvation, having everlaſting life in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                        <p>WHEN Chriſt, the ſtone that became a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and filled the whole earth, had broke to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the head of gold, the breaſt of ſilver, the belly of braſs, the legs of iron, and the feet part clay, which were the four monarchies, the Babylonian and Mede, the Grecian, and the Roman, and had ended the outward Jews typical kingdom, Daniel ſaith, <q>In the days of theſe kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdom which ſhall never be deſtroyed,</q> Dan. ii. 44. Chriſt ſaith, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth," Matth. xxviii. 18. And <q>My kingdom is not of this world,</q> John xviii. 36. <q>Chriſt is the image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, the firſt-born of every creature; for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt,</q> Col. xv. 16, 17. Here Ye may ſee all things conſiſt by Jeſus Chriſt, and all things were created by Chriſt and for him, whether they be things in heaven or things in earth, viſible or inviſible; yea thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, theſe were all created by him and for him. Chriſt is <q>King of kings and Lord of lords,</q> Rev. xix. 16. The <q>Prince of the kings of the earth,</q> Chap. i. 5. Out of his mouth goes a ſharp ſword, with which he ſhall ſmite the nations, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron; as the veſſel of a potter ſhall they be daſhed in pieces who do not obey him, the "King of kings and Lord of lords." This is Chriſt, who ſaith, <q>I am Alpha and Omega, the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the Ending, the Firſt and the Laſt;</q> ſo he is over all nations, and above them all. We muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this rod of iron, by which Chriſt doth rule the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is a figurative ſpeech of Chriſt who is aſcended into heaven, and is at the right hand of God. All power in heaven and earth is given unto him, and all things were created by him and for him: ſo then they are Chriſt's, and he hath power over all things; for all are his. So, as the ſcripture ſaith, <q>By me kings reign and princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree juſtice,</q> Prov. viii. 15. But if they abuſe his power and do not do juſtice, as is decreed by Chriſt, the <q>King of kings and Lord of lords, the Firſt and the Laſt,</q> they muſt ſeel the weight of his rod of iron, by which he will rule ſuch as abuſe his power. That is decreed by him,
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:037441_0915_100D949F1C7B1788"/>who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him, and rules in the kingdoms of men.</p>

                  <p>Several other things I wrote while I was at Kingſton for my ſpirit being continually exerciſed towards God, I had many precious openings of divine matters; and divers places of ſcripture, both in the Old Teſtament and in the New, relating to the ſtate of regeneration and ſanctification, &amp;c. were brought to my remembrance by the Holy Spirit; ſome of which I committed to writing, as followeth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>THEY that touched the dead were unclean, and were to be cleanſed by the water of purification, Numb. xix. And they which touch the dead doctrines or faiths, and let them in, burden the pure, defile and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unclean, until the ſpring of the water of the Word do ariſe and waſh and clean them; for all the dead in Adam in the fall are unclean, and they muſt be waſhed by Chriſt, in his blood and water of life, who quickeneth and makes alive.</p>
                        <p>A dwarf might not come near to offer upon God's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; but he might eat of the holy bread, that he might grow, Lev. xxi. 20, &amp;c. So the new-born babes may eat of the milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby and increaſe. He that had any blemiſh might not come near to offer upon God's altar; neither might any thing be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon God's altar that had any blemiſh, or was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Lev. xxi. And it is ſaid, <q>The ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the judgment, nor ſinners in the congregation of the righteous,</q> Pſa. i. 5. But God ſtandeth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the mighty, Pſal. lxxxii. 1.</p>
                        <p>The camp of God was to be kept clean and holy. That which was unclean, or defiled, was to be kept out of God's camp in the Old Teſtament. And in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all that is defiled and unclean muſt be kept out of God's kingdom, the new and heavenly Jeruſalem that is from above. All was to paſs through the fire (even of thoſe things that would bear the fire) and to be purified by ſire and water, before the people might come into God's camp, Numb. xxxi. So all muſt be circumciſed, and baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and fire, cleanſed with
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:037441_0916_100D953C9E3C14F0"/>the blood of Chriſt, and waſhed with the water of the Word, before they come into the kingdom of God, into heavenly Jeruſalem.</p>
                        <p>The apoſtle Paul ſaith, <q>We know that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earneſtly deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe which is from heaven, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life,</q> 2 Cor. v. 1, 2, 4. Here is "[WE in the earthly houſe of this tabernacle;"] which [WE] are they that have received Chriſt, are become the ſons of God, new creatures, and children of the light, that believe in Chriſt's light; who have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal houſe in the heavens, where mortality is ſwallowed up of life, in which houſe from heaven they will not groan.</p>
                        <p>Peter ſaid, <q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to ſtir you up by putting you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, even as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me,</q> 2 Pet. i. 13, 14. Peter knew he muſt put off this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle ſhortly: but as long as he was in it, he did ſtir up the ſaints to their duty in holineſs, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it after he was deceaſed.</p>
                        <p>Paul ſaith, "The firſt man is of the earth, earthly." (mark, earthly) 1 Cor. xv. 47. <q>And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we ſhall alſo bear the image of the heavenly,</q> (mark, the heavenly) ver. 49. And <q>we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels,</q> &amp;c. 2 Cor. iv. 7. "And I live," ſaid he, "yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me," Gal. ii. 20. who is the life of all God's people.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <q>That the dead are raiſed, even Moſes ſhewed at the buſh, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; for he is not the God of the dead, but of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for all live unto him,</q> Luke xx. 37, 38. So <q>none of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's. For to this end Chriſt both died and roſe, that he might be Lord both of the dead and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</q> Rom. xiv. 7, 8, 9. For all died in Adam: and Chriſt by the grace of God taſted death for every man, that they might come out of the death in Adam to the eternal life in Jeſus Chriſt: who is alſo a quickening ſpirit; for
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:037441_0917_100D7FB2B960A8E0"/>as in Adam all died, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. So Chriſt that died and roſe again, is Lord both of the living and of the dead; for the living live to the Lord, and die in him, and are bleſſed.</p>
                        <p>All Chriſtendom ſay, that they believe in God and in Chriſt, and that they believe Moſes and the prophets, and preach Chriſt, Moſes, and the prophets; ſo their words and writings are preached and printed, and ye ſay ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. But what life do ye live? Are ye through the law dead to the law, that ye may live unto God? Are ye crucified with Chriſt? Doth Chriſt live in you? Is the life that ye now live in the fleſh by the faith of the Son of God, and ye do not live, but Chriſt liveth in you, who gave himſelf for you? Is this your preſent life? for "the juſt live by the faith" which Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of; by which holy, divine, precious faith they have victory over that which is vile, unholy, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and in this faith they pleaſe God, and have acceſs to God and his Son, who fulfilleth the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. For the law and the prophets were until John, and ſince that the kingdom of God hath been preached, and men preſs into it; and the leaſt in the kingdom of God is greater than John, though he was the greateſt prophet born of a woman. See whether ye are in the kingdom that ſtands in peace and righteouſneſs and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, or not. Chriſt, the image of the inviſible God, the firſt-born of every creature, was before any creature; for by him were all things created that are in heaven and in the earth, viſible or inviſible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, <q>all things were created by him and for him, and he was before all things, and by him all things conſiſt: and he is the head of the body, the church, and is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead.</q> Here ye may ſee that all things were made by Chriſt Jeſus, and all things were created for Chriſt Jeſus, and by him all things conſiſt and have their being, who is the firſt-born from the dead, and dieth no more. It pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell, and by Chriſt to reconcile all things unto himſelf, whether they be things in heaven or things in the earth. "In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge," who is the head of all principality and power; for <q>all power in heaven and earth is given to him,</q> the firſt-born of every creature, and the firſt-born from the dead, who
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:037441_0918_100D7FB573130ED8"/>liveth for evermore in his power over all, the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world. While the world's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit rules in men's hearts, they do not know Chriſt, nor the beginning nor ending of the work of God. Chriſt was outwardly crucified and ſlain without the gates of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem by the diſobedient Jews; and they that hate the light of Chriſt, diſobey his goſpel, quench his Spirit, and are erred from his faith, "crucify to themſelves Chriſt afreſh." So Adam and Eve, and their children that diſobeyed God, did ſlay the Lamb; the blind Jews, that diſobeyed God, crucified Chriſt Jeſus; and the outward Chriſtians, that live and walk not in Chriſt, but in ſin and evil, though they make an outward profeſſion of Chriſt, yet crucify to themſelves Chriſt afreſh. As to Chriſt himſelf, he is <q>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended far above all principalities, thrones, powers, and dominions;</q> ſo that they cannot put him to death, or crucify him any more, as to himſelf: but what the killers, crucifiers, and perſecutors do now upon the earth, is againſt Chriſt in themſelves, and in his members; as Chriſt ſaid to Saul, "Why perſecuteſt thou me?" Acts ix. 4. For what is done to his members, Chriſt takes as done to himſelf, Matth. xxv. 40, and 45. And they that did not viſit Chriſt, but perſecuted him in his members, perſecuted Chriſt in themſelves firſt.</p>
                        <p>The ſerpent, that enemy to man and woman, the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyer, the god of the world, and prince of the air, that ruleth in the hearts of the diſobedient, got in by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But Chriſt bruiſes his head, breaketh his power to pieces, and deſtroys the devil and his works; and through death deſtroys death, and the devil, the power of death. So Chriſt, the light and life, hath all power in heaven and earth; and openeth the priſon doors, and the eyes of the blind, and takes captive him that hath led into captivity, and gives gifts unto men. So Chriſt bindeth the ſtrong man of ſin, and ſpoils his goods, and caſts him out; Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah! For the ſtrong man of ſin is the god of the world, and his houſe is that whole world that lieth in wickedneſs. And this God of the world hath kept his houſe, and his goods have been in peace: until a ſtronger than he come, and binds, and caſts him out: and then deſtroys him and his goods. So Chriſt, the Son of God, who is ſtronger than the devil, having deſtroyed the devil and his works, ſetteth up his own houſe. All believers in the light are the children of light, are of the Son of God's ſpiritual
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:037441_0919_100D94A0AD40FDD0"/>houſe, and the Son of God is over his houſe for evermore: glory to God in the higheſt, through Jeſus Chriſt, Amen!</p>
                        <p>God ſpake by the mouth of his holy prophets concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt Jeſus, his Son, the holy One: ſo they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and not unholy, that God ſpake by. All that name the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are to depart from iniquity.</p>

                  <p>I returned to London towards the latter end of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth month 1687, viſiting friends in the way at Chiſwick and Hammerſmith, where I had two meetings, one upon a feaſt-day, and the other on occaſion of a marriage; at which were many people of other denominations, amongſt whom I had a very ſeaſonable opportunity of opening the way of truth.</p>
                  <p>Being come to London, I viſited meetings in and about the city, as the Lord led me! in whoſe ſervice I continued labouring till the middle of the firſt-month 1687-8. At which time I went towards Enfield, and viſited friends there and thereabouts, and at Barnet, Waltham-Abbey, and other places; where I had many meetings, and very good ſervice, in which I ſpent ſeveral weeks. I then returned to London, where I continued labouring in the work of the goſpel till after the yearly meeting, which this year was about the beginning of the fourth month. A precious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was. A very refreſhing ſeaſon friends had together, the Lord vouchſaſing to honour our aſſemblies with his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious preſence in a very plentiful manner. At the concluſion of the meeting I felt a concern upon my ſpirit to give forth the following paper, to be diſperſed amongſt friends.</p>

Let your light ſo ſhine, that people may ſee your good works, and glorify your Father, which is in heaven. For a good tree bringeth forth good fruit; therefore be ye trees of righteouſneſs, the planting of the Lord, having fruits unto holineſs; and then your end will be everlaſting life. Such are the wells and ciſterns that hold the living
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:037441_0920_100D94A25B91A1E8"/>water, which ſprings up in them to eternal life.

Now is the time to labour, while it is day (yea, the day of Chriſt) to ſtir up every one's pure mind, the gift of God that is in them; and to improve your talents, that Chriſt hath afforded you, that ye may profit; and to walk every one according to the meaſure that Chriſt hath given you; for <q>the manifeſtation of the Spirit of God is given to every one to profit withal.</q> Conſider what you have profited in ſpiritual and heavenly things, with the heavenly Spirit of God. Be not like the wicked and ſlothful, that hid his talent; from whom it was taken, and he caſt into utter darkneſs. A dwarf, or one that had any blemiſh, was not to come nigh to offer upon God's altar; therefore mind the word of wiſdom, to keep you out of that which will corrupt and blemiſh you; and that ye may grow in grace, in faith, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and feeding upon the milk of the word, may grow by it, that ye may not be dwarfs; and ſo offer your ſpiritual ſacrifice upon God's holy altar. For the field or vineyard of the ſlothful grows over with thorns and nettles, and his walls go down. Such are they that are not diligent in the Spirit of God, and the power, which is the wall, a ſure fence. The Spirit of God wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Be ye new and heavenly Jeruſalem's children; for new and heavenly Jeruſalem, that is above, is the mother of all the children of light, that are born of the Spirit.

And now all heavenly Jeruſalem's and Sion's children, that are from above, labour in the goſpel, the power of God, the ſeed in which all nations, and all the families of the earth are bleſſed; which ſeed, Chriſt, bruiſes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head, deſtroys the devil and his works, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the whore, the falſe church, the beaſt, and the falſe prophet. He takes away the curſe, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations, and over all the families of the earth, and brings the bleſſing upon all (if they will receive it) ſaying, <q>In thy ſeed ſhall all nations and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth be bleſſed.</q> This is the goſpel of God preached to Abraham, before Moſes wrote his five books; and was preached in the apoſtles days, and is now preached again; which brings life and immortality to light; and is the goſpel of peace, life, and ſalvation to every one that believes it. So all nations, all the families of the earth muſt be in Chriſt, the ſeed, if they be bleſſed, and be partakers of the bleſſing in the ſeed. This goſpel was revealed by Chriſt to his apoſtles, who preached it; which is not of man, nor from man. Now, God and Chriſt hath revealed the ſame goſpel unto me, and many others in this age (I ſay the goſpel, and the ſeed, in which all nations and families of the earth are bleſſed;) in which goſpel I have laboured, and do labour, that all may come into this bleſſed ſeed, Chriſt, who bruiſes the head of the ſerpent, that in it they might have peace with God. This everlaſting goſpel is preached again to them that dwell upon the earth; and they that believe it, and receive it, receive the bleſſing, the peace, joy, and comfort of it, the ſtability in it, and the life and immortality which it brings to light in them and to them. Such can praiſe the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God in his everlaſting goſpel.</p>
                        <p>And friends, all ſeek the peace and good of all in Chriſt: for truth makes no Cains, Corahs, Balaams, nor Judaſſes; for they come to be ſuch, that go out of the peaceable truth.

                  <p>Some time after the yearly meeting I went to my ſon Mead's in Eſſex, and abode ſome weeks; often viſiting friends meetings near, and ſometimes at Barking. After I had been awhile there, I went to viſit friends at Waltham-Abbey, Hodſdon, Enfield, South-ſtreet, Ford-Green, and
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:037441_0922_100D94A746061188"/>Winchmore-hill; where I had ſeveral very ſerviceable meetings; the Lord opening many deep and weighty things through me, for the informing the underſtandings of inquirers, and building up thoſe that were gathered into the truth, and eſtabliſhing them therein.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh month I returned to London, having been near three months in the country for my health's ſake, which was very much impaired; ſo that I was hardly able to ſtay in a meeting the whole time, and often after a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was fain to lie down upon a bed. Yet did not my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body take me off from the ſervice of the Lord; but I continued to labour in and out of meetings in the work of the Lord, as he gave me opportunity and ability.</p>
                  <p>I had not been long in London, before a great weight came upon me, and a ſight the Lord gave me of the great buſtles and troubles, revolution and change, which ſoon after came to paſs.

For the Word of God was before the world, and all things were made by it: it is a tried Word, which gave God's people in all ages wiſdom, power, and patience. Therefore let your dwelling and walking be in Chriſt Jeſus, who is called the Word of God; and in his power, which is over all. Set your affections on things that are above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God (mark) on thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſits; not thoſe things that are below, which will change and paſs away. Bleſſed be the Lord God, who by his eternal arm and power hath gathered a people to himſelf, and hath preſerved his faithful to himſelf through many troubles, trials, and temptations: his power and ſeed, Chriſt, is over all, and in him ye have life and peace with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in him all ſtand, and ſee your ſalvation, who is firſt and laſt, and the Amen. God Almighty preſerve and keep you all in him, your ark and ſanctuary; for in him you are ſafe over all floods, ſtorms, and tempeſts: for he was before they were: and will be when they are all gone.</p>

                  <p>About this time great exerciſe and weights came upon me (as had uſually done before great revolutions and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of government) and my ſtrength departed from me; ſo that I reeled, and was ready to fall as I went along the ſtreets; and at length I could not go abroad at all, I was ſo weak for a pretty while; till I felt the power of the Lord to ſpring over all, and had received an aſſurance from him, that he would preſerve his faithful people to himſelf through all.</p>
                  <p>In the time that I kept within, I wrote a paper, ſhewing; <q>Moſes, as a ſervant, was faithful in all his houſe, in the Old Teſtament; and Chriſt, as a Son, is over his houſe, in the New Teſtament.</q>

                        <p>THE houſe of Iſrael was called God's vineyard, in Iſa. v. 7. and all the Iſraelites were called the houſe of Iſrael. Iſrael ſignifies, <q>a prince with God, and a prevailer with men,</q> Gen. xxxii. 28. When Peter preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:037441_0924_100D94AB51BEBD68"/>Chriſt to the houſe of Iſrael, he ſaid; <q>Let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made the ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt,</q> Acts ii. 36. So they were all called the houſe of Iſrael. And it is ſaid, <q>Moſes was faithful in all his houſe (to wit, this houſe of Iſrael) as a ſervant; for a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after: but Chriſt, as a ſon, over his own houſe; which houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end,</q> Hebr. iii. 5. 6. Here it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that Moſes was faithful in all his houſe, as a ſervant, viz. in the houſe of Iſrael, in the Old Teſtament: but Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, is over his houſe in his New Teſtament and covenant; and all his true believers are of his houſe. The apoſtle tells the Epheſians (who were a church of Chriſt) they were <q>fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſehold of God,</q> Eph. ii. 19. And the ſaints are called "the houſehold of faith," Gal. vi. 10. Peter, in his general epiſtle, tells the church of Chriſt, they were <q>a choſen generation, a royal prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,</q> 1 Pet. ii. 9. And that as lively ſtones, they were built up <q>a ſpiritual houſe, an holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</q> ver. 5. The apoſtle ſaith to the church of Chriſt at Corinth; <q>If our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have 3 build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</q> 2 Cor. v. 1. And Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples; <q>Let not your hearts be troubled: ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me. In my Father's houſe are many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; (a manſion is a dwelling or abiding-place) if it were not ſo, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo,</q> John xiv. 1, 2, 3. The Pſalmiſt ſaith; <q>Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God: they ſhall bring forth fruit in old age; they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing,</q> Pſal. xcii. 13, 14. Again; <q>Holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thine houſe, O Lord, for ever,</q> Pſal. xciii. 5. Iſaiah alſo ſaid by way of prophecy; <q>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, that the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hills, and all nations ſhall flow
<pb n="409" facs="unknown:037441_0925_100D94ADD5F936B0"/>unto it,</q> Iſa. ii. 2. Is not that a great houſe? Is not this mountain Chriſt, who is over his houſe in the New Teſtament and new covenant? To this mountain and houſe all the children of the New Teſtament or new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant flow in theſe latter days; ſo that it is come to paſs, which was propheſied of by Iſaiah. For he ſaid; <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people ſhall go and ſay, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion ſhall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem. And he ſhall judge among the nations, and ſhall rebuke many people; and they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more. O houſe of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord,</q> ver. 3, 4, 5. Here ye may ſee, they that come to the mountain of the houſe of God, and to God's teaching, they muſt walk in the light of the Lord; yea, the houſe of Jacob. Jacob ſignifies a ſupplanter: he ſupplanted profane Eſau, who is hated, and Jacob is loved. Now theſe two births muſt be known within: they that walk in the light of the Lord, and come to Chriſt, the mountain of the houſe of the Lord, eſtabliſhed above all mountains and hills, break their ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: and in Chriſt, this mountain and houſe of the Lord, there are no ſpears nor ſwords to hurt one another withal. Chriſt, the Son of God, is over his houſe and great family, the children of the light, that believe in it, and walk in it, the children of the day of Chriſt, his holy and royal prieſthood, that offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice to God by him. All ſuch are of Chriſt's (the ſpiritual man's) houſe; who are born of God, and led by his Spirit: they are of the Lord of lords, and King of kings houſe and family, which he is over; and are of the houſehold of the holy, divine, pure, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith, which Chriſt is the author and finiſher of. And they that be of the Son's houſe, are pure, righteous, and holy, and can do nothing againſt the truth, but for it, in their words, lives, and converſations; and ſo are a choſen generation, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that they ſhould ſhew forth the praiſe of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light. Theſe are Chriſt's lively ſtones, that build up a ſpiritual houſe,
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:037441_0926_100D94AFD0F92F30"/>which he (Chriſt, the ſpiritual Man, the King of kings, and Lord of lords) is over.</p>

                  <p>Some time after this, my body continuing weak, I went with my ſon Mead to his houſe in Eſſex; where I ſtaid ſome weeks. In which time I writ many things relating to the ſervice of truth, ſome were printed ſoon after; others were ſpread abroad in manuſcript; and amongſt other things, a few lines to this purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THAT, while men are contending for thrones here below, Chriſt is on his throne, and all his holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are about him, who is the beginning and the ending, the firſt and laſt, over all. And that the Lord will make way and room for himſelf, and for them that are born of his Spirit, which are heavenly Jeruſalem's children, to come home to their free mother.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few words alſo I writ concerning the world's teachers, and the emptineſs of their teaching. Which were thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>DOTH not that which is called Chriſtendom live in talking of Chriſt's, of the apoſtles, and prophets words, and the letter of the Scriptures? And do not their prieſts miniſter the letter, with their own conceptions thereupon, for money, though the holy Scriptures were freely given forth from God, Chriſt, the prophets, and apoſtles? Yet the apoſtle ſaith, <q>The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,</q> 2 Cor. iii. 6. The miniſters of the New Teſtament are not miniſters of the letter, but of the Spirit, and they ſow to the Spirit, and of the Spirit reap life eternal. But people's ſpending time about old authors, and talking of them, and of the outward letter, doth not feed their ſouls. For talking of victuals and clothes doth not clothe the body, nor feed it. No more are their ſouls and ſpirits fed and clothed, except they have the bread and water of life from heaven to feed them, and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to clothe them. Talking of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things and ſpiritual things, and not poſſeſſing them, may ſtarve both their bodies and their ſouls. Therefore
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:037441_0927_100D94B21016AAE8"/>quench not the ſpirit of God, which will lead to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in all things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this I writ another ſhort paper, ſhewing, <q>The hurt they did, and the danger they run into, who turned people from the inward manifeſtation of Chriſt in the heart.</q>

They that did ſo, or that cauſed the blind to wander, were curſed in the old covenant, Deut. xxvii. 17. In the new covenant the apoſtle ſaith; <q>Let him be accurſed that preacheth any other goſpel, than that which he had preached,</q> Gal. i. 8. The goſpel that he preached was <q>the power of God unto ſalvation, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,</q> Rom. i. 16.

So they are curſed that cauſe the blind to wander out of their way, and remove them from their heavenly land-mark.</p>

And by the hand and power of the Lord, he and Aaron his brother brought them out of Egypt, a land of anguiſh, bondage, darkneſs, and perplexity. And Moſes kept the Lord's people, or ſheep, forty years in the wilderneſs: a meek ſhepherd of God he was, and kept his great flock of ſheep; though ſome of them were ſcabbed with the leproſy of contention and murmuring, and were deſtroyed in the wilderneſs.</p>
                        <p>David (though he afterwards came to be a king) was a keeper of his father's ſheep in the wilderneſs, 1 Sam. xvii. 15. 28.

                        <p>Eliſha was a plowman, 1 Kings xix. 19. He was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the plow, to teach God's people, the children of Iſrael, to plow up the fallow-ground of their hearts, that they might bring forth ſeed and fruits to God their Creator.</p>

Chriſt likewiſe called James and John his brother, when they were in a ſhip, with Zebedee their father, <q>mending their nets; and they immediately left the ſhip, and their father, and followed him,</q> ver. 21. 22. He gave them power (a net that will hold, and not want mending) and made them fiſhers of men, to fiſh them out of the great ſea, the world of wickedneſs. We read, when Peter, Thomas, Nathaniel, the ſons of Zebedee, and other diſciples went a fiſhing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that night caught nothing, in the morning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus appeared, and ſaid, <q>Caſt the net on the right ſide of the ſhip, and ye ſhall find.</q> They did ſo, and catched ſo great a multitude, they were not able to draw them to the ſhore.

For Chriſt, who hath all power in heaven and in earth given unto him, ruleth in the kingdoms of men: and he, who doth inherit the heathen, and poſſeſs the utmoſt parts of the earth with his divine power and light, rules all nations with his rod of iron, and "daſhes them to pieces like a potter's veſſels," the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of diſhonour, and the leaky veſſels that will not hold his living water of life; and he doth preſerve his elect veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mercy and honour.

                        <p>WITH my love to thee and thy wife, J. Clauſe, and J. Roeloffs, and all the reſt of friends every where in Chriſt Jeſus, who reigns over all. I am glad to hear friends are well in all thoſe provinces and places every where, except Dantzick, and that you were ſo diligent in ſpreading my papers to the ſtrengthening of friends. I have lately printed the Life of William Caton, but have not made a collection of his books. I think to ſend ſome of them to you, which you may tranſlate and print if you will; they may be ſerviceable among friends, eſpecially them that knew him.</p>
                        <p>Concerning friends at Dantzick, whom the Lord hath ſupported with his eternal arm and power to this day, I hope by the ſame arm and power he will ſupport them, and in it they will feel his bleſſed preſence with them in all their ſufferings; who is over the cruelty of their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, who will hardly let them breathe outwardly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in the common air of their native ſoil. Which ſhews their immorality, inhumanity, and unchriſtianity, and that they want the counſel of a Gamaliel amongſt them; whoſe actions are below the law of God, to <q>do unto others as they would have others do unto them;</q> God will not bleſs the doings of ſuch. However I deſire that friends may mind the Lord's power that is over all, be valiant for his truth, and keep upon their rock and foundation Chriſt Jeſus, that ſtands ſure in the time of the heat of perſecution which is ſo hot upon you, that they will not ſuffer you to have ſo much as your houſes to work and ſleep in, nor to meet nor ſerve God in. The Lord beholds all ſuch actors and their actions. Therefore look over all to him, who is able to deal with them, and reward them according to their works. God Almighty preſerve you all in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom you have reſt, life and peace, Amen.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>Chriſtian Shroder, preſident of the council, Emanuel Dilger, N. Gadecken, and N. Fraterus, deputy of the council, and the reſt of the magiſtrates and prieſts.</p>
                        <p>WE have ſeen your order, and your breathing out perſecution againſt that little flock, the lambs of Chriſt, that live under your juriſdiction in the city of Dantzick, and that you have impriſoned and baniſhed two by the hangman out of the government of your city; and others you threaten to do the ſame to, with great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if they return. Likewiſe you threaten thoſe with puniſhment they rent their houſes of, if they let them have their houſes either to live in, or meet in to ſerve and worſhip the Lord that made them. Truly, I am heartily ſorry for both your magiſtrates and prieſts, that go under the name of Chriſtians, and ſhew ſuch immoral, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, unchriſtian actions, below the royal law of God, which is <q>to do to others as you would have them do unto you.</q> For would you think it was moral, human, or chriſtian, or according to the law of God, if the king of Poland, who is of another religion than you, ſhould baniſh you out of your city by the hangman, and call you murderers of ſouls? Could you ſay but this was according to the law of God, <q>to do unto you as you would have done unto others?</q> If you ſay, you have the ſword, the horn, and the power: bleſſed be the Lord that hath ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened your ſword, your power, and your horn, that it reaches no further than your juriſdiction of Dantzick: and you do not know how long God may ſuffer you to have your horn, your power and your ſword. We are ſure you have not the mind nor Spirit of Chriſt; and the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſaith, <q>They that have not the Spirit of Chriſt are none of his,</q> Rom. viii. And Chriſt bids Peter <q>put up his ſword;</q> they that draw the ſword concerning him, to defend him and his worſhip and faith, ſhould periſh with the ſword. Peter and the apoſtles never drew the outward ſword after, but ſaid, their weapons were ſpiritual not carnal, and they did not wreſtle with fleſh and blood. Chriſt never gave any ſuch command, that they ſhould baniſh any by the hangman, that were not of their religion, nor would not receive it. Are not you worſe than the Turks, who let many religions be in their country, yea
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:037441_0933_100D94BE96C97348"/>Chriſtians, and to meet peaceably? Yea, the Turkiſh patroons let our friends that were captives meet together at Algiers, and ſaid, "It was good ſo to do." You are worſe than thoſe barbarous people at Salee, who do not profeſs Chriſtianity; for you profeſs Chriſt in words, but in works deny him. Did you ever find, either in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or hiſtory, that any perſecutors proſpered long? You are worſe than they are in the Mogul's country, who they ſay permits ſixty religions in his dominions; and many others might be mentioned, which you are worſe than them all in your cruelty and perſecution of God's people only for meeting together in the name of Jeſus, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worſhipping God, their Creator. No, they muſt not breathe in their natural air, neither natural or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in your dominions. I pray, where had you theſe commands from? Neither from Chriſt nor his apoſtles. Do not you profeſs the ſcriptures of the New Teſtament to be your rule? But I pray you, what ſcripture have you for this practice? It is good for you to be humble, to do juſtice, love mercy, call home your baniſhed, and love and cheriſh them; yea, though they were your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you are to obey the command of Chriſt, and love them. I wonder how you and your wives and families can ſleep quietly in your beds, that do ſuch cruel actions, without thinking the "Lord may do to you the ſame!" You cannot be without ſenſe and feeling, except you be given over to reprobation, and your conſciences ſeared with a hot iron. But Chriſtian charity doth hope that you are not all in that ſtate; but that there may be ſome relenting or conſideration of your actions among ſome of you, either according to the law of God or his goſpel.</p>
                        <p>From him that deſires your temporal and eternal good and ſalvation, and not deſtruction, Amen.</p>

Having ſtaid in the country about three weeks, I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to London a little before the yearly meeting, which was in the third month this year, and was a very ſolemn, weighty meeting; the Lord, as formerly, viſiting his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and honouring the aſſembly with his glorious preſence, to the great ſatisfaction and comfort of friends. After the buſineſs of the meeting was over, it was upon me to add a few lines to the epiſtle, which went from the meeting to friends, after this manner:</p>

                           <salute>Dear friends and brethren,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>WHO have known the Lord's eternal arm and power, that hath preſerved you upon the heavenly rock and foundation, and hath built your houſe upon it; you have known many winds, tempeſts, and ſtorms that have riſen out of the ſea, where the beaſt roſe, and many raging ſtorms that have riſen by apoſtates of ſeveral ſorts; but the ſeed that bruiſes the ſerpent's head, and is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's people, ſtands ſure. Dear friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though there be great ſhakings in the world, the Lord's power is over all, and his kingdom cannot be ſhaken. Therefore, all ye children of God, children of the light, and heirs of his kingdom, a joyful, peaceable habitation keep in; keeping out of all the heats, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. and diſputes about things below. <q>Lay hand on no man, nor nothing ſuddenly,</q> leſt they ſhould be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with that which fades, and ſo come to loſs; but mind the Lord's power that keeps open your heavenly eye, to ſee things preſent and to come, and in that ye will ſee and handle the word of life. Dear friends every where, have power over your own ſpirits. As God hath bleſſed you with his outward things, have a care of truſting in them, or falling into difference one with another about theſe outward things that are below, which will paſs away. But all live in the love of God, and in that live in peace with God, and one with another. Follow the works of charity, and overcome the evil with the good to all; for what good have all the tinklers done, with their cymbals and ſounding braſs? They always bred confuſion, and never did good in any age; tinkling with their cymbals, and ſounding with their braſs, to draw out the ſimple to follow them. It is good for all the children of God to keep in their poſſeſſions of life, and in the love of God that is everlaſting. As for all the tumults of the world,
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:037441_0935_100D94C39E4D7DF8"/>and the apoſtates from the truth, the Lord's power is over them all, Chriſt reigns, and the Lord ſaith, <q>No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper,</q> Iſa. liv. 17. Friends, you are not inſenſible how many weapons have been formed againſt us who are ſons and daughters of God, and the Lord hath reſtrained them according to his promiſe; they "have not proſpered." The Lord ſaid, <q>Every tongue that ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt thee, thou ſhalt condemn;</q> ſo God hath given ſuch a power to his children to condemn all the tongues that ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt them, and this is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, "Their righteouſneſs is of me," ſaith the Lord. You are not inſenſible of the many tongues that have riſen up againſt us in judgment, yea of apoſtates and prophane; but in and with the truth, the power of God, according to the promiſe of God, <q>Every tongue that riſeth againſt thee thou ſhalt condemn,</q> It is not one tongue only thou ſhalt condemn; but every tongue that ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt thee thou ſhalt condemn. The Lord giveth this power to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children to judge the evil tongues, and he doth reſtrain the weapons formed againſt them, ſo that they ſhall not proſper againſt his children that he hath begotten. Praiſes and honour be to his holy name for ever! Amen!</p>

And inaſmuch as there had been ſome hurt done in that place, by ſome that were gone out of the unity of friends, it was upon me to write a few lines to that meeting, to <q>exhort them to keep in pure heavenly love, which brings into and keeps in the true unity.</q> Which was thus:</p>

                        <p>Dear friends and brethren in Chriſt Jeſus,</p>
                        <p>WHOM the Lord by his eternal arm and power hath preſerved to this day, all walk in the power and Spirit of God, that is over all, in love and unity; for love overcomes, builds up, and unites all the members of Chriſt to him the Head. Love keeps out of all ſtrife, and is of God. Love, or charity, never fails, but keeps the mind 'above all outward things, and ſtrife about outward things.
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:037441_0936_100D94C5A48384D8"/>It overcomes evil, and caſts out all falſe fears.

The God of love preſerve you all, and eſtabliſh you in Chriſt Jeſus, your life and ſalvation, in whom ye have all peace with God. So walk in him, that ye may be ordered in his peaceable, heavenly wiſdom, to the glory of God, and the comfort one of another, Amen.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>MY deſires are that ye may live and walk in his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth, and ſhew forth that ye are children of the light and of the truth; for the heavenly, gentle, peaceable wiſdom is juſtified of her children. But debate, ſtrife, wilfulneſs, laying open one another's nakedneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is not the practice of heavenly wiſdom's children (but of Ham's) nor from the Spirit of Chriſt; neither ſuch as bite and tear one another; that is from a devouring ſpirit, not the Spirit of Jeſus, which covers that which is uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and can forgive. My friends, you profeſs that truth which is beyond all the world's ways, therefore ſee that you excel them in the heavenly gentle wiſdom, that is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be intreated; for the wiſdom of the world is not eaſy to be intreated, and ſometimes will not be intreated at all. Pray ſee you excel the world in wiſdom, in virtue, in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in love that is over hatred, in meekneſs, humility, ſobriety, civility, and modeſty, in temperance and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in all morality and humanity; which will not act any thing below men nor unmanly. Shew forth true
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:037441_0937_100D94C86E0F0BD0"/>chriſtianity, and that ye are the converted and tranſlated believers in Chriſt, dwelling in the love of God that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, endureth all things, is not puffed up, and envies not. For they that are out of this love of God, and Chriſtian charity, are nothing but as a tinkling cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and as ſounding braſs, and are diſcontented, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and complainers, full of doubts, queſtions, and falſe jealouſies. Keep that ſpirit out of the camp of God: for do not you read in the ſcriptures, both of the New and Old Teſtament, that the end of ſuch was miſery? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the love of God, build up one another; for love edifies the body of Chriſt, and he commands his believers to love enemies, and to love one another; by this they are known to be the diſciples of Chriſt. But to live in envy, ſtrife, and hatred, is a mark that they are no diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt; <q>for he that loveth not his brother abides in death, and whoſoever hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. But they that love the brethren are paſſed from death to life,</q> 1 John iii. 14, 15. And, <q>If a man ſay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen? And this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have we from God, that he who loveth God loves his brother alſo,</q> chap. iv. 20, 21. Therefore <q>love one another;</q> for love is of God, and hatred is of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knows God. All are children of God by creation, therefore in that ſtate they are to love their neighbours as themſelves, and <q>to do unto all men as they would have them do unto them.</q> Secondly, God pouring his Spirit upon all fleſh (or all men and women) all that are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God, heirs of God, and joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt, and are in fellowſhip in the everlaſting goſpel, and in unity in the Spirit, the bond of peace. They that go out of this unity, out of the bond of peace, and do not keep it, break the King of kings peace; but they that keep in the unity and fellowſhip in the Spirit, and walk in the light, have fellowſhip one with another, and with the Father and the Son. It is not every one that talks of the light of the world, of righteouſneſs, of Chriſt, and of God, but he that "doth the will of God." There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my friends, ſtrive to excel one another in love, in virtue, in good life and converſation; and ſtrive all to be
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:037441_0938_100D94CA91F749F8"/>of one mind, heart, and judgment in the Spirit of God; for in Chriſt all are one, and are in peace with him. The Lord God Almighty preſerve you in him, your rock and foundation, that is heavenly and ſtands ſure; that ye may be valiant for the truth upon earth, for the Lord and his glorious name; that ye may all ſerve him in your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in his new creation in Chriſt Jeſus, Amen.</p>
                        <p>And now that you are come into ſo much favour with the magiſtrates and powers, that they let you ſerve the office of a conſtable, &amp;c. without ſwearing or taking any oaths, hereby Chriſt's doctrine and command, and his apoſtle's is ſet up. I therefore deſire that you may double your diligence in your offices, in doing that which is juſt, true, and righteous; ſo that ye may excel and exceed all that are tied or bound by oaths to perform their offices; and you can do it upon your Yea and Nay; ſo ſay and ſo do, according to Chriſt's doctrine and command. For Adam and Eve, by diſobeying the command of God, fell under condemnation; and they that diſobey the command of Chriſt, in taking oaths and ſwearing, go into evil, and fall into condemnation, Mat. v. and James v. My love in the Lord is to you all.</p>

                  <p>I ſtaid at Kingſton till the beginning of the ſeventh month, where not only friends came to viſit me, but ſome conſiderable people of the world, with whom I diſcourſed about the things of God. Then leaving Kingſton, I went to London by water, viſiting friends as I went, and taking Hammerſmith-meeting in my way. Having recovered ſome ſtrength by being in the country, when I was come to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I went from meeting to meeting, labouring diligently in the work of the Lord, and opening the divine myſteries of the heavenly things, as God in his Spirit opened them to me. But I found my body would not long bear the city; wherefore, when I had travelled amongſt friends there about a month, I went to Tottenham-High-Croſs, and from thence to Edward Man's country-houſe near Winchmore-hill and to Enfield; ſpending three weeks amongſt friends thereabouts, and had meetings at all thoſe places. Then, being a little refreſhed in the country, I returned to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; where I tarried, labouring in the work of the miniſtry,
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:037441_0939_100D94CC24B6C9D8"/>till the middle of the ninth month; at which time I went with my ſon Mead to his houſe in Eſſex, and abode there all the winter. During which time I ſtirred not much abroad, unleſs ſometimes to the meeting to which that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily belonged, which was about half a mile from thence; but I had meetings often in the houſe with the family and thoſe friends that came thither. Many things alſo I wrote while I was there, ſome of which follow. One was an epiſtle to the quarterly and yearly meetings of friends in Pennſylvania, New-England, Virginia, Maryland, the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, Carolina, and other plantations in America. Which was thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>My dear friends and brethren in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, WHO, by believing in his light, are become children of his light and of his day; my deſires are, that you may all walk in the light and in the day, and keep the feaſt of Chriſt, our paſſover, who is ſacrificed for us, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs; but let all that be purged out, that ye may be a new lump, keeping the feaſt of Chriſt, our paſſover, with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth. Let no leavened bread be found in your houſes, nor in your meetings, nor in the camp of God, or houſehold of faith, which are the houſehold of Chriſt; but all that ſour, old leaven, which makes people's hearts ſour, and burn one againſt another, muſt be purged out of the camp of God, and kept out. For the feaſt of Chriſt, our paſſover, muſt be kept in the New Covenant with his heavenly unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread of life. The Jews feaſt in the Old Teſtament was kept with outward unleavened bread; and now in the New Teſtament, in the goſpel-day, our feaſt is to be kept with the heavenly unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth. Therefore friends, I deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider, and to keep this feaſt which the apoſtle directed the church of Chriſt to keep. Do not you ſee Chriſtendom, ſo called, keep their feaſts with the leavened bread of malice and wickedneſs? which makes them ſo ſour, and their hearts ſo to burn one againſt another, that they have deſtroyed, and do deſtroy one another about religion. Therefore all live in the love of God, which keeps above the love of the world; ſo that none of your hearts may be choaked or ſurfeited with theſe outward things, or with the cares of the world which will paſs away; but mind ye the world
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:037441_0940_100D94CDD5908200"/>and the life that is without end, that ye may be heirs of it. And, friends, you ſhould ſtrive to excel all, both profeſſor and prophane, in morality, humanity, and Chriſtianity, modeſty, ſobriety, and moderation, and in a good, godly, righteous life and converſation; ſhewing forth the fruits of the Spirit of God and that you are the children of the living God, children of light and of day, and not of the night. And ſerve God in newneſs of life; for it is the life, and a living and walking in the truth, that muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the witneſs of God in all people, <q>that they, ſeeing our good works, may glorify our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q> Therefore be valiant for God's holy pure truth, and ſpread it abroad among both profeſſors and prophane, and the Indians. And you ſhould write over once a year, from all your yearly meetings, to the yearly meeting here, concerning your diligence in the truth, and of its ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of people's receiving it, both profeſſors and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and the Indians; and concerning the peace of the church of Chriſt amongſt yourſelves. For, bleſſed be the Lord, truth doth get ground in theſe parts, many are made very loving to friends, and the Lord's power and ſeed is over all: in which God Almighty keep all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his glory, Amen.</p>

                  <p>While I was in the city I had a concern upon my ſpirit with reſpect to a twofold danger that attended ſome who profeſſed truth; one was of young people's running into the faſhions of the world, and the other was of old people's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the earth. And that concern coming now again weightily upon me, I was moved to give forth the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a reproof to ſuch, and an exhortation and warning to all friends to beware of and keep out of thoſe ſnares.</p>

                        <p>MY deſires are that you walk humbly in it; for when the Lord firſt called me forth, he let me ſee that young people grew up together in vanity and the faſhions of the world, and old people went downwards into the earth, raking it together; and to both theſe I was to be a ſtranger. And now, friends, I do ſee too many young
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:037441_0941_100D94D02A092B60"/>people that profeſs the truth grow up into the faſhions of the world, and too many parents indulge them; and amongſt the elder ſome are declining downwards and rak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the earth. Therefore, take heed that you are not making your graves while you are alive outwardly, and loading yourſelves with thick clay, Hab. ii. 6. For if you have not power over the earthly Spirit, and that which leadeth into a vain mind, and the faſhions of the world, and into the earth; though you have often had the rain fall upon your fields, you will but bring forth thiſtles, briers, and thorn, which are for the fire. Such will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brittle, peeviſh, fretful ſpirits, that will not abide the heavenly doctrine, the admonitions, exhortations, and reproofs of the Holy Ghoſt, or heavenly Spirit of God; which would bring you to be conformable to the death of Chriſt, and to his image, that ye might have fellowſhip with him in his reſurrection. Therefore it is good for all to bow to the name of Jeſus, their Saviour, that all may confeſs him to the glory of God the Father. For I have had a concern upon me, in a ſenſe of the danger of young people's going into the faſhions of the world, and old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's going into the earth, and many going into a looſe and falſe liberty, till at laſt they go quite out into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world as ſome have done. The houſe of ſuch hath been built upon the ſand on the ſea-ſhore, not upon Chriſt the Rock; that are ſo ſoon in the world again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of liberty of conſcience. But it is not a pure conſcience, nor in the Spirit of God, nor in Chriſt Jeſus; for in the liberty in the Spirit there is the unity, which is the bond of peace; and all are one in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom is the true liberty: and this is not of the world, for he is not of the world. Therefore all are to ſtand faſt in him, as they have received him; for in him there is peace, who is the Prince of Peace, but in the world there is trouble. For the ſpirit of the world is a troubleſome ſpirit, but the Spirit of Chriſt is a peaceable Spirit: in which God Almighty preſerve all the faithful, Amen.</p>

                  <p>Another I wrote while I was here concerning the Enſign which Iſaiah propheſied the Lord ſhould ſet up for the
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:037441_0942_100D94D35E179148"/>Gentiles, which I ſhewed was Chriſt. Of which follows a copy:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>THE Lord ſaith, <q>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea,</q> Iſa. xi. 9. <q>And in that day there ſhall be a root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand for an enſign of the people; to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his reſt ſhall be glorious,</q> ver. 10. <q>And he ſhall reign over the Gentiles, and in him ſhall the Gentiles truſt,</q> Rom. xv. 12. This Enſign is Chriſt, who was propheſied of by the prophet; which prophecy the apoſtle, who was a miniſter to the Gentiles, ſheweth was fulfilled in the New Teſtament. In this day of Chriſt, Iſaiah ſaith, <q>The Lord ſhall ſet his hand again the ſecond time to recover the remnant of his people, which ſhall be left, from Aſſyria and from Egypt, &amp;c. And he ſhall ſet up an enſign for the nations, and ſhall aſſemble the outcaſts of Iſrael, and gather together the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed of Judah from the four corners of the earth,</q> ver. 11, 12. This is in the day of Chriſt, and his goſpel of life and ſalvation, which is preached to every creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, who <q>enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,</q> both Jews and Gentiles, that by his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly divine light they may ſee Chriſt, their Enſign and Captain of their ſalvation; ſo Chriſt is one Enſign both to the Jews and Gentiles. Iſaiah ſaith, <q>The Redeemer ſhall come to Sion,</q> &amp;c. Iſa. lix. 20. And, <q>This is my covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee (to wit, Chriſt) and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed's ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever,</q> ver. 21. <q>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee,</q> chap. lxi. 1. "And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light," ver. 3. <q>And the abundance of the ſea ſhall be converted unto three,</q> ver. 5. (the ſea is the world). <q>The Lord ſhall be thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting light,</q> ver. 20. And, <q>Thou ſhalt call thy walls, ſalvation, and thy gates, praiſe,</q> ver. 18. And the Lord ſaith, "I will make the place of my feet glorious," ver. 13. "Heaven is his throne, and earth is his footſtool," chap. lxvi. 1. <q>And he that puts his truſt in me, ſaith the Lord, ſhall poſſeſs the land, and ſhall inherit my holy
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:037441_0943_100D94D4F2AB3B30"/>mountain,</q> chap. lvii. 13. Which mountain is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed above all the mountains and hills, Iſa. ii. 2. The Lord ſaith (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <q>I have put my ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles,</q> Iſa. xlii. 1. <q>I will give thee for a covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs, out of the priſon-houſe. I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to graven images,</q> ver. 6, 7, 8. So Chriſt the Light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and the Gentiles are come to the light of Chriſt. This prophecy of Iſaiah concerning Chriſt, many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles witneſs fulfilled, that <q>ſalvation is come to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</q> Rom. xi. 11. God gave his glory to his ſon; and Chriſt ſaith, <q>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them (namely his believers and followers) that they may be one, even as we are one,</q> John xvii. 22. Here you may ſee the promiſes and prophecies are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath given for an Enſign both to the Jews and Gentiles, and the Captain of their Salvation; and he doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world: that with his heavenly divine light they might ſee Chriſt, the Lord from heaven, their Captain and Enſign, and truſt in him, their Conqueror; who bruiſes the ſerpent's head, and deſtroys the devil and his works: and Chriſt and his followers overcome the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet. Therefore all Jews, Gentiles, and Chriſtians, that come to believe in Chriſt, are to ſtand to their Enſign, Chriſt, who is alſo the Captain of their Salvation, above all enſigns and captains below, for he is from above; therefore all are to truſt in him, for he is certain and able to ſave to the utmoſt. He is the ſame Enſign and Captain to-day as he was yeſterday, and ſo for ever, the Firſt and Laſt, the Beginning and Ending, the Lord of lords, and King of all kings upon the earth; and there is nothing certain to be truſted in below Chriſt Jeſus who is from above. You ſee in the ſcriptures, there were many ways and religions among the heathen, as there were many ſects among the Jews when Chriſt came; and now there are many ſects or religions among the Chriſtians, who believe from the ſcriptures "that he is come," as the Jews believed "he was to come." But they that cloſe their eyes, and ſtop their ears to the light of Chriſt, are
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:037441_0944_100D94D7590B8790"/>not like to ſee Chriſt who hath enlightened them, to be their Enſign and the Captain of their Salvation, that ſee not with the heavenly eye, nor hear with the heavenly ear, to ſee and hear their heavenly Enſign and Captain of their Salvation, to convert and heal them; that they might follow him, and be of his holy camp, his heavenly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to whom he gives ſpiritual arms and armour, the helmet of ſalvation, the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, the armour of light, and the ſhield of faith, (which will quench all the fiery darts of Satan and give victory) and the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God, which ſhall cut, hammer down, and burn up all the ſtrong holds of Satan. Alſo he clotheth his ſoldiers with fine linen, white and clean, his righteouſneſs, and ſhoeth them with the everlaſting goſpel of peace, the power of God; which clothes and ſhoes will never wax old. And all that are ſhod with the everlaſting goſpel, the power of God, will never wax old; but will ſtand all ſtorms and tempeſts in the world. They that are ſhod with the goſpel, the power of God, can in it tread upon ſerpents, vipers, and ſcorpions, and all the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſts upon the earth, and all the thorns, briers, bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, thiſtles, ſharp rocks, and mountains, and never be hurt, nor never wear out their ſhoes; for their feet were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beautiful upon the mountains. Moſes, a captain, the ſervant of the Lord, ſaid unto the people of Iſrael, <q>I have led you forty years in the wilderneſs; your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy ſhoe is not waxen old upon thy foot,</q> Deut. xxix. 5. Here ye may ſee, the Jews in the Old Teſtament, their clothes and their ſhoes did not wax old: but they, who are Chriſt's follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom he ſnoeth with his everlaſting goſpel of peace, and clotheth with his fine linen, his righteouſneſs, and arms with his armour, are clothed, ſhod, and armed, with that which will never decay, wax old, canker, ruſt, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, nor grow blunt. Now all (whether Chriſtians, or Jews, or Gentiles) that hate the light of Chriſt, cloſe their eyes, and ſtop their ears to it, are not like to ſee Chriſt their enſign and captain of their ſalvation, but are blind. As no outward captain would liſt a company of blind and deaf men, and clothe and arm them with outward armmour, to ſuch as are blind and deaf, whoſe eyes are cloſed, and care ſlopped to the heavenly light of Chriſt, he is not like to clothe with his ſine linen, and arm with his heavenly and ſpiritual armour; nor are they like to be ſpiritually
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:037441_0945_100D94D9AA33D540"/>and heavenly diſciplined, and to ſee and know his holy, ſpiritual, living camp, nor to follow him, while they are deaf and blind, and hate his light, which is the life in Chriſt. For it is the light, that ſhines in the heart, which gives the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus; who is the enſign and captain of men's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and who hath brought, and doth bring many ſons unto glory: praiſes, honour, and glory be unto the Lord over all, who liveth for ever, Amen.</p>

                  <p>I ſtaid in town between three weeks and a month, after the yearly meeting, and then went to Tottenham-High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Croſs, where was a meeting on firſt-day, which I was at; and then went to Edward Man's at Ford-Green near Winchmore-Hill: and the firſt-day following to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Enfield; where the Lord gave me many precious openings to declare to the people. Afterwards, moving to and fro amongſt friends thereabouts, I viſited the meetings at Cheſshunt, Waltham-Abbey, Enfield, Tottenham, and Winchmore-Hill frequently; the Lord being with me, and opening many deep and weighty truths, divine and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſteries to his people through me, to their great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and my joy. After ſome time I went to Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, to viſit friends there; and was at their meeting on a firſt-day. And having ſomething more particular upon me to the ancient friends of that place, I had a meeting with
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:037441_0948_100D94DFD896BD20"/>ſome of them the next day, and imparted to them what the Lord had given me for them. Then paſſing to Ware, I made a little ſtay amongſt friends there, and was at their meeting. After which, returning, amongſt friends about Edmonton ſide and Tottenham, and taking meetings as I went, I came back to London in the end of the ſeventh month.</p>
                  <p>I remained at London till the beginning of the ninth month, being continually exerciſed in the work of the Lord, either in publick meetings, opening the way of truth to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and building up and eſtabliſhing friends therein, or in other ſervices relating to the church of God. For the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament now ſitting, and having a bill before them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oaths, and another concerning clandeſtine marriages, ſeveral friends did attend the houſe, to get thoſe bills ſo worded, that they might not be hurtful to friends.

<pb n="433" facs="unknown:037441_0949_100D94E3AAB11B90"/>may reap life everlaſting. Go on in the Spirit, plowing with it in the purifying hope; and threſhing, with the power and Spirit of God, the wheat out of the chaff of corruption, in the ſame hope. For he that looks back from the ſpiritual plow into the world, is not fit for the ſpiritual and everlaſting kingdom of God; and is not like to preſs into it, as the faithful do. Therefore you that are awakened to righteouſneſs, and to the knowledge of the truth, keep yourſelves awakened in it: then the enemy cannot ſow his tares in your field; for truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is over him, and before he was. My deſires are, that all may fulfil their miniſtry, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath committed to them; and then by the blood (or life) and teſtimony of Jeſus you will overcome the enemy that oppoſes it, within and without. All you that preach the truth, do it as it is in Jeſus, in love; and all that are believers in Jeſus, and receivers of him, he gives them power to become the Sons of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt; whom he calleth brethren; and he gives them the water of life, which ſhall be a well in them, ſpringing up to eternal life; that they may water the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual plants of the living God. So that all may be ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual planters, and ſpiritual waterers; and may ſee with the ſpiritual eye the everlaſting, eternal God over all to give the increaſe, who is the inſinite fountain. My deſires are, that you may be kept out of all the beggarly elements of the world, which is below the ſpiritual region, to Chriſt the head; and may hold him, who bruiſeth the head of enmity, and was before it was; that ye may all be united together in love, in your head, Chriſt, and be ordered by his heavenly, gentle, peaceable wiſdom to the glory of God. For all that be in Chriſt, are in love, peace, and unity. In him they are ſtrong, and in a full perſuaſion; and in him, who is the firſt and laſt, they are in a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolution and conſidence for God's everlaſting honour and glory, Amen.</p>

Another epiſtle I wrote ſoon after, more particularly to the friends in the miniſtry, that were gone into America: after this manner.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>DEAR friends and brethren, miniſters, exhorters, and admoniſhers, that are gone into America and the iſlands thereaway. Stir up the gift of God in you, and the pure mind, and improve your talents; that ye may be the light of the world, a city ſet upon an hill, that cannot be hid. Let your light ſhine among the Indians, the Blacks and the Whites; that ye may anſwer the truth in them, and bring them to the ſtandard and enſign, that God hath ſet up, Chriſt Jeſus. For from the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame, God's name ſhall be great among the Gentiles; and in every temple, or ſanctified heart, <q>incenſe ſhall be offered up to God's name.</q> And have ſalt in yourſelves, that ye may be the ſalt of the earth, that ye may ſalt it; that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from corruption and putrefaction: ſo that all ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered up to the Lord may be ſeaſoned, and be a good ſavour to God. All grow in the faith and grace of Chriſt, that ye may not be like dwarfs; for a dwarf ſhall not come near to offer upon God's altar; though he may eat of God's bread, that he may grow by it. And friends, be not negligent, but keep up your Negroes meetings and your family-meetings; and have meeting with the Indian kings, and their councils and ſubjects every where, and with others. Bring them all to the baptizing and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Spirit, by which they may know God, and ſerve and worſhip him. And all take heed of ſitting down in the earth, and having your minds in the earthly things, coveting and ſtriving for the earth: for to be carnally mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brings death, and covetouſneſs is idolatry. There is too much ſtrife and contention about that idol, which makes too many go out of the ſenſe and fear of God; ſo that ſome have loſt morality, humanity; and true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian charity. O therefore, be awakened to righteouſneſs, and keep awakened; for the enemy ſoweth his tares, while men and women ſleep in careleſſneſs and ſecurity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many ſlothful ones go in their filthy rags, and have not the fine linen, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but are ſtraggling, and plowing with their ox and their aſs, in their woollen and linen garments, mixt ſluff feeding upon torn food, and that dieth of itſelf, and drinking of the
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:037441_0951_100D94E782A82D00"/>dregs of their old bottle, and eating the four, leavened bread, which makes their hearts burn one againſt another. But all are to keep the feaſt of Chriſt, our paſſover, with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread of Life from heaven makes all hearts and ſouls glad and joyful, lightſome and cheerful, to ſerve and love God, and to love and ſerve one another in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth, and to keep in the unity of God's Spirit, which is the bond of (the Lord of lords, and the King of kings) peace. In this love and peace God Almighty keep and preſerve all his people, and make them valiant for his truth upon the earth, to ſpread it abroad in doctrine, good life and converſation, Amen.</p>
                        <p>All the members of Chriſt have need one of another. For the foot hath need of the hand, and the hand hath need of the foot: the ear hath need of the eye, and the eye of the ear. So that all the members are ſerviceable in the body which Chriſt is the head of; and the head ſees their ſervice. Therefore let none deſpiſe the leaſt member.</p>
                        <p>Have a care to keep down that greedy earthly mind, that raveneth and coveteth after the riches and things of this world; leſt ye fall into the low region, like the gentiles or heathen, and ſo loſe the kingdom of God that is everlaſting: but ſeek that firſt, and God knows what ye have need of; who takes care for all both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in the earth: thanks be unto God for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gifts, both temporal and ſpiritual!</p>

                  <p>Not long after I returned to London, and was almoſt daily with friends at meetings. When I had been near two weeks in town, the ſenſe of the great hardſhips and ſore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that friends had been and were under in Ireland coming with great weight upon me, I was moved to write the following epiſtle, as a word of conſolation unto them:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>DEAR friends and brethren in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Lord by his eternal arm and power hath upheld through your great ſufferings, exerciſes, trials, and hardſhips (more, I believe, than can be uttered) up and down that nation, which I am very ſenſible of; and the reſt of faithful friends that have been partakers with you
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:037441_0952_100D94E9EF66E728"/>in your ſufferings: who cannot but ſuffer with the Lord's people that ſuffer. My confidence hath been in the Lord, that he would and will ſupport you in all your ſufferings; and that he would preſerve all the faithful in his wiſdom, that they might give no juſt occaſion to one nor other to make them ſuffer; and if you did ſuffer wrongfully or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, that the righteous God would aſſiſt and uphold you; and reward them according to their works, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or wronged you. And now my deſire is unto the Lord, that in the ſame holy and heavenly wiſdom of God ye may all be preſerved to the end of your days, to the glory of God, minding his ſupporting hand and power; who is God All-ſufficient, to ſtrengthen, help, and refreſh in time of need. Let none forget the Lord's mercies and kindneſſes, which endure for ever: but always live in the ſenſe of them. And truly, friends, when I conſider the thing, it is the great mercy of the Lord that ye have not been all ſwallowed up, ſeeing with what ſpirits ye have been compaſſed about. But the Lord carrieth his lambs in his arms, and they are as tender to him as the apple of his eye; and his power is his hedge about his vineyard of heavenly plants. Therefore it is good for all his children to be given up to the Lord with their minds and ſouls, hearts and ſpirits, who is a faithful keeper, that never ſlumbers nor ſleeps; but is able to preſerve and keep you, and to ſave to the utmoſt, and none can hurt ſo much as an hair of your heads, except he ſuffer it, to try you; for he upholds all things in heaven and earth, by the Word of his power: all things were made by Chriſt: and by him all things conſiſt (mark, conſiſt) whether they be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or inviſibles, &amp;c. So he hath power over all; for all power in heaven and earth is given to him: and to you, the have received him, he hath given power to become the ſons and daughters of God; ſo living members of Chriſt, the living head, grafted into him in whom ye have eternal life. Chriſt the Seed reigns, and his power is over all; who bruiſes the ſerpent's head, and deſtroys the devil and his works, and was before he was. So all of you live and walk in Chriſt Jeſus; that nothing may be between you and God, but Chriſt, in whom ye have ſalvation, life, reſt, and peace with God.</p>
                        <p>As for the affairs of truth in this land and abroad, I hear, that in Holland and Germany, and thereaway, friends are in love, unity, and peace: and in Jamaica, Barbadoes,
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:037441_0953_100D94ECA0F86630"/>Nevis, Antigua, Maryland, and New England, I hear nothing, but friends are in unity and peace. The Lord preſerve them all out of the world (in which there is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom there is peace, life, love, and unity, Amen. My love in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to all friends every where in your land, as though I named them.</p>

                  <head>DEATH AND BURIAL.</head>
                  <p>THUS, reader, thou haſt had ſome account of the life and travels, labours, ſufferings, and manifold trials and exerciſes of this holy man of God, from his youth to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the time of his death: Of which himſelf kept a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; whence the foregoing ſheets were tranſcribed. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that an account be added of the time, place, and manner of his death and burial; which was thus:
The next day, after he had written the foregoing epiſtle to friends in Ireland, he went to the meeting at Grace-church-ſtreet, which was large (it being on the firſt-day of the week): and the Lord enabled him to preach the truth fully and effectually, opening many deep and weighty things with great power and clearneſs. After which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayed, and the meeting being ended, he went to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gouldney's (a friend's houſe in White-hart Court, near the meeting-houſe): and ſome friends going with him, he told them, <q>He thought he felt the cold ſtrike to his heart, as he came out of the meeting;</q> yet added, <q>I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear.</q> As ſoon as thoſe friends were withdrawn, he laid down upon a bed ſas he ſometimes uſed to do, through wearineſs after a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but ſoon roſe again; and in a little time laid down again, complaining ſtill of cold. And his ſtrength ſenſibly decaying, he was fain ſoon after to go into the bed; where he lay in much contentment and peace, and very ſenſible to the laſt. And as, in the whole courſe of his life, his ſpirit, in the univerſal love of God, was ſet and bent for the
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:037441_0954_100D94EE347E4350"/>exalting of truth and righteouſneſs, and the making known the way thereof to the nations and people afar off; ſo now, in the time of his outward weakneſs, his mind was intent upon, and wholly taken up with that: and he ſent for ſome particular friends, to whom he expreſſed his mind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the ſpreading friends books, and truth thereby in the world. Divers friends came to viſit him in his illneſs, unto ſome of whom he ſaid, <q>All is well: the Seed of God reigns over all, and over death itſelf. And though,</q> ſaid he, <q>I am weak in body: yet the power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all diſorderly ſpirits.</q> Thus lying in an heavenly frame of mind, his ſpirit wholly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards the Lord, he grew weaker and weaker in his natural ſtrength; and on the third day of that week, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hours of nine and ten in the evening, he quietly departed this life in peace, and ſweetly fell aſleep in the Lord, whoſe bleſſed truth he had livingly and powerfully preached in the meeting but two days before. Thus ended he his day in his faithful teſtimony, in perfect love and unity with his brethren, and in peace and good-will to all men, on the 13th of the 11th month 1690, being then in the 67th year of his age.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 16th of the ſame month (being the ſixth of the week, and the day appointed for his funeral) a very great concourſe of friends, and other people of divers ſorts, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together at the meeting-houſe in White-hart Court near Gracechurch-ſtreet, about the middle time of the day, in order to attend his body to the grave. The meeting was held about two hours with great and heavenly ſolemnity, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly attended with the Lord's bleſſed preſence and glorious power; in which divers living teſtimonies were delivered, from a lively remembrance and ſenſe of the bleſſed miniſtry of this dear and ancient ſervant of the Lord, his early en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the Lord's work at the breaking forth of this goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel day, his innocent life, long and great travels, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labours of love in the everlaſting goſpel, for the turning and gathering many thouſands from darkneſs to the light of Chriſt Jeſus, the foundation of true faith; the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſufferings, afflictions, and oppoſitions, which he met withal for his faithful teſtimony, both from his open adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and from falſe brethren; and his preſervations, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, and dominion in, out of, and over them all, by the power of God: to whom the glory and honour always was by him, and is and always ought to be by all aſcribed.</p>

                     <pb n="439" facs="unknown:037441_0955_100D94F04E6EEA70"/>
After the meeting was ended, his body was borne by friends, and accompanied by very great numbers, to friends burying-ground near Bunhill fields: where, after a ſolemn waiting upon the Lord, and ſeveral living teſtimonies borne, recommending the company to the guidance and protection of that divine Spirit and power, by which this holy man of God had been raiſed up, furniſhed, ſupported and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the end of his day, his body was decently committed to the earth; but his memorial ſhall remain, and be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly bleſſed among the righteous.</p>

                  <p>This for all the children of God every where, who are led by his Spirit, and walk in his light, in which they have life, unity, and fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, and one with another.</p>
                  <p>KEEP all your meetings in the name of the Lord Jeſus, that be gathered in his name by his light, grace, truth, power, and Spirit; by which you will feel his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and refreſhing preſence among you and in you, to your comfort and God's glory.</p>
                  <p>And now friends, all your meetings, both men's and women's, monthly, quarterly, and yearly, &amp;c. were ſet up by the power, Spirit, and wiſdom of God; and in them you know that you have felt his power, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and wiſdom, and bleſſed refreſhing preſence among you, and in you, to his praiſe and glory, and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: ſo that you have been a <q>city ſet on a hill, that cannot be hid.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although many looſe and unruly ſpirits have riſen betimes to oppoſe you and them, in print and other ways, you have ſeen how they have come to nought. The Lord hath blaſted them, brought their deeds to light, and
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:037441_0956_100D94F1E5B3A838"/>made them manifeſt to be trees without fruit, wells with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, wandering ſtars from the firmament of God's power, and raging waves of the ſea, caſting up their mire and dirt; and many of them are like the dog turned to his old vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed, turned again to the mire. This hath been the condition of many, God knoweth, and his people!</p>
                  <p>Therefore all ſtand ſteadfaſt in Chriſt Jeſus your head, in whom you are all one, male and female, and know his government, of the increaſe of whoſe government and peace there ſhall be no end; but there will be an end of the devil's, and of all that are out of Chriſt, who oppoſe it and him, whoſe judgment doth not linger, and their damnation doth not ſlumber. Therefore in God and Chriſt's light, life, Spirit, and power live and walk, that is over all (and the Seed of it) in love, in innocency, and ſimplicity. In righteouſneſs and holineſs dwell, and in his power and Holy Ghoſt, in which God's kingdom doth ſtand. All children of new and heavenly Jeruſalem, that is from above, and is free, with all her holy ſpiritual chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to her keep your eyes.</p>
                  <p>As for this ſpirit of rebellion and oppoſition that hath riſen formerly and lately, it is out of the kingdom of God and heavenly Jeruſalem; and is for judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, with all its books, words, and works.

In which Seed you have joy and peace with God, and power and authority to judge it; and your unity is in the power and Spirit of God, that doth judge it: all God's witneſſes in his tabernacle go out againſt it, and always have and will.</p>
                  <p>Let no man live to ſelf, but to the Lord, as they will die in him; and ſeek the peace of the church of Chriſt, and the peace of all men in him: for <q>bleſſed are the peace-makers.</q> Dwell in the pure, peaceable, heavenly wiſdom of God, that is gentle and eaſy to be intreated, that is full of mercy; all ſtriving to be of one mind, heart, ſoul, and judgment in Chriſt, having his mind and Spirit dwelling in you, building up one another in the love of God, which doth edify the body of Chriſt, his church, who is the holy head thereof. Glory to God through Chriſt, in this age and all other ages, who is the Rock and Foundation, the Emmanuel, God with us, Amen.

                  <p>All children of New Jeruſalem, that deſcends from above, the holy city, which the Lord and the Lamb is the light of, and is the temple; in it they are born again of the Spirit: ſo Jeruſalem that is above, is the mother of them that are born of the Spirit. Theſe that come and are come to heavenly Jeruſalem, receive Chriſt; and he giveth them power to become the ſons of God and they are born again of the Spirit: ſo Jeruſalem that is above, is their mother. Such come to heavenly Mount Sion, and the innumerable company of angels, to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect; and to the church of the Living God written in heaven, and have the name of God written upon them. So here is a new mother, that bringeth forth a heavenly and ſpiritual generation.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſchiſm, no diviſion, no contention, nor ſtrife in heavenly Jeruſalem, nor in the body of Chriſt, which is made up of living ſtones, a ſpiritual houſe. Chriſt is not divided, for in him there is peace. Chriſt ſaith, "In me you have peace." And he is from above, and not of this world; but in the world below, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of it there is trouble; therefore keep in Chriſt, and walk in him, Amen.</p>

                     <head>A narrative of the ſpreading of truth, and of the oppoſition from the powers which then were, written by George Fox, in the year 1676.</head>
                     <p>THE truth ſprang up firſt to us, ſo as to be a people to the Lord, in Leiceſterſhire in 1644, in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire in 1645, in Nottinghamſhire in 1646, in Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in 1647, and in the adjacent counties in 1648, 1649, and 1650; in Yorkſhire in 1651, in Lancaſhire and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland in 1652, in Cumberland, Durham, and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland in 1653, in London and moſt of the other parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, in 1654.</p>
                     <p>In 1655 many went beyond ſea, where truth alſo ſprang up, and in 1656 it broke forth in America and many other places.</p>
                     <p>In the authority of this divine truth friends ſtood all the cruelties and ſufferings that were inflicted upon them by the long parliament; to the ſpoiling of goods, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and death, and over all reproaches, lies, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as well as thoſe in Oliver Cromwell's time, and all the acts made by him and his parliament; his ſon Richard after him, and the committee of ſafety; and after withſtood and outlaſted all the acts and proclamations ſince 1660, that the king came in.</p>
                     <p>Friends never feared their acts, priſons, gaols, houſes of correction, baniſhment, nor ſpoiling of goods, nay, nor the loſs of life itſelf; nor was there ever any perſecution that came, but we ſaw in the event in would be productive of good; nor were there ever any priſons that I was in, or ſufferings, but it was for the bringing multitudes out of priſon; though they who impriſoned the truth, and quenched the Spirit in themſelves, would impriſon and quench it without them; ſo that there was a time when ſo many were in priſon, that it became as a bye-word, <q>truth is ſcarce any where to be found but in gaols.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after the king came in, divers friends ſuffered much, becauſe they would not drink his health, and ſay, "God bleſs the king;" ſo that many friends were in danger of their lives from rude perſons, who were ready to run them through with their ſwords for refuſing it, until the king gave forth a proclamation againſt drinking healths;
<pb n="443" facs="unknown:037441_0959_100D94F8CBFC4490"/>for we were and are againſt drinking any healths, and all exceſs, both before his coming in and after; and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the king's good, and that the bleſſing of God might come upon him and all his ſubjects, and all people upon the face of the earth; but we did deſire people not to drink the king's health, but let him have his health, and all people elſe; and to drink for their own health and neceſſity only; for that way of drinking healths, and to exceſs, was not for the king's health <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> their own, nor any others; which exceſs often brought forth quarrelling and deſtroying one another: for they deſtroyed the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and one another; and this was not for the king's wealth, nor health, nor honour, but might grieve him to have the creatures and his ſubjects deſtroyed; and ſo the Lord's power gave us dominion over that alſo, and all our other ſufferings. But,</p>
                     <p>Oh! the number of ſufferers in the commonwealth's and Oliver Cromwel's days, and ſince; eſpecially thoſe who were haled before the courts for not paying tithes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſwear on their juries, not putting off their hats, and for going to meetings on the firſt-days; under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of breaking the ſabbath; and to meetings on other days of the week; who were abuſed both in meetings and on the highways.</p>
                     <p>Oh! how great were the ſufferings we then ſuſtained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe accounts! for ſometimes they would drive friends by droves into the priſon-houſes like penſolds, confine them on the firſt-days, and take their horſes from them, and keep them for pretended breach of their ſabbath, though they would ride in their coaches and upon their fat horſes to the ſteeple-houſes themſelves, and yet puniſh others. And many friends were turned out of their copy-holds and cuſtomary tenements, becauſe in obedience to the command of Chriſt and his apoſtle, they could not ſwear; and as they went to meetings, they have been ſtoned through the ſtreets, and otherwiſe cruelly abuſed. Many were fined with great fines, and lay long in priſon for not putting off their hats, which fines friends could never pay, though they kept them in priſon till they had ſatisfied their own wills, and at laſt turned them out, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter keeping them a year or more in priſon.</p>
                     <p>Many books I gave forth againſt tithes, ſhewing how the prieſthood was changed that took them; and that Chriſt ſent forth his twelve, and afterwards ſeventy diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="444" facs="unknown:037441_0960_100D94FADD279F80"/>ſaying unto them, <q>Freely ye have received, freely give.</q> So all who do not obey the doctrine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt therein, we cannot receive them.</p>
                     <p>I was alſo moved to give forth ſeveral books againſt ſwearing, and that our Yea and Nay might be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an oath, which if we broke, let us ſuffer the ſame puniſhment as they who broke their oaths. And in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica the governor and the aſſembly granted the thing; it is alſo granted in ſome other places; and ſeveral of the parliament-men in England have acknowledged the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs thereof. The magiſtrates, after ſome time, when they ſaw our faithfulneſs in Yea and Nay, they who were moderate, both before and ſince the king came in, would put friends into offices without an oath; but the cruel and envious would fine friends to get money of them, though they could not pay them any.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Lord's power hath carried us through all, and over all, to his everlaſting glory and praiſe; for God's power bath been our hedge, our wall and our keeper (the preſerver of his plants and vineyard) who have not had the magiſtrates ſword and ſtaff to help us, nor ever truſted in the arm of fleſh, but have gone without theſe, or Judas's bag, to preach the word of life, which was in the beginning before they were; which word reconciles to God. And thouſands have received this word of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and are born again of the immortal Seed, by the Word of God; and are feeding upon the milk of the word, which lives and abides for ever.</p>
                     <p>Many have ſuffered death for their teſtimony, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and beyond the ſeas, both before and ſince the king came in; which may be ſeen in an account given to the king and both houſes of parliament; being a brief, plain, and true relation of the late and ſad ſufferings of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in ſcorn called Quakers, for worſhipping and exerciſing a good conſcience towards God and man.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon whereof eighty-nine have ſuffered till death, thirty-two of which died before the king came into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and fifty-ſeven ſince, by hard impriſonment and cruel uſage. Forty-three have died in the city of London and Southwark ſince the Act made againſt meetings, &amp;c. about 1661, of which a more particular account was given, with the names of the ſufferers to the king and parliament, about 1663.</p>
                     <p>And though divers laws were deſigned againſt us, yet
<pb n="445" facs="unknown:037441_0961_100D94FE8BE63420"/>never could any of them juſtly touch us, being wreſted and miſapplied in their execution by our adverſaries, which ſome have been made to confeſs. All thoſe laws that were made, and the oath which they impriſoned us for, becauſe, in obedience to the command of Chriſt Jeſus, we could not ſwear at all, were not originally intended againſt us; and yet we ſuffered by the ſeveral powers, and their laws, both ſpoiling of goods and impriſonment, even to death. And the governor of Dover caſtle, when the king aſked him if he had diſperſed all the ſectaries meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? ſaid, that he had; but the Quakers, the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not; for if he did impriſon them, and break up their meetings, they would meet again; and if he ſhould beat them or knock them down, or kill ſome of them, all was one, they would meet, and not reſiſt again. Thus the Lord's power did ſupport and keep them over their perſecutors, and made them to juſtify our patience and lamb-like nature. This was about 1671.</p>
                     <p>Since the king came in, three acts have been made againſt us, beſides the proclamations, by which many have ſuffered impriſonment and baniſhment, and many to death. And yet for all theſe acts and proclamations, perſecutions, ſufferings, baniſhments, faithful friends are as freſh as ever in the Lord's power, and valiant for his name and truth.</p>
                     <p>Some weak ones there were, when the king came in, who did take the oath; but after they had ſo done, they were ſore troubled for diſobeying the command of Chriſt and the apoſtle, and went to the magiſtrates, condemned themſelves, and offered to go to priſon.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Lord, in his everlaſting power hath been the ſupport and ſtay of his people; and ſtill his Seed reigns, his truth is over all, and exceedingly ſpreads unto this year 1676.</p>

                     <p>HAVE you ſeen and felt the judgments of God upon your city, the Lord ſending lightning from heaven, that deſtroyed and burnt it? As I paſſed through your city on a firſt-day of the week, which you call your ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, I ſaw ſome drinking, ſoldiers playing at ſhuffle-board, and others with their ſhops open, and trading,
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:037441_0962_100D95001FE534F8"/>when they ſhould have been waiting upon God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him; and your people were light and vain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſe of God's judgments, or repentance. O therefore repent, leſt the all-ſeeing God, who ſees all your actions, and is over all, bring ſwift judgment upon you in his wrath, fury, and indignation. Repent, and lay aſide all manner of evil, wickedneſs, ungodlineſs, and unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs: for the day of the Lord will come upon all that do evil, all the workers of iniquity. This mighty day of the Lord will find them all out, and will burn as an oven; burn up all the proud and wicked, and neither leave them root nor branch. Therefore all ye magiſtrates, prieſts, and people, ſearch in yourſelves to find out the cauſe, and what evil you have committed, that has brought the wrath, vengeance, and judgments of God upon you and your city, in burning of it. All return, and come to the light of Chriſt in your hearts, to God's ſpirit, to the grace and truth in your hearts, that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; that with it ye may ſearch your hearts. Do not grieve, nor vex, nor quench God's good Spirit in your hearts; walk not deſpitefully againſt the Spirit of grace, nor turn from it into wantonneſs; and yet make a profeſſion of God and Chriſt in words, when your hearts are afar off, living in pleaſures, and wantonly upon the earth, ſporting your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, killing the juſt, crucifying to yourſelves Chriſt afreſh, and putting him to open ſhame; ſo diſhonouring God. Chriſt, and chriſtianity, yet making a profeſſion and a trade of the ſcriptures; keeping people always learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they may be always paying.</p>
                     <p>Ceaſe from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and look unto the Lord, all ye ends of the earth, and be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Lord God of heaven and earth is come to teach his people himſelf by his light, Spirit, grace, and truth, and to bring them off all the world's teachers. God hath raiſed up Chriſt Jeſus his prophet, whom peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould hear; and ſaith, <q>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him:</q> and Chriſt ſaith, <q>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth, and the life; and no man comes to the Father, but by me.</q> There is no ſalvation by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Jeſus, who ſaith, <q>I am the good Shepherd, and have laid down my life for my ſheep, and my ſheep hear my voice and follow me, and will not follow the hireling:</q> for Chriſt feeds them in the paſtures of life, that will never wither.
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:037441_0963_100D950293DB2910"/>God hath anointed Chriſt Jeſus to preach, if you will hear him; and God hath given Chriſt for a counſellor and a leader, if you will be led and counſelled by him; and God hath given Chriſt for a biſhop to overſee you, and a king to rule you, if you will be overſeen and ruled by him. You that will not have Chriſt to rule over you, who never ſinned, nor was guile found in his mouth, you may read his ſentence in the New Teſtament upon ſuch. Is not Chriſt a ſufficient teacher, whoſe blood was ſhed for you, and taſted death for every man? Doth not Chriſt ſay to his miniſters, "Freely ye have received, freely give?" And the apoſtle ſaith, <q>We covet no man's gold, ſilver, or apparel.</q> They laboured with their hands, and kept the goſpel without charge. Have they that are called mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters amongſt you done the ſame, and kept this command of Chriſt Jeſus? Let them be examined, and examine themſelves. Have you not trimmed your outſides? but look within with the light and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, and ſee if your inſides be not black and foul. For Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world with the life in himſelf, ſaith, <q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light.</q> With the light ye may ſee all the evil and ungodly deeds that ye have committed, all your ungodly words you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and all your ungodly thoughts ye think; that ye may turn from them to Chriſt, from whence the light comes: who is your Saviour and Redeemer, who hath given you a light to ſee your ſin, and that you are dead in Adam; that with the ſame light you may ſee Chriſt, the quickening Spirit, who makes you alive to God, and ſaves you from your ſin. But if you hate the light, which is the life in Chriſt, the Prince of life; and love the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the prince of darkneſs more than the light or the life in Chriſt, becauſe it will reprove you; Chriſt tells you, "This light will be your condemnation," John. iii. Therefore be warned now in your day. While you have time, turn to the Lord. Do not quench the Spirit of the Father, by which he draws to his Son; nor hate the light of Chriſt; for if you do, you hate the life in Chriſt, and ſo remain under condemnation from God and Chriſt with the light, who now ſpeaks to his people by his Son, as he did in the apoſtle's days; the ſame God, that was the ſpeaker by the prophets to the fathers, and ſpeaker to Adam and Eve in paradiſe: and happy had Adam and Eve, and
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:037441_0964_100D95042FFAEDB0"/>the Jews, and all Chriſtians been, if they had kept to this ſpeaker, and not have followed the ſerpent, that falſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his inſtruments. And now God is the true ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by his Son, who bruiſes the head of the ſerpent, the falſe teacher, the head of all falſe ways, falſe prophets, falſe churches, and falſe religions and worſhips. So God in Chriſt is bringing people to the pure undefiled religion, that will keep them from the ſpots of the world, into the new and living way Chriſt Jeſus; and to the Church in God, which Chriſt is the head of, as he was in the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles days; and to worſhip God in the Spirit and truth, which worſhip Chriſt ſet up above ſixteen hundred years ſince. Therefore muſt all people come to the grace and Spirit of truth in their own hearts, to know the God of truth, who is a Spirit, and in the Spirit and truth to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſerve, honour, and glorify the living God, who is over all, and worthy of all, bleſſed for evermore, Amen!</p>
                     <p>Ye magiſtrates and officers, read this in all your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and cauſe all your prieſts to read it in their churches; that they and you, and all people may hear and fear the God of heaven, as you will anſwer it at the great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of judgment, and vengeance of the Lord God Almighty. This is in love to your ſouls, and for your temporal and eternal good.</p>

                     <p>WHERE did ever Chriſt or his apoſtles command any believers or Chriſtians to obſerve holy-days or feaſt-days? Let us ſee where it is written in the New Teſtament, in the four evangeliſts, the epiſtles, or the Revelation, that ever Chriſt or his apoſtles commanded Chriſtians to obſerve the time called Chriſtmas, or a day for Chriſt's birth? or to obſerve the time called Eaſter,
<pb n="449" facs="unknown:037441_0965_100D9507906FDED8"/>or Whitfuntide, or Peter's, Paul's, Mark's, or Luke's, or any other ſaint's day?</p>
                     <p>You, that profeſs yourſelves to be reformed churches from the Papiſts, Jews, and Heathens, and the ſcriptures to be your rule, and are profeſſors of the new covenant, where do you prove out of the New Teſtament, that the apoſtles and the primitive church practiſed or forced any ſuch thing, or that Chriſt and his apoſtles gave any ſuch command to the churches, that they ſhould practiſe and obſerve any ſuch days? Let us ſee where this command is written. Did not the apoſtle ſay to the Galatians in the fourth chapter, <q>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather ye are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye deſire again to be in bondage? Ye obſerve days, and months, and times, and years; I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you labour in vain.</q> And in the third of Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians it is ſaid, <q>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth,</q> &amp;c. And in Galatians the fifth, the apoſtle exhorts them to <q>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free:</q> and moreover ſaid, <q>Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doth not this manifeſt there were ſome teachers that were drawing the church of the Galatians into theſe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly elements, and bringing them again into bondage, in obſerving of days, months, times, and years? It was the apoſtle's work to bring them out of thoſe bondages and beggarly elements; therefore when they were going back again into obſerving days, months, times, and years, he was afraid that he had <q>beſtowed his labour upon them in vain:</q> and he exhorts them to <q>ſtand faſt in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage:</q> and again ſignifies, <q>that they had been once entangled with that yoke of bondage and beggarly elements.</q> But O! how are people, called Chriſtians, ſince the apoſtles days, gone again under this yoke of bondage, and theſe beggarly elements, in obſerving days, months, times, and years, let their practice declare. Nay, do not both Papiſts and Proteſtants force people to obſerve days, months, and times? And therefore is not the apoſtle's labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail beſtowed upon Chriſtendom in vain, which was to bring people from under ſuch beggarly elements and that
<pb n="450" facs="unknown:037441_0966_100D950A18D577B8"/>yoke of bondage (which the law did require) to <q>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage?</q> It was and is Chriſt that hath made and doth make his people free from theſe beggarly elements; therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed are to <q>ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free.</q> This liberty all true Chriſtians are to ſtand faſt in; they are made free by Chriſt, and not by man; for man, without the Spirit and mind of Chriſt, ſeeks to force and compel Chriſt's followers, ſuch as he hath made free from the yoke of bondage, to outward things that the law commanded, to the obſerving of days, months, times, feaſts, and years. From ſuch weak, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly elements, thoſe that know God, or are known of God and Chriſt, are to ſtand faſt in their liberty, and not come under nor be entangled with the yoke of bondage again, ſeeing he hath made them free. For they that are in ſuch things, and would force others to them, are gone from that which gives the knowledge of God, and have not ſtood faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt makes free.</p>
                     <p>Concerning prayer, we do not read that ever Chriſt or his apoſtles did ſeek by force to compel any to faſt or pray with them. But Chriſt taught them how they ſhould pray, and be diſtinct from the hypocrites. His words are as followeth: <q>When thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to ſtand praying in the ſynagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeen of men, &amp;c. But when thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father, that ſeeth in ſecret, will reward thee openly. But when you pray, uſe not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking. Be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye aſk him,</q> &amp;c. As the apoſtles and ſaints did, ſo do we; we pray in ſecret, and we pray in publick, as the ſpirit gives us utterance, which helps our infirmities, as it did the apoſtles and true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: after this manner we pray for ourſelves, and for all men both high and low.</p>
                     <p>Concerning faſting, Chriſt ſaith, <q>Moreover when ye faſt, be not as the hypocrites, of a ſad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to faſt. But when thou faſteſt, anoint thy head, and
<pb n="451" facs="unknown:037441_0967_100D950BAD75DCF8"/>waſh thy face, that thou appear not unto men to faſt, but unto thy Father which is in ſecret; and thy Father, which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may ſee in Iſaiah lviii, what the true faſt the Lord requires is, where it is ſaid to the prophet, <q>Cry aloud, and ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins; yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteouſneſs, and forſook not the ordinance of their God; they aſk of me the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of juſtice, they take delight in approaching to God. Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your faſt ye find pleaſure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs; ye ſhall not faſt as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen? A day for a man to afflict his ſoul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulruſh, and to ſpread ſack-cloth and aſhes under him? Wilt thou call this a faſt, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the faſt that I have choſen, ſaith the Lord; to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</q> So this faſt that the Lord requires, is not to lay yokes, to oppreſs, and lay heavy burdens, and to make faſt the bands of wickedneſs; but to looſe and break ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>Further, Concerning the true faſt the Lord requires, <q>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor, that are caſt out, to thy houſe? When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyſelf from thy own fleſh? (Do you keep this true faſt?) Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thine health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily: and thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee, the glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rereward. Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, Here I am: If thou take away from the midſt of thee the yokes, the putting forth of the finger, and ſpeaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy ſoul to the hungry, and ſatisfy the afflicted ſoul; then ſhall thy light ariſe out of obſcurity, and thy darkneſs be as the noon-day. And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfy thy ſoul in
<pb n="452" facs="unknown:037441_0968_100D950D486619C8"/>drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou ſhalt be like a watered garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fail not,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Here is the practice of the true faſt the Lord requires of his people; and to them that obſerve this faſt, the Lord ſaith, "When they call, he will anſwer." You may ſee what glorious and happy comforts they receive from the Lord, that keep this true faſt; but ſuch as faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſts of wickedneſs, <q>to make their voices to be heard on high, to afflict their ſouls for a day, to bow down their head as a bulruſh, and looſe not the bands of wickedneſs, nor undo every heavy burden, break off every yoke, and let the oppreſſed go free, that does not deal his bread to the hungry, clothe the naked, and bring the poor to his houſe, but hides himſelf from his own fleſh;</q> ſuch faſts and faſters the Lord doth not accept, neither hath he choſen them. Theſe appear to men with their disfigured faces, hanging down their heads as a bulruſh for a day, like the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, to faſt, as Chriſt ſpeaks in Matth. vi.</p>
                     <p>Is it not the command of Chriſt, that in their faſt they ſhould not appear unto men to faſt? And now you, that would force us to ſhut up our ſhops on faſting-days, or for a day, does not this faſt appear to men? and is not this the faſt, that the Lord ſaith in Iſaiah, <q>he doth not accept?</q> for he ſaith, <q>Is this the faſt that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, a day for a man to afflict his ſoul, and bow down his head as a bulruſh,</q> &amp;c. <q>Wilt thou call this a faſt, and an acceptable day to the Lord?.</q> Iſa. lviii.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all God's people are to keep the true faſt of the Lord from debate and ſtrife, and the fiſts of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that <q>faſt that breaks the bands of wickedneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does every heavy burden, breaks every yoke, lets the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free, deals bread to the hungry, clothes the naked, and brings the poor that are caſt out to his own houſe.</q> Every one that keeps this true faſt, their health ſhall grow, and when they call, the Lord will hear them; <q>he will be their guide continually, ſatisfy their ſouls in drought, make their bones fat, and they ſhall be like a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe waters fail not.</q> Now you, that keep not this true faſt, when you call upon the Lord on your own faſting-days, does the Lord anſwer you, and ſay, "Here I am?" Doth the Lord guide you continually? Are your bones made fat
<pb n="453" facs="unknown:037441_0969_100D9510083AC7F0"/>by him, and your ſouls ſatisfied in drought? Are you like a watered garden, and like a ſpring whoſe waters fail not? You that keep not this true faſt, do you not want theſe waters which fail not? ſo your ſouls are not ſatisfied in drought, but your bones are lean, and you hear not the voice of the Lord, who ſaith, "Here I am:" ſo you loſe the heritage of Jacob, and ride not upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places there; but come under. Therefore every man and woman, ſhut your hearts againſt all manner of evil whatſoever, and trade not with Babylon's merchants of confuſion; but keep the ſupernatural day of Chriſt, that is ſprung from on high, that is kept by believing and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the light of Chriſt, and being grafted into him. This will bring you to the true faſt, from ſeeding upon any evil, and to the true praying in the Spirit, as Chriſt and the apoſtles have taught. The fruit of the Spirit is love, &amp;c. The birth of the Spirit is not a perſecuting birth; but he that is born of the fleſh will perſecute him that is born of the Spirit, becauſe he will not follow the birth of the fleſh, with its weak, beggarly elements, that entangles with its yoke of bondage, and its obſerving of days, months, times, faſts, feaſts, and years: which the birth of the Spirit is to ſtand faſt againſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made it free.</p>
                     <p>Do you not know that the Turks keep their ſabbath on the ſixth-day, the Jews upon the ſeventh-day, and the Chriſtians meet together on the firſt-day of the week? And that day, which the Turks keep, the Jews and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſhops are open; and that day the Jews keep, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Turks ſhops are open; and the firſt-days, that the Chriſtians keep, both Jews and Turks ſhops are open? The Turk does not force the Jews nor the Chriſtians to ſhut up their ſhops on their meeting-days, but lets them have their liberty in Turkey. And where do you read that ever the Turks forced any Chriſtians to obſerve any of their holy days, faſts, or feaſts? If not, ſhould not Chriſtians be beyond the Turks in giving liberty to all tender conſciences to ſerve God, ſeeing Chriſt and the apoſtles command not nor force people to obſerve holy days, or times, or months, or years, but ſhould pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Spirit, and faſt always from ſtrife and debate, from all manner of ſin and evil; and that will keep down the fiſt of wickedneſs, and the bond of iniquity? Why ſhould not people of a tender conſcience have their
<pb n="454" facs="unknown:037441_0970_100D95119C9B70C8"/>liberty to exerciſe their conſciences towards God, that they may have a <q>good conſcience always, towards God and man,</q> to perform that which God requires, and <q>to do unto all men as they would have them to do unto them, and to love their neighbours as themſelves;</q> ſeeing ſo many debauched, evil and ſeared conſciences, as with an hot iron, have liberty in their looſe lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in their looſe words, whoſe tongues are at liberty to ſwear and curſe, and their ſpirits at liberty in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uncleanneſs? Let the magiſtrates look and ſee how this evil ſeared conſcience hath its liberty to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in all manner of evil things all Chriſtendom over: which is a great ſhame and diſhonour to God, Chriſt, and Chriſtianity, yea, and humanity. Therefore why ſhould not God's people have liberty to exerciſe their good and tender conſciences towards God and man? The myſtery of faith, which Jeſus Chriſt is the author and finiſher of, is held in a pure conſcience; and ſhould not the work of the true Chriſtian magiſtrate be to encourage the exerciſe of this pure conſcience towards God and man, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the exerciſe of this evil ſeared conſcience that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours both God and Chriſt, and true Chriſtianity? If not, how are they a praiſe to them that do well, and a terror to evil doers?</p>
                     <p>Concerning the not putting off our hats to men. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under the name of Chriſtians, have taken offence at us becauſe we could not put off our hats, and bow down to them; which we find no command from Chriſt or his apoſtles for, but rather to the contrary. For Chriſt ſaith, "I receive not honour of men" (mark, he did not receive honour of men): and further, <q>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that comes from God only?</q> Now Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be a mark of unbelievers, that ſeek <q>honour one of another,</q> and ſeek not that <q>honour that comes from God only;</q> and is not the putting off the hat, and bowing with it, an honour to men, which they ſeek one of another, and are offended if they have it not? Do not the very Turks mock at the Chriſtians in their proverb, ſaying, <q>The Chriſtians ſpend much of their time in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their hats, and ſhewing their bare head to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</q> Should not thoſe be beyond Turks, that bear the noble name of Chriſtian, above ſeeking honour one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and perſecuting them that will not give it, when all
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:037441_0971_100D9513AAF43358"/>true believing Chriſtians ſhould ſeek the honour that comes from God only? which is the duty of all true believers in Chriſt Jeſus, for he would not receive honour of men. And <q>he that believeth on the Son of God, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him,</q> John iii. 36. Is not the Turks proverb a reproach to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who ſay, <q>That the Chriſtians ſpend much of their time in putting off their hats, and ſhewing their bare head one to another?</q> Have you not ſined and impriſoned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe they would not put off their hats to you, and ſhew you their bare heads? In many of your courts they ſhall not have right and juſtice, nor liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in cities or ſtates, though they have truly ſerved their time, and are honeſt and civil men, unleſs they will put off their hats, and ſhew you their bare head? Have you not made a law againſt ſuch, that they muſt forfeit two guilders if they do it not? Do not you ſeek to compel and force them to do it, and fine ſuch as do not, as at Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meer in Waterland? Is not this the honour that you ſeek one of another? Did not the Phariſees and Jews do the ſame?</p>
                     <p>As for your ſaying, <q>The apoſtle commands to honour all men; and ſuch as rule well are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</q> If this "honouring all men" were to put off their hats to all men, and ſhew all men their bare heads, then this command you break yourſelves, for you do not this to all men generally; and if they that rule well, muſt have double hat-honour, then they muſt put off their hats twice, and ſhew them their bare heads. If this hat-honour, and ſhewing the bare head, be an invention of men, and not from God, and ye cannot prove it by ſcripture, yet ſay, "It is your rule,;" then you act beſide the rule, and compel people to act contrary to your rule. For where did ever the prophets, Chriſt, or the apoſtles command any ſuch thing? Let us ſee a command, a practice, and an example for it. Nebuchadnezzar, who was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and caſt the three children of Iſrael into the fire with their hoſe, cloaks, and hats, we do not read that he was offended at them becauſe they did not put off their hats, and ſhew him their bare heads; but becauſe they would not bow to his image. And is it not ſaid in the margin of the bible, where it is ſaid, "Honour all men", <q>Have all men in eſteem?</q> Then they that rule well, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="456" facs="unknown:037441_0972_100D95155C1358F0"/>of double eſteem; and this eſteem muſt be truly in the heart, without any envy, malice, or hatred. As all men are the workmanſhip of God, they are to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart with the Spirit of God; and they that rule well, are worthy of double eſteem: here is true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the heart, both to God and man, his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For people may put off their hats and ſhew their bare heads one to another once, or twice to the officers and magiſtrates, and yet be full of envy, malice, hatred, and murder in their hearts one againſt another; and give them that honour, as you call it, and yet ſpeak or wiſh evil towards them, when they have turned their backs off them. The true honour or eſteem in the heart to all men, as they are God's creation, is without any evil wiſh or thought in the heart to any, and they that rule well have the double eſteem, whom God hath placed over people. There is no evil in the heart that gives this reſpect, eſteem, or honour, and brings them love their neighbours as themſelves, and to <q>do unto all men as they would have them do unto them,</q> in that they eſteem all men, and have a double eſteem for them that rule well. This is beyond all the honour of putting off the hats once to all men, and twice to them that are worthy of the double-honour, as you may call it. But we would aſk Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that practiſe this hat-honour, and ſhewing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their bare heads, Who invented this honour, ſeeing they cannot prove that ever Chriſt or the apoſtles did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or practiſe any ſuch thing, or Moſes in the time of the law? Do not ſay or think that we had this practice of not putting off our hats from the Turk; for we were mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of the Lord, before ever we heard of the Turks proverb and practice, to leave the honour that is below, and ſeek the honour that comes from above, when we came to be true believers in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Concerning perſecuting, impriſoning, and baniſhing God's people, in whom Chriſt is manifeſt, and dwells in their hearts, doth not Chriſt tell you, that in ſo doing you impriſon him? Then do you not baniſh him, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him out of your cities and corporations? And how can you enter into and have a ſhare in his kingdom, though you may profeſs him in words? Are not ſuch to go into everlaſting puniſhment, that do not viſit Chriſt in priſon? Then what will become of you, that baniſh and impriſon him where he is manifeſt in his members, nor ſuffer them
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:037441_0973_100D95177574EFC0"/>to meet together to enjoy him amongſt them, according to his promiſe? Therefore you, that will not let Chriſt reign in his people, and have his liberty in them in your cities and countries, to exerciſe his offices, you will not have your liberty in heaven. You that will not let Chriſt reign in your hearts, nor ſuffer him to reign in his people here upon the earth, in this world, in your kingdoms, you will not reign with Chriſt in heaven, in his kingdom, nor in the world without end.</p>
                     <p>You, that baniſh the truth out of your cities or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or his people for its ſake, you baniſh the truth and Chriſt out of your hearts from ruling there; ſo you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not the temples of God. When you have baniſhed Chriſt and his truth out of your own hearts, you baniſh ſuch, in whom he rules, out of your eſtates and country; then ſee what judgments the Lord doth bring upon you, when you are left to yourſelves; yea, fears and troubles, one judgment after another, comes upon you, till you are even filled with them. But the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſufferers for truth and Chriſt's ſake, have a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble habitation in the truth, which the devil is out of, and cannot get into; which habitation will outlaſt all the habitations of the wicked and perſecutors, though they be never ſo full of words without life and truth. The life and the truth will outlaſt all airy notions; and Chriſt the Lamb and his patient Seed, will overcome the devourer with his impatient ſeed: and they that have the garment, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is the fine linen, will find it to outlaſt all the rags and inventions of men. Chriſt ſaith to his learners, <q>Be of good cheer I have overcome the world, the perſecuting world.</q> He alſo ſaid to his diſciples, <q>Marvel not if that the world hate you, for it hated me before you.</q> Therefore let all that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, lay aſide perſecution about religion, churches or worſhip, faſting or praying days; for you have no command from Chriſt and his apoſtles to perſecute any. Chriſt, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, when they called him a deceiver, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, and ſaid, "He had a devil," did not perſecute any of them for it, nor force or compel any to hear and believe him, nor the apoſtles after him; but he bad them, that would have been plucking up the tares, <q>let the tares and the wheat grow together until the harveſt.</q> So
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:037441_0974_100D9519DB3F7AA8"/>you have no command from Chriſt or his apoſtles to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, impriſon, baniſh, or ſpoil the goods of any for matter of pure conſcience and religion, worſhip, faith, and church in the goſpel-times.</p>

                     <p>YOU have painted and garniſhed the inſide of your outward houſes and high-places; but look within your hearts with the light of Chriſt, which he hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened you and every man that cometh into the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and with it you may ſee how foul your hearts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides are with ſin and evil, which Chriſt tells you ye ſhould make clean; who told the Phariſees how they "painted the ſepulchres of the righteous," and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were full of rottenneſs and corruption. Therefore look into yourſelves and your own hearts, what you are full of. To paint the ſepulchres of the righteous apoſtles, and make a trade and a profeſſion of their words, without the ſame Holy Ghoſt, power, light, and truth which they were in, will not ſtand the day of God's vengeance. Therefore repent while you have time, turn to the Lord with your whole hearts, and do not think yourſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure without a ſenſe of his immediate almighty protection. For it is not all your works, nor all your own ſtrength, power, and defence that can protect you. It is not for you to look at them, and think yourſelves ſecure, and to ſit down in your ſecurity, and let your hearts be merry, and at reſt and eaſe. When the Lord brings a ſcourge upon you, that you are filled with terrors and fears, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you were warned, that you were ſet down, but not in the true reſt. Then all your own ſtrength and force will ſtand you in no ſtead; you will acknowledge that it muſt be God that muſt protect you. Therefore take warning; for your prieſts and people are too high, are ſwallowed up too much in this world. The vanities
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:037441_0975_100D951BE06BE570"/>of it carry your minds away from God; your care is more for the world than for God, and more after the riches of this world than after the riches of the world that has no end. Know you not that all your heaps of outward trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt have an end, and that you muſt leave them all behind you? Therefore I am to warn and adviſe you, both high and low, prieſts and people, to come to the grace, light, and truth that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; to the manifeſtation of the good Spirit of God, which is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you to profit withal; that with this grace, truth, light, and Spirit of Chriſt, you may turn to him from whence it comes, who ſaith, "Learn of me;" and God ſaith, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." So all the children of the new covenant, that walk in the new and living way, do hear Chriſt their prophet, that God has raiſed up, and anointed to be their teacher and prieſt. So now, God doth ſpeak to his people by his Son, as he did in the apoſtles days. The Lord is come to teach his people himſelf by his grace, light, truth, and Spirit, and to bring them off from all the world's teachers, made by men ſince the apoſtles days; who have kept people always learning, that they may always be paying of them. And he is come to bring them off all the world's religions, to the religion that he ſet up in the apoſtles days in the new covenant, which is pure and undefiled before God in his ſight, and keeps from the ſpots of the world, &amp;c. And the Lord is come to bring them off all the world's churches, to the church in God, which Chriſt the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is head of; and to bring them off all the world's worſhips, to worſhip God in Spirit and in truth, which Chriſt ſet up above ſixteen hundred years ſince. So all men and women muſt come to the Spirit and truth in their hearts, by which they muſt know the God of truth, who is a Spirit; and then in the Spirit and truth they will worſhip him, and know what and who they worſhip. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Lord is come to bring his people off all the world's temples, that with the Spirit they may know their bodies to be the temples of the Holy Ghoſt. And the Lord is come to bring his people off all the world's croſſes, pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, images, and likeneſſes; to know that the power of God is the croſs of Chriſt, which cruciſies them to the world, and brings them up into the likeneſs and image of God man and woman were in before they fell; and ſo to
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:037441_0976_100D951DB2521868"/>Chriſt that never fell. This work muſt all know in their hearts by the light of Chriſt Jeſus, who <q>is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</q> It is called the light in man and woman, and the life in Chriſt the Word; who ſaith, <q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light.</q> And the light lets you ſee all your evil actions that you have committed, your ungodly ways you have walked in, and your ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words and thoughts. If you hate this light, and love the darkneſs, and the prince of it, more than this light, which is the life in Chriſt, the Prince of life, and will not come to it, becauſe your deeds be evil, and it will reprove you, Chriſt tells you, "This light is your condemnation." Then what is all your profeſſion good for, when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under the condemnation of the true light, in which you ſhould believe, and ſo become children of light, and out of condemnation? Therefore every one muſt believe in the light, if they receive Chriſt Jeſus; and to as many as receive him, he gives <q>power to become the ſons of God.</q> He that hath the Son of God, hath life; they that have not the Son of God, have not life; and if you have not life, what good doth all your profeſſion of the ſcriptures from Geneſis to Revelations do you, any more than the Jews, Scribes, and Phariſees, that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt the life, upon whom God brought his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge. Therefore do you take heed for your ſtrength will be no better than theirs, if you have not God and Chriſt's ſupporting power, when God's ſcourge comes upon you, and you are filled with horrors and fears. My deſires are, that you may all repent, from the higheſt to the loweſt, and not grieve, nor quench, nor vex, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt God's good Spirit in you, nor <q>walk deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt the Spirit of grace,</q> nor turn from it unto wantonneſs, which would teach you, and bring your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If you do, how can you eſcape the overflowing ſcourge of the Almighty, and the wrath of the Lamb? My deſires are, that you may all obey God's good Spirit of truth, which will lead you out of all evil into all truth, and reprove you for your own righteouſneſs, and for your own judgment and ſin, and bring you to cleave to that which is good, to forſake that which is evil, and to turn to the Lord, who will receive you in his mercy and kindneſs; by which means you may eſcape the overflowing ſcourge in
<pb n="461" facs="unknown:037441_0977_100D952064C7AA28"/>the day of vengeance, which dreadful day is coming upon all evil-doers. This is a warning to you, both for your temporal and eternal good; for you to read in your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and your prieſts in their churches; ſo that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may hear and fear, as you will anſwer it at the terrible and dreadful day of judgment.</p>

Further, the apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Chriſtians to <q>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</q> So this unity, this bond of peace ſhould be kept (and not broken) by all that bear that noble name, Chriſtian. They ſhould keep the unity of the Spirit of Chriſt in the Bond of the Prince of princes, King of kings, and Lord of lords peace, which is the duty of all true Chriſtians. Herein they may honour Chriſt, in bringing forth the fruits of peace, which are love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For the apoſtle tells you, <q>The fruits of the good Spirit are love, joy, and peace, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs,</q> &amp;c. Gal. v.</p>
                     <p>

The apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians, <q>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceable with all men.</q> This ſhould be the endeavour of all Chriſtians. For it is no honour to Chriſt, that Chriſtians ſhould war and deſtroy one another, that profeſs the name of Chriſt, who ſaith, "He came to ſave men's lives, not to deſtroy them." Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have enemies enough abroad without them, and therefore they ſhould love one another, as Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who ſaith, <q>By this ye ſhall be known to be my diſciples, if ye love one another.</q> Chriſtians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love enemies, much more one another. And Chriſt ſaith, <q>As the Father hath loved me, ſo I hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> loved you: continue ye in my love,</q> John xv. 8. <q>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another,</q> John xiii. 35. But if Chriſtians war and deſtroy one another, this will make Jews, Turks, Tartars, and Heathens ſay, you are not diſciples of Chriſt. Therefore, as you love God, and Chriſt, and Chriſtianity, and its peace, all make peace, as far as you have power, among Chriſtians, that you may have the bleſſing. You read, Chriſtians were called the houſehold of faith, the houſehold of God, a holy nation, a peculiar people: and they are commanded to be <q>zealous for good works,</q> not for bad. Chriſtians are alſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to bite and devour one another, leſt they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed one of another.</p>
                     <p>Is it not a ſad thing for Chriſtians to be biting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming one another in the fight of the Turks, Tartars, Jews, and heathens, when they ſhould <q>love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do unto all men as they would have men do unto them?</q> Such devouring work as this will open the mouths of Jews, Turks, Tartars, and heathens to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the name of Chriſt, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, and cauſe them to ſpeak evil of Chriſtianity, for them to ſee how the unity of the Spirit is broken among ſuch as profeſs Chriſt and Chriſt's peace. All Chriſtians are to mind God and Chriſt's teaching, who teach Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to love one another, yea, enemies; and perſuade kings and princes to give liberty to all tender conſciences in matters of religion and worſhip, they living peaceably under every government: ſo that for the time to come there may be no more impriſonment and perſecution among Chriſtians for tender conſciences about matters of
<pb n="463" facs="unknown:037441_0979_100D95247238F6D0"/>faith, worſhip, and religion, that the Jews, Turks, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and heathens may not ſee how Chriſtians are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting one another for religion. Seeing from Chriſt and the apoſtles Chriſtians have no ſuch command, but, on the contrary, to love one another; and knowing that Chriſt ſaid to ſuch as would have been plucking up tares, <q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harveſt (which is the end of the world) leſt they plucked up the wheat;</q> and at the end of the world Chriſt would ſend forth his angels, and they ſhould ſever the wheat from the tares. So Chriſt tells you, it is the angels work at the end of the world, and not men's work before the harveſt at the end of the world. Hath not all this perſecution, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, impriſoning, and putting to death concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, been the pretence of plucking up tares? and hath not all this been before the harveſt, before the end of the world? Have not all theſe been actors againſt the expreſs command of Chriſt, the king of heaven? All kings and rulers, eſpecially thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould obey their Lord and Saviour's command; <q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harveſt;</q> and the harveſt is the end of the world. Alſo Chriſt told ſome of his diſciples, that would have had <q>fire to come down from heaven, to deſtroy ſuch as would not receive him (in their zeal) That they did not know what Spirit they were of:</q> and rebuked them, ſaying, <q>He came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them.</q> Have all ſuch as have deſtroyed men's lives concerning religion, and the worſhip of God, known what ſpirit they have been of? Have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y not done that they ſhould not do? That which Chriſt forbad, who ſaith, <q>Leſt ye ſhould pluck up the wheat with the tares,</q> and ſaith, <q>It is the angels work at the end of the world?</q> Hath not God ſhewed unto man what is good, and his duty, To <q>love mercy, to do juſtly, and to walk humbly with his God?</q> which man is to mind.</p>
                     <p>And the apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to <q>follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</q> Heb. xii. 14. Why ſhould Chriſtians war and ſtrive one with another, ſeeing they all own in words one King, and Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe command is, that they ſhould "love one another;" which is a mark that they ſhall be known by, to be Chriſt's
<pb n="464" facs="unknown:037441_0980_100D95266AF6CB68"/>diſciples, as I ſaid before. And Chriſt, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, ſaith, <q>As I have loved you, ſo love one another,</q> John xv. 12. and John xiii. And the apoſtle ſaith, <q>Chriſtians ought to be patient towards all men,</q> 1 Theſſ. v. 14.</p>
                     <p>From him who is a lover of truth, righteouſneſs, and peace, and deſires your temporal and eternal good; and that in the wiſdom of God, that is pure, gentle, and peaceable from above, you may be ordered, and order all things God hath committed to you to his glory, and ſtop thoſe things among Chriſtians, ſo far as you have power, which diſhonour God, Chriſt, and Chriſtianity!</p>
