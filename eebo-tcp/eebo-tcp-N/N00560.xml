            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME Seasonable Considerations For the good People of CONNECTICUT</head>
            <p>I Remember there was Advice given us in the Year 1689. when we were about to make our Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as 'tis called) and for ought I know it had been good for us that we had taken it. But we are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be àdvised, and so ill affected to any that tell us the Truth, that there is little Encourâgement for any to expose themselves in that kind for the future. The Prophet sayes, <hi>The Prudent shall keep Silence, for it is an evil time:</hi> And the greatest of Prophets hath-said, <hi>Cast not your Pearls before Swi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And I remember it is also said, <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, thou shalt in any wise rebuke him, and not suffer sin upon him.</hi> And me thinks no reasonable Creature should look upon a Perswasion to <hi>Consideration</hi> as if it were evil

Council, or did proceed from ill Will. Therefore I will adventure for my Country-men and Brethrens sake to make one Essay.</p>
            <p>It was said of Old, <hi>Consider, take Advice, and speak your Minds. Temerity</hi> is always evil, <hi>Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> is always good, but sometimes necessary. It is requisite that we be always sober and considerate, but especially when we have to do in things that immediately and deeply concern not our <hi>selves</hi> only, but <hi>GOD</hi> and the <hi>KING</hi> too.</p>
            <p>With relation to God, it is said, <hi>Be not rash with thy Mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God,</hi> Ecles. 5. 2.</p>
            <p>With reference to the King, <hi>Be not hasty to go out of his sight—A Wise Mans Heart discerns both Time and Judgment,</hi> Eccles. 8. 3, 5.</p>
            <p>With reference to our selves, <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established,</hi> Prov. 4. 26.</p>
            <p>Verily, we have cause of Consideration. He is a stranger in <hi>Connecticut</hi> that knows not what hath lately been done there. Let us first reflect, and see what we have done, and then examine and consider it.</p>

After which, Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> making some further Demands in the Spring, 1693. we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to pay him some hundreds of Pounds and to take upon us thé Defence of thé upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> upon this River, belonging to the <hi>Massachusets;</hi> as if these things would satisfie their Majesties Commission.</p>
            <p>This Year (1693.) Their Majesties give a like Commission to his Excellency <hi>Benjamin Fletcher,</hi> Captain General and Governour in chief of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000688_0004_0FA9A2767653B318"/>
Province of <hi>New-York</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> whereby he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted their Majesties Lieutenant and Commander in chief of the Militia, and of all Forces by Seà and Land in their Majesties Collony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and of all Forts and places of Strength within the same.</p>
            <p>But upon Notice hereof the Free-men and Souldiers in the several Towns are convened, to see how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> affected, and what they will contribute towards addressing their Majesties in this behalf. A General Assembly also is called, and meets, and there it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>By these Methods the Free-men of the Corporation, and as many of the People as will fall in with them, are ensnared and strongly pre-engaged to make Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against their Majesties Commission. Insomuch than one Jeers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

shoot him than to shoot a Deer, and can very well find in his heart to spend a brace of Bullets upon him; beside other Flouts. At length the Commission arrives and comes to his Excellency's hands. In pursuance thereof he speedily takes a Journey to <hi>Hartford</hi> in the time of our General Assembly held at <hi>Hartford, October</hi> 12. 1693. and causes his Commission to be publickly reàd in the said General Assembly, and in their Majesties Namé requires and presses Obedience to it, and gives us all reasonable satisfaction and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for that end. In particular, to prevent Mistakes, and in order to a good accomodation, his Excellency leaves his Memorial of his Expectation with us in Writing, desiring our Answer to it in Writing; and then further assures us, <hi>That he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath neither power nor intent to invade our civil Liberties: That in case of our Submission he would commissionate all that were in Commission before, and take our advice for the supply of vacant places:</hi> and particularly, tenders a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to oûr Governor for the command of all the Militia in the Collony, only in subordination to this Their Majesties Commission.</p>
            <p>But what is the Effect of all? Why! the Deputies (divers of them at least) being so prépared, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, are resolved before hand, and have determined the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000688_0006_0FA9A279426D8560"/>
Question before the Court meets; <hi>God hath given them such a Priviledge, and therefore if their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties put such things upon them, they must oppose and hold their own, they are bound in Conscience to do it.</hi> When his Excellency comes to the General Assembly, to publish his Commission, Order is given to the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berteérs, <hi>To admit none but his Excellency and his Retinue;</hi> as if it were not meet that their Majesties Commission should be known to the People, who therefore were kept back, and not admitted without hot bickering, nor till after great part of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was read; and no marvel, the General Assembly themselves not ever-willingly give the Commission the hearing, take no great Notice of his Excellency, wave the business, would bring him to composition, (as they had done by Sir <hi>William Phips</hi>) and will not yeild Obedience to the Commission, but instead thereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>rts, to prevent then Seisure; and it seems (if the common same be true) it is their Opinion, <hi>That their Majesties have nothing to do with us.</hi> Hereupon some will not take Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from his Excellency, others, who otherwise would, are deterred, that they dare not. And for the more common f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt of People, One maliciously slanders and reviles his Excellency, another basely Libils him,

               </gap> to do the same. Such of the Assembly as moved for a Submission, are thought unfit to be Magistrates or Deputies any more: and such of the people as show their Resolution to pày their Allegiance to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties, and yeild Obedience to their Commission, are traduced as <hi>Rogues,</hi> that would undo the Country, and accounted scarce worthy to live.</p>
            <p>His Excellency some-what surprized (as well he might) at this strange carriage of the King's Subjects; his Country-men and prosessed <hi>Christians</hi> &amp; <hi>Protéstants,</hi> and having but six or seven Persons attending on him, thinks it most conducive to their Majesties service to demur a while, hoping that we will bethink our selves, and withal leaves a Proclamation pursuant to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And upon our Governour's Return, his Excellency did demand, whether he had received the same? which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> owned. And thereupon his Excellency required him to give due Obedience thereto. But it is now above a Month since, and yet we have no more of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000688_0008_0FA9A27A3A3E56E0"/>Soon after his Return to <hi>York,</hi> his Excellency saw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

But it is now above a Moneth since thé date of that also, yet we hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of such publication of it, only there is a printed copy or two of it casually come to the sight of some.</p>
            <p>And whereas by the Publicàtion of this their Majesties Commission all former Military Commissions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly determined, Hereupon arose a Question and Doubt, <hi>Whether we had best to muster, and call men to Arms for Military Exercise as formerly?</hi> Yet upon deliberation it is resolved upon, and in divers places Souldiers are commanded to muster, and are trained as confidently às ever; and which is yet more, it is said, that after all this, we have taken upon us to create a Major too. Thus we make all the Defiance to their Majesties and their Commission, Trample them into the very Dirt, and Offend with as high an Hand as is well possible for us to do.</p>

            <p>There are two sorts of people, (as is ùsual in such cases) that are guilty of this Error. Some there are of Factious and Turbulent Spirits, and such as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged by their Male-feazances, or other personal Interests; and these two wittingly err themselves, and out of Design mis-lead others. Others again there are, (and I would hope the most) that àre plain honest minded men, who pinning their faith upon other mens Sleeves, and being deluded by divers Artifices indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously used for that purpose, do think the matter is right, <hi>and if it were not so, surely such and such whom they take to be godly, wise and able men, would never have had a hand in it;</hi> and therefore think they must and ought to follow them, and do as they do. Thus it was in <hi>Absalom's</hi> Rebellion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>With</hi> Absalom <hi>went two hundred Men out of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that were call'd, they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The former sort seem to be Desperate, there is little hope of bringing them to better thoughts: For the latter fort therefore this Essay is chiefly intended.

            <p>I may not undertake to play the Divine, but it concerns every <hi>Christian</hi> to keep a good Conscience. <hi>Conscience</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Apostles of Christ tread in the steps of their Master, and studiously vindicate the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> from this Scandal, by the diligent and fervent pressing of the same Doctrine: so <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 5. <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whosoever therefore resists the Power, resists the Ordinance of God, and they that resist receive to themselves Damnation. Wherefore you must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</hi> How is it then that some of our Deputies say, <hi>They must resist and oppose, they are bound in Conscience to do it?</hi> 'Tis true, a false God is in truth no God: An Idol is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World; so a false usurped pretended

Authority is not of God, and so is in truth no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; 'tis but àn Idol, there is no Obedience due to it; and if the King be such an one, they say something: But all lawful Authority is of God, and be that resists resists God: He that disobeys the King, as King, or exercising his Kingly Office, disobeys God. Hence the true <hi>Christian Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience toward God,</hi> (if we have any) do necessitate us to yeild Obedience to the King and his Ministers. <hi>We must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</hi>

            <p>So, <hi>James</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>If a Man seem to be Religions and bridles not his Tongue, he deceives his own heart, that Man's Religion is vain: pure Religion and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed before God, is to visit the Fatherless and Widdow,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> That is, true Religion draws Righteousness and Mercy (the Duties of the second Table) along with it, and is evidenced by them.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Commànd is the Command of God as well as the rest of the ten, and he that is a Transgressor of thàt is a Transgressor of all: He that said, <hi>Fear God,</hi> hath also said, <hi>Honour the King.</hi> If therefore a man say, he fears God, and yet dishonours the King, he deceives his own heart, he should not believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for his fear of God is vain.</p>

So the Duties of the second Tàble are like to the Duties of the first. <hi>Duty to Parents</hi> is called <hi>Piety,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 4. for its likeness to it, and evidence of it. And (as <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> says very well) <hi>Then will the Power of Kings and Magistrates

               </gap> their Authority from him, are to be obeyed, (according to the measure of their Authority) in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, not in opposition to the King. We are not to ask Inferior Governors, whether we shall obey the King, or not: The Son is not to ask his Mother, (much less his Brethren and Sisters, or Servants of the House) whether or no he shall obey his Father: No, there is the Law of Nature and express Command of God for it. <hi>Children, Obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is Right, Ephes.</hi> 6. 1. so 'tis in this case. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Be subject to the King, as Supream, for so is the Will of God,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And the Fathers Authority is paramount to that of the Mother: So is the Authority of the King to that of inferiour Rulers; see <hi>Josh.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Joshua</hi> was now made chief Governour by God; <hi>Moses</hi> his Successor, who was King in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surun;</hi> and there you see how straitly they bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Obedience to him; see àlso <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 26. I think these points are Orthodox, and may pass for a Touch-stone, whereby to give a true Judgment of our Profession.</p>
            <p>If therefore our Religion be over-grown to that pass, that it teaches us to deny Kings and Magistrates to be of God, untill we can King it our selves, or to deny and absolve our selves from Obedience to them, unless

they be of our mind, or will humor us: In a word, if it either be or do teach or tolleráte Rebellion, it is certain it cannot be true; it is high time to renounce it and get a better: Such Religion is a scandal to the Gospel. We shall make the World believe, we have our Religion to seek. It is good for us to read <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. to 26. If therefore we desire to credit our Religion, and adorn the Gospel, which we profess, let us consider and return to our Obedience; get good Principles, and put them into practice. Let us look upon Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance not as an Arbitrary thing, that we may pay it, or we may let it alone, or take our time for it, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> bùt let us look upon it as a matter of Necessity. We must needs be subject. If others will not be Loyal, yet we must; and if this make us <hi>Vile,</hi> then we must be <hi>more Vile.</hi> If for this we be <hi>Rogues that will Undo the Country,</hi> then we must be Rogues still.</p>
            <p>But possibly all this will easily be avoided: It grows too common an Opinion, <hi>That the King hath nothing to do with us:</hi> ànd if that be true, I must confess, I am beside the Text. Therefore in the next place,</p>

            <p>We have accordingly in our Addresses to their Majesties, declared, <hi>That we resumed our Government till further Order, and professed our selves to be their Majesties most humble and dutiful Subjects; begged such Directions from their Majesties, as to their Princely Wisdom should seem meet:</hi> Very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and zealous we have pretended our selves to be for the Service and Interest of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to what end is all this? Did we not hereby engage Obedience to their Majesties, as our King and Queen? but what Truth and Reality is there in it? for now their Majesties exert their Authority, issue their Commissions, and give us their Directions, they will not be received nor obeyed; as if <hi>their Majesties had nothing to do with us indeed!</hi> Thus in words we profess to acknowledge their Majesties, but in our

It is a manifest thing that this and the other <hi>Homurculus</hi> hath a thousand times more Authority, Respect and Obedience in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> than their Majesties have. If a Man come in their Majesties Name, and with their Commission, he will not be received by us; but if a man come in his own Name, without their Majesties Authority and Commission, him we will receive: This is not the behaviour of good Subjects. Have we not given our Hands, or do we repent of so doing? Let us deal well and truly with their Majesties. Have we a King, or no King? or, why halt we between two Opinions? If their Majesties be our King and Queen, then let us follow and obey them; but if this ánd t'other man be indeed Kings, then let us follow them. Let us not flatter and mock, and call their Majesties King and Queen, and pretend they are <hi>Our Dread Soveraigns, our Soveraign Lord and Lady, and We their most Humble and Obedient Subjects,</hi> and make use of their Names to serve our own purposes, and in the mean time refuse to yeild them any Obedience, scorn their Commissions, maligne,

            <p>Yea, let us deal plainly and uprightly with one another also. We aré not willing to be kept in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, deluded and led hood-winked, till we are so fast, and unawares entangled in the Snare laid for-our Life, that we shall not be able to get out of it.

            <p>These things were, without Controversy, agreed on both hands; but the only Question was concerning the <hi>Manner how the Charge of the Defence ought to be levyed? Whether by the Kings Writ, or by common consent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby therefore we may see, that by the Law of <hi>England</hi> the sole and supream Power, Government and Dispose of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, &amp;c. is, and ever was the Kings undoubted Right, and that these Statutes (above-mentioned) do but declare the antient Law in that behalf.</p>
            <p>This Commission therefore is a lawful Commission, being founded upon the antient and standing Laws of the Realm; yea, it is not only lawful, but necessary, forasmuch as it is incumbent upon their Majesties, both in Honour and by their Oath, to provide for the safety of their People on every side.</p>
            <p>The Designation or Appointment of this or that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000688_0030_0FA9A28CF209D850"/>
particular Person to be their Majesties Lieutenant, (being qualified according to Law) is by the Law left to their Majesties Wisdom and Pleasure. Consider we then, that (these things being so) our Disobedience to this Commission is utterly inexcusable, and much more our Contempt.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> It is to be considered also, That when their present Majesties came to the Throne, the Militia, and all Forces by Sea and Land, and all Forts, and places of Strength in <hi>Connecticut;</hi> were in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties hands and possession; it is good for us to be think us, Who took them out of their Majesties hands? or how it came to pass that they are not now in their Majesties hands, if it be so indeed? or who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to give account of that matter? Is it not more Wisdom for us to make sure of a Pardon for what is past, than to go on to multiply and aggravate our Presumptions?</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly.</hi> Put the case that their Majesties had granted such a Commission to us, should we not have expected and compelled Obedience to it? Yea, no doubt; then it had been a very lawful and good Commission, and necessary to be obeyed We that can make so much
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000688_0031_0FA9A28DB781EA48"/>
of a bare silent Permission or Sufferànce of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and make so much of the King's làte Letter, which yet takes not so much as the least Notice of any of us; and can be so severe and sharp upon any di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledgement of our disputable Authority, how brag &amp; peremptory should we have been, if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>(in terminis)</hi> had been given to us? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot,</hi> or the <hi>Noose of an Halter</hi> had been good enough for any one that should have offered to oppose it, or refuse Obedience to it: And how should we have traduced them as Enemies and Rebels to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then tûrn the Scale. We know the Golden Rule, <hi>Whatsoever ye would that others should do to you, do you the same to them.</hi> It is their Majesties Commission no less than if it had been directed to our selves.</p>
            <p>6<hi>thly.</hi> How greedily did we catch at the King's Letter of the 3d of <hi>March</hi> last (although their Majesty doth therein take no Notice of our Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or any particular Person in it, but directs it only in general, thus, <hi>[To such as for the time being take care for the preservation of the Peace, &amp;c.]</hi> in our Collony of <hi>Connecticut)</hi> And how readily did
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000688_0032_0FA9A28E77FEBB68"/>
we comply with it? And why? <hi>Why</hi> (it will be said) <hi>it is his Majesties Command, his Majesties pleasure, we must obey the King.</hi> Consider then, This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their Majesties Command also, this is their Royal Pleasure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> In this case, <hi>(Rex pracipit, &amp; Lex precipit)</hi> The King commands, and the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is all one.</p>
            <p>And is not this lawful Command as good as that? Is not the great Seal as effectual às the little Seal?</p>
            <p>But it may be thought, that Letter put a staff into our hands, in a sinister manner to serve our selves of our fellow Subjects, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this Commission takes it out again; and therefore we willingly complyed with that, but will oppose this. Possibly some may have cause to thank their Majesties for that: But if that be the case, where is our Obedience? Genuine Obedience is Universal.</p>
            <p>7<hi>thly.</hi> Consider we the vile Ingratitude of this our ill behaviour towards their Majesties, and their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? It is well known to the World what their Majesties have done, and how they have exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the benefit of the whole <hi>English Nation,</hi> of which we are a part, for the securing of all their

               </gap>, their <hi>Religion, Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and the continual and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Labour and Hazards which his sacred Majesty condescends from Year to Year to undergo, for that end. Whereby their Majesties have given abundant Evidence of their good affection to their Subjects, and that they will take nothing from us which is our Right, nor deny us any thing which their Royal Wisdom shall see to be good for us, but are willing to purchase it for us at a dear Rate. Yea, and this very Commission is a singular Instance of their tender care for our Defence and Safety in this perilous time of War, as is manifest from the Commission it self: And do we thus requite their Majesties? <hi>O foolish we, and unwise!</hi> Who hath bewitched us? There is nothing so hateful and provoking as Ingratitude: Truly, we may do well to remember <hi>Jotham's</hi> Parable <hi>(Judg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000688_0034_0FA9A28FF101F988"/>
their Hands? Shall we require Love with Hatred? Tender Bowels with Malignity? For what else can our Behaviour signifie, but a malignant Spirit and inveterate Hatred against the King, as King, and who ever comes from him, as such? We have sufficiently declared our Affections to the King, and what we should have done, if we had him in our hands; we should soon rid the World of Kings, if we had them in our Power. Remember <hi>Hazael, Is thy Servant a Dog</hi> (says he) <hi>that he should do this great (i. e.</hi> this Abominable<hi>) thing;</hi> Yea, but when Temptation and Opportunity met together, he did it notwithstanding; and verily so should we.</p>
            <p>8<hi>thly.</hi> Let us look through all their Majesties Realms and Dominions, and see where we can find any such President or Example. We are too apt to admire our selves, <hi>and to bless God that we are not as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican!</hi> But who so Ungrateful, who so Disobedient as we? Their Majesties may look upon themselves to be very Unhappily and Unequally yoked, as to us: The best of Princes with the worst of Subjects.</p>
            <p>9<hi>thly.</hi> Consider we the Time. Is this a time for
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000688_0035_0FA9A290B38D28A8"/>
us to be Refractory and Disobedient to our Prince? Between four and five Years ago, when there was no War with <hi>France,</hi> we would needs have made the King and and the World believe, <hi>That we were in continual danger of our Lives, by reason of the Natives being at War with us, with whom</hi> (we said) <hi>we had just fears of our Neighbouring</hi> French <hi>to joyn; and therefore not receiving Orders or Directions what Methods to take for our Security, we were necessitated to put our selves into some form of Government.</hi> And yet now there hath been open and strong Wàr with <hi>France,</hi> and with the <hi>French</hi> in all pàrts above this three Years, and that attended with not a few or small Difficulties ànd Disappointments, and now that their Majesties have given their Orders and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections whàt Methods to take for our Security in this difficult and hazardous Time, there is yet so little danger, that we will not receive their Majesties Directions, but spurn at their Commission, scorn at their Lieûtenant, and will yield no obedience.</p>
            <p>What! do we indeed intend to fall off to the French? We had as good fall to the French, as fall from our King; and if we intend so to do, let us speak out; if not, surely this is not a time to be Disobedient. For how is it possible for any Prince to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000688_0036_0FA9A2916EF79328"/>
provide for the safety of his Subjects, or to manage the weighty Affairs of War with effect, (and more especially at such a Distance) if his Subjects will flight ànd disobey his Commissions, or take upon themselves to wage War, without or against them?</p>
            <p>10<hi>thly.</hi> We are now addressing their Majesties for their Favour (so we say) and to the end that we may recommend our selves to them as (it seems) their <hi>most Proud and Disobedient Subjects,</hi> at this very time we disobey their Commission. Can we think that <hi>Disobedience</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> âre the most likely way to obtain access and acceptance? Is that the way to find favour? or do we think that the King is afraid of us, and we shall force him to comply with us? Verily, I doubt we shall tempt him and prove him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Pride, Supplication</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> do not sort well together.</p>
            <p>11<hi>thly.</hi> Our great Champion in whom we trusted to vindicate ûs, and defend our Cause, yeilds the Cause, and leaves us in the Lurch: Our <hi>Goliah,</hi> who defied all as Pigmies that durst appear against us, the stone is sunk in his fore-head, and he is fallen

upon the Earth; he is convinced in his Conscience, and tells us with all the honesty and plainness that he can, <hi>That he will not ruin himself and his Posterity; That he will not Hang for any of us.</hi> No doubt but (whatever he hath done, yet) now he speaks as he thinks; and shall we yet harden our selves? shall we ruin our selves and our Posterity? Believe it, <hi>we shall find it hard kicking against the Pricks.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us consider seriously the end and event of these things, and what may reasonably follow thereupon. <hi>The fools Eyes are in his Heels:</hi> He can see nothing but what is past, and repent when it is too late. But <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The wise mans Eyes are in his Head:</hi> He looks before him. The Prudent man <hi>fore-sees the Evil,</hi> and hides himself, but the <hi>simple pass on and are punished,</hi> Prov. 22. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, <hi>That the Wise Man begins at the end;</hi> and it were good for us to begin there too: Let us consider it then. What do we think will be the end of these strange Behaviours? What good can we promise our selves?</p>

            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> We overween our Charter in more things than one, to the no little Prejudice both of King and Subjects. Modesty might incline us to think that the King understands our Charter, and how well the Militia was thereby disposed of, at least as well as we do; and he knows what is his own Right and our Right much better than we. Their Majesties have given us no cause to suspect, that they will take any thing from us that doth of right belong to us. But to let other things pass, let us here consider, That the

            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> It is only our Ignorance that makes us suspect it to be a Cheat.

            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> But now there is a Queen Regent; his Majesty was pleased to commit the Government to the Queen in his absence, and accordingly it was by Act of Parliàment (of <hi>anno</hi> 2. <hi>W. &amp; M.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1st.</hi> A poor shift! as if their Majesties Commission to his Excellency to command, were not a command for us to obey? or, as if his Excellency's command, pursuant to his Commission received from their Majesties, were not their Majesties Command.

            <p>His Excellency demands no surrender of the Militia of us, but Obedience to his Commission: The Militia is the Kings, and he hath constituted his Lieutenant over it, and thereby furnished him with all the Powers that any of their Majesties Captain Generals do or have lawfully exercised. Now the Kings Lieutenants or Captain Generals may lawfully assemble men, form Regiments, Troops and Companies, commissionate Officers, muster, lead and conduct them, or cause them to be mustered, led and conducted, either for Military Exercise or for actual Service, as occàsion

requires: And the Law not only requires Obedience of all, but in particular requires all Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be aiding and assisting to the Kings Captain Generals in the execution of their Commissions.

            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> Did their Majesties ever give their Subjects any command to yeild Obedience to our resumed Power?

Yet we expect Obedience from them, without any such command. And are not we their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Subjects, as well as the rest of the People?</p>

Will the King take this well at our hands, that we should obey any man rather than himself? We can willingly submit to <hi>Leysler's</hi> Authority, but stubbornly reject the Kings Commission, and defie his Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> If we renounce the King ánd his Government we destroy our own: We cannot pretend to any thing but from and under the King: and how can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or expect that others should obey us, if we will not obey the King? All Loyal Subjects may justly be afraid of having to do with us; for such Obedience is indeed Unlawful.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> We cannot think that our Government shall always shoulder out the <hi>Kings</hi> Government; and 'tis not to be doubted but their Majesties have long had the settlement of the Government of these Territories under consideration. The Defence of the Dominion is their Majesties great Interest and care. It is obvious to every Eye that we are divided from the <hi>Massachusets</hi>

at Sea by the shoals, and at Land by a great distance, and that <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>York</hi> by their natural sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation lie much fairer than <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusets,</hi> for the defence of each other, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulàr of <hi>Albany,</hi> that key of the Country, à Post necessary to be defended, and by the defence whereof we defend our selves; and this is laid as the ground of their Majesties dispose of the Militia in this Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. It is not for us to appoint or dictate to their Majesties, but to acquiese in their Majesties Wisdom and Goodness in that behalf, on whom we may relié, being assured that they will do that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> shàll be best for us.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> We may remember also, That whereas their Majesties did the last year give a Commission to Sir <hi>William Phips;</hi> their Governour of thé <hi>Massachusets,</hi> we had then the same jealoûsie of being annexed to the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> and would not submit to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, nor take notice of Sir <hi>William</hi> in that capacity; whereby (to make the fairest construction of it that may be) their Majesties might very well conclude, that we were not desirous to be annexed to the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> but had rather be annexed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

may well look upon this Commission as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of our Non-submission to Sir <hi>William Phips.</hi> It is their Majesties Grace so far to over-look that <hi>Disobedience;</hi> if now we shall finally reject the second, the <hi>Third</hi> may bring a greater inconvenience than any we can imagine to follow upon our being annexed to York.</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly,</hi> The Regal and chief Government doth not belong to us: The most that we can pretend to is but that of a Corporation. The Regal Government is the King's, and their Majesties may commit it here or there, as pleases them, and 'tis our Duty to submit. And which, I pray, is the most likely way to preserve our Government, <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?</hi>

            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> The Governour neither doth nor can impose any Rates upon them, there is none levyed but what their Assembly of the Free-holders see needful for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the necessary Charge.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> That small Province of <hi>New-York</hi> hath had (beside other arrears) the burthen of the Defence of <hi>Albany</hi> so long lying mainly upon them alone, by which their Rates, no doubt, have been much more heavy than otherwise they would have been. But have not we great Rates to pay also, now as we are standing alone? And how doth it appear that their Rates are greater than ours? If that màtter was well examined, possibly it might be found, thàt our Rates are as great, if not greater than theirs; and yet we have had no such burden incumbent upon us. How many Thousand of Pounds have been raised upon this Collony since the Revolution? and who is he that can give account of a farthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We volùntarily take upon us the Defence of the upper Towns belonging to the <hi>Massachusets</hi> upon this River, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains not to us. The King by his Letter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands assistance of Men and Money to his Governor of <hi>York,</hi> and we seem willing to comply with that; but these things must of necessity augment our Rates as it not more than our annexion to <hi>York,</hi> if it should be so.</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly,</hi> If we should be annexed to the <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusets,</hi> shall we not have as great Rates to pay, as if we be annexed to York, or greater?
