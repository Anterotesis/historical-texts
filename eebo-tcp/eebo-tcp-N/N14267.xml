            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CINCINNATI, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT has been long ago obſerved (and every day's experience evinces with how much truth and propriety) <hi>"That there is no gift of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor effect of art, however beneficial to mankind, which is not ſometimes perverted to a miſchievous purpoſe."</hi> Whatever may be the cauſe of happineſs, may alſo be the cauſe of miſery. The ſame medicine which ſkilfully applied has power to cure, when ignorance or malice dictates, the preſcription has an equal power to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>This preliminary obſervation holds ſtrictly true with regard to the liberty of the preſs, and will not (I truſt) be thought to be here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly applied, by the attentive readers of a late pamphlet, entitled, <hi>"Conſiderations on the Society or Order of the Cincinnati."</hi> The LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY OF THE PRESS however (that PALLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIUM of the rights of nature) is very properly protected in this country, as the PILLAR that ſupports the whole fabric of freedom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the advantages which ſociety derives from it, every member of the community ought to reſt ſatisfied with this conciliating
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018073_0003_0FA4B5492673A0C0"/>
reflection, "That in no ſingle inſtance is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the lot of humanity."</p>
            <p>In this age of literary intelligence, no ſooner has a popular pamphlet eſcaped from the groans of the preſs, than it flies, (as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaniouſly) to every point of the compaſs, and if impregnated with venom, every where wafts its poiſon from centre to circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The preſs (in this enlightened aera of the world) finds employment for all the purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of civil and of ſocial life; the moſt abſtruſe political reaſonings are no longer held impervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to vulgar eyes. The tippling philoſopher, and the village politician, familiarly diſcuſs the moſt important ſubjects by the means of it, and ſagaciouſly predict the fate of kingdoms by the revolutions of the tankard. It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that there is no character, no ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, no man ſo juſt, no ſet of men ſo reſpectable, to which it does not afford food for calumny to reproach, or envy to malign. <hi>Perhaps</hi> there is nothing more important to the welfare of a ſtate, than that the channel of public information ſhould ſlow pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and that citizen is at leaſt reſpectable who only <hi>endeavours</hi> to clear the ſtream from the filth with which it is impregnated. TO DO THIS is the object of the enſuing ſheets; and to diſſipate error, as it confers no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable benefit, ſurely it merits no vulgar praiſe.</p>
            <p>The advantages of nature or of fortune have been obſerved in all ages (ſays Johnſon) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute little to the promotion of happineſs. Thoſe (whom the ſplendor of their rank, or
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018073_0004_0FA4B549F325B060"/>
the extent of their capacity have placed upon the ſummit of human life) have ſeldom given any juſt occaſion to envy, in thoſe who look up to them from a lower ſtation. Such is the infirmity of human nature, that every <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of ſuperiority (however neceſſary to the policy and government of a ſtate) naturally excites ſullen ſuſpicion in the breaſts of the ſubordinate; and the misfortune is, that the <hi>beſt characters and the nobleſt inſtitutions</hi> are often marked out as the firſt objects of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſentment.</p>
            <p>"The faireſt bloſſom is the reptile's food."</p>
            <p>The very illiberal reflections and <hi>aggravated</hi> conſequences deduced from the inſtitution of the order of the Cincinnati, will, I truſt, be added as one more to the innumerable proofs which hiſtory and experience already offers of this melancholy truth.</p>
            <p>It is recorded of the celebrated Engliſh poet Pope (who felt the full force of detraction, from the peer at St. James's down to the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at St. Giles's) that when he publiſhed his poem of the Dunciad, he carefully collated all the pieces that envy and ignorance had generated, and gave them (HIMSELF) entire to the world.</p>
            <p>Truth certainly derives double advantage from the effect of contraſt. Light is the more dazzling to him who emerges out of darkneſs, and the diamond has a luſtre more brilliant by compariſon. Induced by the ſame motives, I ſhall beg leave to introduce here THE PLAN
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018073_0005_0FA4B54A9D8718E8"/>
ITSELF, and thoſe Rules and Orders of the Society, which have raiſed ſo much ill grounded cavil, and ill ſupported exception.</p>

                        <p>To perpetuate, therefore, as well the remembrance of this great event, as the mutual friendſhips which have been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the preſſure of common danger, and in many inſtances cemented by the blood of the parties, the officers of the American army do hereby in the moſt ſolemn manner aſſociate, conſtitute, and combine themſelves into one SOCIETY OF FRIENDS, to endure as long as they ſhall endure, or any of their eldeſt male poſterity, and in failure thereof, the collateral branches, who may be judged
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018073_0006_0FA4B54B5C278500"/>

                        <p>The officers of the American army, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally been taken from the citizens of America, poſſeſs high veneration for the character of that illuſtrious Roman, LUCIUS QUINTUS CINCINNATUS, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow his example by returning to their citizenſhip, think they may with propriety denominate themſelves, THE SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY OF THE CINCINNATI.</p>

                        <p>An unalterable determination to promote and cheriſh between the reſpective ſtates, that union and national honour, ſo eſſentially neceſſary to their happineſs, and the future dignity of the American empire.</p>
                        <p>To render permanent the cordial affection ſubſiſting among the officers: this ſpirit will dictate brotherly kindneſs in all things, and particularly extend to the moſt ſubſtantial acts of beneficence, according to the ability of the ſociety, towards thoſe officers and their families, who unfortunately may be under the neceſſity of receiving it.</p>

                        <p>In the general meeting, the preſident, vice-preſident, ſecretary, aſſiſtant ſecretary, treaſurer, and aſſiſtant treaſurer generals, ſhall be choſen to ſerve until the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>The circular letters which have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the reſpective ſtate ſocieties to each other, and their particular laws, ſhall be read and conſidered, and all meaſures concerted which may conduce to the general intention of the ſociety.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that ſome perſons may make donations to the general ſociety, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of eſtabliſhing funds for the further comfort of the unfortunate; in which caſe, ſuch donations muſt be placed in the hands of the treaſurer general, the intereſt only of which to be diſpoſed of, if neceſſary, by the general meeting.</p>
                        <p>All the officers of the American army, as well thoſe who have reſigned with honour, after three years ſervice in the capacity of officers, or who have been deranged by the reſolutions of Congreſs upon the ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms of the army, as thoſe who ſhall have continued to the end of the war, have the right to become parties, to this inſtitution; provided that they ſubſcribe one month's pay, and ſign their names to the general rules in their reſpective ſtate ſocieties; thoſe who are preſent with the army immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and others, within ſix months after the army ſhall be diſbanded, extraordinary caſes excepted.

And as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of affection to the memory and the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ſuch officers as have died in the ſervice, their eldeſt male branches ſhall have the ſame right of becoming members as the children of the ſociety.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe officers who are foreigners, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in any of the ſtates, will have their names enrolled by the ſecretary general, and are to be conſidered as members in the ſocieties of any of the ſtates in which they may happen to be.</p>
                        <p>And as there are and will at all times be men in the reſpective ſtates, eminent for their abilities and patriotiſm, whoſe views may be directed to the ſame laudable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with thoſe of the Cincinnati; it ſhall be a rule to admit ſuch characters, as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary members of the ſociety for their own lives only: Provided always, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honorary members in each ſtate does not exceed a ratio of one to four of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or their deſcendants.</p>
                        <p>Each ſtate ſociety ſhall obtain a liſt of its members, and at the firſt and annual meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate ſecretary ſhall have engroſſed on parchment, two copies of the inſtitution of the ſociety, which every member preſent ſhall ſign; and the ſecretary ſhall endeavour to procure the ſignature of every abſent member; one of theſe liſts to be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſecretary general, to be kept in the archives of the ſociety, and the other
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018073_0011_0FA4B551D7FC51E0"/>
to remain in the hands of the ſtate ſecretary.</p>
                        <p>From the ſtate liſts the ſecretary general muſt make out, at the general meeting, a complete liſt of the whole ſociety, a copy of which he will furniſh each ſtate ſecretary.</p>
                        <p>The Society ſhall have an Order by which its members ſhall be known and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſhall be a Medal of Gold, of a proper ſize to receive the emblems, and ſuſpended by a Deep Blue Ribbon, two inches wide, edged with White, deſcriptive of the union of America and France, viz.</p>

            <p>The world gives the credit of this pamphlet to the pen of a celebrated lawyer, and the many rhetorical flowers that decorate the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, manifeſtly tends to ſhew the hand that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018073_0012_0FA4B55253BAFAC8"/>
planted them. The report, however has gained ground from the ſilent acquieſcence of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom the production is attributed. And if the child is not of his lawful iſſue, the ſanction of bearing his name has given it a title by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For my own part I conſider the learned gentleman as publicly wearing his laurels, and not a little vain of his literary accompliſhments. Gentlemen of the long robe from their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional practice acquire a wonderful fluency of expreſſion and an uncommon facility of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Engaged in the indiſcriminate defence of right and wrong, from the force of habit only, they argue a bad cauſe with the ſame zealous ardour that they would defend a good one; and this too, I am willing to believe, without any very bad deſign or malevolence of intention. With different ſentiments I ſhould feel an inclination (too ſtrong perhaps to reſiſt in the preſent inſtance) to pay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to his underſtanding that might ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a little at the expence of his integrity.</p>
            <p>Conceiving myſelf addreſſing a lawyer (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing legal language) I ſhall adopt a legal idea, for where there is a latitude that affords me the choice of <hi>two</hi> conſtructions, that only will be taken by me which is the moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to candour and humanity.</p>
            <p>Viewing only the <hi>back ground</hi> of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—how gloomy would be the proſpect— It might be urged, that the external appearance of patriotiſm was often deficient in its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent qualities—That many aſſume that higheſt of all human titles who have no other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſuch claims than diſſeminating diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent—
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018073_0013_0FA4B552E7A5BC08"/>
propagating reports of dangerous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, violated rights and encroaching uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—Inſtigating the people with outcries, uttered with malignity and echoed by folly— To which might be added, a very ſincere la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that (as it were by ſome unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fatality) loud and empty declamation is always accepted by the multitude as the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of truth and fame, while the zephyr breath of wiſdom and moderation is altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected or received with the moſt mortifying indifference. <hi>Certainly,</hi> however that patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm is queſtionable which profeſſes to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by <hi>incredibilities,</hi> and it is equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the common marks of patriotiſm are ſuch as artifice may counterfeit or folly miſapply.</p>
            <p>I do not—cannot—will not—attribute the conſiderations on the Society or Order of the Cincinnati to <hi>ſuch motives,</hi> they may be traced, I fancy, to others which have their ſource in the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of human nature. The man of genius and literature, who has toiled for his acquiſitions, who has waſted the midnight oil over his lucubrations, naturally <hi>pants</hi> after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, he feels an ardent but honeſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſhew thoſe talents to an admiring world, which have coſt him ſo much care to poliſh and improve. The inſtitution of the order of the Cincinnati ſprings up—The author of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations <hi>feels</hi> his talents—the <hi>cacoethes ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi</hi> ſeconds—ſtimulates this deſire of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction—the ardour of compoſition heats the imagination and (what fleſh alive)
<q>"With pulſe that riots and with blood that glows,"</q>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:018073_0014_0FA4B553A37F5F30"/>
Could reſiſt ſuch an opportunity, and when it was conſidered too how many fine things might be ſaid upon it, no wonder the learned gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was led captive by deluſion!</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Vanity!</hi> Thou univerſal paſſion of the human breaſt! Not only the gay bloſſoms of youth, but the boſom of age expands under thy influence. Thou art the magnet which canſt attract every human paſſion with force irreſiſtible! By <hi>thee</hi> the idle are animated to action, the diſſipated and luxurious to an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donment of their pleaſures, and by thee, alas! the good are ſometimes led from the path of integrity to the road of vice.</p>
            <p>Wanting leiſure <hi>as well as books</hi> neceſſary to give that ample refutation of the ſheets before me which I could wiſh, I am principally urged to this weak endeavour with a view to rouſe ſome abler pen in defence of this honourable order and valuable inſtitution, <hi>not wanting</hi> in theſe advantages. It is my intention, however, to obſerve upon the author's principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endeavour to ſhew the people the ſubterfuges by which reaſon is eluded; and if in the courſe of my obſervations I ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe conſiderable freedom, the author of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ought not to be offended at a liberty of which he has himſelf given an example.</p>
            <p>THAT to which all would otherwiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, often attracts notice from the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of a name, and the magnitude of the performance. But I muſt beg my readers to emancipate their minds from that captivating deluſion, and not to ſet off with an idea, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018073_0015_0FA4B554987E7A30"/>
much has been <hi>proved</hi> becauſe much has been <hi>ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned gentleman INTRODUCES his obſervations with an account of the Order itſelf (the object of animadverſion) and a ſplendid diſplay of his talents for deſcription in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute hiſtory of the medal and the ribband (in our author's eyes) <hi>things moſt odious</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting his chief charge of criminality. That ribbands are moſt dangerous things what mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal can deny! Cupid in the perſon of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty woman often ſhoots his moſt pointed arrows from behind them; <hi>but as an article of male attire,</hi> to no other breaſt than Caſſius's can they poſſibly convey any apprehenſion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>THEN follows an enumeration of the many great public characters who have dignified the order by becoming honorary members of it, and who (if Caſſius ſupports his charge) certainly owe him an acknowledgment for making them <hi>acceſſaries</hi> to a crime which our patriot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer reprobates in the bittereſt terms of aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reproach.</p>
            <p>No taſk (however ardous) will the ſpirit of enterprize forego! Waſhington himſelf cannot eſcape him—by a novel idea, and argument inverted, our great general is made to ſhew his diſapprobation of the Order, <hi>by condeſcending to become a member of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CASES may undoubtedly be ſuppoſed (which practice I belive would warrant) where a man may talk nonſenſe to a jury without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to his character as a lawyer; but to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deliberate nonſenſe to the world <hi>in writing</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:018073_0016_0FA4B55882AA53C8"/>
is tempting fortune too far, and committing an act of voluntary ſuicide upon reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſcretion</hi> is called the leading feature of our great general's character—he is made by Caſſius to diſapprove this Order, and as a <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inſtance</hi> of this <hi>diſcretion</hi> to avow his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation—<hi>by becoming a member of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN—<hi>To become a member of a ſociety</hi> (and in the preſent inſtance, certainly the firſt and moſt important member) is, according to Caſſius—to act a <hi>neutral</hi> part.</p>
            <p>LOGIC is ſurely exploded the bar of South-Carolina, ſhe certainly has quitted her ſeat upon the bench.</p>
            <p>Caſſius is aſtoniſhed—that this ſelf-created order has not excited the leaſt attention—is apparently diſappointed, that it is not even made a ſubject for the tattle of a tea-table, and concludes with this affecting apoſtrophe— HOW BLIND ARE THE MULTITUDE! Yet this ſame people, in the very ſame page, are repreſented as reſtleſs, vigilant, and active, <hi>feelingly alive</hi> to ſuſpicion, and prone to reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſuch objects as are in the leaſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to excite it.</p>
            <p>It is a truth which can no longer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, that in ſome parts of theſe <hi>Oracular Leaves</hi> (where Caſſius is ſo piteouſly doleful) that he ſometimes nods towards dullneſs, and in others (where he is argumentative) that contradictions are ſet ſtaring one another in the face, in a ſtate of enmity that excludes every hope of reconciliation.</p>
            <p>TWO poſitions ſtanding in direct oppoſition of equal authority, afford me, I apprehend,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018073_0017_0FA4B55A0C40B418"/>
the liberty of <hi>chuſing,</hi> and from the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reaſoning which pervades the whole, it may, I think, be collected, as Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius's meaning. "That dullneſs holds her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over the people at large with whom I ſuppoſe he includes their repreſentatives and that the diſcovery of the dreadful political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences with which this inſtitution is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was left to the Lynx's eye of the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Caſſius." They are indeed ſuch <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,</hi> as made me tremble, and it is not to be denied, but that they are told in ſuch a melancholy tale of ſerious ſadneſs, and with as much appearance of ſincerity, as if the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gentleman <hi>himſelf</hi> really believed them.</p>
            <p>Let us examine the grounds upon which this immenſe political ſuperſtructure has been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we ſhall find it built upon a ſandy foundation.</p>
            <p>The Congreſs (it ſeems) are dull as the people, or, what is worſe, that which they do ſee is <hi>winked at</hi>—Yes! and winked at, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius (I dare apprehend) for ſubſtantial reaſons —becauſe they foreſee <hi>no</hi> conſequences reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this ſociety, likely to be injurious to the community. The <hi>ſilence</hi> of that reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able body (the watchful guardians of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is the ſtrongeſt argument of the <hi>innocence</hi> of the inſtitution; but it is, at all events, as fair for me to infer <hi>approbation</hi> from the <hi>ſilence</hi> of the Congreſs, as for Caſſius to urge the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>approbation</hi> of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, <hi>from his being a member of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Congreſs do not ſee the conſequences ſtated by Caſſius, they are as dull as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018073_0018_0FA4B55B82507FB0"/>
and this is in that caſe, a very <hi>unlucky</hi> country; if they do ſee them in the light ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by Caſſius, and diſregard them, this is aſſuredly a very <hi>unhappy</hi> country. But having an eye upon the inſtitution from its birth, and taking no meaſures to deſtroy it in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio, it is moſt likely the danger exiſts no where but in the imagination of the viſionary Caſſius.</p>
            <p>What <hi>inducements</hi> would Caſſius ſuggeſt in Congreſs to make them wink at <hi>enormities?</hi> Is it to be inferred from their conduct?—How has it happened that the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have been ſilent too? Are they alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this ſtupor, or are they in conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy with the Congreſs to betray the people, and conſequently themſelves?</p>
            <p>PROPERTY <hi>alone conſtitutes</hi> POWER, <hi>and</hi> POWER <hi>is conferred by Congreſs and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people.</hi> Honours indeed) like impreſſions upon coin, may give an ideal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to baſe metal, but it is gold and ſilver alone that will paſs without any recommendation but from its weight.</p>
            <p>The examples drawn from Rome, of Sylla and of Caeſar are not in point. Caeſar diſbanded no army, nor Sylla till he had accompliſhed the miſchief he meditated.—How different the conduct of our <hi>greater Caeſar!</hi> Having reſtored the Goddeſs <hi>Liberty</hi> to her country and built her a permanent habitation there, he quietly retires to the rural ſhade, the glory and wonder of the age. There has indeed been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity of good offices between the American army and their country—They have bleſſed her
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018073_0019_0FA4B55C29F6E3B0"/>
with <hi>freedom,</hi> and ſhe has rewarded them with <hi>immortality.</hi> To uſe the metaphorical language of Junius, <q>Recorded honours ſhall gather round their monument and thicken over them, it is a ſolid fabrick, and will ſupport the laurels that adorn it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides—the <hi>means</hi> of riſing to military fame in the Roman republics, was through the channel of civil employments, men figured as ſtateſmen in the cloſet before they were choſen generals in the field, The means of doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to their country was conſequently greater than in modern republics.</p>
            <p>Caſſius affects the phraſe of <hi>a plain level ſtate of civil equality.</hi> I dare ſay that even Caſſius will not contend that, abſolute, perfect, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is poſſible to the government of any ſtate. As the mind muſt govern the hands, ſo the man of intelligence muſt direct the man of labour. Hiſtory is the beſt ſchool to improve the minds of the people, and the whole weight of its evidence tends to ſhew. That infant ſociety is always in a progreſſive ſtate, and that diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been made in all ages, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ſervices: and I believe have ſeldom failed to benefit the country that beſtowed them. Diſtinction neceſſarily excites a ſpirit of emulation, a ſpirit which when once diffuſed among a people, gives vigour to every ſpring of government and vibration to the heart of every member of the community.</p>
            <p>The inſtitution of the order of the Cincinnati is back'd by no power, and conſequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no danger,—<hi>The arm of civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſurrounds it</hi>—only to <hi>will</hi> its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018073_0020_0FA4B55CB0A3DBC8"/>
would be inſtant annihilation. If this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has any tendency to create diſtinctions, it is, I again aſſert, a diſtinction <hi>without power,</hi> and without any other luſtre than what it borrows from virtue. Not like the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and garters of modern ambition, but anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agous to the wreath of parſley or of the olive branch which decorated the foreheads of our ancient heroes, diſtinctions too which as they are the rewards of merit, reflect an unequalled brilliancy upon the wearer of them.</p>
            <p>Diſtinctions (it feems) are inconſiſtent with a republican government—Why ſo Caſſius? Every republic confers them—Is not Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a republic, <hi>rich, free, and powerful?</hi> And has ſhe not a nobility to whom too are confided the higheſt offices of the ſtate, civil as well as military?</p>
            <p>But theſe are trifling flights to the tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caſſius—<hi>he</hi> ſcorns deducing his infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from a nearer fountain than from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven itſelf, He appeals to Homer and Virgil to prove that Hector, Achilles and Aeneas were ſet up as idols to be worſhipped by future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and to ſhew <hi>in what depth of deſign and extent of artifice,</hi> the order of the Cincinnati is founded, INFERS, that, this order will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the ſame homage from the people—In other words—That the Cincinnati will ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up as <hi>idols,</hi> and the virtuous citizens of America will become <hi>idolaters.</hi> But I beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don—In this he is conſiſtent, for dealing in <hi>fiction,</hi> it was very natural for him to call in aid the evidence of the muſes.</p>
            <p>I beg now to refer the reader to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018073_0021_0FA4B55D619EA0E0"/>
of the order itſelf, and the rules of the order, page 6, upon which Caſſius comments with ſo much triumph. It purports to be an order, inſtituted (among others) for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purpoſes <hi>(viz.)</hi>

            <p>IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO CASSIUS, I ASSERT, That, if words are to be taken in their plain ſenſe and common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and to be conſtrued according to their real import, hiſtory furniſhes <hi>no ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of an inſtitution more <hi>apparently</hi> the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of PATRIOTISM, FRIENDSHIP, and HUMANITY.

            </p>
            <p>An extenſive knowledge of the common law, was (I dare ſay) one of the qualifications that recommended Caſſius to his ſeat upon the bench. In his judgments from that ſeat of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is not to be doubted but he ſtrictly adopts its rules as the grounds of his deciſions —Why omit the practice of them in a ſerious appeal to the people? THEY would inform Caſſius that conſtructions ſhould be <hi>favourable</hi> and as near as poſſible to the minds and intents of the party—VERBA INTENTIONI DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BENT INSERVIRE. And BENIGNE INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRETAMUR CHARTAS PROPTER SIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLICITATEM LAICORUM. Therefore the conſtruction muſt alſo be REASONABLE AND AGREEABLE TO COMMON UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERSTANDING.</p>
            <p>That—QUOTIES IN VERBIS NULLA EST AMBIGUITAS IBI NULLA EXPOSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIO CONTRA VERBA FIENDA EST.— When the intention is clear, too minute a ſtreſs ought not to be laid upon the preciſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of words NAM QUE HAERET IN LITERA, HAERET IN CORTICE.<note n="*" place="bottom">Query. Has not the neglect of this rule occaſioned Caſſius ſometimes (as we emphatically expreſs it) to STICK IN THE MUD.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly—THAT THE CONSTRUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION BE NOT MADE UPON DISJOINT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED PARTS, BUT ON THE WHOLE TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GETHER.</p>
            <p>If the intention of the Order is apparently innocent in the WORDS of the inſtitution, this very obvious queſtion very naturally ariſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:018073_0023_0FA4B55EE3B6F1C0"/>Has every ſingle ACT of the ſociety tended to ground a ſuſpicion or apprehenſion of the conſequences ſuggeſted?</p>
            <p>What! Every tongue locked in ſilence!</p>
            <p>If Caſſius had not known (as a lawyer) HU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANITY might have told told him (as a man) <hi>that the preſumption of inocence, ought always to precede the imputation of guilt.</hi> Let Caſſius <hi>fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in conjecture</hi> as much as he pleaſes, his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are as unfavourable to him as his facts. The good ſenſe of the people will only be led by reaſon and argument, and not the labour of the moſt minute reſearches of the moſt microſcopic eye, will ſecond his diſcoveries. No great depth of deſign will ever be found in the inſtitution of the order of the Cincinnati. For my own part I concur in the remark of a very attentive obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of human life. "That a ſoldier ſeldom looks further forward than to the end of his muſket or backwards beyond his knapſack."</p>
            <p>Caſſius would diſcover ſingular ingenuity in in reconciling the following contradictions.</p>
            <p>The citizens of America (altho' they fought and bled as well as the Cincinnati) are already (ſays Caſſius) <hi>as much below them as the earth is below the Heavens.</hi> Yet this vile medal and ribband would ſet the Cincinnati SO MUCH HIGHER <hi>that it would very juſtly excite the jealouſy and ſuſpicion of every man throughout the continent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Caſſius's Sagacity has diſcovered (page 3 of his pamphlet) that in all great ſocieties there are <hi>ſome</hi> bad men, and conſequently that there are men of that deſcription among the Cincinnati, yet (in page 9) <hi>were their country as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018073_0024_0FA4B5613663CC30"/>
as I am</hi> (ſays Caſſius) <hi>with the temper of</hi> GOODNESS <hi>and humanity which runs thro' the</hi> WHOLE OF THEM, <hi>they would be as much beloved as they are admired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can the ſame people excite love, admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and SUSPICION?</p>
            <p>The <hi>reaſons</hi> upon which he grounds his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions are ſingularly novel, namely, <hi>the uncommon merit of the officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had they,</hi> ſays he, <hi>leſs merit and claim to the applauſe of their countrymen at home and fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I ſhould not be alarmed, &amp;c. Men of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth,</hi> (i. e. bad men) COULD NOT <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this inſtitution detrimental to the freedom of their country, but it muſt be remembered</hi> (and I heartily join my prayers that it may never be FORGOTTEN) <q>That a ſeries of hardy gallant ſpirited actions through a fierce and deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, through toil and ſufferings, and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under them, and above all the glorious ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which crowned the whole, have rendered the officers of the American army the moſt renowned band of men that this day walk on the globe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Caſſius is certain that <hi>this dreadful inſtitution will entail on the people of America all the evils he has ſtated, and that he has</hi> PROVED <hi>it, to the ſatisfaction of every one,</hi> NEVERTHELESS <hi>he has not the moſt diſtant idea that it will ever come to a diſſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Might it not be aſked then, why Caſſius did not ſpare himſelf ſo much trouble. If it could not anſwer a good purpoſe, it muſt anſwer a bad one, namely, that of giving the people <hi>(fruitleſs)</hi> uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Caſſius concludes with obſerving, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018073_0025_0FA4B562DFB3AD48"/>
his remarks may appear trivial to ſome of his readers, that they are worthy, in his opinion, the attention of the philoſopher and hiſtorian. They ſerve to ſhew, ſays he, <q>that the freedom of a country may be overturned by cauſes imperceptible to the multitude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The matter ſeems to HINGE upon this queſtion, viz. Are the people ſuch as Caſſius repreſents them or not? i. e. Are they thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ignorant and inattentive to the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns; or are they, on the contrary, vigilant, active, attentive, and jealous of every thing that has relation to government?</p>
            <p>I contend for the truth of the latter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and if that is the caſe, what danger can threaten or invade a people, who conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arms of Britain; who fought and bled with the Cincinnati—Men who could protect their country ſo invaded from <hi>without,</hi> are ſurely competent to the taſk of defending it from <hi>within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a free people are ever vigilant and ſuſpicious of the ſlighteſt invaſion of their rights, may be deduced from every volume of hiſtory, the power (I had almoſt ſaid the Omnipotence) of the people (when that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion is once awakened) from every page. To take two examples out of a thouſand: this appears ſtrongly from the revolution of England, in the year <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>60; and of Holland, in the year 1672. The firſt is in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the meaneſt citizen of the continent. <q>The uſurped powers that had either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned no root, or at leaſt drawn none, but in the affections and intereſts of thoſe who
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018073_0026_0FA4B5644E222230"/>
were engaged with the government, thought themſelves ſecure in the ſtrength of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foiled army of ſixty thouſand men, and in a revenue proportionable, raiſed by the awe of their forces, though with the mock forms of legal ſupplies; yet they were forced to give way to the vent and current humour of the people.</q> And this mighty army loſe their heart and their intereſt, and content themſelves to be again moulded into the maſs of the people.</p>
            <p>THE COMMON PEOPLE (ſays Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple) conſtitute the bulk and ſtrength of all great kingdoms.—Whenever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and unite in one common paſſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, for the nobles without them are like an army of officers without ſoldiers, and make on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a vain ſhew unleſs raiſed and encreaſed by the VOICE OF THE PEOPLE which for this reaſon is called THE VOICE OF GOD.</p>
            <p>To go back into Engliſh hiſtory—Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Conqueror experienced this truth in the many troubles of his reign, and which would have proved fatal to him if he had been diſtracted with the common diſcontents of his Engliſh ſubjects.</p>
            <p>SOME of Caſſius's arguments may look flattering to the eye, but when brought to the teſt of palpability, they elude the touch and melt in idle air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:018073_0027_0FA4B56619F0EA38"/>The ſervices RECEIVED by the ſtates from the American army, are not denied—They ſtand alone, unparalleled in hiſtory.—The only recompence expected is—A MEDAL AND A RIBBAND, TO PERPETUATE THE RECORD OF THEM.</p>
            <p>If this is denied, will it not recall to every man's recollection the following ſtory of Aeſop.</p>
            <p>A poor man aſked charity of a prieſt—<hi>a guinea!</hi>—he was refuſed with aſtoniſhment— <hi>a ſhilling</hi>—he was refuſed with contempt—<hi>a farthing</hi>—ſtill he was refuſed—Give me then your <hi>bleſſing,</hi> continued the mendicant.— <hi>"That you ſhall have, friend,"</hi> anſwered the prieſt. It was now the beggars turn to reject. <q>No <hi>(ſays he)</hi> I will not take it, for if it had been worth a farthing, thou wouldeſt not have given it away.</q>
