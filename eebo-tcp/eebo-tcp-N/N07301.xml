            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is the anſwer Chriſt made to a certain ſcribe, whom after ſome conference, he found to be more knowing, at leaſt more ingenuous and fair in his conceſſions and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as in his inquiries, than the others, who converſed with him. The others came not to be inlightened and inſtructed by Chriſt; for they, who had been inſtructed in all the learning of their law, did in the pride of their hearts ſcorn to be taught of him; but their deſign was to inſnare him in their talk: Thus we are told, that certain of the Phariſees and of the Herodians (being ſent by the reſt) came to him <hi>to catch him in his words,</hi> v. 13. which was by putting ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring queſtions; that by his anſwers they might get ſomething againſt him. One of the queſtions they put was, Whether it was lawful to <hi>give Tribute to Caeſar</hi> or not? In which Chriſt ſaw thro' all their hypocriſy &amp; cunning: and gave them an anſwer, which raiſed their admiration; but gave them no handle againſt him. — Then came the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009326_0005_1030EE07972D74D8"/>Sadducees with their puzzling queſtion <hi>about the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> To which Chriſt anſwered, ſo as not only to put them to ſilence, but to convince them of their error, and their infidelity, if they had not been prejudiced againſt him.</p>
            <p>And now, one of the Scribes (the perſon our text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to) being preſent; and hearing how well, and how wiſely Chriſt anſwered the Phariſees and the Sadducees; takes his turn and puts his queſtion, ſaying to him; <hi>Which is the firſt Commandment of all?</hi> The queſtion being put in a plain manner, and as if he aimed rather at being inſtructed, than to get any thing againſt Chriſt in his anſwer; Chriſt anſwers him directly to the queſtion; and tells him, that to <hi>love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our ſoul, and with all our ſtrength, was the firſt Commandment;</hi> and goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the ſcribe's queſtion, and tells him, which was the ſecond, as well as the firſt Commandment, namely <hi>to love his neighbour as himſelf:</hi> and aſſures him, that there is <hi>no other Commandment greater than theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scribe fell fully in with our Saviour's anſwer, and freely acknowledges it, and deſcants upon it, ſaying, <hi>well Maſter thou haſt ſaid the truth;</hi> and going over the two commandments, he declares them to be his own principles, ſaying, <hi>There is one God, and there is none other but he, and to love him with all the underſtanding, and with all the ſoul, and with all the ſtrength, and to love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices.</hi> There was ſo much wiſdom and truth, as well as freedom, openneſs &amp; honeſtly appearing in this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that Chriſt commends it, and commends him for it: <hi>for when Jeſus ſaw that he anſwered diſcreetly, he ſaid unto him, thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I propoſe is to ſearch into the meaning of the text; and ſee what there was in this man, this ſcribe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what there was in the other ſcribes, or phariſees, that ſhould induce Chriſt to ſay of him, that <hi>he was not far from the kingdom of God:</hi> whereas the others were ſo
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009326_0006_1030EE092FBCA078"/>far from it, that he tells them <hi>Publicans &amp; Harlots would go into the Kingdom of God before them.</hi> Matth. 21.31. When Chriſt declared ſo diſtinguiſhingly of this ſcribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt, it does not appear to be by vertue of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, and power to ſearch the heart; but he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thus upon him, from the diſcovery he made of himſelf in his anſwer. And when Jeſus ſaw that <hi>he anſwered diſcreetly,</hi> he ſaid, thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>To handle this ſubject in as diſtinct and clear a manner as I can — I propoſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Briefly to ſhow what we are to underſtand by the Kingdom of God, which the ſcribe was not far from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider the <hi>ſcribe's anſwer,</hi> and the ſeveral things which are contained therein, and ſee what there is in the <hi>anſwer,</hi> that bids fair for the <hi>kingdom of God,</hi> or ſhewed that he was not far from it.</p>
            <p>And as I go along, I ſhall make ſuch application of the ſeveral points, as may be inſtructive and profitable to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the phraſe here <hi>the Kingdom of God;</hi> and what is to be underſtood by it.</p>
            <p>Now it undoubtedly intends the <hi>goſpel kingdom,</hi> or the kingdom of grace, as it is exhibited and diſplayed in the goſpel, which diſpenſation of grace began to be ſet up in our Saviour's time.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we find John the Baptiſt and forerunner of Chriſt, preaching up repentance, ſaying <hi>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</hi> Matth. iii. 2. And Chriſt himſelf began his publick miniſtry declaring the ſame thing, <hi>Matth.</hi> iv. 7. The kingdom of heaven is the ſame with the kingdom of God, and promiſcuouſly uſed in the new teſtament.</p>
            <p>This kingdom of God is that diſpenſation which opens the grand myſtery of man's redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, in the cleareſt and fulleſt manner, that mankind has ever been ſavoured with. A diſpenſation that ſets forth the ſin and ruin of man, and his recovery by Jeſus Chriſt. It ſets forth and declares all the world guilty before God; and that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009326_0007_1030EE0C954F3340"/>and that by his obedience and death he is become the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. The kingdom of God, or goſpel kingdom, exhibits Chriſt to us, as the prophet, prieſt and king of our ſalvation; and iſſues forth this proclamation of grace in his name, He that <hi>believeth,</hi> that is on the Son of God, <hi>and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Ma<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. xvi. 16. giving out many encouraging calls and endearing invitations, ſetting forth the richneſs and freeneſs of divine grace; and that the whole kingdom from the foundation to the top-ſtone is of grace; that <hi>by grace we are ſaved thro' faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God; not of works leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Eph. ii. 8.9. For this goſpel kingdom is a kingdom in which all boaſting is forever excluded as to our ſelves, both as to ſtrength as well as righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of God is begun in this world. Every profeſſing chriſtian is a viſible member of this kingdom: every true chriſtian is a real member or ſubject of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and as to ſuch true believers in Chriſt,—the kingdom of grace is carried on in this world, and perfected in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; where there will be the completion, or perfection of the kingdom of grace in glory.</p>
            <p>So then, from what has been ſaid it appears, that the coming into this kingdom of God, is the becoming true chriſtians; and the actual coming into this kingdom or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming true chriſtians, comprehends in it; firſt of all, a very deep ſenſe of our loſt and wretched ſtate by reaſon of ſin; and of our own utter inability to help or ſave our ſelves: and ſo of the abſolute need we ſtand in of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and <hi>that a great one.</hi> It alſo comprehends in it a ſincere belief that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the only, and the all-ſufficient Saviour, able to ſave to the uttermoſt all who come to God by him; and that we actually receive him, as he is revealed and offered to us in his goſpel, and from a grateful ſenſe of his infinite love and grace as well as of his authority and power, freely yield our ſelves to his honour and ſervice, to glorify him in our bodies and with our ſpirits which are his; living as his grace teaches us; running the race that is ſet before us, all the while
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009326_0008_1030EE0E71FEBC90"/>looking to Jeſus as the author and finiſher of our faith; and as the grand medium of intercourſe between God and us, and by whom all ſpiritual and ſaving bleſſings are conveyed to us.</p>
            <p>Every one who has come to ſuch a ſenſe of things, to ſuch a faith in Chriſt, and ſubjection to him, is actually born, brought into this kingdom of God, and is a true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Let us now conſider the Scribe's anſwer, and ſee what there was in it; which diſcovered that he was not far from the kingdom of God:</hi> And that he was nearer to it than the other Scribes Phariſees, and Sadducees, or the Jews in general.</p>
            <p>For the opening and illuſtrating this Point;</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would obſerve that the <hi>Jewiſh nation had many things peculiar to them, that might ſerve to prepare them for the goſpel kingdom, and ſo it might be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they would not be far from the kingdom of God; but ready to enter into it, whenever it ſhould come among them.</hi>

            <p>No people had advantages equal with the Jews for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the nature of the goſpel kingdom: and ſuch encouragements to come into it, as they had at firſt; for really the kingdom of God, under a different diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had been among them from <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. They had the advantage much every way; chiefly that unto them <hi>were committed the oracles of God:</hi> for in thoſe ſacred oracles, they were taught the fall of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and how ſin and ruin firſt came into the world. And the old teſtament, as it taught them the ſinfulneſs of man, ſo it taught them the need of a Saviour, and gave them the promiſe of one, even of the <hi>ſeed of the woman;</hi> and a multitude of promiſes, conſequent upon this, and to open and inlighten the ſame unto them. By the old teſtament it was revealed to them, that this Saviour, the ſeed of the woman, ſhould be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> their anceſtor, of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the lineage of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009326_0009_1030EE133AB90908"/>
               <hi>David</hi> that he ſhould be born of a virgin, &amp; in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea.</hi> Moreover, it was foretold in their prophecies, that he ſhould appear in a ſtate of humiliation, ſo as to be deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief; yea, that he ſhould be wounded for our tranſgreſſions, that he ſhould pour out his ſoul unto death, bear the ſins of many, and make interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors: and then ſhould paſs from that ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, to a ſtate of exaltation &amp; glory; when he ſhould ſee his ſeed, and his kingdom ſhould enlarge in the world, and he ſhould be a light to the gentiles, as well as the glory of his people Iſrael. Nay, the prophecies of the old teſtament went ſo far, as to point out the very time when the great Saviour ſhould appear and ſet up his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel kingdom, Dan. ix. 24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finiſh tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs &amp;c.</hi> which prophecy was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of weeks of years, viz. 400 years, which brought it to the time that our Lord Jeſus actually appeared: and accordingly, there was a general expectation of the Meſſiah in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>And now one would think that a nation and people fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a multitude of ſuch promiſes as theſe, and brought up from generation to generation in the belief of the Meſſiah to come, ſhould be the neareſt to the kingdom, and the moſt ready of any people in the world to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the goſpel kingdom of the Meſſiah, ſo ſoon as ever it came among them, and was publiſhed to them: which was done to them, before it was to any other people: for he was ſent in the firſt place to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, when we conſider what the apoſtle ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, Rom. ix. 4.5. <hi>That to them pertained the adoption and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes; and of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all God bleſſed for ever;</hi> I ſay, conſidering theſe things, what could be thought, but that upon the news of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009326_0010_1030EE17A1554B70"/>Meſſiah, and ſetting up of his kingdom, the Jews from all quarters would flock in unto him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Notwithſtanding the Jews had ſuch advantages of being near the kingdom of God, and of entering into it; yet by reaſon of their horrible corruption, pride and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe conſtruction of things; perhaps no people as ſuch were farther from the kingdom than they.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That nation abuſed the ſpecial favours of God to them; and grew very corrupt and wicked, proud and perverſe: and ſo put proud and perverſe, corrupt and carnal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations upon the law, and upon the promiſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning the Meſſiah's kingdom. For they ſeem'd to forget all that was predicted concerning his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and making his ſoul an offering for ſin: and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for a Meſſiah, who ſhould ſet up his kingdom with external power and pomp; giving them (the Jews) the preheminence &amp; dominion over all other nations—More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, by a perverſe, corrupt conſtruction of the law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conſtruing it as forbidding <hi>only</hi> the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and groſs acts: they, eſpecially the ſcribes and pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, grew very ſelf-righteous, ſo as not to ſee the need of a ſuffering, and an atoning Saviour: nor did they ſee the neceſſity of regeneration, or change of heart, which is ſo neceſſary to our entering into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>So that when the Meſſiah actually came, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was among them; it was ſo different from their carnal apprehenſions, and vain proud thoughts relating to the kingdom, that they were prejudiced againſt it. They could not bear to have him who profeſſed to be the Meſſiah, make ſuch a poor outward appearance; and to take a number of poor illiterate fiſhermen for his diſciples, and the chief miniſters of his kingdom, rather than the great men, the learned Rabbies of their own nation: and his expounding the law in ſuch an extenſive ſpiritual ſenſe, beyond what they did; and his reproving them ſo plainly for their pride, hyprocriſy and wickedneſs, ſet them againſt him, his perſon, his doctrine and his kingdom; ſo as to pour the greateſt contempt upon the ſame; endeavoring <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009326_0011_1030EE1CBB615AE0"/>methods to ſuppreſs his pretenſions to the Meſſiah-ſhip, yea to kill him, and get him out of the way.</p>
            <p>And thus that people who had the advantage of being neareſt the kingdom of God, were really further from it, in their temper and diſpoſition perhaps, than any people in the world. And agreably to this ſays our Saviour, Matth. viii. 11.12. <hi>Many ſhall come from the eaſt and weſt, and ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven: but the children of the kingdom</hi> (that is the Jews) <hi>ſhall be caſt out.</hi> And again Matth. xxi. 31. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</hi> The pride and ſelf-righteous ſpirit of the ſcribes and phariſees, their groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the law, their hypocriſy, their prejudice againſt the perſon of Chriſt, were ſuch that even publicans and harlots were nearer the kingdom of God, more ready to receive the goſpel than they. And he who conſiders the nature of ſpiritual pride, ſelf-righteouſneſs, corrupt noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in religion handed down to poſterity, together with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and perverſeneſs of ſpirit, muſt needs ſee that they are qualities which ſet us at the greateſt diſtance from the kingdom of God: and that publicans &amp; harlots, and ſuch ſinners, who are conſcious of their evil ways, ſeem to be more eaſily convinced and perſwaded, than ſuch ſort of people.</p>
            <p>But the ſcribe in my text differed from his brethren; and how far ſo ever they were from the kingdom of God, yet he was not far from it, as Chriſt the trueſt and beſt judge in the matter, aſſerts and declares.</p>
            <p>And ſo I am brought to conſider, what there was in this ſcribe's anſwer, which ſhew'd he was not far from the kingdom of God; or what there was in his anſwer, that diſcovered he was in any ſort better prepared to embrace chriſtianity, and enter the goſpel kingdom than others.—</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall,</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider, the character which is given of his anſwer in general, viz. that he <hi>anſwered diſcreetly.</hi> And then</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009326_0012_1030EE20B9235990"/>Secondly, conſider the matter of the anſwer it ſelf, and the ſeveral things contained therein; which may give us to ſee how near he was to the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the character which is given of his anſwer in general, viz. that he anſwered <hi>diſcreetly,</hi> that is <hi>underſtandingly</hi> and <hi>wiſely,</hi> as the word ſignifies.</p>
            <p>He did not anſwer ignorantly, perverſely, or ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. He did not anſwer with ſubtility and craft, as if he had any particular private deſign of his own in view, or any point to gain, or any intangling ſnare to guard againſt. He does not appear to anſwer with low cunning, and want of honeſty, as the prieſts and ſcribes anſwered our Saviour, when he aſked them, whether the <hi>baptiſm of John was from heaven, or of men? and they reaſoned with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying; if we ſhall ſay from heaven, he will then ſay, why believed ye him not? and if we ſay of men, all the people will ſtone us, therefore they ſaid, we cannot tell whence it was,</hi> Luk. xx. 4 — 7. They could have told at leaſt what they thought about the matter: but fearing leſt by anſwering either way, they ſhould bring themſelves into a ſnare; they evaded the matter, by ſaying, they could not tell.— But there appears no ſuch craftineſs or deceit in the anſwer of this ſcribe; for he appears to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer truly, yea honeſtly; and what he really thought to be the truth. His anſwer don't ſeem to be the effect of pride, or paſſion, or fear, or bias to any particular party; nor does it ſeem to ſavour of prejudice or perverſeneſs: for his anſwer was a true and a good anſwer; and ſuch an one as he ought to have given, exactly correſponding with what Chriſt himſelf had ſaid in the foregoing verſes. Moreover, it appears to be delivered with an air of honeſty, and as his real opinion. This ſcribe by the queſtion he aſked at firſt, and by this his reply to Chriſt's anſwer, ſeems to have been an honeſt enquirer after truth; and was willing freely to own it, whenever it appeared to him. And upon this account he may be ſaid to be not far; at leaſt not ſo far from the kingdom of God as ſome others; but in a fairer way to embrace the chriſtian ſcheme, than
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009326_0013_1030EE225D21BBB0"/>his brethren. Who anſwered and acted with craft and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, under the influence of pride, obſtinacy and hypocriſy.</p>
            <p>Thus a man having true thoughts, and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as to the doctrines, principles and precepts of chriſtianity, and a diſpoſition to ſpeak of the ſubſtantial points of religion, without any trimming or turning or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating, is not ſo far from the kingdom of God; but is better prepared to receive the chriſtian faith, and come into the goſpel kingdom, than he who is ignorant, and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; who is proud and perverſe; inſincere and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tical, and who wilfully blinds his own eyes, and ſuppreſſes the convictions of his own conſcience.</p>
            <p>And now, who will deny but that there are men of ſuch different characters, at leſt as to degrees? And ſurely we may ſay, that the more knowing and underſtanding, the more free from guile and hypocriſy, and pride and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice any are; they are nearer to the kingdom of God, than thoſe who have leſs knowledge, and more pride, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and hypocriſy.—I do not ſay, that theſe ſhall be actually brought into the kingdom of God, or made true chriſtians before the others: for who may preſume to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the power and grace of God, who can, if he pleaſes, bring the remoteſt from this kingdom, into it at once; and make the moſt unpromiſing wretches upon earth, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his grace? But this no ways denies, but that the more underſtanding, and the more ſound in judgment, and the more free from pride and hypocriſy, they are not ſo far from the kingdom of God as ſome others are.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the anſwer in general, that it was a diſcreet wiſe anſwer.— I now proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider <hi>the anſwer it ſelf</hi> given by the ſcribe, and ſee what there is in it, which gave occaſion for Chriſt to ſay to him, that he was <hi>not far from the kingdom of God;</hi> but rather bid fair for becoming a chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The anſwer acknowledges and declares, that which is the fundamental principle of all true religion, viz. <hi>The being of a God, and the unity of the God-head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009326_0014_1030EE23F3F4E358"/>And the ſcribe ſaid unto him, <hi>Well maſter, thou haſt ſaid the truth: for there is one God, and none other but he;</hi> as in the verſe but one before my text. Here you ſee, he believed there is a God: and this is the foundation of all religion; for religion and every act thereof ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the being of a God: <hi>for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeez him,</hi> Heb. xi. 6. Now, in this point he was not ſo far from the kingdom of God, as thoſe <hi>athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical fools</hi> who ſay in their hearts, <hi>there is no God.</hi> There was not ſo much to do to bring him into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as there would be to ſuch an one who does not ſo much as believe there is a God: for the atheiſt muſt be brought to the faith of that which the ſcribe believed already. So that he who believes there is a God, is at leaſt one ſtep nearer to the kingdom of God, than he who don't ſo much as believe there is a God, or any kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>But then, the ſcribe not only believed there was a God, but that there was only one God. There is <hi>one God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and none other but he.</hi> The faith he profeſſed was that there was but one only living &amp; true God. Well, this is a ſtep nearer than thoſe who multiply gods, and ſo the objects of their worſhip, and pay religious ſervice to a number of feigned deities, which is due only to the one true &amp; living God. Accordingly in this reſpect the ſcribe might be ſaid, not to be ſo far from the kingdom of God, as the heathen world at that day, who had a multitude of gods, to whom they paid religious worſhip: ſuch as the ſun, and moon, four-footed beaſts, and creeping things, and graven images. For before theſe can come into the kingdom of God, they muſt be turned from all theſe dumb idols; muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the ſin and folly of idolatry, and muſt renounce it, which the ſcribe implicitly does in his anſwer: and ſo was nearer than thoſe who were ſwallowed up in ignorance and idolatry.</p>
            <p>And thus, ſuch who have right notions of the Godhead as to the unity thereof; and ſo of the one only object of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, are nearer the kingdom of God, than ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009326_0015_1030EE27A72EA7A8"/>who multiply objects of religious worſhip, and divide the glory due only to God, with ſome of his creatures: as ſuch who worſhip the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and pray to Angels, and ſaints departed, as if they heard and knew, and were able to help and ſave. The divine precept is, <hi>Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Matth. iv. 10. Accordingly, ſuch who embrace the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant principles, which renounce all idolatry, are in that reſpect nearer the kingdom of God, than thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the idolatrous principles of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His anſwer made a proper <hi>diſtinction between the moral and the ceremonial law; and acknowledges the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to be much preferable, to all the ceremonies and moſt coſtly ſacrifices under the moſaic oeconomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thus the ſcribe anſwers: and <hi>to love him with all the heart &amp;c. and to love his neighbour as himſelf, is more than all whole burnt offerings &amp; ſacrifices.</hi> As in the v. before my text. To love God with all the heart &amp; ſoul; and our neighbour as our ſelves; is the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the moral law: and this he freely acknowledges to be more than all whole burnt offerings, and ſacrifices, which may be conſidered as the ſum of the ceremonial law, or of poſitive inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>It was a matter of no ſmall diſpute among the Jews, which was the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>greateſt</hi> commandment. Some pleaded for <hi>circumciſion;</hi> which precept was given to their father <hi>Abraham</hi> as a ſeal of the covenant. Others pleaded for the <hi>philacteries,</hi> which were certain portions of the law, written of ſtrips of parchment, that they wore upon their foreheads and upon their arms; agreable to what is commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii. 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 8, 11 — 18. Now theſe portions of the law being written and ſet forth in ſuch a conſpicuous manner, were frequently repeated by thoſe who wore them. And our Saviour obſerves of the ſcribes and phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 5. <hi>that they made broad their philacteries,</hi> out of oſtentation and ſhow: and no wonder if they pleaded for the precepts inſcribed on their philacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as the greateſt commandments; among which was the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009326_0016_1030EE2E5E23A708"/>law of the paſſover; the ſanctifying the firſt-born of men; and ſetting apart of firſtlings of beaſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii. <hi>begin</hi> Others pleaded for the <hi>law of ſacrifices, purification</hi> and <hi>keeping feſtivals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, this ſcribe ſeems to underſtand the difference between moral precepts and meerly poſitive inſtitutions; and gives the preference to the precepts of morality: To love God with all the heart, and our neighbour as our ſelf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices. The language of the jewiſh practice was, as if burnt-offerings and ſacrifices were the great commandment; For theſe, they were obſervant of, and had great dependance upon, and upon occaſion would abound in them, even while they neglected the love of God, and of their neighbour. Nay our Saviour obſerves concerning them, that they were ſo critical and nice, as to tythe their <hi>mint, anniſe</hi> and <hi>cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and ſuch like herbs; when at the ſame time they neglected the weightier matters of the law, <hi>judgment, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, faith,</hi> and the <hi>love of God,</hi> Matth. xxiii. 23. Luk. xi. 42.</p>
            <p>But this ſcribe underſtood the nature of true religion, and wherein it conſiſts better than this came to. He freely and fully gave the preference to the moral law; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the love of God, and of our neighbour, are greater commandments, and of greater importance reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than all the ſacrifices, and ceremonies of the jewiſh law. In this reſpect he was orthodox and ſound in his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and judged truly in the caſe; for the oracles of truth teach us, that God hath not ſuch delight in burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord; and that to obey, eſpecially this great commandment of love, is better than ſacrifice; and to hearken than the fat of rams, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 22. And to do juſtice and judgment (which implies love to our neighbour,) is more acceptable to the Lord than ſacrifice, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxi. 3.</p>
            <p>Now who can ſay this ſcribe was ſo far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as thoſe who had very different and ſo very falſe apprehenſions of theſe things? and who placed their religion in circumciſion, or the ſacrifices and ceremonies of the jewiſh church, rather than in thoſe two great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009326_0017_1030EE300FCEDC18"/>of love to God and our neighbour? For the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, or the goſpel kingdom, has laid aſide all the ſacrifices and ceremonies of the jewiſh law; and is a more plain and ſimple diſpenſation; the ſubſtantial parts of which are ſupreme love to God, and Chriſt, and ſincere fervent charity one to another: all excited by or grounded upon a true faith in Chriſt. Says the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5. The end of the commandment, that is the completion, or perfection of the goſpel diſpenſation, is LOVE, out of a pure heart, and a good conſcience, and faith unfeigned.— Surely then, this ſcribe, who at leaſt maintained this in theory, was not ſo far from the kingdom, as thoſe who placed their religion in ſacrifices, purifications, and the punctilio's of the moſaic law, or of their oral traditions: for this error in their underſtanding and judgment, muſt be corrected &amp; rectified; before they would be even with him reſpecting the goſpel kingdom.</p>
            <p>And thus we may confidently aſſert, that ſuch who do ſo well underſtand religion, as to be able truly to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the weightier and leſſer matters of the goſpel; between the eſſentials, and circumſtantials of chriſtianity; are not ſo far from this kingdom, as thoſe who groſly miſtake in this point; and place their religion more in the outward form and appearance, than in the truth and reality of it; and who lay more ſtreſs upon the outward ſervices, and inſtituted parts of religion, than upon the moral part thereof. So that under the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſuch perſons as place their religion in outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and ſervices, and ſatisfy themſelves with the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening ſacrifices of prayer and praiſe, and with the public worſhip, and religious ſervices of the ſabbath, without ſeeking after that faith in Chriſt, that love to God and their neighbour, which the goſpel requires, are not ſo near the kingdom of God, as they who look upon faith, repentance, love and holineſs, to be the great things of religion: and who attend upon the poſitive inſtituted parts of religion, not as if the kingdom of God conſiſted in them, but as means of God's appointing to attain thoſe ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial vertues and graces, in which the goſpel kingdom doth
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009326_0018_1030EE319E1395C0"/>conſiſt. <hi>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. xiv. 17.</p>
            <p>Many people are apt to deceive themſelves, and think they are near the kingdom of heaven: yea, that they are actually in the kingdom of grace; becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in attending religious worſhip, &amp; go on in a round of duties; when perhaps they have little or no regard to the love of God or of their neighbour; but with all this round of religious duties, indulge themſelves in pride, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, envy, hatred and malice. Theſe, altho' they may be near in the eye of the world, as well as in their own conceit, yet are really far from the kingdom, and without a rectifying their underſtanding and judgment, as well as a change of their will and inclination, they will not ſee the kingdom of God, or become real chriſtians: whereas the man who is doctrinally knowing in this matter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that faith and repentance, love and holineſs, are the great things of chriſtianity; and the poſitive precepts and inſtituted duties, are the appointed means to bring us to this, is not ſuch an error as the former.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we are not to make the diſtinction ſo wide between the inſtituted means of grace, and the grace it ſelf, as to neglect the means, under a pretence that we are looking after the end, the ſubſtantial parts of religion: for he who overlooks and neglects the inſtituted means, ſuch as prayer, the word and ordinances, has not really a proper regard for the ſubſtantial parts of religion as the end: for the goſpel not only requires faith, love and holineſs, as the great things of the kingdom: but it requires our diligent &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance on the poſitive and inſtituted parts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch as reading, hearing, praying, and walking in all the ordinances, which are appointed as means of obtaining grace; or of growth therein. For altho' theſe duties may not be reſted in; yet they muſt obſerved by us. The weightier matters muſt be above all regarded; but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms of divine appointment may not be neglected.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009326_0019_1030EE3520956E40"/>3. <hi>The ſcribe's anſwer was free from the common error and corruption of that day; as if it was only an external conformity that the law required: whereas he acknowleges that the commandment reached to the heart, and required the inward eſteem and affections of the ſoul, as well as the outward expreſſions of love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His anſwer is, and to love the Lord with the <hi>heart,</hi> and with the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and with the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and with the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and to love his neighbour as <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews at that day had ſo corrupted the written word with their oral traditions, as to make religion to be a meer outſide thing, a meer form, a carcaſs without any life and ſpirit to animate it: and as if the heart had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or but little to do in the matter. For although the written word they then had, taught them that God looketh at the heart, and <hi>that he required truth in the inward parts.</hi> Pſal. li. 5. yea and that God <hi>demanded the heart,</hi> Prov. xxiii. 26. yet by ſome means or other, they had ſo perverted theſe and ſuch like places of ſcripture, as to bring their religion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to the outſide, &amp; as if the inner man had but little to do in their religious ſervices. And this appears from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plain hints and reproofs which Chriſt gave them in this matter at one time and another; but more eſpecially in his ſermon upon the mount; one evident deſign of which was to reſcue the law from the falſe gloſſes, which the ſcribes and phariſees had put upon it; whereby they had taken away the ſpirit of the law, and confin'd it to the groſſer acts; and as if the heart and ſpirit of the man was no way concerned with the law. Matth. v. 21. <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill: and whoſever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the judgment: but I ſay unto you, whoſoever is ANGRY with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the judgment.</hi> By which it appeared that they conſtrued the ſixth commandment, as forbidding only groſs actual murder: and that if they did not actually kill a perſon, they did not break this commandment. But now our Saviour would have them to know, that this law reached their very ſpirit; and that if they ſuffered their ſpirits to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009326_0020_1030EE3B9981E458"/>riſe ſo much as into anger without a cauſe, they tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this law. They little thought when they indulged cauſeleſs and raſh anger, hatred, wrath, deſire of revenge, that they brake this law.—So <hi>again, ye have heard, that it hath been ſaid, thou ſhalt not commit adultery: but I ſay unto you, whoſoever lacketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> chap. v. 27.28. By which it appears, as if the doctrine of that day was, that only the groſs act of adultery was forbidden by that commandment. But here he corrects their error, and gives them to underſtand that the law was more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and extenſive in it's requirements than this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſo much as unchaſte thoughts and deſires indulged, were breaches of this commandment: Furthermore, the <hi>wo</hi> that Chriſt pronounces upon them for <hi>making clean only the outſide of the cup or platter,</hi> Matth. xxiii. 35. plainly ſhews, that an outſide religion was what they taught and practiſed, without any proper regard to the Heart.</p>
            <p>The Scribe ſeems by his anſwer to underſtand that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was inward as well as outward; that to love God and his neighbour, was not to love in word and in tongue only, or in ſome outward expreſſions of love: but to love with the heart, indeed and in truth. The Scribe's anſwer conſiders the heart and ſoul as the ſeat of this love: and that the commandment reached to the heart, and to all that is within him.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch a true apprehenſion of religion, ſhew'd, that he was not ſo far from the kingdom of God as his brethren ſcribes and phariſees, who taught the law as reaching only to the outward man. His anſwer diſcovers a true thought of religion, and that it lay in the heart, as well as in the outer man. And ſurely this is a ſtep, a large ſtep towards true chriſtianity, nearer than thoſe who adhered to the meer lettter of the law, without any regard to the ſpirit of the ſame. Conſider how much further they muſt needs be from true chriſtianity, who make religion all an outſide thing; than he who in his principles &amp; profeſſion extends it to the heart and ſoul, and all the powers of the inner man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:009326_0021_1030EE3D633A8630"/>From whence we may argue, that ſuch who maintain this principle, that religion is ſpiritual, and reaches to all the powers and affections of the ſoul, as well as to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and members of the body, are not ſo far from the kingdom of God, as ſuch who place all their religion in the outſide and bodily part. Varying the terms, and putting chriſtian inſtead of jew; and chriſtianity inſtead of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; we may adopt the words of the apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 28, 29. and ſay, <hi>He is not a chriſtian, who is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; But he is a chriſtian, who is one inwardly. — For chriſtianity is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then, we may ſee that they who place religion in the heart and ſpirit, as well as outer man; are much nearer the kingdom of God, than ſuch who place all their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in outward forms and modes of worſhip, and in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal expreſſions of love and regard to God, without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their hearts, to ſee that they be right with him. What a poor religion muſt that be, that is only in the letter, but not in the ſpirit? and how remote muſt they be from true chriſtianity, who place it all in ſome outward form, and appearance, and look no further? whereas the man who in his judgment, places religion in the heart, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he has not attained to this inward gracious principle himſelf; yet appears to be in a much fairer way for it than the former. For by conſidering the law of God in its large extent, as reaching to the heart, the thoughts, deſires and intents of it, as well as to the outward man, the man is in a much fairer way to conviction, which is a ſtep to repentance: for whilſt the man conſiders the law as reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his heart, he is led to ſee innumerable ſins in his heart which the other is inſenſible of. And ſuch an one cannot but ſee a deal of corruption and wickedneſs wtihin, which the other thinks nothing of; ſo that this man who ſees the law reaching his heart, is one ſtep nearer to conviction than the other. The apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when phariſee, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law in the oldneſs of the letter, without extending it to the inner man, was blameleſs and righteous in his own eyes: but when he ſaw the ſpirituality of the law; and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009326_0022_1030EE3EF1B44610"/>how it's precepts reached to the heart, and all the inner man; then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> revived, then he had a ſenſe of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which he never had before. But without ſuppoſing the eyes to be opened to ſuch a degree, and in ſuch a ſpiritual and ſaving manner, by the ſpirit of God, as the apoſtle's were: it may be truly ſaid, that a ſpeculative apprehenſion of the extenſiveneſs of the divine law, reaching to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, deſires and purpoſes of the heart, lays a man much more fairly open to conviction, than he who is inſenſible of this; and has no apprehenſion of either the ſins or duties of the heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Scribe's anſwer ſhow'd, that he underſtood LOVE to be the grand, and even univerſal principle of all true religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Says he, to LOVE God with the heart, underſtanding, ſtrength and ſoul; and to LOVE his neighbour as himſelf, is more than all burnt-offerings, and ſacrifices. So that he by his anſwer underſtood LOVE, the love of God eſpecially that was the main thing in religion and the grand ſpring or principle, from whence any religious ſervices are performed in an acceptable manner. His anſwer plainly intimates, that there is nothing in religion equal with <hi>Love.</hi> The anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer fully falls in with what Chriſt had juſt before ſaid, that the firſt commandment was to love the Lord with all thine heart &amp;c. this is the firſt commandment: it is the great commandment of all; it is the life and ſoul and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of every thing elſe in religion, without the love of God reſting in the heart, all acts of religion are but dead formality.</p>
            <p>And now, as the ſcribe by his anſwer ſeems to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this; he was advanced a conſiderable ſtep towards the kingdom of God, to what others were, who placed the eſſence of religion in any thing beſides <hi>Love:</hi> even altho' they ſhould place it in the moſt difficult and moſt ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying acts of obedience and ſubmiſſion to God. Some are apt to place religion in a fear and dread of the divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and in a ſort of ſervile obedience and ſubmiſſion to his will, in voluntary humility, in mortifications and ſelf-denials, without conſidering <hi>that love</hi> which is the neceſſary
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009326_0023_1030EE408401B9F0"/>ingredient and eſſential principle of every thing in religion; they labour under groſs miſtakes in religion, for thus ſays the apoſtle, <hi>Though I have the gift of prophecy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge; and though I had all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains: and though I be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> my goods to feed the poor; and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity,</hi> or love <hi>I am nothing, and it all profiteth me nothing.</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 23. Religion without love is bondage and ſlavery ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than glorious liberty; and would be a meer taſk and burden, rather than delightful to the ſoul. It is <hi>love</hi> which renders the ways of religion, ways of pleaſantneſs; and more delightful than all riches, or indeed than neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food.</p>
            <p>And therefore when men's ſentiments are ſo rectified (as they were in ſome degree in this ſcribe) as to ſee love to be the ſoul of religion; and the very thing that gives us pleaſure in religion, &amp; renders the ſame thro' Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the great object of religion, they are not far from the kingdom of God. For love is the cardinal grace in the chriſtian ſcheme. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 13. <hi>Now abideth faith, hope and love; but the greateſt of there is love:</hi> our bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble renders it <hi>charity,</hi> but the word is <hi>love;</hi> ſo in the forementioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5. The <hi>end of the commandment,</hi> or the perfection of the goſpel diſpenſation <hi>is love,</hi> out of a pure heart, a good conſcience, and faith unfeigned.</p>
            <p>Indeed, faith ſeems to ſtand firſt in the goſpel ſcheme; hence this was the goſpel that the apoſtles were ſent forth to preach every where: <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, Mark</hi> xvi. 10. and we are ſaid, <hi>to be ſaved by grace, through faith; Eph.</hi> ii. 8. But then that faith which is ſaving worketh, or is made perfect by love. It is love that animates the faith, and makes it a living ſaving faith, without which it is a dead faith, and will profit nothing.</p>
            <p>So that if you would but ſo much as get near the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, you muſt get well poſſeſſed of this one point, that <hi>love</hi> is of the very eſſence of chriſtianity, the very life and ſoul of it, without which no religion can be pleaſing to God, or pleaſant or profitable to our ſelves.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009326_0024_1030EE474072FD80"/>For altho' <hi>faith</hi> be the baſis of all true religion, becauſe he that cometh unto God, muſt believe that he is; and ſo he who cometh to Chriſt, and becomes a ſubject of his kingdom, muſt believe that he is the Son of the living God, and the Saviour of ſinners: yet if a man ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that barely ſuch a faith is the ſum and ſubſtance of true chriſtianity, and that ſuch a faith is of it ſelf and by it ſelf a ſaving faith, they ſet up a dead faith for a ſaving faith, and ſet up that for ſaving religion, that has neither ſpirit, nor favour, nor reliſh in it. For <hi>love</hi> ſeems to be a fulfilling of the goſpel, as well as of the law. So that there is no faith that will ſave without love; no fear, no hope, no repentance, no obedience, no acts of devotion that are to any ſaving purpoſe without love. O then, may we be well poſſeſſed of this point in theory, and let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after ſuch a ſupreme love to God, and ſuch a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative love to the Lord Jeſus; and ſuch a ſincere fervent charity one to another, which is the very life and ſoul of chriſtianity, and in which the kingdom of God conſiſts. May God by his bleſſed Spirit ſhed abroad this love into our ſouls!</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſcribe's anſwer diſcovered that he underſtood the commandment of the law required <hi>perfect love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any defect or falling ſhort therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is, ſays the ſcribe, to love him with <hi>all</hi> the heart, and with <hi>all</hi> the underſtanding, with <hi>all</hi> the ſoul, and with <hi>all</hi> the ſtrength. So that here we ſee the ſcribe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the commandment of the law requir'd perfect love, the love of the whole man to the utmoſt extent of human power, without the leaſt failing or falling ſhort therein. There muſt be no time, not ſo much as one moment, but what God muſt have the <hi>whole</hi> love of the <hi>whole</hi> heart and ſoul, without the leaſt abatement: For the law don't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the leaſt defect or failing.</p>
            <p>But here you may be ready to aſk, how this <hi>ſentiment</hi> concerning the law and commandment ſerved to bring him nearer to the kingdom of God?</p>
            <p>To which, I would anſwer and ſay, that conſidering this ſentiment in the anſwer of the ſcribe, with the plain,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009326_0025_1030EE4A69594BF0"/>obvious and natural conſequences of the ſame; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is no one ſentiment in the ſcribe's anſwer that led more directly to the kingdom of God, or kingdom of grace, than this.</p>
            <p>For let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this muſt needs afford matter of conviction to him that he had tranſgreſſed this commandment, and was guilty before God. — For when he conſiders what he ſays, that the firſt and great commandment is, to love the Lord our God, with <hi>all</hi> the heart, and with <hi>all</hi> the ſoul, and with <hi>all</hi> the ſtrength, and his neighbour as <hi>himſelf;</hi> he muſt ſee if he look'd into himſelf, and back upon his paſt life, that he had not come up to this commandment; but had fallen ſhort of it in innumerable inſtances: and indeed that he never did in one inſtance come up to this commandment: that he did not then at that time; and that he never did love God with <hi>all</hi> his heart, and with <hi>all</hi> his ſoul. Nay, if he would but examine himſelf with any tolerable care or impartiality, he would find that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of loving God with <hi>all</hi> his heart, he did not love him with any heartineſs or ſincerity at all: but th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> inſtead thereof the world, and the things which are in the world, ſuch as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, had gotten his heart, his underſtanding, his ſoul, and all his ſtrength. And that inſtead of being devoted entirely to God, the world and ſelf had engroſs'd his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, his thoughts, his time, and all his care.</p>
            <p>What muſt that man think of himſelf and of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who allows that the firſt and great commandment is to love the Lord his God with <hi>all</hi> his heart, ſoul, &amp; ſtrength, and finds that he himſelf falls utterly ſhort of it; ſo as never in one inſtance in all his life to come up to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? Would not his ſhew the man that he is a ſinner, a great ſinner, who has tranſgreſſed this great and good commandment, and never once in all his life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with it? And how can he help thinking that God is infinitely angry at him, for denying to him that perfect ſupreme love which he demands, and which is infinitely
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009326_0026_1030EE4C0103CFB8"/>due to him: and giving his heart and affections to ſome inferior creature or other? And how can he help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is expoſed to the divine reſentment, and lies open to the dreadful wrath, and almighty vengeance of that God from whom he has with-held that love and ſervice which he demanded, and is infinitely due to him? And when the man has gone on in ſuch a natural train of thinking as this, what can remain to him, but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to devour him?</p>
            <p>Now what ſituation of mind is nearer the kingdom of God than this? What temper of mind better prepared to hearken to the news of a Saviour, and of a way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation than this? So that the ſcribe by acknowledging the firſt and great commandment was to love God with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love, without any defect, might by looking into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſee that he had broken, yea that he had never kept this commandment; and conſequently that he was liable to the wrath and curſe of God, which is denounced againſt every one that continueth not in <hi>all</hi> things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the law to do them, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10. And this muſt needs ſerve to prepare his mind better than any thing to hearken to the news of a Saviour, and to embrace a method of ſalvation that ſhould be propounded to him; which is the very <hi>kingdom of God,</hi> we are treating of. For if the ſcribe did but let his thoughts run in a natural rational courſe upon this commandment, they muſt quickly run to this, that he needed one to help and ſave him, and that without a Saviour &amp; Redeemer, he muſt needs periſh. Well now, let the ſcribe be brought to this point, which his own anſwer would by plain and ſhort reaſoning lead him to: and how far would he then be (do you think) from the kingdom of God, which reveals ſuch an atoning ſacrifice, and ſaviour unto him?</p>
            <p>And from hence, we may obſerve, that a due ſenſe of the demands which the divine law has upon us; and the perfect love, the perfect holineſs, and unſinning obedience it requires of us, ſerves to bring us near to the kingdom of God, as it is a preparation for our entertaining and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009326_0027_1030EE4D91C45ED0"/>the gracious offers of the <hi>goſpel.</hi> In order to know what manner of perſons we are, and what we ſtand in need of, we muſt know what we ought to be: And to know what we ought to be, is to know what the law of God which is righteous and holy, demands of us. And therein we ſhall ſee it requires perfect LOVE, the love of the whole heart perfect obedience, and ſpotleſs holineſs. And now when we compare our ſelves with this law, we ſhall ſee ſuch dreadful defects and deviations from it; yea a life and a temper ſo contrary hereunto, as to ſee that if God ſhould proceed againſt us, according to the rigorous but righteous demands of the law, we muſt needs be undone and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all eternity: And conſequently that we ſtand in abſolute need of one to interpoſe in our behalf, and help and ſave us from the wrath to come. And when is a man ſo well prepared to receive a ſaviour, as when he ſees the abſolute need of one? Says Chriſt, Mat. ix. 12. <hi>The whole need not a phyſician, but they that are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt ſee themſelves to be <hi>ſinners,</hi> before they will ſee any occaſion for repentance, or need of a ſaviour: And in order to ſee themſelves ſinners, they muſt ſee the law in the wide extent thereof. You therefore who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of your ſins and don't ſee ſuch need of an atoning ſacrifice, and ſaviour; do but look to the law of God, and ſee what perfect love, and perfect holineſs it requires of you; and what a curſe it denounces againſt all who tranſgreſs the ſame. And ſee how horribly you fall ſhort, and tranſgreſs this law; and how you thereby expoſe your ſelves to the divine wrath and curſe: And then you will ſee the need of one to atone for your ſins, to interceed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and the divine wrath; and to be the end of the law for righteouſneſs unto you. And when you ſhall be brought to ſuch a ſtate as this, there will be but a ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and the kingdom of God: But a ſtep between you and your acceptance of Chriſt, who is in goſpel revealed, and offered to you as ſuch a ſaviour.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009326_0028_1030EE4F20FA0058"/>2. But then, it is to be conſidered further that the ſcribe if he underſtood his own anſwer, muſt needs ſee, that as he had not kept the law for the time paſt; ſo neither could he for the time to come; and that if God ſhould forgive all his paſt offences againſt the firſt and great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet that he could not keep it for the time to come; but ſhould be tranſgreſſing it every day, and be adding to the new ſcore of guilt continually; nay he muſt needs ſee, if he thoroughly examined and obſerved himſelf, that he was ſo far from being able to love and ſerve God perfectly, that he was not able to do it with any goſpel ſincerity, without ſome ſpecial aſſiſtance. And this would bring him a ſtep nearer to the kingdom of God, as it would lead him to ſee not only that he needed an atoning ſacrifice for ſins paſt, but ſome ſpecial aſſiſtance, to enable him to love God even with ſincerity. And as Chriſt is offered in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel kingdom, to be our <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as well as <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> it would ſerve to prepare the way for his acceptance of him in that character alſo. Surely the ſcribe, if his heart was in his own anſwer, muſt ſee it was highly reaſonable to love God above all: But then he might doubtleſs ſee that he could not ſo much as do this, without the divine help: That he had not ſo much the command of his own heart and affections, as to fix them ſupremely upon him, whom his reaſon and conſcience told him was the proper object hereof. And the more he ſaw of this his weakneſs and impotency to guide and govern his affections and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, the nearer he was to the kingdom of God; as by this he would be the better diſpoſed to accept of the help which Chriſt offers in his goſpel, and of his grace that would be ſufficient for him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we may obſerve that a ſenſe of the divine precepts, and the vaſt extent of them, together with a ſenſe of our own inability of our ſelves to keep them ſo much as with any goſpel ſincerity, prepares for the goſpel kingdom, and brings us near to it, where grace and help is offered, and may be had. The more we ſee of the perfections of the divine law, the more we ſhall ſee of our own imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and weakneſs; and the more we ſee of our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009326_0029_1030EE5733F30AB0"/>and corruption, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> clearly we ſhall ſee the need of a ſavior, with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, or at leaſt will he not ſee it reaſonable that he ſhould be inclined to come into that goſpel kingdom where help and grace may be had; where the love of God may be ſo ſhed abroad in his heart by the holy Ghoſt, whereby he may be enabled to love God ſincerely and ſupremely, although not with a legal perfection.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſidered ſeveral things in the ſcribe's anſwer; all which being laid together, gave occaſion for our Saviour to ſay of him, that <hi>he was not far from the kingdom of God:</hi> that is, not far from ſeeing into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and truth of chriſtianity, and embracing the ſame. But whether he ever actually came into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo as to become a true diſciple of Chriſt or not, we cannot ſay, becauſe we have no further account of him. But by his diſcreet anſwer, and what was comprehended therein. Chriſt himſelf pronounces upon him, that he was not far from the kingdom of God, that is, according to the plain and natural ſenſe of our Saviour's words, that he was nearer the goſpel kingdom; and bid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be a chriſtian than his brethren. And it muſt be allowed this the principles and ſentiments in his anſwer as I have ſhewn, plainly ſet forth, that if they were ſeriouſly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and duly proſecuted, they would lead a man to ſee that he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009326_0030_1030EE58C7B488C0"/>
ſtood in need of a Saviour, &amp; of juſt ſuch a Saviour as Jeſus Chriſt is. And then there would want only this one ſtep actually to enter into the kingdom; namely the free own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearty accepting of Chriſt for his prince &amp; ſaviour, as he is revealed and offered in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude the ſubject with ſome APPLICATION.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From what we have heard we infer that although ſome are not ſo far from the kingdom of God as others; yet this is not always according to outward and human appearance; for oftentimes ſame who ſeem the neareſt are really the furtheſt off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour in the text aſſerts concerning one, that he was not far from the kingdom of God; which implies that others were far off, or were not ſo near. And this doubtleſs is the caſe in the ſeveral ages and places of the world, eſpecially in every part of the viſible church. For it muſt be allowed, that ſome have knowledge and certain qualities, and diſpoſitions, which bring them nearer to the chriſtian ſtate than others. For altho' I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is no man out of this kingdom, let him be never ſo near to it, but it requires an act of divine power and ſovereign grace, to bring him actually into it: for no man cometh to the Son <hi>but whom the Father draweth,</hi> Joh. vi. 44. and regeneration is of the Spirit of God. (Joh. 3.5.) yet it does not follow, but that they may be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, if not by natural temper, yet by education inſtruction, example, conſideration and thought, and by the free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the means of grace, as to be ſo much nearer the kingdom than others, as not to need ſo much to be done for them at the time of actually bringing them into the kingdom as ſome others. Who will ſay but that <hi>Agrippa</hi> was nearer the kingdom than ſome others, who was <hi>almoſt</hi> perſwaded to be a chriſtian. Divines have been won't to diſtinguiſh between common and ſpecial grace: and as among thoſe who are favoured with ſpecial grace, ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to higher degrees than others; ſo it is as to common
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009326_0031_1030EE5A556C0DF8"/>grace: it muſt be allowed that ſome make a much better improvement of common grace than others. And who will ſay that thoſe who make the beſt improvement and greateſt attainments in common grace, are ſo far from the kingdom of God, and bid no fairer to enter into it, than thoſe who make no, or but very poor improvement of the grace God affords them in common with others?</p>
            <p>But now as to perſons being near or far off from the kingdom; it is often very different from the common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of men in the matter. — No people were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo near the kingdom of God, &amp; of the Meſſiah, as the Jews; and yet, as I obſerved before, perhaps no people in their temper were further from the kingdom than they: And among the Jews, none were thought ſo near the kingdom as the phariſees: it being a common ſaying among the Jews, <q>that if but two men went to heaven, one of them would be a phariſee:</q> whereas in truth, there were none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews further from the kingdom than they. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that our Saviour obſerves that <hi>publicans and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots would ſooner enter into the kingdom of heaven than they,</hi> Matth. xxi. 31. And he illuſtrates it by a parable, ſetting forth the different tempers of a phariſee and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, <hi>Luk.</hi> xviii. 10 — 14. Two men went up into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray, one a <hi>phariſee,</hi> the other a <hi>publican.</hi> The phariſee, ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, "God I thank thee, I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, or even as this publican: I faſt twice a week, and I give tythes of all that I poſſeſs: And the publican ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afar off, would not ſo much as lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but ſmote upon his breaſt, God be merciful to me a ſinner. I tell you, this man went down to his houſe juſtified rather than the other: for every one who exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed; but he who humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted." By which it appears, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who have ſome humble ſenſe of their ſins, are nearer the kingdom, and in a much fairer way than proud ſelf-righteous hypocrites. For nothing is more contrary to the genius and ſpirit of the goſpel kingdom than pride; and the very nature &amp; tendency of the goſpel kingdom is to humble
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009326_0032_1030EE61E964E898"/>pride; and bring down the haughtineſs of man, that the Lord alone, and his rich and free grace may be exalted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We may gather from what hath been ſaid that good knowledge in religious matters, with moral honeſty and ingenuity, bids fair for the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The favourable remark Chriſt makes upon the ſcribe's anſwer, teaches us, that when perſons are willing to know the doctrines and principles of the goſpel, and are ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ingenuous, as to own and acknowledge the truth thereof, as it appears to them, they are in a much more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way than thoſe who deſpiſe knowledge, and neglect the means of knowledge: and reject the truth when it is offered unto them; and deny it when convinced of it: when men chooſe darkneſs rather than light, and obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſt in error rather than embrace the truth, they are very remote from that kingdom which is founded in truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A right underſtanding of the law in all its high demands upon us, ſerves to bring us ſo much nearer to the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is by the law that there is the knowledge of ſin: for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law of God. Now therefore, the more clear and extenſive views we have of the divine law in the numerous demands and various requirements of it, with all the awful penal ſanctions thereof, the better ſhall we be prepared to receive the goſpel: for if we thus ſee and underſtand the law, we ſhall ſee that we are guilty before God: and without a Mediator, and an intereſt in him, under the divine wrath and curſe, and liable to death and eternal deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely, a ſenſe of theſe things muſt needs very much prepare for the goſpel kingdom; which iſſues forth a proclamation of grace inviting the tranſgreſſors of the divine law, to come in, aſſuring them, that whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Chriſt, he will in no wiſe caſt out; but ſhall thro' him obtain pardon, juſtification and eternal life. The law then in all it's rigorous, but righteous demands, may well be called a ſchool-maſter to bring us to Chriſt, <hi>Gal</hi> iii. 24. For it ſerves to give us ſuch a ſenſe of our own ſin and guilt, as to put us upon fleeing from the tribunal of awful
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009326_0033_1030EE6569A39778"/>and inflexible juſtice, to proſtrate our ſelves before the mercy-ſeat prepared, and throne of grace erected in the goſpel kingdom. It is therefore of vaſt importance that men ſhould be well inſtructed in the law of God, and made to ſee how exceeding broad it is, and how extenſive in its demands, and how dreadful in its penalties; as that which may be a ſpecial means to put perſons upon repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that divine perſon, who was made of a woman, and made under the law, to redeem us who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is a bad ſign when perſons content themſelves with the outward acts of religion, and have little or no regard to their hearts, and the affections of their ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the firſt and great commandment is <hi>Love;</hi> and to love God with all the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoul.</hi> Surely then ſuch, who content themſelves with lifeleſs heartleſs duties in religion, whatever they may think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or whatever others may think of them, are not near the kingdom; and their placing religion in outward <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and ceremony, and not in ſincere and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affections has a ſad tendency to keep them at a diſtance. For ſuch oftentimes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>arter themſelves, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the kingdom: and ſuch a ſelf flattering, and ſelf-deceiving ſpirit indulged, is a very dangerous ſtate: for many of the means of grace, ſuch as counſels, warnings and reproofs which may reach others, won't be likely to affect theſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>How thankful ſhould we be, for the ſpecial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> for getting NEAR, but getting INTO the kingdom of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the goſpel of the kingdom preach'd to us; the proclamations of grace are iſſued forth, with the terms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we may be admitted and accepted: We have the ſtatutes and ordinances of the kingdom publiſhed to us; and we are invited and called upon, yea intreated by the ambaſſadors of Chriſt, to come into the kingdom; and the ſpirit ſays <hi>come,</hi> by ſtirring up convictions and good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and in ſhort, there are no means, helps or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which it is reaſonable for God to grant, but he is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009326_0034_1030EE66FB206DC8"/>ready to afford unto us. Surely then, theſe diſtinguiſhing means and helps call for our moſt thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and we ſhould bleſs the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is thus bleſſing us with ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It greatly concerns us all to examine our ſelves in this matter, and ſee how it is with us; and how we ſtand related to the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is of infinite importance to be in this kingdom; for the kingdom of grace here, and the kingdom of glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, are inſeperably connected. Surely then, it infinitely concerns every one of us to ſee, and ſo far as we are able to know how we ſtand related to this kingdom.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Whether we are in this kingdom.</hi> Many of you are viſibly and profeſſedly in this kingdom; and moſt of you by baptiſm, are viſibly the children of the kingdom. But now I beſeech you conſider and inquire, whether you be really in this kingdom: have you felt the power of this kingdom upon your ſouls, and working ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually within you? Are you convinced of your loſt and undone ſtate, by reaſon of ſin, and without a ſaviour? Do you by an eye of faith, ſee Jeſus to be the only and all-ſufficient Saviour? and do you receive him, and rely upon him as he is revealed and offered to you in his goſpel? Does the grace of the goſpel operate upon you? Are you become the willing ſubjects of this glorious king? Have you openly profeſſed him, and ſworn allegiance to him? have you his ſpirit ruling in you? Are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the ſpirit of this kingdom? Do you live as this grace of God teaches you, denying ungodlineſs, and every worldly luſt, and living ſoberly, righteouſly and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the preſent world? And do you walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord blameleſs? In ſhort, do you bear and bring forth the fruits of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſuch as faith, love, holineſs and righteouſneſs? Now if this be the caſe, you may be congratulated as happy ſubjects of this kingdom of grace, and heirs of the kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you cannot find that you are as yet in the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009326_0035_1030EE6892EA4CE8"/>kingdom, <hi>conſider and inquire whether ye be near or far off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you not near the kingdom? Is not the kingdom of God among you? Is not the goſpel of the kingdom preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you? Are you not invited and called upon to come in by friends &amp; by miniſters? And is not the ſpirit of God ſtriving with you? And is not God waiting upon you, keeping the door open to you, to ſee if you will come in? And don't ſome of you find your ſelves upon the point of coming in? Are you not forming reſolutions that you will make haſte, and make no more delay in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? But then, let me aſk ſome of you, whether you are not gone further from the kingdom than you were ſome time ago? Have you not by neglecting the awakenings and convictions which have been ſtirred up in you, very much loſt them? And have you not by quenching and grieving the ſpirit provoked him to withdraw, and has he not left you in a greater dulneſs, coldneſs &amp; backwardneſs to the things of God, than in times paſt? Now if any of you upon examining and obſerving your ſelves, find this to be your caſe, Oh! how ſhould it alarm your fears, leſt the ſpirit of God ſhould utterly leave you, and you ſhould never enter into the kingdom. O ye delaying ſinners! you ſhould conſider how long God has been calling and waiting upon you; and if you don't beſtir your ſelves ſpeedily, and in good earneſt, all your reſolutions will grow more &amp; more feeble; and all the hopeful proſpects will vaniſh, and the door of the kingdom will be for ever ſhut againſt you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And to conclude: <hi>How ſad and dreadful will the caſe of ſuch be, who tho' they are not far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, yet by ſome means or other, fall ſhort at laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this was the caſe of the ſcribe in our text we cannot ſay; but this we have reaſon to fear is the ſad caſe of many perſons under the goſpel. They have a good degree of knowledge in ſpiritual matters, and in the nature of the goſpel kingdom; and have many awakenings and convictions; and are brought to many purpoſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, relating to their coming into the goſpel church and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009326_0036_1030EE6C18503A58"/>kingdom: but by neglecting to proſecute the ſame, they fail of the grace of God; never get into the kingdom of grace here, &amp; ſo finally rejected as to the kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p>But now, how ſad will the caſe of ſuch be, &amp; how aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated their grief and miſery, to think they were near the kingdom, within a ſtep or two of entring in; and yet for not actually entring, are for ever rejected? Oh! how will it cut ſuch poor wretches to the heart, to think the door of the kingdom ſtood open to them, and God called and invited them by his word, by his miniſters, and by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and waited on them from month to month, from year to year; but they ſtill delayed, and practically refuſed, and now the door is everlaſtingly ſhut againſt them? How will it cut them to think that by inſtructions and counſels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings and convictions, they were brought near the kingdom, and upon the very point of entring in; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed &amp; delayed till their opportunity was lapſed, &amp; they are for ever rejected! With what anguiſh and vexation of ſpirit, will they be filled, to think that once they were as it were near to heaven's gates; but for want of that faith, that reſolution, the goſpel required, they fell ſhort! And with what everlaſting upbraiding of themſelves will they be filled, when they ſee not only <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the kingdom of God; but ſhall ſee them come from the eaſt &amp; from the weſt, from the north and from the ſouth, &amp; ſit down with them in the kingdom of God; while they, the children of the kingdom, children of the church, and viſible members of the kingdom, and under the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt means, are thruſt out.</p>
            <p>O may you, my hearers, who are at the door of the kingdom, but not come in as yet, beſtir your ſelves ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in good earneſt, that this may not be your unhappy caſe! And may God by his almighty grace, overcome all remaining reluctance, and bring you in!</p>
