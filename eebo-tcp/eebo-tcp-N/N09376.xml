            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom; teaching and admoniſhing one another in pſalms, hymns and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this chapter the Apoſtle exhorts the Coloſſians to a variety of duties, to which they were ſtrongly obliged by virtue of their knowing and profeſſing the goſpel. In particular; he enjoins it upon them to be heavenly-minded; to ſeek thoſe things
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011955_0003_0F8788E5D5AF73E0"/>
that are above; to mortify their members which are upon the earth; to ſpeak the truth one to another; to put off the old man with his deeds; to be clothed with bowels of mercies and charity;—to be peaceable and thankful.</p>
            <p>AND in our text, in order to ſuperſede the neceſſity of any more particular inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning their duty, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to them to become intimately acquainted with the goſpel of Chriſt: For if they were happily poſſeſſed of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it would be unneceſſary for him, or any other Apoſtle, to deſcend to a minuter detail of thoſe virtues, which their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chriſtianity laid them under peculiar obligations to practiſe. The word of Chriſt would itſelf ſufficiently inſtruct them in theſe things; and therefore he had nothing farther to do, than only to preſs it upon them, to ſtudy it with diligence and care, and make it familiar to their minds. Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AND as the Apoſtle was perſuaded that they would, by a careful and frequent peruſal of the Goſpel, diſcover a rich profuſion of divine grace, a wonderful diſplay of God's perfections in general, he would have them affect their hearts with a grateful ſenſe thereof: And as there is no better way to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011955_0004_0F8788E75D4CBB80"/>
teſtify and expreſs thankfulneſs, than by ſinging hymns of praiſe; therefore he exhorts them in the latter part of the verſe, to teach and admoniſh one another in pſalms, hymns and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in their hearts to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SINGING</hi> is expreſſive of thankfulneſs, as appears from the text, and from that parallel place of ſcripture, Eph. 5.19. It alſo denotes joy and gladneſs, as is evident from that direction of St. James, Is any merry? let him ſing pſalms. It likewiſe indicates an hearty acquieſcence in the diſpenſations of providence. Laſtly, it is a particular way of worſhipping God; of bleſſing him for his favors, and praiſing him for his unrivalled perfections. Hence it is a duty proper at all times, and ſuited to all occaſions. Accordingly, David declares that he would bleſs the Lord at all times, and that his praiſe ſhould be continually in his mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SINGING</hi> was much practiſed by the Jews of old. they had "ſinging men and ſinging women," perſons particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in muſick, appointed to lead in this part of divine ſervice. And that it might be performed with the greater variety and pleaſure, they introduced all kinds of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011955_0005_0F8788E803F248D0"/>
muſical inſtruments into publick worſhip; not to ſuperſede, but to be uſed in concert with the human voice. The Jews doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs delighted in muſick, and <hi>this</hi> delight, together with its being a duty expreſſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, was the reaſon why ſuch ample proviſion was made by them for its being regularly and decently conducted. And if theſe were reaſons to <hi>them,</hi> why ſhould they not be ſo to us? It is a duty <hi>now</hi> as much as it was <hi>then,</hi> and we may preſume that it is in general as delightful to <hi>us</hi> as to <hi>them,</hi> to Chriſtians as to Jews.</p>
            <p>THAT it is a duty under the goſpel none can queſtion, who conſider that Chriſt, with his diſciples early ſet an example of it; and that his Apoſtles have ſeveral times warmly recommended the practice: And thô no mention is made of <hi>organs</hi> or other <hi>muſical inſtruments</hi> in the New-Teſtament, yet it cannot from thence be, with certainty, concluded that they would be either unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or improper.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the idea that mankind generally have of ſinging, it ſeems to be more eſpecially adapted to joyful occaſions. But as it denotes ſubmiſſion to the events of Providence, be they what they will; as muſick has a moſt happy tendency to poliſh and refine the ſoul, to improve and perfect it in the virtues of the divine life; and,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011955_0006_0F8788EDC82EB618"/>
eſpecially, as there are tunes of different airs, ſome cheerful, others ſolemn, fitted to joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or mournful occaſions; and as the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſſures us in the text, that there is a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſubjects to be ſet to muſick, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his uſing the ſeveral words, pſalms, hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs,) it muſt be concluded that it is never unſeaſonable, and that it is a duty at all times to teach and admoniſh one another in pſalms, hymns, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>EVEN ſhould it be granted that ſinging is expreſſive of joy and thankfulneſs only, it would prove nothing againſt the conſtant fitneſs and propriety of the practice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are required to "rejoice in the Lord alway, and always to give thanks for all things unto God in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." And were <hi>this</hi> not expreſſly required; when can we be ſaid to be ſo far deſtitute of favours, as to be under no obligation to bleſs God, and ſing praiſes to his Name? Under the moſt afflictive circumſtances we are conſtantly ſurrounded with a thouſand bleſſings, for which we are bound to give thanks, and conſequently to engage in this delightful ſervice. Therefore if we conſider the duty of ſinging in this view only, it brings us to the ſame concluſion, and teaches us that it ſhould be perpetual. Even that the Lord
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011955_0007_0F8788EEE467CB30"/>
ſuperintends all things, and is concerned in the government of the world, is matter of joy and gladneſs. "The Lord reigneth let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the iſles be glad thereof."</p>
            <p>OF this conſtant and delightful duty of our holy religion, I ſhall now ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more particular. And in my ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſcourſe on this ſubject, ſhall ſpeak of the two following things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. OF the nature, excellency and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Church-muſick: And</p>
            <p n="2">II. OF the manner in which it ought to be performed— with grace in our hearts to the Lord.</p>
            <p>THAT ſinging is a duty, and a part of inſtituted, publick worſhip, none who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the divinity of the ſcriptures will pretend to deny: And that it was not made our duty without reaſon and deſign, may appear form what follows.</p>
            <p>MAN is the only creature on the earth that is endued with reaſon and a faculty of ſpeech. Theſe ſuperior powers are the gift of God; on him he depends for the continuance of them, and therefore in <hi>his</hi> ſervice and for his glory is he bound to employ them.—
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011955_0008_0F8788EF8CFC47A0"/>
The glory of God is the principal end for which all creatures were made; and this they are capable of declaring in divers manners, according to their different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and capacities. Even the inanimate world, the Sun, the Moon and the Stars in a ſilent, but expreſſive manner, proclaim the glorious perfections, the wiſdom and ſkill, the goodneſs and power of the divine Architect. The brutal creation ſubſerve the ſame deſign, and in <hi>their way</hi> ſhew forth the praiſes of him who made them. But then theſe ſeveral ranks of creatures are only the <hi>paſſive</hi> inſtruments of the divine glory. Man, as he is poſſeſſed of reaſon and a faculty of ſpeech, is capable of being <hi>actively</hi> employed in this delightful and honorable ſervice; is capable of declaring articulately to all around him the glories of his heavenly King. For this end was his tongue given him, which therefore, in the pſalms, is ſtiled his glory.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 16.9. alſo 108.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſhall he ſuffer <hi>ſo</hi> noble, <hi>ſo</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed a faculty to lie dormant? Shall other creatures, both animate and inanimate, live up to the laws of their creation, declare the glory of God and ſhew forth his handy work? And ſhall man alone, tho' raiſed high in the ſcale of being, be ſilent in his Maker's praiſe? Shall man, tho' his organs are framed to make articulate ſounds, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011955_0009_0F8788F05249BF58"/>
his reaſon ſufficient to enable him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce harmony, talk, notwithſtanding, the confuſed language of beaſts, and chant the diſcordant ſongs of birds? No. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements ſhould be eminent, as his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſuperior. For harmony was he made, and in melodious notes ſhould he ſign the praiſes of his God.</p>
            <p>HARMONY conſiſts in a continued coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence of two, or more, ſounds, tho' at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſtances from each other; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ingredients thereof, are concords. In the doctrine of concords, there is ſomething abſolutely unaccountable by man. Voices at ſome certain diſtances from each other, how pleaſant ſoever in themſelves, will grate and jarr; whereas at other different diſtances (which are eaſily aſcertained by fixed rules) they will mix and unite, and, by their union, produce concords, from a continued combination of which, ſprings harmony. Now why this is ſo, we are unable to ſay; neither does there appear any natural aptitude in two ſounds of a concord to give a pleaſing ſenſation more than in two of a diſcord; theſe different effects are by us inſcrutable, and muſt be reſolved wholly into the divine will. All that we can ſay is, that theſe things are in fact ſo; and upon this well known, tho' unintelligible property of nature, the art of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011955_0010_0F8788F1C919B258"/>
muſick is founded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the rules of which may be learned by perſons of common capacities without any great expence of time or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and when learnt, may be reduced to practice by far the greater part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and when practiſed in that perfection the thing will admit, by a proper choice and mixture of male and female voices, conſtitutes one of the moſt pleaſing and advantageous exerciſes in the world.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING the pleaſure of it, but little is neceſſary to be ſaid: For they who have a taſte for muſick know by experience its delight; whilſt others cannot form any better conception of it, than a blind man can of colours. Altho' harmony be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nature, ſome perſons have their ears ſo <hi>oddly</hi> conſtructed as to be incapable of diſtinguiſhing between jarring and concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſounds; they are all alike to them, alike inſiped and indifferent. But they who have their auditory nerves rightly ſtrung receive the moſt refined pleaſure from muſick; and when they hear a ſelect number of ſkilful voices, in concert joined, hymning the eternal Father, are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy and filled with rapture. The clear and lofty notes of the Counter; the ſoft, but full ſound of the Tenor; the ſprightly and acute conſonance of the Treble; the manly, the ſolemn and the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011955_0011_0F8788F29E8483E8"/>
grand echo of the Baſs, all conſpiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and uniting in one charming ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony, give the ſoul ſuch delight as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond deſcription glorious! Such harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſounds flatter our hopes, ſoften our cares, encreaſe our joy, inflame our love, diſpel our fears, and excite the ſofteſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the tendereſt emotions of the heart. I would not be underſtood to mean that theſe different effects are all produced by the ſame ſtrains of muſick. The power of ſounds is great, and the effects various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the air, meaſure and proportion of a tune, and the different keys on which it is conſtructed. There is the grave and the acute ſound; the joyous and the mournful, the ſprightly and the ſolemn mode; the flat and the ſharp key, by a ſuitable choice of which, almoſt any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and feelings may be excited. Some ſtrains of muſick will melt us into ſoftneſs and enervate the ſoul; whilſt others will rouſe us into manly courage and make us undaunted in the field of battle: Some will fill us with pleaſing ſenſations; whilſt others ſhall excite painful commotions in the breaſt.</p>
            <p>SOUNDS have an immediate and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence on the nervous ſyſtem; and, by giving the animal ſpirits a briſk or ſlow, an equable or unſteady motion, produce mirth or ſorrow, hope or deſpair, rage or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011955_0012_0F8788F353BA6A40"/>
diſtraction. Accordingly hiſtory gives an account that diſeaſes have been cured, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity corrected, ſeditions quelled, paſſions raiſed or calmed, and even madneſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by tunes of different airs. It is ſtoried that <hi>Timotheus</hi> could tranſport <hi>Alexander</hi> into rage and fury by the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> ſound, and ſooth him into indolence with the <hi>Lydian.</hi> And of a certain muſician in Italy it is ſaid, that he was able, by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his muſick from briſk, to ſolemn, and ſo <hi>vice verſa,</hi> to move the ſoul ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently as to cauſe diſtraction or madneſs.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the various effects that are produced by different compoſitions. Since therefore <hi>ſinging</hi> is conſtituted a part of divine ſervice, it is always ſuppoſed that no tunes of a light and airy kind; none that are calculated to ſenſualize the mind and excite laſcivious deſires are introduced into the publick worſhip; but only ſuch as are ſuited to mend the heart, to purify the ſoul, to diſpoſſeſs it of malignant paſſions, to ſtrengthen its faith, and raiſe its hopes to heaven.</p>
            <p>OF this ſort of muſick would we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood principally to ſpeak; and of the divine effects of it, what cannot be ſaid! it is difficult if not impoſſible to ſay too much and to launch forth too far in it's commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Should we deſcribe it as capable
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011955_0013_0F8788F40BC23930"/>
of working miracles, I am not certain the ſcripture would not authorize the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This muſick is an enemy to all malice, to impure imaginations and un-hallowed deſires. <hi>This,</hi> and that grand adverſary to the ſouls of men, the Devil, who walks about continually ſeeking whom he may devour, are, luckily, no friends: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwell together. Sacred harmony which gives all pious ſouls the moſt ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, fills that infernal and envious fiend with torture: ſo that he had rather quit his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful poſſeſſion of mens bodies and minds, than undergo the torment of it. For the truth of this, witneſs king Saul, who, we are told, was troubled with an evil ſpirit, and had it removed by the harmony of David's lyre. Whether by this evil ſpirit we are to underſtand the Devil himſelf, or a ſpirit of malice and rage which from time to time ſeized the king, it matters not; for they are near akin, and what will remove one, will doubtleſs diſpoſeſs the other.</p>
            <p>PRAYER may, in a ſenſe, be ſaid to have an omnipotent power, as it prevails with the Almighty, and brings down bleſſings from heaven to earth. But the efficacy of ſacred harmony is nothing inferior. <hi>This,</hi> if it proceeds from a pious heart, makes delightful melody in the ears of Jehovah, and inclines him to look down from his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011955_0014_0F8788F4C5F208A0"/>
throne propitious to the ſons of men. <hi>This</hi> raiſes the ſoul to heaven, and fills it with that peace of God which paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>This</hi> ſpreads a divine calm over the mind, huſhes all tumultuous paſſions, and prepares us to receive, with reverence, inſtruction from on high. <hi>This</hi> ſets all the ſprings of nature to work, fires the ſoul with divine love, and diffuſes joy and gladneſs through the heart.</p>
            <p>ARE we at any time caſt down, and filled with melancholly and diſponding thoughts? by the power of muſick the gloom is diſpelled, and a ray of light darted into the mind, which cheers and enlivens it. Are our breaſts torn with the paſſions of revenge, envy and malice? no ſooner do we hear the voice of melody, than the rage is ſuſpended, and every baneful paſſion hangs its head. Is the ſoul immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the pleaſures of ſenſe and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? a ſacred ſong ſung by ſkilful and pleaſant voices will arouſe it from its lethargy, and make it ambitious of nobler and diviner joys. Is it careleſs about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the things of futurity? when it hears the important truths of God, and another world chanted forth in melodious accents, and conſiders that in ſuch raptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtrains a whole eternity will be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the bleſſed inhabitants of heaven, it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011955_0015_0F8788F58E77D3B0"/>
is immediately excited to work out its ſalvation with diligence and care, with fear and trembling, that ſo it may be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for, and at laſt be made a partaker of the delights and honors of the upper and better world.</p>
            <p>THUS ſacred muſick is a friend to the ſocial and religious life; it advances our happineſs <hi>here</hi> and lays a foundation for the perfection of it <hi>hereafter.</hi> Doubtleſs the experience of many now preſent can witneſs the truth of the above aſſertions. Have you not received numerous advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as well as great pleaſure from cloſely attending on this part of divine worſhip, eſpecially ſince your late diſtinguiſhed improvements in muſick? Are not ſome of you able to ſay, that from hearing an agreeable piece of ſacred harmony, you have had your thoughts turned into a devout channel, and been led into ſome ſuch ſoliloquy as the following? If melody made by frail and imperfect men be ſo raviſhing, ſo tranſporting, how charming muſt that place be where God's praiſes will be ſet to the harps of Angels, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſhall join with ſweet and ſonorous voices to extol his unrivalled perfections? If we feel ſuch pleaſing emotions of ſoul at hearing the harmony of earth, how extatick, muſt be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011955_0016_0F8788F748D08BC8"/>
our joy, when we hear the angelick choir attune their voices in their maker's praiſe, whilſt the innumerable band of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect ſhall join the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and without diſcord ſing, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come: great and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy works, juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints; bleſſing and honor and glory and power be unto him that ſitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever!"</p>
            <p>IN a word; if the frequent hearing of church muſick, well performed, will not infallibly make a perſon religious, it will do much towards poliſhing his manners; and if to delight therein does not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a man to be devout, yet it is for the moſt part an evidence that there is nothing in his nature that inclines him to be flagrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked. The lovers of harmony are ſeldom known to be malicious and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but it has been ſaid, and in ſome caſes experience will juſtify the aſſertion, that they who have no ear for muſick, no reliſh for its charms, have dark and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſouls, ſtrangely diſpoſed for treaſons, maſſacres, bloodſhed and war.</p>

            <p n="2">II. I AM in the ſecond place to ſhow how this part of divine worſhip is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed—<hi>ſinging</hi> with <hi>grace</hi> in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
            <p>NOW this expreſſion (with <hi>grace in your hearts)</hi> may import the two following things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. THAT we ſhould ſing gracefully, and in a manner acceptable to others; and 2dly, That we ſhould ſing with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful minds, with pious and devout affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> interpreters tell us that the greek words <hi>(en kariti)</hi> which are tranſlated, with grace, are equivalent to another greek word (viz. <hi>kaientoos)</hi> which is moſt properly rendered, decently, acceptably;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011955_0018_0F8788FAD601D9A0"/>
or ſo that our hymns may be grateful to others, and be received with ſpiritual delight. But whether the words are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this conſtruction; or whether <hi>this</hi> were the ſenſe of the Apoſtle or not, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is that thoſe who engage in and pretend to perform this part of divine ſervice, are obliged to uſe their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to ſing in the moſt regular and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner poſſible. Though the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the heart be the thing that God principally regards in <hi>this,</hi> and all other religious exerciſes, yet it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be <hi>altogether</hi> indifferent to him, whether we ſing by rule, or irregularly, in a graceful, or in a barbarous manner. God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace, and he expects that <hi>all</hi> things ſhould be done decently and in order, eſpecially in all the churches of the ſaints. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14.33 &amp; 40.</note> As certain then as the great Jehovah is ſelf-ſatisfied, and pleaſed with his own perfections; ſo certain is it that <hi>harmony</hi> is more acceptable to him than <hi>diſcord, regularity</hi> than <hi>confuſion.</hi> Therefore they who perform church-muſick the moſt by rule, and make the compleateſt melody with their voices, as well as in their hearts to the Lord, bid the <hi>faireſt</hi> to obtain his approbation and favor. As God is the author of nature, they who come neareſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011955_0019_0F8788FBC8988FC0"/>
to <hi>her</hi> unerring ſtandard, are advanced to the greateſt perfection, and muſt certainly pleaſe him the beſt. Since then harmony is produced by a cloſe attention to the laws of nature, thoſe who make the <hi>fineſt</hi> muſick are evidently moſt obſervant of her rules, and conſequently muſt be, in this reſpect, the <hi>moſt</hi> acceptable to nature's God.</p>
            <p>This being ſo undeniably the caſe, it is ſomewhat wonderful that <hi>any</hi> perſons, and ſtill more ſurprizing that any who <hi>pretend</hi> to the leaſt ſhare of reaſon and goodneſs, ſhould ſet themſelves to oppoſe the laudable endeavors of <hi>ſuch</hi> as have of late attempted to make the ſinging in our publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies regular; to retrieve the credit of our pſalmody, and reſcue it from that barbariſm and uncouthneſs, that ridicule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt into which it had very unhappily, and almoſt univerſally fallen. It is well if all ſuch perſons do not at laſt, to their ſorrow, find that, in making ſuch oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were <hi>fighting againſt God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As regular ſinging is the moſt pleaſing to the <hi>Diety,</hi> ſo it is alſo to the <hi>greater</hi> part of mankind; to all who have their ſenſes, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, exerciſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good and evil. Now as it is, in the general, the moſt grateful to our fellow men, this ſuggeſts another very ſubſtantial reaſon why we ſhould endeavour to ſing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011955_0020_0F8788FEB5561938"/>
by <hi>rule:</hi> For that muſick, which gives the greateſt ſatisfaction, will probably produce the moſt beneficial effects, inſpire the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt gratitude to God for his favours, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle in our hearts the divineſt love, excite the pureſt deſires, and raiſe the ſoul on contemplations wings to heaven.</p>
            <p>THIS duty of <hi>ſinging</hi> gratefully to others, implies the two following things.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. THAT we ſhould <hi>ſelect</hi> out of that <hi>variety</hi> of tunes with which we are favored a few of the <hi>fineſt compoſitions;</hi> thoſe that contain the greateſt number of perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, thoſe whoſe <hi>air</hi> and <hi>time</hi> ſhall be found to be moſt pleaſing to a correct ear; whoſe notes are properly adapted to the words, and whoſe "ſound ſhall ſeem an echo to the ſenſe." A neglect to uſe the ſound of the notes to the ſenſe of the words which anſwer to them, is doubtleſs the greateſt deficiency in our Church muſick. Some ſuperior compoſitions <hi>done</hi> by great maſters of ſong, are now in our hands. But is it not apparent that there is a groſs failure in this regard? And does not this defect render our pſalmody <hi>too</hi> unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing? An <hi>exact</hi> correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſound of the notes and the ſenſe of the words that are ſet againſt them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011955_0021_0F8788FFD3DB9288"/>
the general <hi>air</hi> of a tune, and the nature of the ſubject-matter to be ſung, would give life and energy, beauty and force to the performance; and therefore in order to render ſinging acceptable to others, the <hi>choriſter</hi> would do well, always to adapt his tunes as much as poſſible to the complexion of the pſalm: That is, for a penitential hymn, or pſalm of mournful contents, a tune conſtructed on the flat key, and of a grave and ſolemn tone, ſhould be given; whereas hymns of praiſe and thankſgiving ſhould be always ſung in tunes of a briſk and ſprightly air.</p>
            <p>IT is as beautiful to ſuit the tune to the nature of the pſalm, as it is to adapt the pſalm to the occaſion, be it what it will. They who are the moſt obſervant of this rule are the likelieſt both to pleaſe, and to profit. Now to be able thus to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date tunes to different ſubjects and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is neceſſary that the choir ſhould be acquainted with, and have at command a conſiderable number of them; and this is alſo neceſſary upon <hi>another</hi> account, viz. to prevent a diſagreeable repetition. If the number of tunes which are ſung in publick be very ſmall, they muſt needs recur fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and if they are often ſung, their ſound will grow familiar, and if familiar it will pall upon the ear; and if it once
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011955_0022_0F87890007DF4628"/>
grows dull, it will ſoon be offenſive and diſpleaſing. And all this may take place, not only with indifferent compoſitions; but alſo with the fineſt pieces of muſick. Such is the conſtitution of man, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure itſelf will not long pleaſe: Much of our happineſs reſults from variety; and novelty has its peculiar charms. New and ſtrange things do we love, and after them will we go. Now this paſſion for variety ſhould be gratified in all caſes where it can be done with ſafety; and to pleaſe it in the caſe before us (in which certainly there can be no danger) it is of importance, not only to have the number to which we are at any time confined ſomewhat large; but alſo to leave out old and introduce new tunes from time to time, as may be found to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to avoid a dull identity, and to give to this part of divine ſervice all the charms of novelty. But then we ſhould be always careful, that our humor for introducing new pieces of muſick does not exceed our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for learning them, leſt, under a notion of making our pſalmody more pleaſing by a variety of tunes, we really ſpoil it by our inability to ſing them.</p>
            <p>WHICH brings me to ſay in the 2d place, that the duty of ſinging gratefully to others, implies not only that we introduce the beſt muſical compoſitions into our churches, but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011955_0023_0F878900C8C7AE40"/>
alſo that we get a perfect knowledge of them, and are able to ſing them with all their graces.</p>
            <p>THERE is not only a difference in the tunes, with which we are favored, but alſo a diverſity in our manner of ſinging them; and the excellency of the performance is the joint-reſult of the <hi>Compoſition,</hi> and the manner of its being ſung. An excellent tune but indifferently ſung ſhall not appear ſo agreeable, as an indifferent one regularly and gracefully performed. Hence then if we would ſing gratefully to others, we muſt have reſpect both to the tunes in themſelves, and to the method of performing them. The apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us to ſing not only with the ſpirit, but with the underſtanding alſo, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14.15.</note> at leaſt he virtually injoins ſuch a method of ſinging; and the Pſalmiſt in ſo many words requires all to ſing praiſes with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; or, as it might as properly be rendered, all that have underſtanding to ſing praiſes to God. <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm 47.7.</note> To this purpoſe it is neceſſary that we ſhould teach and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one another, as we are directed in the text. Inſtruction in pſalmody is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as in any other art or ſcience. No man is born with the knowledge of muſick, tho' ſome perſons have a genious particularly turned to make ſurprizingly rapid improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein. It is in vain for us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011955_0024_0F87890193C94AD8"/>
that we need no other inſtructor than nature in this matter, and that it would be ſufficient for every man blindly to follow her uncultivated dictates: For beſides that in this extemporaneous way, we ſhould not hit upon ten notes out of a thouſand that would be melodious; beſides that our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and fancies are different, which would inevitably lead us into different turns, trilloes and rolls in ſinging, and draw us out into divers lengths of ſound: Beſides theſe things, I ſay, not being acquainted with the ſame pieces of muſick, and not uſed to ſing in concert, no harmony could be produced, but ſuch a jarr and diſcord as would be abſolutely intolerable to a nice and delicate ear. Such ſinging, if it may be called by that name, would
<q>
                  <l>"Rend with tremendous ſounds your ears aſunder,</l>
                  <l>Like gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbuſs and thunder."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE the indiſpenſable neceſſity of an acquaintance with the rules of muſick, and of a joint-knowledge of thoſe tunes that we pretend to introduce into our public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Hence alſo the neceſſity of ſinging-maſters to teach and inſtruct the young, the ignorant and the unlearned.</p>
            <p>TIME and money expended for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are profitably laid out. Inſtruction brings back the aged to the rule, from which
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011955_0025_0F8789030BD13138"/>
they gradually, and in a courſe of years widely depart; and enables the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration regularly to employ their tongues in their Maker's praiſe. How beautiful is it to ſee, under the benefit of kind and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tutors, even children ſkilfully uſing their tongues in ſinging loud Hoſannahs to the Son of David! Such an appearance brings to mind and ſeems to be a freſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this paſſage in ſacred writ, "out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe." <note n="§" place="bottom">Math. 21.16.</note> How much better is it for youth to ſpend their leiſure hours in learning ſo pleaſant and profitable an art, than to paſs them, as is too often done, "in rioting and drunkenneſs, in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonneſs," to the diſgrace of human nature, the deſtruction of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and eſtates, their health, and their ſouls. But</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly. SINGING with grace in the heart, intends that we ſhould ſing with pious and devout affections, with grateful minds full of the ſenſe of the divine favours. This, in the ſight of heaven, is the principal thing; and to have our hearts rightly tuned, is, in a religious conſideration, infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the fineſt modulations of the voice. To what avail is it to have our tongues ſing in grateful accents, unleſs our ſouls
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011955_0026_0F878904061A0300"/>
catch the ſacred fire and glow in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to heaven. The melody of the heart is what the Apoſtle has ſeen fit particularly to recommend, as that which in the ſight of God is "of great price," and with which the melody of the voice is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared. The firſt is the weightier matter of the law which ought always to be made, whilſt the latter ſhould never be omitted.</p>
            <p>IF we would make melody in our hearts to the Lord, we ſhould endeavour to affect them with what we are employed about. Are we ſinging a pſalm of praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving? we ſhould be careful that our ſouls are filled with gratitude, and expanded with love to the ſupreme Benefactor. Are we engaged in ſinging thoſe pſalms which deſcribe the man after God's heart, and teach us what we ought to be? It will be the fixed reſolution of him who ſings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to comply with theſe demands and anſwer to this deſcription. Are we ſinging a penitential hymn? Sadneſs ſhould ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our faces, and contrition poſſeſs our hearts. And ſo in all other ſuppoſeable caſes. To ſing with grace in the heart, then, implies that the words of the ſong are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, as well as the notes of the tune har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious; and that we diligently attend to, and underſtand the ſenſe and meaning of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011955_0027_0F878904A167FC98"/>
the pſalm or hymn, or whatever it is we are ſinging.</p>
            <p>IN this ſervice we ſhould have in view not ſo much the praiſe of men, as the glory of God. We ſhould ſing to the Lord, have reſpect in this as well as in every other part of worſhip to his will, and to the honor of his name and religion. "Whatever we do in word or deed, we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God and the Father, by him," as it follows in the verſe immediately after the text. We ſhould be ſolicitous to pleaſe him, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſt we offend him in the manner of diſcharging this duty, knowing that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our praiſes is <hi>thro'</hi> him, and the recompenſe of them will finally be <hi>from</hi> him.</p>
            <p>UNLESS theſe are our views and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; unleſs this be the temper and diſpoſition of our hearts, tho' our ſinging may pleaſe and profit others, it can be of no laſting ſpiritual benefit to ourſelves; Our oblations will be offenſive, and with all the muſick and harmony of our voices, we ſhall be deemed by God, who ſearches the hearts and weighs us in an even balance, as "ſounding braſs and tinkling cymbals." Tho' in a ſenſe we may be ſaid to "offer praiſe, yet we ſhall not glorify God," nor, in this way ſhall we ever "ſee his ſalvation." Harmony will not ſupply the place of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011955_0028_0F8789054B0401E0"/>
neither will the correcteſt muſick, atone for the want of piety. Should we therefore be ever ſo celebrated for our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior attainments in this art, it will ſignify nothing if our hearts are diſcordant and not right in the ſight of God. It ſeems to be the more neceſſary to mention, and inſiſt on this, becauſe <hi>young</hi> perſons are too prone to neglect their hearts, whilſt they are culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their voices, and to ſeek the praiſe of men, rather than that favor which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of God only. But if the applauſe of men be the only thing they have in view, verily they ſhall have their reward; they ſhall receive the empty compliments and fulſome panagyricks of their fellow-mortals and nothing elſe. To guard you againſt a miſtake ſo pernicious, be perſuaded to carry your views forward and conſider how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible it muſt needs be to go, at death, from praiſing God on earth, to be aſſociated with damned ſpirits who ſpend their hopeleſs hours in blaſpheming that venerable Name which all ſhould worſhip and adore.</p>
            <p>BUT if you are ſincere in your devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God <hi>now, then</hi> may you humbly hope to join, at laſt, with Angels round the throne in ſinging anthems of praiſe and hallelujahs to God, and the Lamb that liveth and reigneth for ever and ever. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learnt the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi>

here on earth, and in temples made with hands, you ſhall, when your tongues grow cold and motionleſs in death, thrô grace, be received to heaven to "join the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born," and, in temples not made with hands, ſing in more exalted ſtrains, without interruption or fatigue, the high praiſes of your God and King through interminable ages.</p>
            <p>A FEW reflections on what has been ſaid ſhall conclude the whole.</p>
            <p>SINCE muſick is ſo pleaſant an exerciſe, how thankful ſhould we be to Almighty God, that he has conſtituted it a part of divine worſhip; herein making our duty and pleaſure perfectly coincident: An evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, among a thouſand others, that God is not a hard maſter, that he has conſulted our happineſs in all his laws, and that he does not delight in the torment and miſery of his creature man. In token of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to our ſupreme Benefactor for his goodneſs in this regard, let us be excited to cultivate and improve our muſical talents, to "ſtir up the gift that is within us," to teach and admoniſh one another in pſalms, and hymns, that ſo we may make our tongues, in this way, inſtruments of the divine glory. Some perſons are ſhamefully negligent, and therefore highly culpable in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011955_0030_0F878906CC9B6AC0"/>
this matter; they ſuffer thoſe organs to ruſt away, which ought in all reaſon to be worn out in the immediate ſervice of their maker. Indeed there are a few who have no talents for muſick, neither <hi>ear</hi> nor <hi>voice;</hi> and whoſe endeavors to learn the art, much more to excell in it, would be, of conſequence, to no purpoſe. Such perſons muſt content themſelves to ſing with the ſpirit, and to make melody in their hearts only, as they are unable to do it with the underſtanding and the voice, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring for their conſolation, that God requires of men only in proportion to what he has given them; and that, if there is firſt a willing mind, it is accepted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what a man has, and not according to what he has not. But they, who are furniſhed with muſical organs, and either do <hi>not</hi> improve them at all, or <hi>miſimprove</hi> them by ſinging profane and vicious ſongs, are chargeable with guilt; "to <hi>them</hi> it is ſin."</p>
            <p>To the honor of many it may be ſpoken, that they ſeem to have a juſter ſenſe of their duty in this matter, and that, of late, they have been fired with a noble ambition to excel in this art: We rejoice to ſee that their endeavors have been crowned with abundant ſucceſs; and that, under the advantages of good Inſtructors, they have,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011955_0031_0F87890833A83288"/>
in the compaſs of a few years paſt, carried vocal muſick to a degree of perfection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in this part of the world till now. It muſt needs give to all ſincere lovers of harmony and Zion, great pleaſure to ſee this ſpirit ſpreading from place to place; and particularly it is matter of heart felt joy to many that you, my young friends in this place, have imbibed ſo large a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and, under the auſpices of the moſt high, have made ſuch diſtinguiſhed improvements in vocal muſick. Suffer me, with modeſty, to ſay it is much to your honor: May it be to the credit of religion, and the intereſt of your ſouls.</p>
            <p>It is preſumed that all here preſent, will heartily join with me in fervently wiſhing you the divine bleſſing and preſence.— May you be encouraged to perſevere, and may proſperity attend you. May your worthy examples be imitated by others: May your numbers daily increaſe, and the glorious, the ethereal flame be propagated hence, and catch from town to town, till by the prevailing harmony of our muſick, the natural aſperity of our tempers is taken away, and the ſoft, the benevolent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons become predominant; till from loving and practiſing harmony here, we are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to dwell in that place where love and joy, peace and pleaſure go hand in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:011955_0032_0F878909ACBF9100"/>Laſtly, IF muſick be ſo pleaſant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and the late improvements add ſo much to its excellency, then it is matter both of grief and ſurprize that reformation in our ſinging ſhould, in any place, meet with reſiſtance and oppoſition. Although perhaps, it would be no breach of charity to attribute much of this oppoſition to the ignorance and prejudices of thoſe who make it; yet as <hi>all may</hi> be conſcientious, and think they have good reaſons for their conduct, we will conſider theſe reaſons and give them all the weight they deſerve.— Some object and ſay, "that they cannot but oppoſe theſe improvements in muſick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they take it entirely out of their hands and place it above their reach." And thô they would not be ſuppoſed to act upon the ſame principle the fox did in the fable, who called thoſe grapes ſour which he could not reach, yet they perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that this is a very ſufficient reaſon why they ſhould diſcountenance this new method of ſinging. They were, perhaps, <hi>once</hi> famous for their ſkill in pſalmody and for the part they bore in this ſervice, but <hi>now</hi> are obliged to ſet entirely mute, not only to the diſparagement of their muſical ſkill, but alſo to their great mortification, as they once took delight in "making their voices to be heard on high." This ſeems
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011955_0033_0F87890A8938D318"/>
to be an objection in ſome mens minds; and if any part of it proceeds from pride, we are truly ſorry for it; but if it proceeds from this, that theſe improvements render them unable to comply with what <hi>they</hi> ſuppoſe is their duty, we ſay that probably they may have wrong notions of their duty in this inſtance.—It would be very agreeable to ſee the whole aſſembly join as one in praiſing God for his common boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but this is a ſight we can never expect to ſee in this world; and were it poſſible, it would not be worth purchaſing at the expence of our pſalmody. If our muſick has at any time got to a very low ebb, and cannot be reformed without leaving a part of the congregation behind, it is, notwithſtanding, a duty to attempt a reformation: For regular ſinging muſt be more acceptable both to God and man, thô performed by only a part of the aſſembly, than that which is groveling and indifferent, thô all ſhould be engaged therein. Therefore if there be any who, through age, or other infirmity, are unable to keep pace with others in the neceſſary improvements in muſick; inſtead of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, they ought to attend on it with all the delight and profit poſſible; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring for their comfort that the benefit of ſinging is not confined to whoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011955_0034_0F87890BF89BAF18"/>
it, but may extend to all who, thô they cannot ſing with the underſtanding and voice, endeavor to make melody in their hearts to the Lord. If I miſtake not, the hearer has the advantage of the ſinger in this reſpect; for the firſt has nothing elſe to do, but to excite and cultivate his devotion; whereas the latter muſt attend to the harmony of the voice, as well as to the melody of the heart. Let not any then, who are deſtitute either of voice or ſkill, imagine themſelves to be unconcerned in this part of divine worſhip, but rather let them cloſely attend to both the ſubject and the ſong, that they may ſing with the ſpirit and make melody in their hearts to the Lord.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, others there are, who, tho' they approve the muſick, object to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with which it is preformed, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly exclaim againſt the <hi>Pitch-Pipe,</hi> and the <hi>motion of the hand.</hi> With what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety theſe are called ceremonies, I know not. There is certainly a wide difference between ceremonies ſtrictly ſo called, and thoſe circumſtances which are neceſſary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the being or well-being of any particular performance, action or thing Ceremonies properly ſo called ought never to be encouraged; becauſe it is well known they corrode the vitals of religion;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011955_0035_0F87890C07E4E3A8"/>
and that in proportion as <hi>they</hi> flouriſh, true and undefiled Chriſtianity withers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays. But what is all this either to the Pitch-Pipe, or the Hand. Theſe are ſaid to be circumſtances neceſſary to the decent and regular performance of vocal muſick: The one enables us to begin and ſet the tune at a proper height or pitch, that ſo the notes of it may be within the compaſs of different voices; and the other, to keep exact time and ſing in perfect conſonance. For want of ſome ſuch expedients or helps as theſe, how often have we known the moſt melodious compoſitions ſpoiled in the performance, and converted into <hi>harſh</hi> and grating diſſonance. Inaſmuch, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as theſe things give no diſturbance to the congregation, and are in ſo great a degree neceſſary to the beautiful and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſcharge of this duty, why ſhould they be oppoſed, eſpecially by thoſe who eſteem regular ſinging? To eſteem the one and find fault with the other is juſt as conſiſtent, as it would be to extol a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar face, and exclaim againſt thoſe features on which its beauty depends.</p>
            <p>Laſtly. OTHERS oppoſe the preſent regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar method of ſinging becauſe they ſay it is an innovation, and an introductory ſtep to Popery: Two charges, if true, that ought
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011955_0036_0F87890CC4063278"/>
to determine all ſerious and good men to oppoſe it. But there is no ſort of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for theſe aſſertions. An innovation it is not, and to popery it cannot tend. Regular ſinging is not a new practice even in this part of the world; for however the inhabitants firſt began to ſing, we know a reformation once took place, which occaſioned <hi>then</hi> as it does <hi>now,</hi> too much diſturbance. And as there is no foundation for the charge of innovation, ſo it gives no occaſion for that terrible outcry which ſome perſons make, as tho' popery was advancing with haughty ſtrides upon us. This is the mear bugbear of folly, or the offspring of ignorance, or what is worſe, the wicked craft of ſome deſigning men to bring this reformation into diſcredit and ſtop the progreſs of it. For no perſon of common ſenſe can ſee the leaſt connexion between popery and the late improvements in our church-muſick.</p>
            <p>To conclude. IT is much to be lamented that chriſtianity is ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that the meek and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſpirit of the goſpel is ſo ſeldom diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by thoſe who call themſelves the diſciples of Chriſt. If ſuperſtition, bigotry and ignorance were not ſo prevalent, we
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011955_0037_0F87890F96827B50"/>
ſhould not ſee ſuch fierce contentions about trifles to the neglect and detriment of the weighter matters of the Law. May toleration and charity be more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally practiſed. "May we look not every one on his own things, but every one alſo on the things of others. May the ignorant be leſs prone to ſpeak evil of the things which they underſtand not, and may the ſtrong bear the infirmities of the weak."</p>
