            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ſenſible that the Subject inſiſted on in the following Sheets, is none of the moſt grateful and pleaſing to corrupt and degenerate Nature, and therefore, if I have aim'd at my own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I have purſued a wrong Method to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or ſecure it, in chuſing this ſo grating and <hi>diſguſting a Subject,</hi> and in treating upon it in ſuch a <hi>po$$|ed Stile:</hi> But, if it is not the moſt pleaſing, I dare be bold to aſſert that it is one of the moſt ſutable, neceſſary and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; conſidering the general and lamentable Security that prevails ſo exceedingly among the Children of this Generation.</p>
                        <p>Although the unjuſt Cenſures of ungodly People, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo far from being afflictive to me, that they afford Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſolation, <hi>Mat. 5.12.</hi> They can't pleaſe me better, than by giving me the Honour of an unjuſt Abuſe; except they turn to the <hi>bleſſed JESUS.</hi> On the contrary their Praiſes make me ſuſpicious (with one of the <hi>Ancients</hi>) that I have done ſomething amiſs; yet, as to the Detracters and Aſperſers themſelves, I cannot but be ſorrowful for the <hi>Sin</hi>
                           <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003967_0003_10036321FB452050"/>they coutract, and the <hi>Danger</hi> they inour, by their unjuſt Reproaches! To prevent both which, I thought it needful to propoſe an Anſwer to ſome general Objections, which, I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, wou'd (according to humane Probability) be level'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the following Compoſura.</p>
                        <p>And</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Perhaps ſome may object againſt the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, as well as againſt the pointed <hi>Manner</hi> of Expreſſion, that both are too terrible.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> What I have advanc'd, I think I have prev'd by plain Scripture Evidence. I hope the Objector will have more Modeſty than to find Fault with the ſacred <hi>Oracles,</hi> becauſe they don't <hi>ſute</hi> his <hi>Plate;</hi> but if waving that antiquated, tho' graceful Vertue, he will fall ſoul on the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I wonder not that he <hi>cenſures</hi> me; and as I wonder not at his <hi>Reflections</hi> againſt my ſelf, ſo I mind them not any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than ſo as to eſteem them, as a <hi>Pearl</hi> in my <hi>Crown,</hi> as a <hi>Badge</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> and a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Triumph.</hi> But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the Truth is, Such be the Miſeries of preſumptuous and impenitent Sinners, in this, and eſpecially in the next World, that what I have offer'd comes far ſhort of an equal, much leſs of an exceſſive Deſcription of them. It is a <hi>juſt</hi> and receiv'd <hi>Maxim</hi> that <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> don't admit a <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> Indeed a <hi>Cherub's Tongue</hi> or <hi>Quill</hi> cou'd ſcarce <hi>expand</hi> or <hi>diſplay</hi> them <hi>ſufficiently.</hi> Conceive of GOD perfectly, and then you may perfectly conceive of and deſcribe his <hi>Anger.</hi> But this is impoſſible for a finite Underſtanding, as <hi>Zophar</hi> informs us, Job <hi>11.7, 8, 9. Canſt thou by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is high as Heaven what canſt thou do? Deeper than Hell, what canſt thou know? The Meaſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea!</hi> Friend, thou ſhalt know by Experience, either by a <hi>ſound Conviction here,</hi> or by a <hi>dreadful Condemnation hereafter,</hi> that I have nor <hi>equal'd,</hi> much leſs <hi>exceeded</hi> the <hi>Sorrows</hi> and Pains of the <hi>damned State,</hi> in the Deſcription I have given of them.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Stile,</hi> I ſhall only offer this brief <hi>Apology,</hi> that the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> treated of, and the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> require it, and inſtead of retracting it, I cou'd wiſh it were much more <hi>pointed,</hi> it falls ſo far ſhort of my Deſire this Way; and tho' I freely acknowledge that planting and watering are nothing to Purpoſe, that the moſt <hi>ſolemn Matter,</hi> and <hi>acrid Stile,</hi> will not avail without the divine <hi>Benediction;</hi> yet in the mean time, I believe that God
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003967_0004_10036325DD713F28"/>ordinarily uſes <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> moſt <hi>ſuted</hi> to the <hi>Work</hi> he deſigns to <hi>accompliſh: Blunt Inſtruments</hi> (in my Opinion) are not <hi>ſuted</hi> to <hi>pierce hard Hearts,</hi> or <hi>alarm ſecure Souls.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to give a ſatisfactory Reply, to this Objection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly conſider'd, if poſſible, I ſhall offer to your Conſideration the Sentiments of ſome great Lights of the Proteſtant Church upon this Head, with ſome of the Reaſons they advance to confirm them by. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in one of his Sermons upon that Text, <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>6.11. Knowing the Terror of the Lord, we perſwade Men;</hi> hath theſe Words, <q>
                              <hi>That if this <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Reaſon does not perſwade Men, there is no Reaſon to expect any other ſhould, if almighty Power cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us, if infinite Juſtice can't affright us, if a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come can't make us tremble, and eternal Miſery leave no Impreſſion upon us, what Arguments or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods <g ref="char:endq">”</g>can we imagine wou'd reclaim us from our Sins?</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Biſhop <hi>Hopkins</hi> in his Sermon upon Heb <hi>10.30.</hi> hath theſe very memorable Expreſſions, pag <hi>367, 8.</hi> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>There are <g ref="char:startq">“</g>two principal Attributes of God, which the Scripture propounds to us as the moſt powerful and efficacious Motives to reſtrain us from Sin; and they are his Mercy and his Juſtice: Mercy tho' it be a ſoft yet it is a ſtrong Argument to encourage us to Purity and Holineſs,</hi> Rom. <hi>2.4. He that can encourage himſelf in his Wickedneſs, upon the Conſideration of the infinite free Grace of God, doth ſpurn theſe very Bowels that yern towards him, and ſtrikes at God with his golden Scepter, yea tears abroad thoſe Wounds that were at firſt opened for him, and caſts the Blood of his Saviour back again in his Face. But becauſe Ingenuity is periſhed from off the Earth, and Men are more generally apt to be wrought upon by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from Fear, than Love, therefore the Scripture propounds to us the dreadful Conſideration of the Juſtice of God, array'd in all the Terrible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, that if Mercy won't allure us, Juſtice may affright us from our Sins. As thoſe who are to travel through Wilderneſſes and Deſarts, carry Fire with them to terrify wild and ravenous Beaſts, to ſecure themſelves from their Aſſaults, ſo doth the great God who hath to deal with brutiſh Men, Men more ſavage than the wild Beaſts; he kindles a Fire about him, &amp; appears to them all in Flames and Fury, that ſo he might fright them from their hold Attempts, who otherwiſe wou'd be ready to run upon his Neck, and the thick Boſſes of his Buckler,</hi>

There is a ſtrange Dullneſs and Stupor ſeiz'd us that we can no longer keep waking then we are ſhook, and therefore as we uſe to apply Fire and burning Coals to Lethargick Perſons to awaken them, ſo we have need to heap Coals of Fire upon Men's Heads, to ſpeak with fiery Tongues, and thunder Wo and Wrath, and Judgments againſt them, that we may rouſe the ſecure and ſtupid World, and ſcorch them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Life and Senſe.</hi>

                              <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this is an Argument ſuted to one <g ref="char:startq">“</g>of the ſtrongeſt Paſſions of humane Nature, our Fears. Nay it's almoſt the only Argument that ſenſual and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Sinners ſeem at firſt capable of being affected and mov'd by. If we endeavour to reclaim them to their Duty, by ſetting before them the endearing Obligations of divine Love: This is an Argument that may indeed touch an ingenuous Mind, but it's likely to make little Impreſſion upon an unthankful and ſtupid Heart. If we wou'd entice them to the Paths of Holineſs, by propoſing to them the ſpiritual Joys that attend them, alas, they neither underſtand nor reliſh them. If we would win and attract them by diſplaying the Glories of Heaven before their Eyes; the Objects are too Sublime and Spiritual for their groſs Affections to aſpire to: So that we have no Argument ſo proper as this, to ſet before them the Torments of Hell. For theſe are the moſt eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and conceiv'd, and if ſeriouſly believ'd and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, they carry the moſt irreſiſtable Force to awaken the Conſciences of the moſt ſtupid Sinners, and convince them of the Neceſſity of flying from the Wrath to come. For who can dwell with devouring Fire? Who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings? This is an Argument that reaches the Principle of Self-Preſervation, ſo deeply rooted in our Natures, that ſtrongly prompts us to flee with all poſſible Speed, from what we apprehend to be the greateſt and moſt certain Evil. So that if any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can make Impreſſion on an obdurate Sinner, it muſt be this drawn from the Proſpect of the eternal Vengeance, as hardeſt Metals are ſooneſt melted by <g ref="char:endq">”</g>the Fire.</hi>

                        <p>Poſſibly ſome may object againſt the <hi>Method,</hi> that it is perplex'd and conſus'd.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, That perhaps the Prolixity of the Diſcourſe, and the Numerouſneſs of the Heads contained in it, makes is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more ſo than it really is, when the whole Frame, and Relation of the ſeveral Parts to each other is complexly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd.

                        <p>If any ſhould again object, that conſidering the <hi>Meanneſs</hi> of the whole <hi>Compoſure,</hi> that it is but a piece of Pride and Preſumption (in ſo critical and cenſorious an Age) to expoſe ſo young a <hi>Production</hi> to publick <hi>Light;</hi> I deſire thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to conſider, whether they are not too <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant</hi> in paſſing ſuch a haſty Judgment upon the ſecret <hi>Springs</hi> of another's <hi>Actions,</hi> which it's <hi>God's Prerogative</hi> and his only <hi>(who is Cardiognoſtos, the Searcher of the Hearts)</hi> to know immediately and infaliibly?

                     <item>1. The <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of the preſumptuous Sinner <hi>detected,</hi> he walke after the Imagination of his Heart, and adds Drunkenneſs to Thirſt.</item>

                  <p>And firſt we have a <hi>ſummary Detection,</hi> or a Diſcovery of his Wickedneſs in two Particulars.</p>

This Charge is more general.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He adds Drunkenneſs to Thirſt: This is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Preſumptuous Sinners not only <hi>purſue</hi> the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate <hi>Gratification</hi> of their <hi>ſenſitive Appetites</hi> and <hi>brutiſh Paſſions</hi> in the <hi>General,</hi> but they are alſo under (for the moſt part) the <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> of ſome darling Luſt in <hi>particular,</hi> which they againſt Light and Knowlege pay a peculiar Veneration to. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Rom</hi> 2.3. The preſumptuous Sinner <hi>adds Drunkenneſs to Thirſt.</hi> That is, ſaith Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi>

Or the Words may be rendred, ſaith he, to add Thirſt to Drunkenneſs, and ſo the Senſe may be this, that when he hath multiplied his Sins, and made himſelf as it were drunk with them, yet he is not ſatisfied therewith, but ſtill whets his Appetite and provokes <g ref="char:endq">”</g>his Thirſt after more.</q> In ſhort, the Words plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a courſe of Sin: A preſumptuous Sinner adds Sin to Sin, goes on in a Courſe of Wickedneſs of one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either <hi>open</hi> or <hi>ſecret</hi> Leſt any be miſtaken, it muſt be acknowleged that all preſumptuous Perſons are not guilty of Prophanen$ſs or Immorality, no, no; ſome of them make a fair Shew in the Fleſh, are regular in their external Conduct, and have the ſtrict <hi>Form</hi> of Godlineſs, though they are deſtitute of the <hi>Power</hi> of it: Witneſs the

                  <p>But what is to be underſtood by the Curſes in general? And why are the Curſes of the Goſpel the muſt terrible in particular? I anſwer, The <hi>Curſe</hi> includes all the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which divine Juſtice has annex'd to the Violation

Now the Curſes of the Goſpel are the moſt terrible for theſe two Reaſons,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe that from the Goſpel there is no <hi>Appeal:</hi> From the Law we may appeal to the Goſpel, but when we abuſe the <hi>Remedy,</hi> our Caſe is <hi>deſperate. Acts</hi> 4.12.</item>
                     <item>2. The Curſes of the Goſpel are Judgments proportion'd to the heinous Quality and crimſon Hue of that Offence which pours Contempt upon the moſt beautiful and bright Appearances of divine Goodneſs and Philanthropy that ever the humane Nature was honour'd with: That Sin ſurely can admit no parallel, which flights the Love that juſtly aſtoniſh'd all the angelick Hoſts, and excited them to expreſs their grateful Reſentments with chearful Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannah's. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14.

                  <p>If it ſhould be inquired, what is the Reaſon that the Sin and Puniſhment of preſumptuous Souls is propos'd in the ſingular Number in this Text? I anſwer,</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003967_0025_1003765994457FB8"/>at thoſe Things at which the Devils <hi>tremble. They have a Whores Forehead that refuſes to be aſham'd,</hi> Jer. 3.3. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> long ago propheſied of this Crew of hardy Mortals that are thus madded againſt God and their own Souls. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. So that their brutiſh Wickedneſs, tho' it ſhall (without Repentance) compaſs their Damnation, yet doth it in the mean time confirm the Truth of the Scriptures. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10. But when married many chuſe another Maſter, they ſerve the World with much Fidelity and Care; and under the Pretence of providing for their Families, looſe the Opportunities of Mercy, and ſo ſtarve and damn their Souls.</p>
                     <p>But I proceed to conſider the ſecond Thing propos'd, which was, <hi>To prove that ſome who are guilty of a Courſe of ſinning, do notwithſtanding expect Peace</hi> Both Scripture and Reaſon prove this, our Text is a plain Evidence of this <hi>terrible Truth.</hi> And further, John 8.33. <hi>We be Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Seed.</hi> But I may anſwer this in the Words of Chriſt, Ver. 39 <hi>If ye were Abraham's Children, ye would do the Works of Abraham. We be not born of Fornication; we have one Father even God,</hi> Ver. 41. But I may ſay to you, as the Lord Jeſus did to them, Ver. 44. <hi>Ye are of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, and the Luſts of your Father ye will do.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle's Caution againſt Deceit, <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> plainly ſuppoſes, that theſe vile Perſons that were guilty of the unworthy Actions and Villanies mention'd, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding expected Salvation; which falſe and fooliſh Conceit he labours, not only in this, but in ſeveral other Places of his Writings, to tear up by the Roots; as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, Gal. 6.7, 8 <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a Man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap, For he that ſoweth to his Fleſh, ſhall of his Fleſh reap Corruption.</hi> Theſe Words ſuppoſe this, that tho' Men ſow to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> yet that they are prone to expect another kind of Harveſt, viz A <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> This Expectation the Apoſtle aſſerts to be not only falſe &amp; unreaſonable, but a down-right mocking of the great God, Mat. 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; but he that doeth the Will of my Father
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003967_0026_10037660B5CF19C8"/>which is in Heaven. Many will ſay to me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out Devils? and in thy Name done many wonderful Works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you: Depart from me ye that work Iniquity.</hi> By theſe Verſes we are inſtructed that many wicked People, will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retain their falſe Hopes in this World, but even have the Impudence to plead their wretched Performances with Chriſt himſelf in the next, but to very little Purpoſe. Joh. 9.40. <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> ſaid the Phariſees to Chriſt, and yet many of them were very wicked, neglected the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Righteouſneſs, Mercy; and for a Pretence made long Prayers, to prey upon the poor Widows, for which our Lord told them they ſhould receive <hi>the greater Damnation, Mat.</hi> 23.14. So many life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Formaliſts, if they have a pretty deal of Knowledge, and are advanc'd in Years, eſpecially diſdain to have the Goodneſs of their State queſtion'd; they are apt to ſay with the proud Phariſees, Are we blind alſo? To ſuch I would return Chriſt's Anſwer, <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no Sin: but now ye ſay, We ſee; therefore your Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</hi> If you ſaw your Blindneſs, your Sins would not be ſo great, you would be in the Way to get them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and your dangerous State chang'd. You know the fooliſh Virgins had a ſtrong, tho' falſe Hope, which they held to the Death: Now tho' they were outwardly well poliſh'd, yet it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they indulg'd ſome ſecret Wickedneſs; for as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> ſaith, <q>As <g ref="char:startq">“</g>every Dog hath his Kennel, and every Swine hath his <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Swill, ſo every unconverted Man hath his Luſt.</q> Bloody <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> the Conjurer could call God their God. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> in the 6th Chapter of his Book, 1, 3, 4, and 5. Verſes, ſhews that there were ſome that put the evil Day far off, and caus'd the Seat of Violence to come near, that fared ſumptuouſly, and liv'd merrily, that eat Calves out of the Stall, and chanted to the ſound of the Viol; theſe he ſays, were at Eaſe in Zion, and from whence could this falſe Eaſe flow, but from their falſe Hope; therefore the Prophet pronounces a Curſe upon them, <hi>Wo to them that are at Eaſe in Zion.</hi>

Iſai. 43.24 <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy Sins, thou haſt wearied me with thine Iniquities.</hi> Amos 2.13. <hi>Behold I am preſſed under you as a Cart is preſſed that is full of Sheaves.</hi> Is there not a Cont$ariety in it's <hi>Nature</hi> to all the <hi>Perfections of God,</hi> a <hi>Wrong</hi> to his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> an <hi>Offence</hi> to <hi>Holineſs,</hi> a <hi>Contempt</hi> of his <hi>Authority,</hi> an <hi>Affront</hi> to his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> a <hi>Provocation</hi> of his <hi>Power,</hi> and an <hi>Abuſe</hi> of his <hi>Mercy?</hi> Is not that an <hi>infinite Evil,</hi> which is <hi>oppos'd</hi> to ſuch an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Good?</hi> By Sin the Creature neglects the <hi>Homage,</hi> and rejects the <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which is due by all the <hi>Laws of Nature</hi> and Reaſon, to his <hi>Creator, Preſerver,</hi> and <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi> by Sin.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Negligence.</hi> Want of Examination of their State, or Partiality in it. Some Men being doubtful of the Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their State, becauſe of their wicked Actions, do not care to look into their Boſoms, for Fear of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Uneaſineſs, but will <hi>truſt</hi> that it is good without <hi>Tryal</hi> They would not do ſo in receiving Money, tho' it were but a ſmall Sum, they wou'd view a fourteen peny Bill carefully to ſee whither it had the Signers Names, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they wou'd accept it: We may ſee by this what a ſmall Price many put upon their Souls.

Or they'l try themſelves only, by ſome of the loweſt Signs of Grace, (and that but lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too) and paſs by others; and theſe Men are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of and confident in their own Judgment, that they don't care to call in the Help of experienc'd Miniſters, in this arduous Affair, as the primitive Chriſtians did, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.$7. Ay but Friends, If you had a juſt Value for your Souls, and your Underſtandings were opened as theirs were, you would be afraid of being miſtaken in a Matter of ſuch vaſt Concern and Importance. Diſtruſtful of your own Judgment as they were, apply your ſelf for Direction to ſome faithful Miniſter, or judicious and experienc'd Chriſtian. You'l bring your Deeds for Land to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to be ſearch'd by them, for Fear of ſome Flaw or
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003967_0031_10037671C28EE840"/>Defect that you can't diſcover; and why don't you take as much Care about your Souls, as you do about your Eſtates. Open your Caſe as it really is to an honeſt Soul ſearching-Miniſter this wou'd be very <hi>pleaſing</hi> to them, and it may be very <hi>profitable</hi> to you. It's a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maxim (and a very true one) that Men are apt to be partial in their own Caſe. This is as applicable to the Concerns of the Soul, as of the Body. It's a pity that Men who are ſo curious in their Searches after the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of other Things, ſhould be ſo willingly ignorant of themſelves, which is indeed the moſt neceſſary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Knowlege; without it we can't obtain the ſaving Knowlege of God, or an Intereſt in his Love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19, 22. Thou that boaſteſt of thy Knowlege of Tongues and Arts, pray remember the Heathen Proveth, <hi>Gnoſthe Seauton,</hi> Know thy ſelf; which thou can'ſt not obtain without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Self-Examination.</p>

                     <p>Now this Self-Love excites them to think the beſt of themſelves. They know there is ſome Difficulty in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> therefore they are inclin'd to hope this is over on the Account of their Eaſe; but Friends, ſeeing that your Conceit can't make your State good, if it be bad, is it not better to endure ſom preſent neceſſary and temporary Trouble, while there's Hopes of getting your State remedied, than to endure eternal Pains wihout Hope or Poſſibility of Recovery? <hi>But this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that doeth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> John 3.19, 20.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Inconſideration.</hi> Thoughtleſneſs about themſelves as to their State towards God and Eternity. Though the moſt of People are very earneſt and thoughtful in the Purſuit of their carnal Pleaſures, and <hi>temporary Gain;</hi> yet they are very indolent and careleſs about the Affairs of their <hi>eternal Happineſs.</hi> They are ſo hurried about the Honours, Profits and Pleaſures of the World, that they have no Time to ſeek and Intereſt in an endleſs Life. O ſtrange Madneſs, unworthy of the rational Nature! but remember, O inconſiderate Soul that awful Threat of the terrible God! <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.22. And may it be to thee, as the Hand-writing on the Wall to <hi>Belſhazzer.</hi> What Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Lamentation is it that Men who have ſo noble

But that of gracious Souls always effects this, that tho' they be guilty of Sins of Infirmity, yet the <hi>Courſe</hi> and <hi>Tenor</hi> of their Lives is <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.

Prov.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.6, 8, 20, 24. The ſpiritual Conflict for the moſt part <hi>prevents</hi> groſs Acts of Sin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.23. which the other <hi>admits, Matth</hi> 23.23.24.

O! it's a great Stoop to a proud haughty Sinner, and ſuch we are all by Nature, to come to Chriſt as a helpleſs, hunger-ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beggar, and to ſue for an Alms of meer Mercy: The Truth is, it's ſo much againſt the Grain, that thouſands will rather be damned than do it.

                     <p n="1">1. If Certainty or Aſſurance of Salvation were unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to what Purpoſe then ſhould we be enjoined by God <hi>to give Diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. And</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To what Purpoſe ſhould ſo many Signs and Characters of ſaving Grace be laid down in the Word, and we comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to examine our ſelves, and prove our ſelves? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 28. But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thought ſtrange of the contrary Opinion, <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. As if he ſhould ſay, It's a ſtrange Thing indeed, if you don't know your gracious State.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To what $urpoſe then is the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> which teſtifies with our Spirits that we are the Sons of God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. The new Name, the hidden Manna, which none knoweth but him that hath it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. But he that hath it knows it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 How came the ancient Chriſtians to obtain it, if it be not attainable, and to call the contrary the <hi>Spirit of the World?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. It's well known by Men of any <hi>Letters</hi> that this, the Body of the Proteſtant Churches have given their unanimous <hi>Suffrage</hi> to, and that the contrary is the darling Notion of the Antichriſtian Romiſh Church. But what is the Reaſon you ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Aſſurance?</hi> Poſſibly it's this, thou art a Stranger to a Work of God's Grace in thy own Soul, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy falſe Peace, thou thinkeſt that every Body is like thy ſelf; this is ſome of thy <hi>Charity,</hi> who art apt to accuſe others as cenſorious Judges: but how can we know? How can we know? I can't ſee: Friend, it's no Wonder you can't ſee, when you are blind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rev</hi> 3.17.

You don't know that you have Grace, how do you know that which is not, you are ſo humble as to queſtion your State, ſometimes when you are forc'd to it by the Gnawings of a guilty Mind, perhaps for ſome groſs Offences; but your Humility muſt lead you further before ever your Heart be changed, even to condemn your preſent State as Chriſtleſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Well if our State be bad, we can't change it our ſelves.

This the Parable of the Talents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms; if the impotent Man had not continued at the Pool, it's probable he would have miſſed Healing.</p>

God keep me, is a terrible Sin. What Diſpair! have Mercy upon us! But Friend, without ſuch <hi>Flame</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> let us talk a little ſoberly of the Matter, and inquire into the Reaſons of thy great Averſion againſt this Evil.</p>
                     <p>Don't it proceed from <hi>Love</hi> to thy own <hi>Eaſe,</hi> more than <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God's Honour?</hi> Yes it does; and if ever thou comeſt to know thy ſelf, thou wilt confeſs it: My Reaſon is this? If it was only upon the Account of the Sin you had this great Averſion, you would equally abhor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, becauſe it's equally Derogatory to the divine Honours, as will appear under the fourth Head. But why ſayeſt thou that you ſhould certainly fall into Diſpair, if you thought much on theſe Things? Why ſome have diſpaired by thinking upon them: Well, what tho' ſome ignorant Perſons thro' the violent Temptation of the Devil have diſpaired, does this neceſſarily infer that thou ſhalt alſo?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's their <hi>Sins</hi> that occaſions their <hi>Diſpair,</hi> not their <hi>Sorrow</hi> for Sin, and religious <hi>Meditation.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. What though ſome did <hi>Miſcarry,</hi> is this enough to beat thee off from all Endeavours after Repentance and Holineſs?

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003967_0056_100376BD0E63F9A8"/>the Holy Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9. the Calls of Chriſt which thou laboureſt to <hi>quench</hi> and <hi>murder.</hi> If theſe were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and increaſed by Meditation and Supplication, the Iſſue (in all Probability) would be thy Converſion and Salvation, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13, 14. But the Way thou takeſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Right it may ſeem in thine own Eyes, ends in Death. <hi>For there is a Way which ſeems right to a Man, but the End thereof are the Ways of Death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. Yea ſome Formaliſts are ſo blind in this Matter, that having conceived (tho' without a Foundation) a good Opinion of their preſent State, miſtake the <hi>Convictions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> for the <hi>Temptation of the Devil,</hi> and ſo under a Notion of oppoſing the Devil, they fight againſt God: When God and their own Conſciences tells them the Truth, viz. That their State is damnable, becauſe they want a ſound Conviction, and the Experiences of God's ſpecial Love. They look upon it to be an Inſinuation of the Devil, and ſo oppoſe it, and thereby ruin themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But how knoweſt thou, O Sinner! that thou ſhould'ſt certainly fall into Diſpair, by thinking ſolemnly about thy Soul's State? Which of the three thouſand that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon fell into Diſpair? Nay, it's ſo far from this, that a neceſſary Sorrow for Sin, and Concern for thy Salvation is the Way to <hi>prevent</hi> a final and fatal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, as being a <hi>Compliance</hi> with the poſitive Commands of God. <hi>Plow up the fallow Ground of your Hearts,</hi> Jer. 4.3. <hi>Rent your Hearts and not your Garments,</hi> Joel 2.13. <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your Laughter be turned into Mourning, and your Joy into Heavineſs,</hi> Jam 4.9.

The Reaſon why thou art ſo much afraid of <hi>Diſpair,</hi> is becauſe it is ſo <hi>painful</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> and Preſumption ſo <hi>Eaſy,</hi> a ſweet Poiſon: O poor Sinner! be informed that on this very Account thou art in much more Danger of being ruin'd by Preſumption than Diſpair. The holy Scriptures that afford us an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Account of above four thouſand Years, yet inform us of but two that periſhed by Diſpair, viz <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> Now if thou believeſt and conſidereſt that but the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Number are ſaved, how many Millions muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in that Time by Preſumption.</p>

                     <p>Excuſe 2. It's but a <hi>trick</hi> of Youth, a <hi>Foible,</hi> to kiſs a pretty Maid.

                     <p>Excuſe 3. It's what almoſt <hi>all practiſe,</hi> and eſpecially People of the beſt <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Faſhion. Anſw</hi> Tho' it muſt be confeſs'd that there is too great reaſon to <hi>fear</hi> that this Sin is too common and flagrant in this perverſe Age; yet there is reaſon to <hi>hope</hi> that a conſiderable Number are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from the Infection. As to what you offer further that the People of Senſe and Faſhion practiſe this. I anſwer, That it's to be fear'd the Aſſertion has too much Truth in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That many of thoſe who make a gay and great Appearance and ſplendid Figure in the World, who would be eſteemed indeed the only Men of Senſe (as if their Judgment muſt of neceſſity be proportioned to the <hi>bulk</hi> of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> the <hi>heighth</hi> of their <hi>Imaginations,</hi> or the <hi>loſtineſs</hi> of their <hi>Looks</hi>) are guilty of it. But ſuppoſing them to be poſſeſs'd of a large Stock of natural Wit and acquired Learning, as it's confeſs'd ſome of the Devil's Children have; but not ſo much as many of them conceit neither: Some of Satan's <hi>Brats</hi> are meer <hi>Dunces,</hi> tho' they would all be eſteemed <hi>Solomon</hi>'s: I ſay, do they ſhew their Wit in rejecting the Government of Reaſon, and the Laws of God, in the purſuit of brutiſh Pleaſures? But what patronage can you get from them? Muſt not every Man anſwer for his own Sins? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.13. If they have much Wit and Knowledge, and live in defiance of it, does it not heighten their Sin? and won't, it their Condemnation? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. Can the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any Vice leſſen it's malignant qualities? Can it be imagin'd that reſpect of Perſons will be ſhewn to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to their Civil Diſtinctions here, at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment? No ſurely, the moſt of the great Ones will be in a moſt woful plight in that Day. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.15, 16. Their Rank and Quality does not free them from the common <hi>Viciſſitudes</hi> of Fortune in this World, Sickneſs and Death ſhews no reſpect to their Greatneſs; and when enter'd the Grave the Worms feed as freely on their <hi>Hearts,</hi> as the Heart of a Beggar; and then People are as free with their (moſtly) <hi>infamous Characters,</hi> as the Worms are with their <hi>pamper'd Bodies.</hi> Now if their Creatneſs can't help them in this World in the foreſaid reſpects, how much leſs in the next?</p>
                     <p>Excuſe 4 Some will pretend that they are induc'd to this Sin by a kind of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> for they are not able they ſay to maintain a Wife credibly, but when they get their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance increas'd by Trading, then they intend to marry and reform.

                     <p n="1">1. They <hi>Swear</hi> to the <hi>Truth.</hi> What then, one may Swear <hi>vainly</hi> to confirm what is <hi>true,</hi> and that they do when they Swear unneceſſarily and cuſtomarily, in common Diſcourſe: This cuſtomary Swearing gradually wears off the <hi>dread</hi> of <hi>God's Majeſty,</hi> and inſe$$$$ly leads to <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood</hi> and <hi>Perjury;</hi> an <hi>Evil</hi> that makes thoſe <hi>Monsters</hi> that
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:003967_0079_10037711CDC27600"/>commit it ridiculous, for who wou'd not ſuſpect him that ſuſpects himſelf. Was there ever a greater Monſter in Nature, than the raſh Sweater? A Man that perhaps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes much <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Penetration,</hi> one that thinks (probably) that all the ſober part of the World are <hi>Fools,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſon of his <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and yet in one of his witty Flights, he ſells his Soul to the Devil for nothing, for a Sin that is neither attended by Pleaſure or Profit, and is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſious that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> ſhould have his Bargain immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which he expreſſes in his ſtrange Acts of Devotion, praying that God would damn <hi>(horeſco refrens)</hi> him, or the Devil take him: Friend, you need not be ſo earneſt with God to damn you; without Doubt his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> will oblige him to grant you your <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> without much <hi>Importunity;</hi> you need not fear but he will <hi>ſeal</hi> your Mittimus for <hi>Tophet,</hi> and caſt ſuch <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> as you are among the <hi>Devils</hi> your <hi>Companions;</hi> there you ſhall have curſing enough, and be obliged to <hi>gnaw</hi> your Tongues for <hi>Pain;</hi> thoſe wretched Inſtruments by which you have reflected ſo much Diſhonour upon the God that made you: One would think your other Wickedneſs would be enough to procure you that Portion, without much other Labour, and is this your great Wiſdom!

                        <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> (in their notion if their Lives may be allowed to interpret their Sentiments) are beneath their <hi>ſoaring Fancies,</hi> which are buſied with Matters of greater Importance, viz. <hi>Catching of Flies;</hi> as it's ſtoried of a Roman Emperor: No, no, they leave the Reſtraints of Religion (which they count Shackles) to Perſons of a <hi>vulgar Mould.</hi> Thus as the Wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>The Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Fools deſtroy them,</hi> Prov. 1.32.</p>
                     <p>Plea 2. But perhaps ſome may plead, that they don't Swear, only atteſt what they ſay by their Faith and Truth. I anſwer, This includes not only prophase Sweating, but Idolatry alſo in its boſom: If a neceſſ$$$ lawful Oath be a part of God's Worſhip, as it certainly is. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.23. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6. Then it's Idolatry to give this part of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Creature, which is due only to the Creator. The deſign of an Oath is an <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> concerning the <hi>Truth</hi> of what we ſpeak: Now when this is done with <hi>Solemnity,</hi> God is <hi>glorified;</hi> for by this <hi>appeal</hi> we acknowledge the <hi>Perfections</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> particularly, his <hi>Omniſcience, Omnipreſence, Juſtice.</hi> Now when any Swear by a Creature (which Faith and Truth are) we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to Creatures the Attributes of God; this the Lord highly reſents, Jer. 5.7. <hi>How ſhall I pardon thee for this? Thy Children have forſaken me, and ſworn by thoſe that are no God's.</hi> Conſider O Sinner! <hi>God will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain: The Curſe ſhall enter into the Swearers Houſe, and there reſt,</hi> Zech. 5.4.</p>
                     <p>Plea 3. Some will ſay they mean no <hi>harm,</hi> it's only a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> they have got, which they can't eaſily leave. Anſwer, Whatever they mean, they do harm by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's poſitive <hi>Law,</hi> contemning his <hi>Authority,</hi> and expoſing themſelves thereby to his Curſe and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> for he has ſaid, he will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain; and ſurely he will make good his Word to their Confuſion, except they repent. As for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> it's ſo far from leſſening, that it very much heightens their Wickedneſs. If a Man convicted of Felony, and arraigned at the Bar, ſhould plead in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that he was ſo us'd to Thieving, he could not help it; would this alleviate his Crime? or ſave his Neck from the Halter? No certainly, the Judge would be apt to anſwer, as it's ſtoried of one, <q>that if he, meaning the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Criminal, was accuſtomed to Stealing, he himſelf had a cuſtom of Condemning ſuch, and that therefore he muſt

To conclude this Head, it's very ſurprizing! that Men who pretend to Manners ſhould offer ſuch an incivility in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as to treat with diſhonour and contempt the Name of One whom all the <hi>ſober</hi> part of Mankind <hi>eſteen</hi> and <hi>revere,</hi> and therefore can't but ſuffer by the inſolent Affronts that are caſt upon him; ſuch a Practiſe is no leſs than an unmannerly and cruel <hi>'Perſecution</hi> of thoſe we Converſe with; if they be not Men quite abandon'd to all ſenſe of <hi>honeſtly</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi>

Of <hi>Abraham</hi> teaching his Poſterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19. Of the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31, 33. Of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10.2. Of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> 24th Chapter of his Book and 15th verſe. Of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan 6.10. This was ſhadowed forth by the Morning and Evening Sacrifice, which was under the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh EOconomy continually offer'd to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>Precept:</hi> When we are commanded to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> Mat. 6.9. which Prayer being plural in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſion, ſuppoſes more than one preſent. We are commanded to pray with <hi>all Prayer,</hi> Eph. 6.18. But
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003967_0083_10035A844F12E300"/>this is one kind of Prayer. Hence it was that the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Chriſtians were call'd Churches, or Churches in their Houſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.22. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. We are commanded to pray <hi>without ceaſing,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. The Servants of <hi>Solomon</hi> are ſaid to ſtand <hi>continually before him,</hi> tho' it was only at ſtated times. <hi>David's</hi> comfortable Speech to <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>eat bread at his table continually,</hi> 2. Sam. 9.7. ſignifies only his eating there at ſet times, otherwiſe his Speech would have been big with terror and puniſhment inſtead of comfort. So <hi>Jehoiachin</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> is ſaid to eat bread continually in the preſence of the King of Babylon all the days of his Life, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.33. Sure no body can be ſo vain as to imagine that he are every minute; then indeed his Life would not have laſted long at that rate of gormandizing. So then this Command of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Praying without ceaſing, at leaſt ſignifies our being always in a praying Frame, and more eſpecially our punctual obſervance of the ſtated Seaſons of Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the Divine Threatning for the neglect of it. Jer. 10.25. <hi>I will pour out my fury upon the Heathen that know me not, and upon the Families that call not on my Name. Obſerve</hi> here the dangerous Condition of Prayerleſs Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they are the <hi>Objects</hi> of God's <hi>Indignation:</hi> Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The neglect of this Duty is a <hi>Pagan Practiſe:</hi> Upon the Heathen. Truly 'tis worſe than that of the Meho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitans, for they Pray five times a Day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The neglect of Family Religion is a plain Evidence of <hi>groſs Ignorance,</hi> and want of acquaintance with God. We may without breach of Charity under the patronage of this precious Scripture call thoſe People Heathens, who neglect this Duty; and indeed they are ſo in fact, tho' perhaps they are Chriſtians in Name, who neglect this Duty totally or frequently, and yet have had Opportunity of being inſtructed concerning its neceſſity and uſefulneſs. Where we have a <hi>Tent</hi> God ſhould have an <hi>Altar,</hi> upon which ſhould be offered ſpiritual Sacrifices.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Don't Reaſon confirm what I have advanc'd on this Head? Is there no Family Sins to be confeſſed, no Family Mercies to be implored and acknowleged? Is not this Practice of excellent Tendency, not only to your ſelves, but alſo to your Children and Servants? Therefore we are bid <hi>to train up a Child in the Way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it,</hi> Prov. 22.6. How will
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003967_0084_1003771B2BDEB680"/>you be able to give an Account of the Charge committed to you before the great God, who neglect to inſtruct, admoniſh and pray with your Children and Servants: If they periſh through your neglect of Inſtruction, either by <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> are you not guilty of their <hi>Blood?</hi> O Friends! conſider if in that great Day of God, when you ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the <hi>flaming Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> would it not be terrible to hear ſome of your Children and Servants accuſing and curſing you, as the Inſtruments of their Ruin, thro' your vile Neglect of this Duty, and other wicked Practices? And this indeed is likely enough to be your <hi>Caſe,</hi> if you don't alter your <hi>Courſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be objected, 1. That ſuch a Courſe of praying wou'd be <hi>formal:</hi> I anſwer, It's your own <hi>Fault</hi> if it be ſo. I am ſure that praying frequently, if with neceſſary Caution and Solemnity is the appointed Way and Mean to obtain vital Religion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9. I ſuppoſe indeed that this Duty is coldly and ſuperficially performed by ſome carnal People, and no better can be expected of them while they remain in that State, unleſs it be ſome Sparks of their own kindling, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.11. And ſometimes under the <hi>bidings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Face,</hi> true Chriſtians may <hi>languiſh</hi> in their <hi>Devotion,</hi> which <hi>Sloth</hi> may much increaſe: <hi>By Night on my Bed I ſought him,</hi> Cant. 3.1. which is much to be <hi>lamented!</hi> But does this make the Duty, in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, the leſs worthy of the Eſteem of conſcientious Perſons? This Argument militates as much againſt ſtated hearing of the Word, reading the Scriptures, ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which are commanded Duties, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25 <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. We don't undervalue natural Food becauſe we partake of it frequently, or becauſe others abuſe it.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. I pray now and then when I am in a good <hi>Frame.</hi> O Hypocrite! I doubt thy Frame is little worth; that which don't come in God's Way, (I mean in the Way of earneſt Seeking) it is generally either a Deluſion of the Devil, or at beſt ſome tranſient Sorrow, occaſioned by the gnawing of thy natural Conſcience for ſome Wickedneſs thou haſt committed, ſuch as the Pagans have as well as thou, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</p>

And what then, that is but a light Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the precious <hi>Jeſus;</hi> if your Head was to be laid on the Block for this Practice, which is much more, you would run the Risk of it, if you were a Child of God. Remember <hi>Daniel:</hi> If you profeſs not Chriſt before Men, how do you think he will profeſs you before his Father and the holy Angels?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. For neglecting to hear the Word of God, ſome will offer the following Pleas.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Miniſter is an <hi>odd ſort of a Man,</hi> he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Hell and Damnation.</hi> Anſwer, Was not <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> a terrible Preacher? <hi>Behold the Ax is laid to the Root of the Tree, every Tree,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that bringeth not forth good Fruit ſhall be $own down and caſt into the Fire,</hi> Mat. 3.10. <hi>O Generation of Vipers.</hi> Mat. 12.34. Was not Chriſt himſelf an awful Preacher? It's true he pronounced Bleſſings upon his Diſciples, and ſo do his faithful Miniſters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. But how many bitter Curſes did he thunder out againſt the Phariſees, that ſelf righteous Generation, that built upon their own Works? <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13,—17 In the Compaſs of four Verſes, he denounces <hi>ſour Curſes</hi> upon them. With what Solemnity and Frequency did our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord inculcare the <hi>grizly Horrors</hi> and <hi>endleſs Pains of the damned World! Mat.</hi> 8.12. Was not this the Practice of the Apoſtles? <hi>Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11. Upon which Text, learned <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> juſtly obſerves, That if the Terrors of God and Eternity will not perſwade Men to forſake their vicious Courſes, nothing elſe will. The great Neceſſity of uſing Terror appears from the following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Holy Spirit begins with <hi>Conviction John</hi> 16.8, 9. Now ſhould not Miniſters follow the <hi>Order</hi> of the Holy Spirit's Operations on the Soul? Does not natural Reaſon teach this, and Men's Practice in other Affairs? In Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, don't Men dig deep, and lay the Foundation firſt? For that ancient Proverb is moſt juſt, <hi>Stabit Opus melius$ſt bene fixa Baſis,</hi> The Superſtructure will ſtand the better if
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:003967_0086_10035A8AEE6B0A98"/>the Foundation be well laid. To preach Comfort to Men before a ſound Conviction, is as ridiculous as if a Maſon ſhould pretend to erect a fair Fabrick in the airy Regions. Do not Men plow the Ground before they ſow it? This Similitude the Holy Spirit uſes in the Word, Jer. 4.3. <hi>Plow up the fallow Ground of your Hearts, and ſow not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Thorns.</hi> Would it not be very ridiculous for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to ſow his Ground before he plowed it, or to caſt Seed upon a flinty Rock? It's every whit as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for Miniſters to preach Comfort to unconvinced Souls. <hi>There is no Peace ſaith my God to the Wicked,</hi> Iſai. 48.22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Unconverted People have a clearer Notion of <hi>Pain,</hi> both bodily and mental, than of the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a pious Life, for they have had the Experience of the one, but not of the other; they have no juſt Notion of the raviſhing Sweets of <hi>Religion,</hi> either in this Life or that to come; for a Stranger doth not intermeddle with thoſe Joys, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. Now is not a Perſon more apt to be affected with thoſe Things he knows, than with the Things he knows not?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Unconverted People are govern'd by ſelfiſh Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, fill'd with Hatred againſt the good God; as I prov'd before. How then can it be reaſonably expected that ſuch Perſons will be much moved by Love Arguments when they are without that noble generous <hi>Paſſion</hi> in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Eminence</hi> towards God? Is not Love Loves Load$ ſtone? A Man never loves God truly and tranſcendently until he feels the warm <hi>Beams</hi> of God's Love <hi>glowing</hi> in his Breaſt: <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 John 4.19. As the Sun ſhining upon Glaſs has it's Rays reflected or retorted, ſo a Believer's Love to Chriſt is nothing but his own reflected. It's true, ungodly People may have ſome tranſient Motion of the Affections when they hear a Love Subject paſſionately handled, but theſe <hi>Affections</hi> are like the <hi>morning Cloud and early Dew,</hi> Hoſ. 6.14. &amp; 13.3.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But ſuch a Miniſter is <hi>uncivil</hi> in his publick <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> he does not treat Mankind with Manners and Diſcretion. In anſwer to this, Let me crave leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that one can hardly call a wicked Man out of his Name: Won't you allow us the Liberty to <hi>learn Manners</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's School?</hi> Is not his Word the beſt <hi>Directory</hi> for the Manners of Chriſtians? I hope you won't have ſuch a hardy Front as to call Chriſt and his Apoſtles unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons, and why ſhould you any that follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples?

Hypocrites, 23. Serpents, &amp; a Generation of Vipers, 33. Foxes, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32. Whited Walls, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.3. The Apoſtles called them Dogs, Phil. 3.2. <hi>Beware of Dogs, beware of evil Workers,</hi> Rev. 22.15. <hi>For without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a Lie.</hi> Yea Beaſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32.

Miniſters ſhould endeavour to <hi>draw</hi> People by Degrees by a <hi>mild winning Way,</hi> they ſhould offer <hi>Milk</hi> to <hi>Babes:</hi> Yes, yes, this is the Way to gain them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but not to Chriſt. Your Advice Friend, is the old Story over again, pray hear what God ſays of it, Iſai. 30.9, 10 <hi>That this is a rebellious People; lying Children that will not hear the Law of the Lord, which ſay to the Seers, See not, and to the Prophets, Propheſy not unto us right Things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth Things, propheſy Deceits</hi> Is it proper think you for a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to <hi>act</hi> according to the <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> of a <hi>diſtemper'd Patient?</hi> If one that is in a Lethargy, a little before he falls into his Fits ſhould adviſe his Phyſician, that whatever he did, beſure to give him eaſy Medicines; do you think that a Man of any Senſe or Conſcience would follow that Direction? I think not. Thus Chriſtleſs Perſons are all of them before their Conviction in this lethargick Sleep, which they don't care to be rouſed out of, becauſe of the Pain occaſioned by ſuch an Alarm. Suppoſe a Man were ſleeping ſecurely and dreaming pleaſantly, while the Houſe was a Fire over his Head, would it not be a Deed of Mercy, to awake ſuch a Perſon? Yes, I ſuppoſe you'l allow this. Now ſuppoſe you your ſelves endeavour'd by a ſudden <hi>Alarm</hi> to rouſe that Man (for I charitably preſume you would allow the Exerciſe of ſome Zeal to ſave a Man's Life from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Flames) you would not ſurely go to whiſper in his Ear ſome ſoft round about Diſcourſe, that his Houſe was you feared not in the beſt Condition poſſible, it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps take Damage if ſuitable Care were not taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. I ſay would you go thus about the <hi>Buſh</hi> with the poor Man in a Time of ſuch <hi>Danger?</hi> No, I believe not: I fancy you would take a rougher Method, without <hi>Ceremony</hi> or Grimace. Now what if this Man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn your Courteſy and Kindneſs to him in Diſtreſs with a <hi>Blow</hi> on your <hi>Face,</hi> while the poor Creature was but half
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:003967_0088_10037725EA93A498"/>awaked out of his ſweet Sleep, being ignorant of his good Deſign: The Caſe applies it ſelf. This truly is much the Condition and Carriage of a ſecure Chriſtleſs World. If a Perſon that was cachextick or under a bad Habit of Body, ſhould adviſe the Phyſician to give him Elixirs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials continually, becauſe he had a natural Averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Phyſick, either Emetick or Cathartick; ſhould the Phyſician obſerve this Direction, and would it effect a Cure? If one that had an old Ulcer, or a mortify'd Leg or Arm, would pray the Chyrurgeon to lay by his <hi>Probe</hi> and <hi>Saw,</hi> for he could not bear to ſee thoſe Inſtruments, they always terrify'd him, but if he muſt ſhew them at any Time, to let the World know that he had a good <hi>Set</hi> of <hi>Tools,</hi> and thereby eſtabliſh his <hi>Character,</hi> that he would intreat him that this ſhould be but ſeldom, and that he would keep them at a due Diſtance, and in the mean time, uſe emolient lenitive Medicines; would it be proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Directions think you, to avoid the groundleſs Charge of Cruelty, &amp; incur deſervedly that of Murder or Fraud?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object</hi> 4. But you'l object, that <hi>Milk</hi> ſhould be offer'd to <hi>Babes:</hi> Yes, yes, by all Means, I have nothing againſt it, but I hope you don't think any are Babes before they are born; I dare be bold to ſay, if you were regenerated by the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; ſo Babes in Chriſt, you would love the Doctrines of Converſion, Faith, Repentance, as the Child the Breaſt, for theſe are the firſt and great Principles of practical Religion. But how can you think you are Babes when you are unacquainted with the <hi>Pangs</hi> of the <hi>New-Birth.</hi> Nay, perhaps inſtead of the experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>noble Change,</hi> you are apt to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether ſuch a Thing be attainable; whether the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of People about it don't conſiſt very much, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in Fancy, Melancholly or Enthuſiaſm; and may be in your great Wiſdom you are apt to fleer or ſmile at the mentioning of ſuch a Change; and yet in the mean time, you pretend to believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Truth, John</hi> 3.9. I pray you reconcile your <hi>Faith</hi> and your <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> together if you can, and ſee if the one be not <hi>Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the other <hi>Madneſs</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi> But is there not Children in another Senſe?

You would be apt to ſay, O that is a fine Miniſter indeed, he is not always thundring about Hell and Damnation, he is a Man of Senſe and Learning, I believe he ſhews the Way to Heaven with <hi>Moderation,</hi> he does not lead People into a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and there leave them; you would court ſuch a Man's Converſation which you would find according to your Hearts Deſire, worldly and vain, may be a little Religion ſpoken of by Chance, and that of the doctrinal and controverſial Parts (not the experimental, they'l take care to avoid that) of Religion, and that offered with haughty, or light Air, which leaves no laſting Impreſſion on the Audience; theſe are the fine Men that the World is bleſs'd with, Hoſannah, Hoſannah! O the Blindneſs and Madneſs of an infatuated World! Such <hi>Soul Murderers,</hi> and <hi>dry Nurſes</hi> are the only Men fit to be eſteemed and careſſed! You would fly the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a faithful Miniſter, as you would do a Lyon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his pious Diſcourſes gall you, and you are afraid poor Souls of being converted.

                     <p n="1">$word$. To make charitable Diſtributions of the good Thing$ of Providence which we enjoy, for the Relief of the Po$$ and Indigent, is neceſſary by the poſitive Law of God; <hi>To do good and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch Sacriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces God is well pleaſed,</hi> Heb. 13.16. <hi>Caſt thy Bread upon the water,</hi> Eccleſ, 11.1. <q>Caſt your Seed upon low Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;" ſo ſome underſtand it, alluding to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <g ref="char:startq">“</g>(ſaith Mr. <hi>H$nry</hi>) who ſpares ſome of the Bread-Corn he has for his Family to ſow his Land, knowing <g ref="char:endq">”</g>that without this he can have no Harveſt another Year.</q> This Text certainly imports our giving to ſuch who are not able to requite us. <q>This for that, is rather a Truck <g ref="char:startq">“</g>than a Benefit," ſays <hi>Seneca;</hi> we ſhould ſend our Gifts a Venture, as Merchants do that trade by Sea, they won't ſink intirely in the Waters: Indeed the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of giving with a good Deſign, is a preſent Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>

                     <p n="2">2. By the Nature of God: Which is our Honour, our Duty and Intereſt to imitate. <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 John 4.8. both eſſentially and communicatively; his <hi>Being</hi> is Love, and his Ways of Providence expreſs much Goodneſs and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence to Mankind in general, and to his People in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; <hi>He makes his Sun to riſe upon the Evil and the Good, and ſendeth Rain on the Juſt and Unjuſt,</hi> Mat. 5.45. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.13.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the Law of Nature and Humanity. That Men by the Conſtitution of their Nature are framed for Society, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears beyond Controverſy, from their natural Propenſity to communicate their Notions and Ideas to one another, the Neceſſity they labour under of mutual Solace and Support, alſo from their common Wants and Fears. Now that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mutual Love and Beneficence are the <hi>Cement</hi> of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, the Bands and <hi>Sinews</hi> by which it is preſerved is as evident,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By the Example of Jeſus in that peerleſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Prodigy of his dying Affection to a loſt World, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Duty is excellent in it's Nature, 1 Cor. 13.1. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as ſounding Braſs, or a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cymbal;</hi> all my Pretences are vain.</p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:003967_0099_100377FA6800C4B8"/>
                     <p n="6">6. It's excellent in it's Effects and Rewards; this is the Way to invite Strangers to fall in Love with Chriſtianity. The ancient Chriſtians were very famous for this Practice, and ſaw the bleſſed Fruits of it. Alſo it's an Excitement to others to ſhew us the like Courteſy in our Neceſſity. It's pleaſing to God: when ſutably performed; for what is done to the leaſt of Chriſt's Members, he takes it as done to himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. It introduces Peace (that Hower of all the Bleſſings of Life) into our Breaſt here, and us into the Kingdom of Peace and endleſs Life hereafter; hence we are bid <hi>to make Friends of the Mammon of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that when we fail, they may receive us into everlaſting Habitations,</hi> Luke 16.9. <hi>Bleſſed are the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for they ſhall obtain Mercy,</hi> Mat. 5.7. and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>He that won't ſhew Pity to others in Diſtreſs, ſhall cry himſelf and not be $eard,</hi> Prov. 21.13. Mat. 18.23, $word$ 3$. But notwithſtanding what has been advanced, ſome will frame the $ollowing Excuſes.</p>
                     <p>Excuſe 1. What I have is my own, and I have it for my own Uſe, <hi>Shall I take my Bread and my Fleſh, and give it to I know not who?</hi> This is <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Plea, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.11. Hold Friend, you are miſtaken; though you have a civil Right to what you poſſeſs, yet the original and ſovereign Claim of Right belongs to God, whoſe Tennant and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard thou art, and to whom you muſt quickly be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Uſe thou haſt made of thoſe Talents the great Lord of the Univerſe intruſted thee with, whether thou haſt brought forth Fruits unto thy ſelf or him? <hi>Luke</hi> 16.2. Whether thou haſt uſed thy Eſtate to feed thy own and thy Childrens Pride and Luxury, or to refreſh the Bowels of the Poor and Needy? O Man! if thoſe Bottles of the Heavens, I mean the Clouds, had their Waters for themſelves, the Earth would ſoon be as Iron, and thou pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of Bread! but thou feeſt how they refreſh the parched Earth with their balmy Dews and refreſhing Show|$rs: Are the Heavens thus indulgent to the labouring Earth, and ſhall thy Bowels be as Braſs, void of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Relentings towards the Indigent, <hi>who are Bone of thy Bone,</hi> Gen. 29.14. What does the Sun get by travelling his ſteady Circuit round the Globe?</p>
                     <p>Excuſe 3. But I am Poor: What then? the leſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired indeed, but yet ſomething is neceſſary to be given to the diſtreſſed, in Propertion to what God has given thee; the poor Widow gave her two Mites, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.42.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:003967_0100_10035AFAC7D53FC0"/>
                     <p>Excuſe 3. I ſhould be deſpiſed if I did not give as much as others. Friend, Remember it's to God you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your ſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. The Judgment of one God and one Conſcience in our Favour is infinitely better than the Applauſe of the whole Earth, and will make the Mind firm and impregnable amidſt all the Storms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Ignominy; if you will not ſuffer with Chriſt, you ſhall not reign with him: No Croſs, no Crown.</p>
                     <p>Excuſe 4 My Children may want it, I muſt buy Lands for them; I have Taxes to pay, and a great many Things to do with the little I have. Friend, your feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked, inſtead of hindring your making neceſſary Proviſion for your Children, will ſecure their Support, by bringing the Bleſſing of Heaven upon your Labours, for what you give to the Poor you lend to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. which he will repay with Intereſt. But further, let me tell you in the Words of the wiſe Man, Eccl. 11.4. <hi>He that obſerveth the Wind ſhall not ſow, and he that regardeth the Clouds ſhall not reap.</hi> 
                        <q>If we ſtand <g ref="char:startq">“</g>magnifying every little Difficulty and ſeeming Danger, we ſhall never do the Work God requires of us; if the Husbandman ſhould decline ſowing for every flying Cloud, and reaping for the ſake of every blaſt of Wind, he would make but a poor Account of his Husbandry at the Years end. Now the Duty of Charity is as neceſſary as that of Sowing and Reaping, and attended with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater Advantages; and thoſe Diſcouragements from ſelfiſh Nature, which obſtruct the Performance of it, are like flying Clouds, or paſſing Blaſts, which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Mind will eaſily encounter and Surmount.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Excuſe 5. I am in Debt, how can I be charitable?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It's to be ſeared that many run themſelves into Debt by taking Money at Intereſt in order to purchaſe great Eſtates for their Children, they join Houſe to Houſe, and Farm to Farm, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.8. and like the Horſe Leach are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied; they with eager and impatient Haſte ſeek great Things, contrary to the Prophet's Advice to <hi>Barak, Jer.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Embaraſs</hi> themſelves in Difficulties at preſent to obtain that End; now while they are under theſe Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies which they have unneceſſarily involved themſelves in, they think they are free from the Obligations to chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Actions, as if one Sin would excuſe another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Perhaps thy Debts are inconſiderable compar'd with thy Eſtate: There be ſcare any Men of Buſineſs and Trade in the World, but what are in Debt, leſs or more,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:003967_0101_100377A75FF749E0"/>and perhaps continue ſo during Life; for as ſoon as one Debt is paid, another is contracted: So that at this rate you'l never find a time for Charity. This is a vile <hi>deceit,</hi> but God won't be <hi>mock'd:</hi> but if thou art really Poor and in Debt, and knoweſt not well how to pay it, <hi>do Juſtice, love Mercy,</hi> Mich. 6.8. Hoſ. 12.6. The bleſſed God won't have Robbery for a Burnt Offering; where there is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, God accepts according to what a Man hath, and not according to what he hath not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>David</hi> had it in his Heart to build the Temple, tho' he did not put his Deſign in Execution for want of Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, yet it was accepted as done, 1 <hi>Kin</hi> 8.18. But it muſt be in the mean time confeſs'd, that having the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary Supports of Life, we ſhould venture the Abridgement of the acceſſory and addtional Comforts of it, much more the extravagancies of pompous Apparel and delicious Meats and Drinks, by ſupplying the Wants of our indigent Brethren, by ſupporting humane Nature in diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Excuſe 6. But this Man, or that Woman is not an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Charity, a great many go about that are meet Cheats. Anſw. A greedy Mind will always have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe ready to protect the Purſe. But more particularly, I confeſs that wiſe Caution is neceſſary in the choice of the Object; and a ſpecial regard ſhould be ſhewn in our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Donations to Pious Perſons: We ſhould expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all, but eſpecially to thoſe that are of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of Faith, <hi>Gal</hi> 6.10. But you ſhould conſult more with the Divine Oracles in ſuch Caſes than with your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Hearts; otherwiſe you'l never do much Good in the World. What tho' you happen to miſs the right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject after neceſſary Examination, you'l not miſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if your deſign be Pious. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.42. There be a number of Profeſſors in this Age, that carry large <hi>Lamps,</hi> but there's little of the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> in them; in regard of the talking, praying parts of Religion, thay make a blazing appearance; they are very ready in theſe Duties, for they are cheap, and touch not the Pocket, but tell them there is this or that to be done for the poor Saints, or Church of God, and their Hearts ſink within them, like their great Grandfath: 1 <hi>Nabal's,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.5. their <hi>Zeal</hi> languiſhes like an expiring Candle in the Socket, they begin to grow ſorrowful, like the Young Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Mit</hi> 19.22. Then they hycocritically with they could do any thing, but—. Now with what Face can theſe Men talk of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:003967_0102_100377ADA2F7B4B8"/>Religion, or imagine they have any true Grace in their Hearts, if this be cuſtomary. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14, 15, 20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27. O thou Earth-Worm! thou diſcovereſt thy rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hypocriſie in this, for all thy pretended Devotion; thy Faith has not overcome the World, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. Hear and conſider, O Deceiver! what the Great God ſpeaks to thee in thoſe Scriptures, Jam 2.13. <hi>He ſhall have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy, that hath ſhewed no Mercy. Prov. 21.13. Matth. 45. ver. 41. to the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If ſome warm Blades give two Pence, or a Groat, or Six Pence to a poor Chriſtian, they think they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a good Conſcience: I believe they have indeed baniſh'd it, and given it a Bill of Divorce. If they were not ſtone-blind, could they imagine that that was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Charity which was not at all proportion'd, neither to the ability of the Giver, or the wants of the Receiver; may be fifty times as much would be counted little, if ſpent upon their own, or their Childrens Luſts or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities. I believe, ſince the Creation of the Earth, there never was a more mercileſs, ſelfiſh Age than this, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Scripture is verified, as I have before made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Another cauſe of the Security and falſe Hope of wicked People, is the Devil; <hi>the God of this World has blinded the eyes of thoſe that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhould ſhine unto them, and they ſhould be ſaved,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. The Devil has many artful and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Methods</hi> to compaſs the ruin of Mankind, and among others, this one of very fatal tendency, viz that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by all the ſly and ſubtle <hi>Meaſures</hi> of Inſinuation to ſtrengthen the groundleſs <hi>hopes</hi> of ſecure Souls: This method he us'd with our grand Parent, <hi>Eve,</hi> Gen. 3.4. and found it wofully ſucceſsful, even to the total <hi>overthrow</hi> of Man's <hi>innocency</hi> and <hi>happineſs:</hi> And the Serpent ſaid unto the Woman, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die:</hi> The ſame Path that crafty and malicious Enemy of Mankind <hi>travels</hi> with almoſt equal <hi>Succeſs</hi> as to Individuals, and leſs difficulty in his dealings with <hi>Adam's</hi> degenerate Poſterity. When God's faithful Servants tell wicked People, that if they continue impenitent, they muſt expect nothing but God's fierce Vengeance; Satan inſinuates a very contrary Leſſon: You ſhall not periſh; God is merciful: Chriſt has dy'd for Sinners; what, an't you Chriſtians? Believers? Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſons? Don't believe theſe preciſe Fellows. Now when the ſolemn <hi>incloſure</hi> of the <hi>penalty</hi> is remov'd
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:003967_0103_100377AF298BA2A8"/>from the <hi>Precept,</hi> Sin, which is tranſgreſſion of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes leſs formidable, and thereby Sinners are induc'd to make bold with it, to their Coſt, as Flies that ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their wanton Flights about a Candle, till they drop down dead.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Another cauſe of the deluſive hopes of many, is the bad Advice of wicked People: Some of whom are buſy, and ſucceſsful Factors for the Devil, in helping him to accompliſh his bloody Deſigns againſt themſelves&amp;others: Some like the perverſe Phariſees of old, will neither enter into the Kingdom of Heaven themſelves, nor ſuffer thoſe that are entering to enter; Matth. 23.13. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites.</hi> The Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> was very ſenſible of the bad influence of wicked Society, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he abandons them with the utmoſt Indignation; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye workers of Iniquity, for I will keep the Commandments of my God,</hi> Pſal. 119.115.</p>
                     <p>Some wicked Wretches will endeavur to jeer and laugh Men out of their Salvation, but there be none that have common Senſe would be thus fool'd out of an Eſtate. If ſome Imps of the Devil ſee any concern'd about their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they'l give them ſuch a Salutation as this; What are you beginning to be preciſe too? There's no need of ſo much pains and buſtle to get to Heaven. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. God is very merciful; I tho't you was a Man of more Judgment, than to be bewitched by ſuch People: Away with ſuch melancholy Whims, you'l be fit for Bedlam by and by if you go on at this rate; Drink a Glaſs of Wine, Brother, and ſerve God with a cheerful Heart: What do you think none will be ſav'd but a pack of ſuch canting preciſe Fellows? God help the World then indeed, what will become of the moſt of your honeſt Neighbours, and the greateſt part of the Earth at this Rate? What needs all this Sorrow, you have never wronged any Body, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Murder or Treaſon: You know there is no Body of Senſe that minds thoſe fantaſtical Enthuſiaſts Anſw. O Murderer! I may ſay to thee as the Apoſtle to <hi>Elimas,</hi> Acts 13.10. <hi>O full of all Subtilty, and all Miſchief, thou Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteouſneſs; wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right Ways of the Lord?</hi> Conſider, as thou wilt anſwer it to the great God, theſe few Queries in Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we to thy pernicious, though crafty Harangue.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If we ſhould not be preciſe, as thou ſcoffingly terms Chriſtian Circumſpection and ſtrict Holineſs; why are we commanded to walk circumſpectly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. Does not
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:003967_0104_100377B8040F8D00"/>the original Word <hi>Acriboos</hi> ſignify ſtrictly, or preciſely? <hi>Wherefore are we commanded to be holy as God is holy, perfect as he is perfect?</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If there be no need of ſo much Pains about Religion, why are we commanded to <hi>fight?</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. to <hi>run? Heb.</hi> 12.1. to <hi>wreſtle? Eph</hi> 6.12. to <hi>ſtrive? Luke</hi> 13.24. in order to obrain Happineſs? Do not theſe Metaphors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the utmoſt Intenſeneſs? Why are we inform'd that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers Violence, and the Violent take it by Force?</hi> Mat. 11.12. <hi>and that many ſhall ſeek to enter and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13.24.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is Conformity to the Will of a wiſe God the Way to Folly? Then white is black, and black is white: And is not this <hi>the Will of God, even our Sanctification?</hi> 1 Theſ.4.3. Is it Folly to ſecure the greateſt Good by the ſeaſonable and earneſt Uſe of appointed Means? Then God grant, I ever may be ſuch a Fool! I know you have a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of your Wiſdom! All ungodly Men have ſome of the Devil's Pride; and perhaps the Father don't much outdo ſome of his Children in this; but remember thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 3.19. <hi>For the Wiſdom of the World is Fooliſhneſs with God: For it is written, He taketh the wiſe in their own Crafrineſs</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. As to the Paucity of the ſaved, it has been before conſider'd; the holy Scriptures do evidently declare that the far greater Part of Mankind, nay of thoſe that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, ſhall be damned eternally; neither does this eclipſe the Mercy of God, as ſome carnal People ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine no, but on the contrary, the diſtinguiſhing Nature of God's Mercy magnifies it exceedingly in the Thoughts of the redeemed, as many thouſands have experienc'd. God might have paſs'd by the fallen Race of Man, as he did by the fallen Angels, and damned them to eternal Pains for the Rebellion of their pro parent and ſoederal Head, <hi>Adam,</hi> and made his righteous Severity triumph in their endleſs Woes; therefore it's wondrous Grace (which does indeed aſtoniſh all the Heavens!) that any of <hi>Adam's</hi> guilty Race ſhould be ſaved from Hell and Death!</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thy calling the Work of God's Spirit in changing and renewing the Heart, <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> is the Fruit either of thy Ignorance or Malice, or of both complexly, contrary to the tenor of the holy Scriptures, which expreſly aſſert ſuch a Change to be abſolutely neceſſary, as I have prov'd before, as well as contrary to the united Teſtimony of the proteſtant Churches; in this Speech thou belcheſt forth
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:003967_0105_10035AFE930ED860"/>thy ſerpentine <hi>Venom</hi> againſt the Apoſtles and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every Age, both before and after Chriſt's coming, for all of them experienc'd this Work of God which thou ignorantly or invidiouſly calleſt Enthuſiaſm; and the Reaſon why thou aſcribeſt to the Devil the Work of the Spirit of God, is becauſe it detects thy Hypocriſy, ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and pains thee with it's Warmth. But O Man! are you not afraid of blaſpheming the Holy Ghoſt after this Manner, leſt thy Sins never be forgiven thee either in this World, or that to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. What tho' this or that Perſon has never been guilty of Overt Fraud, Murder or Treaſon; ſuppoſing they had never been guilty of any groſs Immorality; what does not that <hi>Fountain</hi> of Iniquity, that <hi>Spawn</hi> of Sin, that <hi>Body</hi> of Death, that <hi>Seed Plot</hi> of Corruption which we are born with, afford ſufficient Cauſe for the deepeſt Sorrow? Yes it does; and if ever thy Underſtanding be inlightened, thou wilt feel this Truth, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.5. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24 &amp; 3.9. Are there not many who have not committed the Crimes mention'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, who are yet guilty of them in a ſpiritual Senſe?

Alſo are they not all guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rebellion againſt the King of Heaven by diſobeying his Laws? and don't thoſe Sins require great Sorrow?</p>
                     <p>As to the laſt Particular of the Charge; conſider theſe Places of Scripture, John 7.48, 49. <hi>Have any of the Rulers or of the Phariſees believed on him? but this People who know not the Law are curſed.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. <hi>Not many wiſe Men after the Fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath choſen the fooliſh to confound the wiſe, the weak to confound the mighty.</hi> Acts 28.22. <hi>But as concerning this Sect, we know that it is every where ſpok $ againſt.</hi> The People of God are called the Congregation of the Poor, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84.19.

Spiritual Prudence has for it's main Mark, the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the Intereſt of his Church; which the Perſon that is poſſeſs'd of this noble Quality, eyes and purſues in all his Tranſactions, whatever becomes of his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and worldly Intereſt. A ſincere Soul will venture that, and ſtand for <hi>Chriſt's Intereſt</hi> in all Weathers. <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid <hi>to become all Things to all M$n, to gain ſome;$</hi> I ſuppoſe his Compliance was not in any Thing really criminal, or with a covert View, to gain them to his own Intereſt, but to Chriſt's. I ſuppoſe every one that believes the Scriptures will own that this Apoſtle excelled in the Vertue of Prudence to a great degree of Eminence, and yet he could not keep the People ſtill and quiet where he preach'd: There was generally an Uproar and Tumult among the People, where he declared his Maſter's Truths. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45, 50.14.4, 5, 19 &amp; 16.20. &amp; 17.2, 5, 6. &amp; 18.6. &amp; 19.8, 9, 29. I ſuppoſe there is the ſame Rancour and Malice in natural Men's Hearts againſt God and his Truths now that there was then, only that it is under ſome Reſtraint in ſome by their Education, but Education does not change the Heart. Can it be imagined but that graceleſs Perſons, when the Word is cloſely, powerfully and ſucceſsfully ſpoken, will <hi>growl</hi> (many of them) and ſhew their Teeth, if they don't bite; for <hi>Chriſt did not come to ſend Peace on Earth, but a Sword, Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35, 36. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.51 <hi>to</hi> 54 But there be ſome ſo prudent in our Age, that they have found out a new <hi>Way</hi> to Heaven, a Way which <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trod; for they pretend to go there without bearing the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> but except they lay aſide this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſhifting off the ſweet and precious <hi>Croſs of Jeſus,</hi> tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about with every blaſt, they'l never come into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the bleſſed; <hi>For he that lives godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer Perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12.</p>
                     <p>The Prudence of many is nothing elſe, but that carnal ſelfiſh Craft which God diſdains, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19, 20. It's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I think to act ſo as to have the Apoſtle's Teſtimony. <hi>That in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not in fl$ſhly Wiſdom, we have had our Converſation in the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12.

Your Conceſſion that ſome Chriſtians are ſincere is extorted from your gall'd Conſciences by the ſhining Holineſs of their Lives, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. The latter flows freely from your ſtupid Ignorance, or ſerpentine Malice. 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural Man cannot underſtand the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. O conceited Hypocrite!

                        <hi>Jeremiah, O that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears,</hi> Jer. 9.1. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20.31, 19. <hi>Therefore watch. Remember that by the ſpace of three Years I ceaſed not to warn every one Day and Night with Tears.</hi> Yea and all true Penitents are bid <hi>to turn unto God with Faſting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning,</hi> Joel 2.12. We are informed that <hi>all Tears ſhall be wiped away,</hi> Rev. 7.17. <hi>For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living Fountains of Waters, and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</hi> But pray, how ſhall Tears be wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away from the dry Eyes of thoſe that have not wept?

                     <p>You'l ſay perhaps, what can't they be ſincere without Weeping in publick, I weep my ſelf ſometimes in private: O Phariſee! I believe that's but ſeldom, and that when you are under the gnawings of a guilty Conſcience, or ſome worldly Trouble; but pray Friend, are your Tears thus at your Beck, that you can open and ſhut thoſe Fountains when you pleaſe? Then indeed they are Crocodile Tears, little worth, and your ſelves very Hypocrites, for all your pretended Sincerity. Or</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They'l object thus, I don't like thoſe People that weep ſo in the Worſhip of God; it looks very childiſh and effeminate. Anſw. The Reflection is hardy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, for by this you would repreſent Chriſt, his Prophets and Apoſtles, as a mean ſpirited daſtardly Company, void of a generous Greatneſs of Mind. King <hi>David</hi> was a Man of a brave and gallant Spirit, as appears by his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and heroick Exploits recorded in ſacred Scripture; and yet how oft did he weep and mourn for Sin. Pſalm 42.3. <hi>His Tears were his Meat.</hi> But what is the Reaſon thou doſt not like thoſe that weep in divine Service? You'l
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:003967_0109_100377C76951B688"/>ſay perhaps, that it hinders their Elocution, or that it ſeems hypocritical; no, no, it does not hinder but help their Speech. As to the ſecond Particular, I have before conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it, only let me add one Word; Though I confeſs it is our Duty to conceal from others Obſervance as much as is poſſible our Brokenneſs, yet we muſt not quench the inward Motions of the Holy Spirit; when the bleſſed God is thawing our frozen Hearts by his Word and Spirit, ſhould we ſuppreſs his Work, oppoſe his Love Motions for Fear ſome carnal People ſhould call us Hypocrites, and ſo be guilty of real <hi>Murder</hi> and fighting againſt God to avoid the groundleſs Charge of <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and incur the awful Diſpleaſure of an holy and almighty God, to evite the Scoffs and Taunts of ſilly blind Worms?</p>
                     <p>But ſh$ll I venture to tell you the true Reaſon of your Diſguſt at ſuch Things, why it is this; thou art a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sinner thy ſelf, thy ſtony Heart was never removed, and a Heart of Fleſh given thee, according to that new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. Thou knoweſt a Stone is dry, inſenſible, impenetrable, but Fleſh is tender, ſoft and flexible, eaſily ſuſceptive of the leaſt Impreſſions. Now becauſe thou wanteſt the Heart of Fleſh thy ſelf, and ſeeſt others broken in the Service of God, it pains thee by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting thy Stupidity; this Pain you like not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the Effect, you reflect againſt the Cauſe. When a ſhort Diſcourſe upon Morality is preached with ſwelling Diction, and graceful Cadence (Jude Verſe 16. <hi>Their Mouth ſpeaketh great ſwelling Words, having Men's Perſons in Admiration becauſe of Advantage</hi>) without any Life or Energy: O then you'l ſay, that's a fine Sermon indeed, becauſe it has ſcorched thy guilty Conſcience no more than a painted Fire would thy Body! O hard heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocrite! If thou knew the ſoul-raviſhing Sweets which the Children of God enjoy in their Meltings of Heart by the Preſence of their Maſter and Father, thou would'ſt not ſnuffle and fret at their Contrition, <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.17. but bewail thy own Obſtinacy; they have more Comfort in their Tears, than thou haſt in all thy carnal Mirth and Jollity.</p>
                     <p>As to what you object about the Strictneſs of their Lives, conſider the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.4. <hi>Wherein they think it ſtrange that you run not with them to the ſame Exceſs of Riot, ſpeaking Evil of you.</hi> I ſuppoſe you find your ſelves ſo guilty of groſs Wickedneſs, that through the Greatneſs of your <hi>Charity</hi> and Vertue which
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003967_0110_100377CC2574E9B8"/>you boaſt of (though groundleſly) you are apt to think that theſe that do appear more reformed, do but appear to be ſo. Or</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some will charitably alledge to forward the foreſaid Deſign, that they are all Knaves in their Hearts; this Man will tell one Story, and the other another; I had ſome Dealings with ſuch a Man, one of the Saints, and he bit me; another tells an awful Story of the Fraud, or other Wickedneſs of one of the New-born; then they all laugh, ha! ha! ha! I thought ſo, I believe they are all alike if they were but diſcovered, a pack of Rogues; ho! is this your large Charity that would graſp in the Heathens in it's Boſom? Yes, yes, you'l extend your Charity to all the Sons of Belial, for like rejoyces in like: But remember the Word of God mentioned by the wiſe Man, Prov. 24.24. <hi>He that ſayeth to the Wicked thou art righteous, him ſhall the People curſe; Nations ſhall abhor him.</hi> None are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from your blind and graceleſs Charity; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects of true Charity, viz. pious People, them you don't like, eſpecially if they are very ſtrict, holy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you watch for their halting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. as the Cat does for poor Mouſe; you ſearch their Practice as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Stuff, and when you find any Thing that will bear a Reflection, then you rejoyce and ſpread it abroad among your Kindred, (2 Sam. 1.20. <hi>Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the Streets of Askelon, leſt the Daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph.</hi>) But what are the Reaſons of this Joy?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Malice; that old Enmity God put between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, <hi>Gen</hi> 3.15. A Man that bears Malice againſt another rejoyces in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>

                     <p>The 13th Particular, that ſtrengthens the falſe hopes of ſome wicked People, and confirms them in their wicked Courſes, is the wicked <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the greateſt Number where they dwell, and eſpecially of the <hi>Grandees;</hi> thoſe that are famous for their <hi>Wit, Learning,</hi> or <hi>Wealth.</hi> Many unthinking irreligious People are altogether for the Religion that is in <hi>faſhion,</hi> be it what it will; they ſquare their Conduct according to the Cuſtoms of the Places they live in; according to that Proverbial ſaying, <hi>Cum ſueris Rome, Romano vivito more.

Poor Wretches! they won't ſtand one brunt for Chriſt, his precious Croſs they fly from as a Scare crow, and therefore can't be his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.27.

                     </p>
                     <p>But I proceed to conſider the <hi>fourth</hi> General propoſed, which was to ſhew <hi>the Folly, Miſery and curſed State of ſuch deceived Perſons.</hi> And</p>
                     <p n="1">1. More generally: Are not thoſe who truſt in their own Hearts, Fools? Yes ſurely. Prov. 28.26. <hi>He that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003967_0119_100377E754E21D78"/>truſteth in his own Heart is a Fool,</hi> yea a curſed Fool, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7. Now do not all preſumpruous Perſons truſt in their own Hearts? Prov. 12.15. <hi>The Way of a Fool is right in his own Eyes; but he that hearkneth to Counſel is wiſe.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.2. Preſumptuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have nothing elſe to truſt to but their deceived Hearts; for both Scripture and Reaſon oppoſeth their groundleſs Confidence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is it not a Folly to believe Lies, and expect Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them? This is the very Caſe of preſumptuous Souls, Iſai. 28.15. <hi>For we have made Lies our Refuge, and under Falſhood have hid our ſelves.</hi> Pray read and conſider what God ſaith in the 17. Verſe, <hi>Judgment alſo will I lay to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plumet, and the Hail ſhall ſweep away the Refuge of Lies, and the Waters ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the hiding Place.</hi> The Prophet informs them that this tottering Fabrick would fall and bury the Builder in it's Ruins, the Waters ſhould overflow it; every other Refuge but Chriſt ſhall be overwhelm $word$; as every thing elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Ark was in the Flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> even the higheſt Mountains were covered, the Ark reſted on lofty <hi>Ararat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſtrange to conſider what a prodigious pitch of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Preſumption Sinners may arrive at. Iſai. 28.15. <hi>We have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell are we at Agreement, when the overflowing Scourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come unto us.</hi> See they are as ſecure and unconcerned about the Approaches of Death, as tho' they had made an Agreement with it upon a valuable Conſideration, that it ſhould not come till they ſent for it, and as little afraid are they of Hell: What is the Reaſon of this? Why, they made <hi>Lies</hi> their <hi>Refuge,</hi> they truſted to and depended upon theſe falſe and ſandy <hi>Props,</hi> which the faithful Servants of God told them would deceive them, but which they themſelves and their ſoothing falſe Prophets looked upon as $$$tantial <hi>Fences:</hi> But what was the Iſſue of this vain Confidence and fooliſh Dependance, I have before conſiderd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is it not a Folly to pretend to feed upon Aſhes? This preſumptuous Sinners do, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.20. They put a grand Cheat upon themſelves by pretending to feed their precious Souls with their deluſive Hopes, which can no more nouriſh or ſupport them than Aſhes the Body; and yet they will fully perſiſt in this Self-deceit, and will not be undeceived, or ſay, Is there not a Lie in my right hand? They will not be perſwaded, many of them, ſo much as to
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003967_0120_100377ED57035B80"/>ſuſpect the Goodneſs of their preſent Condition, by the moſt rational and paſſionate Addreſſes of God's Servants! but hold faſt their Deluſions in their right hand, with a ſtrong and eager <hi>Gripe,</hi> as their chief <hi>Good!</hi> and he that would aſſume the Boldneſs for their Benefit, to ſtrike them on the Fingers to make them quit their <hi>Hold,</hi> would perhaps get their Fiſt in his <hi>Face</hi> as the Reward of his Labours, which they would call Impertinency, Pride, or ſome other Nick-name; but ſurely Self ſuſpicion is the firſt Step to Converſion: Is there not a Lie in my right hand?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is it not a Folly to entertain that with Complacency, which inſtead of doing us any real Service, will do us the greateſt Injury poſſible; if your falſe Hopes would ſave you, I would neither trouble you nor my ſelf in telling you the Danger of them; but inſtead of this, they will ſix you more in the Snare of the Devil, heighten your Sin, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and aggravate your Damnation, while you ſay, Peace, Peace, ſudden Deſtruction ſhall come upon you, as travail upon a Woman with Child, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. Your falſe Hopes indeed may put you out of <hi>Fear,</hi> but they increaſe your <hi>Danger,</hi> by making you unapprehenſive of it, unconcern'd about it, and ſo negligent of the earneſt Uſe of thoſe Means which are neceſſary to obtain an Eſcape. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1. They keep you from a ſound and deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of your loſt Eſtate, which is abſolutely neceſſary to a ſaving Converſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>The whole need no Phyſician</hi> (in their own Imagination) <hi>but the Sick, Matth.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.31. <hi>The Lord Jeſus came not to call the Righteous</hi> (ſelf-righteous Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, whole hearted People) <hi>but Sinners,</hi> Sin ſick, broken hearted Penitents, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 5.17. I know it is hard for you, poor Souls, to quit your ſweet <hi>Deluſions</hi> and to come under the <hi>Blows</hi> of God's <hi>Hammer, Jer.</hi> 23.29. Job 11.20. <hi>But the Eyes of the wicked ſhall fail, and they ſhall not eſcape, and their Hope ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> When a Godleſs Sinner is dying, it is with great Reluctance and Regret, he quits his Life; his Soul is torn away from him againſt his Will; indeed it is ſo only with ſuch as are awakned, as for others, they die like Lambs, tho' they are damn'd as Wolves, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.14. They go off quietly to their own Place, and never awake till they get beyond all Hope among the damned Spirits. But tho' it be hard, yet it's abſolutely neceſſlary, as I prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; What Folly is it to truſt to that which will
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:003967_0121_100377EEDAFF9F00"/>fail us in Eternity. Job 8.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>So are the Paths of all that forget God, and the Hypocrites Hope ſhall periſh, whoſe Hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe Hope ſhall be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Web: Can the Ruſh grow without Mire? Can the Flag grow without Water?</hi> In theſe Verſes <hi>Bildad</hi> compares the Hope of Hypocrites to a <hi>Ruſh</hi> and a <hi>Spider's Web:</hi> Now to illuſtrate the Folly and Unprofitableneſs of entertaining preſumptuous Hopes, I ſhall a little inquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of theſe Similitudes. And</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Ruſh$ reſembles a Hypocrite's Hopes in theſe three Things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. As the Ruſh grows up out of the <hi>Mire</hi> and Water, ſo the preſumptuous Sinner's Hopes ſprings from unworthy Conceptions of God, falſe Apprehenſions of himſelf, and other baſe Originals before mention'd, and is generally attended with an earthly or unclean Practice.</item>

<list>
                           <item>1. In reſpect of its <hi>Original:</hi> As the Spider weaves her Web out of her own <hi>Bowels;</hi> ſo the Hypocrite builds his Hope upon thoſe <hi>frames</hi> of Heart which are but Sparks of his own kindling, thoſe Performances, which are the <hi>fruits</hi> of his own <hi>power,</hi> thoſe Conceptions of the Almighty which are the <hi>birth</hi> of his corrupt <hi>fancy.</hi> Thus you ſee he <hi>weaves</hi> his <hi>hope</hi> out of his <hi>own Bowels;</hi> it's a Creature of his own coining and framing: Whereas the true Chriſtian, as Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> obſerves, "is like the laborious Bee, he fetcheth in all his Comforts from the heavenly dew of God's Word.</item>
                           <item>2. In reſpect of the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> he takes in it: The Spider is pleas'd with it's Web, flies to it as a Houſe of Defence, as well as ſports in it as a place of Pleaſure; and do not preſumptuous Sinners flatter and pleaſe themſelves with
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:003967_0122_10035B18816B1D08"/>the hopes of Heaven, and fly to their falſe Confidence, as a ſecure refuge?</item>
                           <item>3. In reſpect of the <hi>uſe</hi> he makes of it: Doth not the craſty Spider make uſe of it's Web as an enſnaring Engine to catch any ſuitable Prey which comes within it's reach? and thus do not preſumptuous Hypocrites cheat and impoſ$ upon many with their ſpecious pretences?</item>
                           <item>4. In reſpect of it's <hi>weakneſs:</hi> The Spider's Web tho' it's artfully woven, and conſiſts of a great many Threads, it is extreamly weak; ſo is the Preſumer's hope, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the conceit he has of it, it is as inſufficient to bear the winnowing of Chriſt's <hi>Fan,</hi> as the Spider's Web is to bear the Strokes of a <hi>Broom;</hi> their hopes ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fail and periſh, and they with them, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the moſt comfort from them.</item>

<list>
                           <item>1. It's <hi>Mockery: Be not deceiv'd, God is not mocked, for what a man ſows, that ſhall be alſo reap,</hi> Gal. 6.7. What <hi>madneſs</hi> and impudent effontry is it to <hi>mock</hi> ſuch an <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God,</hi> who can in a moment ſpeak you dead or damned, who can immediately blow you with the breath of his Indignation as light Chaff to Hell, and burn you with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Flames. Job 4.9. <hi>By the blaſt of God they periſh, and by the breath of his noſtrils are they conſumed.</hi>

By denying God's <hi>veracity;</hi> tho' the <hi>Almighty</hi> has told them that ſuch who commit the Wickedneſs they are guilty of (ſo continuing) ſhall periſh everlaſtingly. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhall be ſaved, tho' God has expreſly reveal'd that without the <hi>New Birth</hi> there is no <hi>Salvation;</hi> that no duty or priviledge, opinion or practice will avail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. Yet they expect Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tho' they are Strangers to this Work, and indeed ſeek not earneſtly after it; what is this but confronting the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty! Flying in the Face of God, challenging him to do his Worſt, by calling him, implicitly, a <hi>Liar!</hi> Won't God's revenging Severity burn againſt thoſe bold Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, his Jealouſy ſmoak againſ them, and all the Curſes of his Book be upon them, and their Name be blotted out from under Heaven? If God <hi>will not hold them $uiltleſs that take his Name in vain,</hi> Exod. 20.7. <hi>And that be will by no means clear the Guilty,</hi> Exod. 34.7. What will the holy God do to thoſe that wound, rend and tear
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:003967_0123_100377F8E39275E8"/>his Being, by denying one of his glorious Attributes! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member O Sinner, <hi>Is is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God!</hi> Thou hadſt better be under the <hi>united Rage</hi> of all the <hi>Devils</hi> in Hell, and <hi>Men</hi> on Earth, than ſeel the <hi>Iron Gripes</hi> of one <hi>GOD,</hi> for their Power and Anger is finite, but God's is infinite and eternal! Heb. 10.30, 31. But may be you'l ſay, I don't deny God's Truth, or expect to be ſaved without Converſion. Anſwer, Perhaps thy Falſhood and Fraud would appear, if I ſhould but ask thee two Queſtions; as firſt, Whether your Peace be made with God? May be after much Reaſoning, you would confeſs the Truth, that it was not. And yet if I ſhould ask you another Queſtion; Do you think that you ſhould be ſaved if God carried you off by Death in this State? Yes you would ſay, you hope ſo, through God's Mercy. O Hypocrite! thou haſt belched forth Blaſphemy and Idolatry in this one Sentence: You hope that through the Mercy of God, he will prove a Liar, and falſify his Truſt; this is the Meaning of thy Speech, O Sinner! it's big with Horror and inſandous Baſeneſs! Art thou not afraid that God will ſtab thee dead immediately with the Spear of his Vengeance! Or cauſe the Earth to open it's Mouth and ſwallow thee up quick, as it did proud rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>Corah</hi> and Company, <hi>Numb</hi> 16.32. Again, there is Idolatry in thy Speech; thou haſt unjuſt Apprehenſions of God's Mercy, as if he would make it triumph in the Ruin of his Truth. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.21.</item>
                           <item>3. <hi>Devil Worſhip.</hi> I ſuppoſe that when you ſpeak of the Pagans worſhiping the Devil, you little think your ſelvas are guilty of the ſame horrible Wickedneſs. The Truth of this Charge appears by the following Conſideration, viz. That Faith, as all confeſs is an Act of Worſhip, but you believe the Devil the Father of Lies and Deceit, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the faithful God who is Truth it ſelf. When God tells you in his Word, which ſhall ſtand, when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth ſhall ſhake, that if you continue in this State and Courſe, you ſhall be damned. And the Devil tells you, you ſhall not; now you believe Satan the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of your Souls, and diſcredit the God that made you by his Power, fed and preſerved you by his kind Providence. Thus you worſhip the Devil, O miſerable Souls! how great is your Sin and Folly? And how compleat and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible will be your Miſery, when you ſhall be ſent to enjoy the gloomy gods you adore? <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41.</item>

                           <item>4. <hi>Hypocriſy;</hi> by profeſſing Chriſt in <hi>Word,</hi> and in <hi>Works</hi> deny him; you bow the Knee in <hi>Pretence</hi> as the Jews did of old, and then crucify him in <hi>Practice;</hi> you ſalute him with a hail Maſter, as <hi>Judas</hi> your Predeceſſor in Impiety, and then betray his Intereſt; you come to God with your Lips; while your Hearts are far from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.8. &amp; 27.29. &amp; 26.49. I know the prophane Herd of Mankind imagine themſelves to be far from Hypocriſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay, they ſhew what they are; they do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed demonſtrate themſelves to be the genuine Children of their Father the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. But at the ſame Time they declare their Wickedneſs as <hi>Sodom</hi> without <hi>Shame</hi> or <hi>Bluſhing,</hi> Iſai. 3.9. <hi>The ſhew of their Countenance doth witneſs againſt them; and they declare their Sin as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they bide it not: Wo unto their Souls.</hi> Jer. 6.15. <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed Abomination? nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh: therefore they ſhall fall among thoſe that ſall, at the Time that I viſit them, they ſhall be caſt down, ſaith the Lord. Jer.</hi> 8.12, 13. I ſay at the ſame Time, they declare their Wickedneſs, they <hi>profeſs</hi> Chriſtianity, and <hi>expect</hi> Salvation by it, and yet while they are Chriſtians in Pretence and Profeſſion, they are incarnate Devils in Practice: Now is not this notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hypocriſy, to profeſs one Thing and do another, to look one Way and row another, to pretend Friendſhip to Chriſt and at the ſame Time ſtab his Intereſt, diſhonour his Name, and diſcredit his Truth by your impious Speeches, and b$$tiſh Lives. And beſides what has been offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head, it ought to be conſider'd, that all who want ſpiritual Sincerity muſt needs be Hypocrites: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs indeed that prophane Sinners are not of the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Kind. However though theſe ſeem to be at Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet they are Children of the ſame Father and Family, and like to inherit the ſame Portion. Hear your Doom from God ye Hypocrites! Matth. 24. laſt. <hi>And ſhall cut him aſunder, and ſhall appoint him his Portion with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Hear you deceitful rotten hearted Profeſſors, who deſpiſe weeping here for Sin, remember (that ſo continuing) ye ſhall weep in Hell, where there is no Hope: Here peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Tears for Sin attended with a Reformation from it, probably would be a mean of obtaining Pardon, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 14. But there, poor Souls, your Tears will be like <hi>Eſau</hi>'s ſhed in vain! there you will <hi>gnaſh your Teeth,</hi> i. e when you are ſhut up in the Gulph of everlaſting Miſery, then
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:003967_0125_100377FD00825730"/>you will be filled with Self-revenge and Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your own Madneſs in hypocritically ſlighting ſuch a Happineſs as was tendred to you by the Son of God, that you would even tear your ſelves in pieces if you could. Can you without ſhivering think upon that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scripture? Matth 22.12, 13. <hi>Then ſaid the King to his Servants, bind him Hand and Foot, and take him away, and caſt him into utter Darkneſs.</hi>
                           </item>

                                 <item>1. You murder your own Souls, thro' the Miſapplication of the Portions of God's Word, as particularly by applying the Promiſes when you ſhould apply the Threatnings. You ſnatch at the Children's Bread, when you have no right to it. Now as a R$medy miſapplied hurts rather than heals, ſo it is in this Caſe, you turn thoſe Means of Grace which were deſigned for the Salvation of Men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Savour of Death unto Death, and to be a Means of your Damnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. Thus you imbrue your Hands in your own Blood; God will by no Means clear ſuch barbarous Butchers, ſo continuing. But</item>
                                 <item>2 They alſo murder others, partly perhaps, by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeaſonable Inſtruction of ſuch as they are under a Relation to, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6.

O if theſe Men had any true Love to God, their own Souls, or the Souls of their Relatives, would they not either lay down their <hi>Lamps</hi> or reform their <hi>Lives.</hi>

                           <item>7. <hi>Fraud.</hi> O preſumptuous Sinners! you are guilty of Self deceit, of Soul deceit: To cheat another in any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Matter is a villanous and very criminal Evil, juſtly expoſing the nocent Perſon to <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Laſh</hi> of the civil <hi>Law;</hi> it is a Sin which is the Diſhonour of Humanity, extremely prejudicial to all the Intereſts of Society; yet as bad as it is, it is not ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and unnatural as to cheat our ſelves, and that in a Matter of infinitely greater Moment: Our Neighbour's Loſs is temporary and reparable, but this is irreparable and eternal. As Suicide, or Self murder is juſtly accounted more unnatuaal and monſtrous than the Murder of another, ſo is this Self deceit, which tho' it affords ſome preſent falſe Eaſe, yet perſiſted in, introduces the Soul into a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth</hi> of endleſs <hi>Anguiſh, Luke</hi> 6.25. Remember, O De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver! that God's Curſe is upon you, Mal. 1.14. <hi>Curſed be the Deceiver.</hi>

                           <item>8. A <hi>Confederacy</hi> with the Devil. Thoſe Spirits having broken the Law of their Creation, are now juſtly deprived of the Happineſs they were once inſtated in, and reſerved in Chains of Darkneſs for the Judgment of the great Day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. Knowing their Doom to be irrevocable, and that ſome of the lapſed and degenerate Race of <hi>Adam</hi> are advanced to that heighth of Happineſs they had forfeited by Sin: They are fill'd with Rage and Malice againſt God, which not being able to execute upon him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, they therefore labour to diſpleaſe him mediately by ſeducing that darling Creature, whom he hath been pleaſed to honour, with ſuch diſtinguiſhed, as well as undeſerved Love. This is the grand Deſign theſe malicious Spirits are in purſuit of and imploy all their Power and Policy about, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. Now when Men embrace their falſe, though ſubtle Inſinuations againſt their own Souls, believing their Suggeſtions concerning the Goodneſs of their preſent State, or the Certainty of their future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs againſt the plain Teſtimony of the holy Scriptures, as the preſumptuous Sinner doth: Is not this a notorious Confederacy with theſe infernal Ghoſts againſt God, and his own Soul.</item>

Inſtead of aſcending the flowry Hills of Paradice, to be ſunk into the Depths of Hell; and would not the ſame Diſappointment ſtrike you with the ſame <hi>Surprize?</hi> For God's ſake, conſider, that the <hi>Strength</hi> of your Hopes does not prove their Truth or Goodneſs: This you may learn from the ſad Inſtance of the fooliſh Virgins; but alas! how difficult is it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade deceived Souls, to quit their falſe Confidence; when they are with <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſettled on their Lees, like Wine which has done working, in which there is little or no Motion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.11. One may as well pull a <hi>Bear</hi> by the <hi>Tooth</hi> as meddle with ſome of them. It is as eaſy without ſovereign Grace intercept, to ſhock the Earth of it's Foundations, as to overthrow their vain Confidence. They have often heard Threatnings, and therefore are uſed to them, and hardned by them. All the <hi>Thunders</hi> from <hi>Sinai,</hi> and <hi>Curſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> are no more to them than the <hi>Cracks</hi> of Children's <hi>Squibs</hi> or Potguns; no, no: they have heard of theſe Things long ago; now the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of hearing the moſt awful Truths, leſſens their Terror; Cuſtom deadens and ſtupifies the Paſſions, or makes their Motion more faint and languid; <q>like Mariners at <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Sea, they are much afraid of Storms at firſt, but afterwards <g ref="char:endq">”</g>they grow more hardned and unconcerned,</q> as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. Goſpel Sinners will in proceſs of Time grow hardy and fearleſs, under the moſt awakening Sermons; like the Smith's Dog, that will lie and take his Reſt near the Anvil, when the glowing Sparks are flying about like Hail: What ſhould ſuch Men as they begin their Religion now, no they ſcorn it; it's proper only for weak, ſilly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plethat know no better to be frighted by Terror, but it is beneath men of their Senſe to be ſtartled at ſuch Trifles, as God's fierce Vengeance and an everlaſting Hell; ah! but for all your Haughtineſs, if but one Curſe, or the Guilt of one Sin was brought home in it's native Weight and Terror to your Conſcience, it would make you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like a Leaf ſhaken with the Wind.

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003967_0128_1003780C12B7A040"/>none beſides the Almighty can perſwade preſumptuous Sinners to forſake their pleaſant, though pernicious Dreams and Deluſions.

Theſe for Order's ſake may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed into two Kinds, viz. <hi>Privative</hi> and <hi>Poſitive;</hi> His privative Miſeries are principally theſe two, viz. <hi>Loſs</hi> of the Image of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the firſt of theſe, Every preſumptuous Sinner is deprived of the Image of God, which is the greateſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the higheſt Excellency and Ornament of the humane Nature; becauſe the neareſt Reſemblance of the Divine. Thoſe moral Excellencies that once the humane Soul poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, it's now bereaved of, until it be ſanctify'd by the Holy Spirit, and made nigh by the Blood of Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. But to underſtand more fully the Extent of this Loſs, let me propoſe a few Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of that Image, innocent Man was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with: What was it but the Conformity of Man to God, or the Reſemblance he bare in his <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellencies and Perfections?

This may be called the <hi>natural Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Man, which can't be loſt while the Soul endures; but there is little Reaſon to glory in that, becauſe the Devils poſſeſs it as well as wicked Men.</item>
                        <item>2. In the Faculties of the Soul, in the Conformity of all i'ts Powers and Paſſions to the Nature and Will of God, in thoſe divine Gifts and Excellencies with which the Soul was cloathed, ſuch as <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> or a perfect Knowlege of Things divine and humane, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. which appeared in <hi>Adam</hi>'s giving Names to all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuited to their different Natures; without this he would have been unfit to manage and ſuſtain the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the inferiour Creatures which he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to.

The Power of <hi>Government</hi> over the inferiour Creatures, wherewith our firſt Parents were inveſted by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. which may be called the <hi>civil</hi> or political <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> as being a Repreſentation and <hi>Shadow</hi> of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sovereignty; Adam</hi> was as it were <hi>God's Vice Roy</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; but this Privilege as well as the moral Image is loſt by Sin; the Beaſts revolt from their wonted Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and want to avenge their Maker's quarrel with Mankind. To conclude this Head, let me mention a few Expreſſions of the learned and elequent Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> in his Harmony: <q>He enjoyed, ſaith he, (ſpeaking of <hi>Adam</hi> in <g ref="char:startq">“</g>his innocent State) Nature in it's original Purity, crown'd with the Benediction of God before it was blaſted with the Curſe, the World was all Harmony and Beauty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Goodneſs of the Creator; the Earth was liberal to <hi>Adam</hi> of all it's Treaſures; the Heavens of their Light and ſweeteſt Influences; he was ſeated in <hi>Eden,</hi> a Place of ſo great Beauty and Delight, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the celeſtial Paradiſe, which is refreſh'd with Rivers of Pleaſure. But his ſupreme Happineſs conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Exerciſe of his moſt noble Faculties on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Objects.</q> See what we have loſt by Sin! If we could with <hi>Niobe</hi> weep inceſſantly; nay, could we ſhed chryſtal Seas of Grief; if all our moiſture were ſpent in the bittereſt Lamentations; Were our Heads Waters and our Eyes Fountains of Tears; nay, were our Tears turn'd into Blood; it were too little to bewail our <hi>fatal, fatal Leſs!</hi> Wo is us, the <hi>Crown,</hi> the ſparkling Diadem is fallen is fallen from our Heads; our Hearts, and we are juſtly left bereaved of our primitive Innocency, Happineſs and Beauty; and were it not that the <hi>God</hi> of Pardons and

While you want God's Image, are not you deprived of your greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, your higheſt Excellency, and ſweeteſt Enjoyment? What greater Honour than to be like the pure and holy God, and what greater Happineſs than by this Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to enjoy the refreſhing Smiles of his reconciled Face? Is it not a ſinful Want, becauſe occaſioned through our own Default? <hi>Adam</hi> being the Repreſentative and federal Head of his whole Poſterity; the Covenant being not only made with him perſonally, but with us in him; his Actions being of a publick Nature and Concern, we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him, and fell with him in his firſt Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom</hi> 5.12, 18, 19.</item>

                     <p>O Sinner! all the other Wants thou complaineſt ſo much about are inconſiderable and trifling, when compar'd with this! they are but temporary and momentous, but the Conſequences of this are durable and eternal: Many of theſe are but imaginary, or not ſo neceſſary, but that you may live, and perhaps comfortably without having them ſupply'd: But this Want is not only real, but of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity to be remedy'd; otherwiſe your Perſons and Services will never be accepted, <hi>Heb</hi> 12.14. <hi>Iſai</hi> 1. You are apt to be deeply ſenſible of, and much affected with other Wants, &amp; perhaps make great Complaints about ſmall Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but alas!

Remember that <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. The <hi>Guilt</hi> contracted by one vain Thought, is infinite, becauſe the Sin is committed againſt an infinite <hi>God,</hi> and therefore cannot be remov'd but by an infinite <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> — Shouldſt thou Pray, were it poſſible, a Million of Years, Weep an Ocean of Tears, and wear thy ſelf to a Skeleton by Faſting, and other mortifying Duties, it would not compenſate the wrong offer'd to God by that vain Thought, for Juſtice requires an exact proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Guilt contracted and Satisfaction paid; Ten Thouſand Rivers of Oyl will not do, nor the firſt Fruits of thy Body for the Sin of thy Soul, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.7. If it be ſo, then what ſhall become of thee, who has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many Abominations!

As God's Mercies are freſh and new every morning to his People, ſo his Anger is renewed and impregnated every morning againſt the Wicked, becauſe of their repeated Provocations; God hates and loaths them in their greateſt <hi>Bloom</hi> of Honours and proſperous Succeſſes, when they are <hi>careſs'd</hi> by a mercenary, flattering and ſycophantick <hi>Crew,</hi> that have a Dependance on them, and make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of them; and to that End pay their cringing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, not ſo much to their Perſons, as to their Bags or Bills; I ſay God loaths them even in the Time of their greateſt Gaiety, Advancement and ſuperficial Devotion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8.

                     <p n="1">1. God's Wrath is terrible becauſe of his <hi>Highneſs</hi> and <hi>tremendous Majeſty.</hi> Job. 13.11. <hi>Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</hi> And Job 31.23. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a terror to me, and by reaſon of his highneſs I could not endure.</hi> Is not Men's anger fear'd according to their Degree and Character?

Men's Wrath is trivial and of ſhort Duration, it muſt needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with their fleeting Breath, though they may poſſibly wiſh an immortal Revenge, yet their tranſitory fading Life will not admit ſuch a malicious Proſecution; but the Wrath of God is permanent and eternal. Jer. 10.10. <hi>But the Lord he is the true God, he is the living God, an$ an everlaſting King, at his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation.</hi> So terrible will be the Majeſty of God to Man, at the general Judgment, that all Nature will faint before him, Rev 20.11. <hi>And I ſaw a great white Throne, and him that ſat on it, from whoſe Face the Earth and Heaven fled away.</hi> And,</p>

A very ample confirmation thereof, the Pſalmiſt gives in the 29th Pſalm; in it we have a very beautiful and poetical deſcription of God's Power, ver. 4. <hi>The Voice of the Lord is powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, it breaks the Cedars, and makes Lebanon and Sirion skip like a young Unicorn; divides the flames of fire, and ſhakes the wilderneſs of Kad$ſh.</hi> Thunderbolts and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes cauſe very terrible Convulſions in the frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tares Trees; levels their proud and lofty Tops, and $oſſes the Earth of it's Axis, makes it reel and ſtagger like a drunken Man, ſo that Men's fix'd Eſtates enter into the Lift of their Moveables.

As if thou did not bear one ſingle grain weight; no, no, Sinner: as ſure, as God lives, thou art D$ad: If thine Eyes which are ſhut with blindneſs and ſeal'd with Death, were but open'd, thou wouldſt ſoon feel the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in thy Heart, and c$y out wit$ the moſt dolorous and heavy <hi>Groans.

Rev. 14.10, 11. <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his Indignation, and be ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: and the ſmoke of their Torments aſcendeth up forever and ever: and they have no reſt day nor night.</hi> All the Afflictions of this Life are allay'd and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with ſome Mercies, and deſirable Enjoyments; but in Hell, which is the proper center of Miſery, there will be Miſery without any mixture of pity or Mercy: All the groans of the Damned cannot incline the Compaſſions of a juſtly offended and inexorable God <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37.11. Then farewell Hope and Happineſs, and all Good for ever! Another additional ingredient or circumſtance of
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:003967_0176_100378B5D49BE8D0"/>the Damned's Torments, will be the Place where they are inflicted, a Place where the thickeſt darkeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeſt Heat for ever reign, a Place where not the leaſt <hi>dawn</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> is allowed thoſe forlorn Wretches, unleſs what ſerves to diſcover the Inſtruments of their Pain, a Place where damned Men and Devils are blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one promiſcuous Throng, and the former perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually expoſed to the cruel Tyranny of the latter; <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring Fire?

The Curſe will be irrevocable and eternal, except they repent: Go on a little longer in your vicious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in ſlighting God's Love, breaking his Law, and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Motions of his bleſſed Spirit, and your Caſe will be paſt Remedy; for God's Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Men, <hi>Gen</hi> 6.3. Hence we are bid to <hi>call upon him while he is near, to ſeck him while he may be found,</hi> Iſai. 55.6. which intimates plainly that if he be not ſought while he is near, while he ſtrives with us by his Spirit, he may be ſought afterwards but in vain; though his Mercy wait long, yet it will not wait always, his abuſed Patience will have a Period, and perhaps quickly with thee.</p>
                     <p>O preſumptuous Sinner! if thou perfiſteſt any longer in thy Impiety, thou may'ſt expect that Chriſt will give thee that final Curſe, which he gave the Fig-free, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.13, 14, 20, 21. Let never Fruit grow on thee more. And ſay to thee as to <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, <hi>Ephraim is joined to Idols, let him alone,</hi> Hoſ. 4.17. And to thoſe mentioned, Rev. 22.11. <hi>Let him that is filthy be filthy ſtill. Becauſe I have purged them, and they were not purged, therefore I will not purge them any more, till I cauſe my Fury to reſt on them,</hi> Ezek. 24.13. If this happens to be thy Caſe, then wo to thee that ever thou waſt born! Pray conſider that the Time of God's gracious Viſitation (wherein he offers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) does not always laſt ſo long as a Man's Life, nay that it frequently thro' their Obſtinacy expires before it. The longeſt Period of Patience that we find afforded to any, was that which the old World was made the Subject of, which contained the Space of one hundred and twenty Years, <hi>Gen</hi> 6.3$ 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. Yet this was not the ſixth Part of the Time they uſually liv'd before the Flood; ten or twelve Years are longer to us, than one hundred and twenty was to them, compating the different Ages Men ordinarily liv'd to then, and now. Now if the Curſe
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:003967_0177_100378B975B7B968"/>may be rendred through Men's Obſtinacy irrevocable in this World, it will ſurely be eternal in the next; this the holy Scriptures are very full and expreſs in aſſerting. See <hi>Iſai</hi> 33.14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 18.8. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43, 44. <hi>Jude</hi> 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.11. If it be objected, that the Words Eternity, or, ever and ever, only ſignifies a limited Space of Time: It is true, they do ſo in ſome Places of Scripture; but it is as true that in many other Places they ſignify an endleſs: Duration, as where Eternity is aſcribed to God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.10. <hi>and</hi> 146.10. and eternal Happineſs to pious Perſons. It would be as ridiculous as blaſphemous, to ſay, that God ſhall live but for a few Ages, and is abſurd to imagine that the Godly ſhould be happy but for the ſame Space. Now in the narrow Compaſs of one Verſe, we find the ſame Eternity aſcribed to the Torments of the Damned, as to the Happineſs of the ſaved; <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment, but the righteous into Life eternal,</hi> Matth 25.46. which not only the <hi>Identity</hi> of Expreſſion, but the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or Law of contraries obliges us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is of the ſame Extent: If we may limit the Duration of the one, we may with equal Reaſon the other. But it is objected, that it's contrary to the Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to inflict an infinite Puniſhment for a finite Offence: In anſwer to this, let the following Particulars be conſider'd.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That though Sin be finite ſubjectively in reſpect of the Perſon, by which, and the Time in which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet it is infinite in regard of it's Object, for it is committed againſt an infinite God, an Affront to infinite <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> a Diſparagement of infinite <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and an Abuſe of infinite <hi>Love,</hi> and therefore deſerves in Juſtice an infinite Puniſhment. In ſhort, Sin is a moſt pregnant and complicated Evil, containing in it a direct Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and vile Reflection upon all the Perfections of the Deity, an unnatural Revolt from his Government, which we are bound to obey by the ſtrongeſt Ties of Reaſon and Gratitude, becauſe of his creating, preſerving, providing and redeeming Love, and that upon the meaneſt Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſhadowy Honours and periſhing Profits of a vain World, and the brutiſh Pleaſures of Senſe. Is it not a Maxim in all Courts of Judicature, that the Offence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in its Heinouſneſs in proportion to the Dignity of the Perſon offended; for if no Diſtinction of Perſons be allowed reſpecting the civil Authority with which they
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:003967_0178_100378BAFAC1F630"/>are inveſted, then all Order and Government is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Babyloniſh Anarchy introduced in its Room. <q>
                           <g ref="char:startq">“</g>If it be thought juſt and lawful among Men (as Mr. <hi>Stackhouſe</hi> obſerves) for very great and outragious Crimes to inflict ſuch Puniſhments upon Offenders that the civil Government may be preſerved, as ſhall affect the whole Duration of their Lives, (which is all of their Beings we have any Power over) it can't ſure be thought unjuſt in God to inflict ſuch Puniſhments upon Sinners as ſhall affect the whole Duration of their Beings, becauſe there is manifeſtly in this Caſe as great a Difference in their <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Crimes, as in the Duration of their Puniſhments.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is rational and agreable to the divine Wiſdom that ſuch Penalties ſhould be annexed to the Breach of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, as do over ballance all Incentives to Vice, that the Subject's Obedience may be effectually ſecured, the Sovereign's Honour inviolably maintain'd, and the Ends of Government obtained. But temporary Puniſhments are not ſufficient to procure this Obedience, therefore the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation of <hi>eternal</hi> is neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Propoſition which only needs Proof, may be thus confirm'd: If through the obſtinate Pravity of Men's Natures, and the numberleſs Enticements to Sin, the Denounciation of <hi>eternal</hi> Puniſhments has but little Influence on the moſt; how much leſs would a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a vaſtly ſhorter Duration. It is a juſt Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> 
                        <q>That if the Law <g ref="char:startq">“</g>be good and neceſſary, and cannot ſo effectually be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd without a ſevere Puniſhment to enforce it, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Puniſhment is ſo far from being a Cruelty, that it's a juſt and wiſe Proviſion to ſecure Obedience to the Law, and to procure the Benefit deſigned by it's <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Inſtitution.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Men have brought into their Natures a Diſpoſition to ſin eternally. It is very probable, that were they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live here for ever, they would act as perverſly as they do at preſent (unleſs the Almighty changed them by that Grace which they had forfeited, by their ſinful Obſtinacy) nay worſe, if worſe can be, than the Pitch ſome have come to; if they knew they ſhould be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo long a Duration here; for then all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints which are drawn from the Brevity and Uncertainty of their Time, as well as from the Terrors of Death, and that State of Rewards which immediately enſues it, (which gives ſome Check to the moſt) would be entirely removed.
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:003967_0179_100378BF4D395488"/>The Saying of <hi>Gregory</hi> upon this Head is remarkable, <q>Ir <g ref="char:startq">“</g>becomes the Juſtice of our Judge (ſaith he) that they who in this Life would never be without Sin, ſhould <g ref="char:endq">”</g>in the next never be without Puniſhment.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. God does but deal with Men in this Caſe according to their Choice. Is it not reaſonable that the Almighty having made Creatures that are capable of moral Service, ſhould give them a Law to direct them in it, enfore'd by ſuch Rewards and Puniſhments, as are ſuitable to excite to the Obedience of it, or deter them from Diſobedience? Now if the Penalty be no greater in weight or duration than the Reward, who can with any reaſon find fault? eſpecially conſidering that none ſhall be obliged to endure it, but ſuch as voluntarily chooſe the way that leads to it; if you don't like the Wages of Sin, pray avoid the Work; but if you will chooſe your own ruin, who can you blame but your ſelves? It's but equal, that thoſe who ſlight an endleſs Life, ſhould be puniſhed with an endleſs Death.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It's neceſſary for the preſervation of the divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and agreable to the Order God has eſtabliſhed of communicating his Favours, that Criminals who expect his Mercy, ſhould ſue for it, repent of, and reform from their Wickedneſs; but the Damned are ſo far from this, that they will perpetually increaſe their Abominations; for their Enmity againſt God, which is now in a great meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, ſhall be then enflam'd by the ſeverity of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; their <hi>impatience</hi> to endure them, and <hi>inability</hi> to avoid them. This will excite them to belch forth bold Blaſphemies againſt the bleſſed God, with the moſt fierce and furious tranſports of implacable, tho' impotent Malice; that if their <hi>power</hi> were equal to their <hi>deſire,</hi> they would tear him from his Throne Rev. 16.10, 11. <hi>They gnaw'd their Tongues for pain, and blaſphem'd the God of Heaven, becauſe of their pains and ſores, and repented not of their Deeds.</hi> In Hell, we are told by the Lord Jeſus, <hi>will be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 8.12. Intenſe Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as great Sorrow. Now if the wickedneſs of the Damned continue, will not God's irrefragable Juſtice incline him to continue their deſerved Puniſhment?</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Thy <hi>Caſe</hi> is <hi>extreamly dangerous,</hi> tho' thou art not ſenſible of it: <hi>Thou are like a Man ſleeping on the top of a Maſt in the miaſt of the Sea,</hi> Prov. 23.34. Every moment in danger of Death. Would it not make your Heart ake, and your Bowels bleed to ſee a poor Creature ſecurely ſlumbering on the Round top of a Veſſel in the time of a

O Friend, this is thy very caſe! Thou art every moment in danger of being ſunk in the Sea of God's Wrath! and if wallowed up with the Billows of his Indignation! Tho' thou art ſecure and unconcerned, thou hangeſt over the Gulph of Hell by the ſlender Thread of thy Life, yea thou fearleſly walkeſt upon the narrow Line of Life, juſt by the brink of the eternal Furnace: The terrible Sword of God's Juſtice hangs over thy Head, as it were by a Hair, ready to pierce thy Bowels, and bathe it ſelf in thy Gore. Is this a caſe to Sleep in? to Laugh in? and to take thy Eaſe? Amos 6.1. <hi>Wo to thoſe that are at eaſe in Zion.</hi> Come Friend, in the Name of the Great God my Lord and Maſter, let me tell thee a little more of thy danger and miſery.

                     <p>Theſe I deſign to treat of, in the order now propoſed, and I intreat you for Chriſt's ſake to Examine your ſelves by them, conſcienciouſly, and impartially, as in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Great GOD.</p>
                     <p>But I return to conſider the firſt Particular propoſed, Every Perſon that is ſavingly convinced, has an affecting Apprehenſion,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of the Sins of his Life, both as to the Malignity of their Nature, and their damning Effects. An enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul ſees more Deformity in Sin, than in any Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for it. O how odious and loathſome does it appear in their View, that they think no Words ſufficient to expreſs the Baſeneſs of it's Nature? Sin becomes by the Commandment exceeding ſinful, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.13. i. e. the Law being applied to the Conſcience, by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, feelingly, diſcovers the odious Nature of Sin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.30.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Pollutions of his Nature; that corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Original, from which all actual Evils proceed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Unconvinced and preſumptuous Sinners take little Notice of their Heart Corruptions, they are apt to think that their Hearts are indifferent good, their principal Concern is to get and keep the outſide clean, if they could but get that managed, they are apt to think they would be pretty well off, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.2. O but when God enlightens the Mind, their Sentiments are quickly altered, they are made to behold with Surprize and Confuſion, innumerable Iniquities in their Hearts, which lay before hid and concealed from their Obſervance: Not only their actual Sins appear in their Scarlet <hi>Dreſs,</hi> and hideous Aggravations; as ranged in <hi>Batallia</hi> againſt them to condemn and confound them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.21. But their original Corruption ſtands ready like a Lyon rampant, with open Mouth to devour them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 3. It aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them to ſee ſo many Evils in their Hearts, which they as little dreamed were there before God enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as <hi>Hazael,</hi> that he ſhould commit thoſe Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> foretold, 2 Kings 8.13. <hi>And Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zach ſaid, But what is why Servant a Dog that he ſhould do this great Thing?</hi> And as it aſtoniſhes them, ſo it afflicts them exceedingly, and makes them cry out, O! what a Wretch, a Monſter in Sin am I! Never was there ſuch a
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:003967_0192_100378ED170B1410"/>Creature on God's Earth before, 1 Tim 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came inco the World to ſave Sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Obſerve, not <hi>was</hi> but <hi>am</hi> chief. At preſent I ſee I am one of the greateſt of Sinners. How will ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Souls complain of their <hi>Hearts,</hi> which before they uſed to applaud; O my Heart! my Heart! never Man or Woman had ſuch a Heart as mine, they would he willing to change Hearts with any Body, were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done, for they are apt to think that there is ſome peculiar Wickedneſs, and myſtery of Iniquity in their Hearts, which is not in any others; this makes them complain to God in the Language of the inſpired Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap 7.23, 24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death.</hi> You know one may ſee many Motes, or Atoms by a Sun Beam ſhining through a Crevice into a Houſe, which they can't perceive by the light of a Candle, now the Light of a natural Conſcience which is all the inward Illumination, that many unconverted People have abiding in them, is no more in compariſon of the ſpecial inlightening Influences of the Holy Ghoſt, than the Light of a Candle to the Sun.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of his loſt, undone, and miſerable State at preſent. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. It is not enough to ſay, we are all in a loſt State by Nature, alas! no it will not do, it will not do! You muſt ſee that you are this Moment in an undone Condition. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. <hi>This my Son was dead and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again, was loſt, and is ſound.</hi> He was not only loſt really, but he ſaw that he was loſt, and was much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his doleful Condition, before he was found by his Father; and it is ſuch only that Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4, 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.11. <hi>comp-Luke</hi> 18.10, <hi>to</hi> 15. It is ſuch only whom Jeſus carries on his Shoulder to the Sheepfold, and lavs in his Arms. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4, 5. Iſai 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock like a Sheep-herd: He ſhall gather the Lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his Boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> Matth 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> It is not ſaid. Come unto me you vain, airy, high minded, hard hearted People, and I will give you reſt; no, they muſt be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Condition, before they be prepared for it: have their Wills bowed, their Hearts broken and diſtreſs'd for Sin. Particularly,</p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="unknown:003967_0193_100378EEBB9612F8"/>
                     <p n="1">1. They muſt have a <hi>Sight</hi> of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of their <hi>Miſery,</hi> if they die in the State they are in at preſent. A convinced Sinner ſees and knows that if he is removed by Death, in his preſent Condition, he ſhall as ſurely die as God lives, as ſurely die eternally, as he at preſent lives naturally, as certainly be ſeparated from God's gracious Preſence in Eternity, by the judicial Curſe of Chriſt, as his Soul ſhall be ſeparated from his Body in Time, by the ſtroke of Death. While People are in a State of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Security, they are apt to ftatter themſelves with the Hopes of Mercy, though they keep the <hi>old Heart,</hi> and go on in the <hi>old Courſe,</hi> as that bold prophane Rebel in our Text, <hi>I ſhall have Peace</hi> though — But true Peace and Safety was not a whit the nearer him, becauſe he dreamed of it, and groundleſly expected it; nor Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the further from him, becauſe he as fooliſhly as impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſdain'd it. Too many, I fear follow this Man's Practice, and think, if they don't ſay, though I be not ſo preciſe in my Life, and have not got ſuch a Change of Heart as ſome Saints pretend to, yet I hope to be ſaved as well as any of them; this is natural to unconvinced Sinners, and thoſe unhappy Creatures will labour to prop up their falſe Hope, by all means poſſible. As particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By a falſe Application of the Promiſes; like <hi>Waſps</hi> they draw Poiſon out of the ſweeteſt <hi>Flowers.</hi> And</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They encourage themſelves by the Falls of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, and by many other Methods before mention'd. If one convinces ſome People by the dint of Scripture and Reaſon, that the moſt of Mankind are in a bad State at preſent, and does but ſay, that if they die in that State they ſhall be damned, they are preſently ſurptiz'd, and imagine you to be a ſtrange ſort of a raſh unmerciful Creature, and quickly reply with much comnpaſſionate Zeal for the good of Mankind! You muſt not judge, God is merciful; you can't tell what he will do with ſuch People. Anſ Poor ſilly Souls, your are rather Objects of Pity than Anger! you ſeem to have Zeal, but alas, it is without Knowlege! <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. Inſtead of it's being for God, it is againſt him; this general groundleſs Charity, has a direct Tendency to ſtrengthen your own and others falſe Hopes, and keep the World in a dangerous Security; and this is privately the Reaſon, at leaſt as to your ſelves, why it is ſo wide. In ſhort, your Speech is either the Speech of an Ignoramus, a Fool, or an Infidel, either of
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:003967_0194_100378F3DB0E77C8"/>one that does not know the plain Current and dirſt of the Scriptures, or of one that cannot know through the Defect of a natural Underſtanding, or of one that will not believe through Prejudice. Your muſt not judge. Anſ. But may not we mention God's own Judgment as it is plainly reveal'd to us in his Word, if we may not, then we may ſhut up our Bibles. God is merciful. Anſ. He is ſo, but will he ſhew mercy contrary to his Word? If ſo, then what will become of his Truth? O the Blindneſs of the ungodly World! But it is again objected, Your don't know what God will do. Anſ. Yes in this Particular we do, for he has told us, in as plain a Manner as can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in his Word, what he will do; that without we believe, and are born again, and live a holy Life, we ſhall be damned, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Heh</hi> 12.14. And muſt we not believe God's Word? I aſſure you it $word$ the Devil's Cauſe you are defending, by your painted Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural <hi>Chariy.</hi> The Truth is, by your Way of arguing, your prove your ſelves to be in a State of Blindneſs and Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. But on the contrary, ſuch as are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, are obliged to caſt away all the Rubbiſh upon which they built their Hopes before; their Mouths are ſhut, and all their old carnal Pleas are ſilenc'd by which they were wont to extenuate their Sins, or juſtify their State, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.8, 9, 11, 13. &amp; 3.19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of the Severity of it: That it is Miſery unallayed with the leaſt mixture of Eaſe, or Intermiſſion. The Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Damned's Miſery is ſet forth to us by ſeveral very dreadful similitudes in the Scriptures. Such as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That of a <hi>Worm</hi> gnawing upon a Body, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44 <hi>comp</hi> which ſignifies the biting Reproaches of the Sinner's guilty Conſcience, which will <q>cleave to <g ref="char:startq">“</g> and prey upon the damned Soul, as Worms upon a dead Body: This Worm never dies, the Soul that is it's Food is immortal, and the Worm is bred in it, and one with it. Damned Sinners will be for ever accuſing, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and upbraiding themſelves with their own Folly, in <g ref="char:endq">”</g>reſecting the Happineſs offered them to Eternity.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By that of a <hi>Furnace,</hi> Matth. 13.42. <hi>And ſhall caſt them into a Furnace of Fire; there ſhall he wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Let us conſider a little the Analogy, and Diſagreement, between a Furnace and Hell.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Furnace is a Place <hi>prepared</hi> for Torment, <hi>Dan</hi> 36. So <hi>Tophet is ordained of old, yea for the King it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large, and the Pile there of is Fire
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:003967_0195_100378F7AD58D748"/>and much Wood, the Breath of the Lord like a Stream of Brimſtone doth kindle it,</hi> Iſai 30.33. Rev 21.8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A <hi>Furnace</hi> heated very hot, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s was, in very <hi>terrible</hi> to ſuch as are to be caſt into it, for their Wickedneſs: But alas! <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Furance heated ſeven Times, nay ſeventy times ſeven were it poſſible, in but an obſcure <hi>Figure</hi> of the Damned's <hi>Tormenzs, in that Lake which burns with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death!</hi> Rev. 21.8. For an earthly Furnace, though terrible, ſoon puts a Period to the Lives of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and conſequently to their Sufferings, which muſt needs expire with their Life; but the Damned's Torments ſhall never terminate, though they are always dying, yet they ſhall never die. Miſerable Souls they are, unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably tormented with a dying Life, and a living Death. Again, an earthly Furnace does but affect the <hi>Body,</hi> and is ſubject to <hi>Decays,</hi> it may be either quenched, or will abate through want of Fuel; but Hell's Furnace affects both <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> and all it's <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and that without Intermiſſion or End, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.11. And how can there be want of Fuel ſeeing the Breath of a God kindles the Flames, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.33. Nay, God himſelf is the Fuel that ſhall torment the Damned moſt. Hence it is ſaid to be <hi>a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God,</hi> Heb. 10.31.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> utter Darkneſs, Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Jude</hi> 5, 15. Natural Darkneſs is <hi>uncomfortable,</hi> but it hath and <hi>End,</hi> and is ſucceeded with <hi>Light;</hi> ſo it was in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and alſo they may enjoy ſome Comforts in the Time of it; but this is without <hi>Comfort,</hi> and without <hi>End;</hi> they ſhall never ſee Light more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural, ſpiritual, nor artificial.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Men may be in ſpiritual Darkneſs and ſaved for all, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.10. But the Gulph of Hell excludes all <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> Now convinced Sinners have an awful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of this, their Reſt is broken by it, Sleep departs from their Eyes, and Slumber from their Eye-lids, in a great Meaſure; and even that little they have is very much diſturb'd, with frightful Viſions of a <hi>dreadful God,</hi> and an <hi>eternal Hell. Job</hi> complains of this in the ſeventh Chapter of his Book, Verſe 14. <hi>Thou ſcareſt me with Dreams, and terrifieſt me through Viſions.</hi> Even in the Day time their waking Thoughts preſent horrible Images of the burning fiery Furnace, and of thoſe damned Creatures, that are rolling there on flaming Beds, and roaring hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:003967_0196_100378F934D76F70"/>through the Acuteneſs of painful Anguiſh! Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bewailing their own <hi>Madneſs,</hi> and ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorging their impotent <hi>Rage</hi> againſt God!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The convinced Sinner has an affecting Apprehenſion of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of his Miſery, that it will never, never End! O this heightens the Severity of it, and makes it intolerable, terrible, incomparable, unconceivable, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, and miſerable Miſery! How can a Perſon that has a Sight of this keep from crying out with the moſt doleful Accent, Great and good God! what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Men and Brethren, What ſhall I do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. Moſt holy Lord God! My Heart and <hi>Fleſh trembles becauſe of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Pſalm 119.120. Whither, bleſſed God, ſhall I haſten for Relief and Succour?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They have a Sight of the <hi>Equity</hi> of their <hi>Miſery;</hi> that it takes it's Riſe from their Sins, and is but the juſt Wages and Reward of their Iniquities; that they have brought it upon themſelves, by their wilful Obſtinacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Light; they know in their own Conſciences, that they were not forced to ſin as they have done, that they have neglected thoſe Duties of Religion, they might have performed, that God may juſtly take up the ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt them, <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done?</hi> reſpecting outward Means: <hi>And yet when I looked for Grapes, behold wild Grapes!</hi> Iſai. 5. In ſhort, every thing ſeems to condemn ſuch a Soul; when they look to the <hi>Trees</hi> or <hi>Flowers,</hi> or <hi>brutal Herds,</hi> theſe Creatures they ſee, though void of the Conduct of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet by a natural Inſtinct, anſwer the Deſigns of their <hi>Being;</hi> but they themſelves, though endowed with ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Powers, have lived in Oppoſition to theirs. In ſhort, there is nothing within the whole <hi>Verge</hi> of Nature, the Heavens, Earth and Sea, but what when conſidered, ſerves to increaſe their Pains! The Sun runs his appointed <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> without the leaſt Variation; the proud angry Ocean keeps within his ſtated <hi>Bounds,</hi> and obſerves his ſtated Ebbs and Flows; the bluſtring Winds and pregnant Clouds follow divine Direction, Pſalm 135.7. <hi>He cauſeth the Vapours to aſcend to the Ends of the Earth, he maketh Lightnings for the Rain, he bringeth the Wind out of his Treaſuries. Pſalm</hi> 148. There is an agreeable Harmony and ready Submiſſion to the divine Pleaſure, in all the Works of God; Men and Devils only excepted! from
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:003967_0197_10035B59091C13B8"/>whom only the moſt could be reaſonably expected: but if they turn their Eye from the Book of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Works of God, to the Book of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the Word of God, they can find no Comfort there for them, but almoſt every Page wounds them deeper, pricks them like a <hi>Nail, Eccl.</hi> 12.11. ſtabe them like a two-edged <hi>Sword, Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.16. bruiſes them like a <hi>Hammer, Jer.</hi> 23.29. ſcorches them like <hi>Fire, Jer.</hi> 20.9. and frights them as <hi>Claps</hi> of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and ſudden <hi>Flaſhes</hi> of <hi>Lightning</hi> does the timorous, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. But I proceed to conſider a</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Particular included in that Concern I would urge you to attain, which is <hi>Fear;</hi> a neceſſary Conſequent of the former: A convinced Sinner is exceedingly afraid leaſt the fierce Anger of God overtake and conſume him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his many and multiplied Tranſgreſſions! Iſai 6.5. <hi>Then ſaid I, wo is me, becauſe I am a Man of unclean Lips, for mine Eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Pſalm 119.120. <hi>My Fleſh trembleth for Fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi> O Sinner! if ſuch holy Men of God, as I have now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were ſeized with ſuch Fear and Anguiſh upon the Account of their Sins of Infirmity, what Reaſon haſt thou to cry out, becauſe of all thy baſe Abominations, thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and crimſon Iniquities Suppoſe one that had ſlain a Man at a Venture, under the legal <hi>O Economy,</hi> ſaw the Avenger of Blood cloſe at his Heels, ready to ſlay him, would he not flee with Fear and great Haſte to the City of <hi>Refuge</hi> in order to ſave his Life? Is it not much more ſo think ye with a convinced Sinner, for the Life of his Soul, his poor precious Soul lyes at Stake; when he is made to ſee that he is guilty of Soul Murder, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the deſtroying Angel of God's Vengeance, ready to give him the fatal <hi>Blow,</hi> when he beholds the <hi>Bow</hi> of Juſtice <hi>bent,</hi> arm'd with the pointed <hi>Arrows</hi> of Death rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <hi>pierce</hi> his unarmed, ſhelterleſs <hi>Soul,</hi> and make it bleed to eternal Death?

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> It's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable here, that while <hi>Job</hi> was at a diſtance from God, under no immediate impreſſions of his Purity and Majeſty, he pleaded hard in his own vindication, but when he came to have a near view of God, in that Glaſs he ſaw himſelf, and that with loathing and abhorrence.

The Hypocrite ſpeaks of ſome beloved Sin, as <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, 2 King. 5.18. <hi>In this thing the Lord pardon thy Servant:</hi> But the true Penitent in the language of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Iſraelite, Gen. 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs, and Sin againſt God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Implacably and conſtantly. Thoſe who hate Sin but by fits, mock God, deceive themſelves, and give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil the ſtronger poſſeſſion of their Souls. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:003967_0206_1003796A491D86D0"/>44, 45. If you ask what means you ſhould uſe to obtain the aforeſaid ſenſe of your Miſery?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Read the Holy Scriptures, which give you a dreadful <hi>Map</hi> of it; and that frequently and conſiderately, having firſt implor'd divine direction and aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Read pious Writings, and ſuch eſpecially as are moſt ſearching and awakening.

                     <p n="3">3. Hear faithful Miniſters; for Daubers and Time ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are not like to profit you. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.9, 21, 22, 32. 'Twas the obſervation of a worthy writer, <q>that our firſt <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Parents loſt Paradiſe by hearing a Sermon, but it was <g ref="char:endq">”</g>from the Devil.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in order to get your Conſciences awakened, and your Hearts chang'd by hearing the preached Word, take theſe Directions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Be buſy with God in the Morning upon your bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knees before you go to hear, cry mightily to Jehovah that he would direct the Speaker to your Caſe, and that he would ſeal it by his Power: Beg of God that he would give you a hungring Heart after the Bread of Life offered to Sinners by the preached Word, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.1, 2. Spend the Sabbath Morning in Prayer, Reading, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and keep ſending Groans to God all the Way you are going to his Houſe; this would make the Word ſweeter to you than Honey from the Comb, and more precious than refined Gold.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Time of Hearing, hearken to what is ſpoken with <hi>Attention</hi> and <hi>Reverence, Acts</hi> 16.14. It is hard to hit a Bird on the Wing, ſo it is difficult to ſtrike a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Hearer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hear with <hi>Faith, Heb.</hi> 4.2. We ſhould receive what is agreable to the holy Scriptures as a Meſſage from God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.15. <hi>John</hi> 10.4. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. With <hi>Application;</hi> and take care that ye apply a right Portion; otherwiſe the Word will hurt you rather than help you; inſtead of Phyſick or Food, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Poiſon. You have no Intereſt in the Promiſes or Comforts of the Goſpel, till you comply with the Terms of it, therefore apply them not, they are Children's Bread, they are Food for Chriſt's harmleſs Lambs, and chaſte
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:003967_0207_1003796BCF1C87C0"/>Doves, not for unclean Goats, crafty Foxes, or cruel. Wolves: Apply the Threatnings to your ſelves, for they are your Portion while you remain in this State; this is the Way to be awakened out of your deep Sleep.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. With <hi>Submiſſion &amp; Obedience, Jam.</hi> 1.22, 24 Again, in the Time of Hearing it would be ſerviceable, I think, to ſend up to God ſome ſudden ejaculatory Petitions for Light and Help. But</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After Hearing, pray don't talk of this or that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Cloaths, or any worldly Matters, but talk of Jeſus, as the Diſciples did when they were going to Emmaus, and it's probable you will find the Benefit of it as they did. The Sheep chews it's Cud, but the Wolf, the Fox and Swine, do not. Meditate on what you have heard, and confer about it with others, this would be both a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſant Way of ſpending ſacred Time; it would bring to your Remembrance Things you had forgot, and fix what you retained the deeper in your Memory, and ſo prevent the Devil (that grand Bird of Prey) ſtealing all the Seed of the Word from you; unleſs we digeſt the Meat we eat, it is not like to nouriſh us; and when you get Home to your Houſes, go into your Cloſets, and cry to the Father of Mercies for a Bleſſing on what you have heard, that the Truths of God, may abide in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Thoughts of your Hearts, and appear in the Fruits thereof in your Practice, to the Honour of the moſt high God, your preſent Peace and future Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Direct. If you are under any Convictions about the Badneſs of your State in general, or of any of your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in particular, <hi>Hold not the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, ſtrangle not</hi> your Convictions by Delays, or any other of thoſe Methods before mentioned, leſt you feel the Force of divine Vengeance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. O conſider! that this Practice of quenching the Spirit is,

An <hi>ungrateful Practice.</hi> Is this the Way you requite Jehovah for his unmerited and forfeited Goodneſs, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Salvation to you, and inviting you to accept of it? That inſtead of accepting his Love motions, you labour to ſtrangle and murder them, O monſtrous Ingratitude! <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh People and unwiſe?

                           <item>2. A <hi>rebellious Practice.</hi> It is a bold breach of God's poſitive Precept, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19 and that againſt the kindeſt Expreſſions of Love and Mercy; when the great

                           <item>3. A <hi>mad Practice.</hi> For by this you enter the Liſts with the <hi>almighty Jehovah;</hi> you fight with the <hi>ſovereign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven</hi> and Earth! And what think you is like to be the Fruit of this unequal Conteſt? Iſai. 27.4. <hi>Who would ſet the Briars and Thorns againſt me in Battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.</hi> Is it not the Perfection of Madneſs to contend with one that is infinitely ſtronger than your ſelves?

                           </item>
                           <item>4. A <hi>murderous Practice.</hi> It is Murder, Soul Murder, wilful Soul Murder; when you ſtifle and quench theſe Convictions about the Danger of your State, or Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Actions, which the good God with much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Love has kindled in your Conſciences, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.8, 9. &amp; 33.11. One may be guilty of Murder by preventing Life, as well as by deſtroying it when formed. Thus thoſe Women who expell their Conceptions by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Methods, leſt their Wickedneſs ſhould be brought to light, are undoubtedly guilty of Murder in the Sight of God; and much more thoſe who ſuppreſs the beginning.

It deſtroys your Peace both in Health and Sickneſs, in Life, at Death, and in Eternity Iſai. 57.20, 21. <hi>But the Wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe Waters caſt up Mire and Dirt.

Iſai 3.11. <hi>Wo unto the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with him: for the Reward of his Hands ſhall be given him. Matth.</hi> 8.12. &amp; 13.42, 50. By oppoſing the Convictions of the Spirit, you will cauſe him to withdraw, and that for ever, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.

Would it not cauſe intolerable Pain to have one of your Arms broke and cruſhed to pieces, and while the Bones jarred and $iſped againſt each other, to have it pulled off by the Shoulder Blade, to have not only the Bones di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted and broken, the fleſhy Parts torn in pieces, but the ſinewy, thoſe moſt ſenſible Parts rent aſunder; but yet it is more terrible to be wounded at the Heart, for a Stab there is mortal! But is it not ſtill more dreadful to have the Breaſt dug and opened, and the Heart that Seat of Life, and Spring of Motion, violently tore out of it, having firſt broke all theſe vital, bleeding Chords, by which it was united to the Body, and then to have the Pericordium (or Skin that covers it) fleed off and the Caul rent from it? But be aſſured Brethren, that this though a bo$$$ and very terrible Image, is but an obſcure Reſemblance of the Almighty's Jealouſy, and the Pains produced by it, in the miſerable Subjects of his Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it infinitely ſurpaſſes any finite Mind, in it's utmoſt Stretch of Thought to frame adequate or equal Ideas of it. Pſalm 90.11. <hi>Who knows the Power of thine Anger? ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath.</hi> The <hi>Damned</hi> muſt be always ſcorched with Flames that ſhall never expire! The <hi>Damned</hi> muſt be always griped with a Worm that ſhall never die. <q>The <hi>Damned</hi> muſt ever ever drink <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the rankeſt Venom that can be ſqueezed out of all the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Curſes ever God denounced; as I proved before.</q> But I proceed to conſider the ſecond Motive.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Motive, Which ſhould excite your Compliance with the former Exhortation and Directions, viz. The Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages you are like to obtain thereby. And</p>

                  <head>A prefatory Diſcourſe to the following Sermons, with a Relation of ſome <hi>Memoirs</hi> of their Author's Converſion and Character.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ARDON me, candid Reader, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Nearneſs of my Relation to the <hi>Author</hi> of the following Sermons, for the <hi>Honour</hi> of the moſt hight GOD, and the <hi>Glory</hi> of his free <hi>Grace,</hi> I do his <hi>Memory</hi> the Juſtice, and the <hi>World</hi> the Service, (I mean ſuch as were nto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally acquainted with him) as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt without the Paint of Flattery, a modeſt Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his real <hi>Characer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am aware that <hi>Relatives</hi> are apt to be ſuſpected of Partiality, in the Relations they give of thoſe they are bound to by thy Tyes of Nature; becauſe through the Strength of their natural Affection, their Judgment is apt to be <hi>byaſſed,</hi> and their byaſſed Judgment as apt to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide their Tongue, or Pen, into hyperbolical Miſtakes in their Narratives.</p>
                  <p>I freely confeſs there is ſome Reaſon for this Suſpicion in the general; but is it not poſſible for a Relative to get his Mind freed from thoſe partial Byaſſ$s, ſo as to obſerve plain Matters of Fact, with <hi>Modeſty</hi> and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Or muſt their Reaſon and Senſes be rendred whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inviolably Uſeleſs, in ſuch Matters as concern thoſe they are related to. Sure I am, they have an Advantage above Strangers in this, that they can with more Eaſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> into the ſecret and more retired Paſſages of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations <hi>Lives,</hi> not to ſay that it has been the Practice of ſome great Men (whoſe Example thoſe of a m$aner Order are apt to follow <hi>pro Viribus</hi>) to favour the World with
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003967_0226_100379A3B0743C60"/>an Account of their Relations Lives and Characters; whoſe Names, if it were needful, I could mention.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I am unequal to the <hi>Task</hi> I am engaging in, but a Regard to <hi>God's Honour,</hi> and the <hi>good of Mankind,</hi> invite me to attempt it.</p>
                  <p>Once more, to remove the former Suſpicion, I can with the utmoſt <hi>Solemnity</hi> aſſure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that what I ſhall offer, ſhall be much below what I might in Juſtice aſſert.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed,</p>
                  <p>The Reverend <hi>Author</hi> of the following Sermons, was bleſſed by God (from whom every good Donation flows) with a quickneſs of <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> copiouſneſs of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and fluency of <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> As to acquired <hi>Parts,</hi> he made no contemptible <hi>Progreſs</hi> in the Knowlege of the learned Languages; as alſo in philoſophical and theological Studies, conſidering his Years and Opportunities; which thoſe Reverend <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> before whom he paſs'd his <hi>Tryals,</hi> gave honourable Teſtimony to, by ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his publick Performances, as was ſuited to his diſtinguiſhed <hi>Merit.</hi> But particularly, he excelled in the <hi>polemical</hi> and <hi>caſuiſtical</hi> Parts of <hi>Divinity;</hi> he was well known to be$a keen <hi>Diſputant,</hi> and an expert <hi>Caſsuiſt.</hi> But that which <hi>crowned</hi> his other Attainents, and made them appear with <hi>Beauty</hi> and Luſtre, in the Eyes of all judicious Beholders, was his undiſguiſed and eminent <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi> It pleaſed the God of all Grace ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Time before his Entrance into the publick Miniſtry, to work a ſpecial Work of his pure Grace in his Heart, which in Concurrence with his peculiar natural and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Endowments, rendred him a prepared and poliſhed <hi>Shaſt,</hi> for the miniſterial Work. Give me leave, candid Reader, to relate a few Paſſages concerning the Manner of his <hi>Converſi$n</hi> to God.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Conviction</hi> of Sin, and the State of Danger and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery he was brought into by it, was the moſt violent in Degree, of any that ever I ſaw: For ſeveral Days and Nights together, he was made to cry out in a moſt dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and affecting Manner, almoſt every Mement; the Words that he frequently uſed in his Soul-Agony were theſe, <q>O my poor Soul! O my bloody loſt Soul! What <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſhall I do? Have Mercy upon me, O God, for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>ſake!</q> Sometimes he was brought to the very Brink of <hi>Diſpair,</hi> and would conclude, ſurely God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have Mercy upon ſuch a great Sinner as he was; and
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003967_0227_10037953DA55F180"/>yet in the mean time, <hi>obſerve</hi> Reader! that his Life was unſtained with thoſe ſcandalous. Extravagancies, which too many (alas for it!) in the Bloom of their Youth are enſnared by. His natural <hi>Predominant</hi> was the Sin of Paſſion, or raſh Anger, and the worſt I ever knew him guilty of, was ſome indecent <hi>Heats</hi> this Way; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was exceedingly humbled for and watchful againſt; his Paſſionateneſs coſt him many a deep <hi>Sob,</hi> heavy <hi>Groan</hi> and ſalt <hi>Tear,</hi> and after it pleaſed the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to confer his free Grace upon him, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably altered in this Particular, and gained in a great Meaſure, the aſcendant over it. Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Manner of his Life before his Conve$ſion was ſuch, as to be free from groſs Enormities, the depth of his <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> under his <hi>Conviction,</hi> and that in young <hi>Years,</hi> is the more remarkable, and ſerves to confute that vain <hi>Notion,</hi> of ſome carnal People, that if Perſons have not been prophane in their Lives, then they ſay there no need of deep Convictions, and grea$ Anguiſh of Soul, in order to a true <hi>Cloſure</hi> with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Indeed his <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> was ſuch, as forced him to make an open <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his Sins, to almoſt all that came near him; as alſo to <hi>beg</hi> their Prayers at God's <hi>Throne</hi> in his Behalf; and this he did in ſuch a piteous Manner, with ſuch a dejected frighted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, like that of a Man going to be put on a <hi>Rack,</hi> or <hi>Gibbet,</hi> or having his Head upon a <hi>Block</hi> in order to be chop'd off; and with ſuch dolorous <hi>Groans,</hi> and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Importunity,</hi> did he implore <hi>Heaven</hi> for <hi>Relief</hi> and Pardon, that even ſome Strangers who came to ſee him, were much affected therewith; the <hi>Tears</hi> trickling down their Cheeks like <hi>Hail.</hi> At the beginning of his <hi>Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I endeavoured to heighten it, by repreſenting to him the particular and heinous Aggravations of thoſe Sins, I knew or ſupected him to be guilty of, in a Dreſs of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> leaſt his <hi>Conviction</hi> ſhould <hi>languiſh,</hi> and he <hi>relapſe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dangerous <hi>Security.</hi> But when I perceived that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a great <hi>Degree,</hi> and was attended with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longing after Chriſt, and a Willingneſs to forſake all for him; I altered the former <hi>Method.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think I had ſufficient Evidence of the <hi>depth</hi> of his <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of his <hi>Deſire</hi> after Chriſt, in the following <hi>Inſtances,</hi> and many others that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, did I not deſign Brevity. <q>He profeſs'd with an <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Agony of <hi>Paſſion</hi> that he was willing to bear the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Hell,</hi> if ſo he might but get a Sight of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003967_0228_100379AE1CFF1C68"/>and an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in him; be earneſtly and frequently beg'd of God, that he would humble him to the <hi>Duſt,</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>yea below the <hi>Duſt.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Morning about the break of Day, after great Wreſtling through the Night and Day preceeding, he took occaſion from the Time of the Day, to ſpeak as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly as ever I heard any Mortal about the Morning-<hi>Star,</hi> longing and praying. <q>that the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>true, the bright, the beautiful <hi>Morning Star,</hi> who had introduced the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Day,</hi> into a <hi>dark World,</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>would appear in Mercy to his poor diſtreſſed Soul</q>; and thus he improved the Time about the <hi>Sun</hi>'s riſing, <q>
                        <g ref="char:startq">“</g>begging that the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteouſneſs would ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diſconſolate, dejected, wretched Soul with <hi>Beams</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>of Mercy and Salvation</q>. And thus he improved ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Occurrences</hi> every of which were they here mentioned, would-ſwell this Paper to too large a <hi>Bulk.</hi> But to be brief, his Heart ſeemed to be ſick, ſore ſick with panting after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ready to burſt in preces. I have (Glory to God) through the Riches of free Grace, been honoured with the Sight of many a convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but never did I behold beſides himſelf, any in ſuch a <hi>Rack</hi> of acute and continued Anguiſh, under the diſmal Apprehenſions of a holy, juſt, jealous and provoked <hi>Deity,</hi> impending <hi>Ruin</hi> and endleſs <hi>Miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when I perceived ſuch plain <hi>Signs</hi> of a deep <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> great <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and earn$ſt <hi>Deſire,</hi> I altered the former Method as I hinted before, and offered all the encouraging Supports I could gather from every promiſory Part of the ſacred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that I thought related to his Caſe, that I might miniſter Comfort to his ſick Soul, but in <hi>vain.</hi> Sometimes after having offered a promiſory <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and laboured to perſwade him that he had an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in it, becauſe the Conditions on which the promiſed Bleſſings were ſuſpended, were wrought in him; this would have ſometimes ſo much Influence upon him, that it would prevent his crying out for a few Minutes, (juſt like a Man drowning in troubled Waters, a ſmall <hi>Twig</hi> may ſupport for a ſow Moments, but the next <hi>Surge</hi> that comes will beat him off) and then immediately the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> of his Grief would break forth, in the moſt doleful <hi>Accents,</hi> 
                     <q>complaining that neither that nor any other <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Promiſe in the whole <hi>Bock</hi> of God belonged to him; that the Conditions annexed to them were not wrought <g ref="char:endq">”</g>in him.</q> The Truth is, his Wound was ſo deep,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:003967_0229_100379B0E4887678"/>that none but God's own Arm could heal it. But it pleaſed the Almighty, after four Days and four Nights, enduring the utmoſt Agony of Soul <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> in which ſpace he cried out almoſt every Moment, after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before deſcribed, to make his <hi>Conſolations</hi> as conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and eminent as his <hi>Conviction</hi> has been. But by the Way, <hi>obſerve Reader,</hi> that for ſome Time before it pleaſed the <hi>Almighty</hi> to ſhed abroad the <hi>Beams</hi> of Mercy and Love into his <hi>Soul,</hi> he was much exerciſed with ſorrowful and piercing Reflections upon his conceived Hypocriſy; he judged and condemned himſelf to be a Phariſee, a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, for crying out as he had done, and yet the biting of his Conſcience, the Sharpneſs of his inward Pain, and Weight of his Grief was ſuch, that he could not prevent it, therefore he would have all People out of the Room, that he might pray and mourn alone.</p>
                  <p>One Morning when I went in to ſee him, I perceived a great Alteration in his Countenance; he that but about an Hour before, looked like a condemned Man, going to be put to ſome cruel Death, looked upon me with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gladſome <hi>Countenance,</hi> (ſo as if a Perſon oppreſs'd with Poverty, had the moſt valuable <hi>Diadems,</hi> and opulent <hi>Kingdoms</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> affords or contains, conferred upon h$m would look) and ſpoke to me in theſe Words, <q>O <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Brother! the <hi>Lord J$ſus</hi> has come in Mercy to my Soul, I was begging for a <hi>Crumb</hi> of Mercy, with the <hi>Dogs,</hi> and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                        <hi>Chriſt</hi> has told me he would give a <hi>Crumb.</hi>
                     </q> Then he deſired me to thank God by Prayer, which I did more than once. He alſo requeſted me to praiſe God by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part of a Pſalm, which I comply'd with, and ſung the thirty-fourth. And was it not ſtrange and ſurprizing <hi>Reader,</hi> to hear this <hi>Perſon,</hi> of whom I have been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinging the Praiſes of God with more Joy, Energy and Clearneſs, than any of the <hi>Spectators,</hi> who crowded in upon ſo extraordinary and ſolemn and <hi>Occaſion,</hi> eſpecially conſidering the Time when this happened, viz. between ten and eleven of the Clock in the Forenoon, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat three of the Clock the ſame Morning he was <hi>Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> for ſome Minutes, and in the Judgment of all the <hi>Spectators, expiring,</hi> in the Pangs of Death. Yea the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God had ſuch a mighty Influence upon him, that about an Hour or two after he went thirty-two Rods upon his own <hi>Feet,</hi> with but a very little Help to ſee his <hi>Brother,</hi> the Reverend Mr. <hi>William Tennent,</hi> who was then extremely ſick, nigh unto Death, deem'd by the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003967_0230_100379B7D6AD9A60"/>moſt, paſt all humane Probability of Recovery; for he ſaid, <q>he muſt ſee his <hi>Brother,</hi> in order to tell him, what <g ref="char:startq">“</g>God had done for his Soul, that he might praiſe God <g ref="char:endq">”</g>upon his Account, before he died</q>: And indeed when he came to the upper Room where his Brother lay (who is yet through Mercy alive, and who has been and is like to be further ſerviceable to advance the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus,</hi> in the Hearts fo Sinners) I having him by one Hand, and Mr. <hi>Court Van Varhes</hi> by the other he had almoſt ſprung out of our Hands, when he came near the H$ad of the Stairs, the <hi>Joy of God</hi> became ſo his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Song!</hi> When he came to his <hi>Brother,</hi> he addreſſed him in theſe Words, <q>O <hi>Brother!</hi> the Lord has looked in <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Pity upon my Soul, let the <hi>Heavens, Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>all that in them is, <hi>praiſe God!</hi>
                     </q> — But being expoſed too ſoon to the cold Air, he ſell into a Fever, and then in ſome few Hours <hi>queſtioned</hi> that eminent Diſcovery of <hi>God's Love;</hi> but was in a little time aſter comforted, and thenceforward the Courſe of his Converſation was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he had many after <hi>Sealings</hi> of God's Covenant-Love, but in the <hi>Intervals</hi> was frequently dejected, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed with doubtful Thoughts about his <hi>State.</hi> Don't expect Reader, that I ſhould relate what aff$cting <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> theſe extraordinary <hi>Occurrences</hi> had upon the <hi>Hearers</hi> and <hi>Spectators;</hi> only one particular I muſt not conceal with a <hi>Vail</hi> of Silence, viz That a certain Perſon of Diſtinction, who in Reſpect of practical Religion was but <hi>Galeo</hi>-like, being preſent when my Reverend Brother received theſe <hi>Conſolations</hi> mention'd, was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, That the Sight of theſe Things, was enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an Atheiſt of the Reality of Religion".</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, after theſe ſatisfactory Diſcoveries of the Love of God in Jeſus, he became a conſciencious Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Duti$s of Religon, both negative, poſitive and relative. He was cautious in avoiding all incentives to Vice, as being ſenſible of his own Weakneſs, and the Force of Temptations.</p>
                  <p>He was painful in the Performance of ſuch Duties eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as were moſt contrary to Nature's Eaſe, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſecret Devotion, and frequent Faſting, the laſt of which is almoſt wholly neglected, by the greateſt Part of the preſent Generation, both young and old, which is for a Lamentation!</p>
                  <p>He was a tender hearted, kind and courteous <hi>Relative,</hi> of a very ſympathetick Spirit, and particularly his dutiful
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:003967_0231_100379BBCE441980"/>Reſpects to his <hi>reverend</hi> and aged <hi>Father,</hi> his honoured and affectionate <hi>Mather,</hi> (of whoſe early Kindneſſes he ſtill retained a grateful Senſe) merits honourable <hi>Mention</hi> and cheerful <hi>Imitation</hi> His great Soul diſdained any thing that was mean and trivial, and inclined him to the moſt noble and generous Actions that were within the <hi>Verge</hi> of his Power. But not to inſiſt here,</p>
                  <p>I proceed to conſider his Attainments in the chriſtian Graces or Virtues: Now there are theſe three, viz. <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Love to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Zeal for his Kingdom,</hi> in which it pleaſed God to give him conſiderable <hi>Advances,</hi> each of which I ſhall ſpeak a little of. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was wont to expreſs himſelf in the moſt abaſing <hi>Strains,</hi> viz "That he thought himſelf, one of the worſt of <hi>Creatures</hi> ever the <hi>Creation</hi> bore!" Give me leave to mention but a few Inſtances of his <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Modeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was not this a remarkable Evidence of the abaſing <hi>Senſe</hi> he had of his own <hi>Unworthineſs,</hi> that, the earneſtly upon his dving <hi>Bed, deſired his Relations,</hi> 
                     <q>to <hi>forbear</hi> any <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                        <hi>Funeral-Encomiums</hi> upon him when he was <hi>gone;</hi> for he <hi>aſſerted</hi> with ſome Degree of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> that he <hi>deſerved</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>none.</q> But this was an Inſtance of his <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> yet we cannot but think, that we ſhould obey God rather than <hi>Man,</hi> by labouring to convey the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of God's peculiar <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> expreſſed to his <hi>Servant,</hi> to the lateſt <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Inſtance</hi> was this, when he was admitted to the miniſterial <hi>Office,</hi> in his private Studies, he often took the <hi>Bible</hi> in his Hand, and walked up and down the Room <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> over it, becauſe altho' there was ſuch a <hi>Treaſury</hi> of precious <hi>Truths</hi> contained in that bleſſed <hi>Book,</hi> that he underſtood ſo little (as he thought) of them. A Senſe of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the miniſterial. <hi>Work,</hi> and of his own <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Unfitneſs</hi> for it, (as he conceived) was often a very oppreſſive <hi>Burden</hi> to his <hi>Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, It was long, even after it pleaſed God to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his <hi>Labours,</hi> before he could be perſwaded to <hi>believe</hi> that the <hi>ſovereign Majeſty of Heaven,</hi> would bleſs the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> of a <hi>Perſon</hi> every Way ſo <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>unworthy,</hi> as he reckoned himſelf to be; and therefore when <hi>Reports</hi> were brought to him, of Perſons <hi>convinced</hi> by his <hi>Sermons,</hi> he could not think for a Time that they were <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſpeacial,</hi> until further <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Conviction</hi> was offered him, by a <hi>Variety</hi> of bright and inconteſtable <hi>Evidences,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:003967_0232_100379BEDA4ACDF0"/>
                  <p>As to his <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> it's neceſſary I ſhould offer one Word: It may be aſſerted with <hi>Truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Juſtice:</hi> that he had an <hi>affectionate Affection</hi> to the <hi>King of Saints;</hi> which he expreſs'd to the <hi>ſurprize</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of ſuch devout Souls, who had the <hi>advantage</hi> of hearing his <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> and <hi>earneſt Prayers. Chriſt</hi> and him <hi>crucified,</hi> was the <hi>mark</hi> of his <hi>Purſuits,</hi> the ſacred <hi>Centre,</hi> to which the various <hi>Lines</hi> of his <hi>Life run,</hi> with a delightful <hi>proneſs;</hi> of his <hi>ſupreme Love,</hi> and <hi>higheſt Admiration!</hi> Of Him he would often ſpeak, in the <hi>rethorical and rapturous Strains,</hi> of <hi>Love Language!</hi> Upon this moſt excellent, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and delightful <hi>Subject,</hi> his <hi>Tongue</hi> was ſometimes as the <hi>Pen</hi> of a ready <hi>Writer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had alſo a very flaming <hi>Zeal</hi> for the promotion and eſtabliſhament of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom;</hi> it was often, often his <hi>Petition</hi> to God; a <hi>Requeſt,</hi> which he uſually offered, with much <hi>Vehemence!</hi> 
                     <q>Namely, that it would pleaſe <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the <hi>Gracious God,</hi> to make him <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to his <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>World;</hi> and that he wou'd not ſuffer him to live only to <hi>devour</hi> the <hi>Alms</hi> of it, but rather remove him to <g ref="char:endq">”</g>himſelf, before he became uſeleſs, and unprofitable</q>: Which Requeſt the <hi>Almighty</hi> granted, for he was carried off in a throng of <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Succeſs;</hi> when his <hi>Heart</hi> was much ſet upon the Work of God, and his People's <hi>Love</hi> upon him.</p>
                  <p>It we conſider him in his publick <hi>Character:</hi> It pleas'd that <hi>God</hi> in whoſe hands the Hearts of all Men are, and <hi>who can turn them, as he does the Streams of Water,</hi> in the <hi>South;</hi> to ſtir up in him earneſt <hi>Longings</hi> after the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Miniſterial Office;</hi> a <hi>Station</hi> which the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> had in a peculiar manner <hi>qualified</hi> him for; a <hi>Station</hi> in which he thought he might more eminently <hi>dedicate</hi> and <hi>devote</hi> all his <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> to the <hi>Glorious God;</hi> in labouring to illuſtrate his <hi>Honour,</hi> and advance his People's <hi>Intereſt:</hi> With theſe <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Deſigns,</hi> after having paſs'd the uſual <hi>Trials,</hi> with uncommon <hi>Approbation,</hi> he came into the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> in which he laboured as <hi>a Workman, that needed not to be aſhamed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Miniſterial Adminiſtrations,</hi> were attended with three notable <hi>qualities,</hi> viz <hi>Prudence, Pains,</hi> and <hi>Succeſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He behav'd himſelf in all reſpects, with ſuch decent <hi>caution,</hi> but yet attended with ſuch Chriſtian <hi>plainneſs,</hi> and

                  <p>As to his <hi>Pains</hi> in the <hi>Miniſterial Work,</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> is, his <hi>labour</hi> was <hi>great!</hi> tho' his <hi>Time</hi> was ſhort, his <hi>Race</hi> was <hi>ſwift</hi> and <hi>vehement!</hi> His Heart was ſo fix'd upon the Work of God, that there was no perſwading him to deſiſt, in the <hi>progreſs</hi> of his publick <hi>Labours,</hi> even then when his <hi>Body</hi> was much <hi>emaciated</hi> and weakned by a <hi>Conſumptive Illneſs;</hi> when it was judg'd by skilful <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> very <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical</hi> to his <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>languiſhing Conſtitution.</hi> He often <hi>preach'd</hi> to his dear <hi>People,</hi> while he was under the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> of a burning <hi>Fever;</hi> which plainly ſhew'd the <hi>flame</hi> and <hi>ſervor</hi> of his <hi>Zeal,</hi> and that he had but little regard to his <hi>Body;</hi> compar'd with the precious <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, for whom he was willing to <hi>ſpend</hi> and be <hi>ſpent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his <hi>publick Diſcourſes,</hi> not to mention the <hi>juſtneſs</hi> of his <hi>Method, beauty</hi> of <hi>Stile,</hi> and <hi>fluency</hi> of <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> by which he <hi>chain'd</hi> his not unwilling <hi>Hearers</hi> to his <hi>Lips;</hi> he was very <hi>awakning</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> (to Unbelievers) in denouncing and deſcribing, with the moſt vehement <hi>pathos</hi> and awful <hi>ſolemnity!</hi> the <hi>terrors</hi> of an offended <hi>Deity;</hi> the <hi>threats</hi> of a broken <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>miſeries</hi> of a ſinful <hi>State;</hi> and this <hi>Subject</hi> in the Courſe of his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> he inſifted much upon; becauſe he found it by experience, (with many others) the moſt effectual and ſucceſsful <hi>mean</hi> to <hi>alarm</hi> ſecure Sinners: And obſerve, <hi>Reader,</hi> he us'd a cloſe diſtinguiſhing and detecting <hi>method</hi> in the <hi>Application</hi> of his <hi>Sermons,</hi> which with his <hi>pungent mode</hi> of <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> was very <hi>piercing</hi> and <hi>ſolemn.</hi> but as Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Funeral Elegy</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> ſo I may truly ſay of him, <q>that he knew the <hi>pity</hi> of <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s <hi>Heart,</hi> ſas well <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words are Part of a remarkable Dialogue between Chriſt and <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> in which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his Fear, Ignorance, and Willingneſs to be taught, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally bewrayed; he was one of the Phariſees, as we are informed from the firſt Verſe of this Chapter, who in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were ſtated Enemies againſt Chriſt, and his Goſpel; theſe Phariſees were proud Separatiſts, who upon the Opinion of their own Righteouſneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all others.</p>
                  <p>As to his <hi>Station,</hi> he was a Ruler, as the Word <hi>Archoon</hi> ſignifies; this Man being in a high and eminent Station, through Fear of incurring the Anger or Diſpleaſure of the Jewiſh Sanedrim, by openly profeſſing Chriſt, came to him by Night, Verſe 2. Thus we ſee what Clogs, Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Impediments, Honour, Grandeur, and Greatneſs are, in the Way of the Profeſſion and Practice of Truth and Holineſs; yet it is evident from the Words of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> in the ſecond <hi>ver.</hi> notwithſtanding his Fears to acknowledge openly the Truth of Chriſt's Miſſion from the Father, that be had a well grounded Perſwaſion of it, $$om the Miracles the bleſſes Jeſus had wrought; <hi>Rabbi,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003967_0242_100379E824035C40"/>we know that thou art a Teacher come from God: for no Man can do thoſe Miracles that thou do$ſt, except God be with him.</hi> But certainly it is of vaſt Conſequence and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that the groſs Ignorance and ſtrange Stupidity of this learned Man, a Teacher in Iſrael, concerning the vital Part of Piety, — are ſo perſpicuouſly detected in our Text and Context. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Verily —.</hi> In the Words are three Things remarkable,
<list>
                        <item>1. A Propoſition.</item>
                        <item>2. An Aſſeveration.</item>
                        <item>3. The implicit Occaſion of them both.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Propoſition</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> In it there be two Things,
<list>
                        <item>1. The <hi>Subject, a Man.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> or that which is ſpoken concerning the Subject, <hi>be born again.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Subject, a Man.</hi> This indefinite Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the Matter ſo requiring as the preſent Caſe is) is equipollent, or equivalent to a univerſal. It is as much as if he had ſaid every Man, of whatſoever Order, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or Age, or Nation, Great or Small, Rich or Poor, Noble or Ignoble, Learned or Unlearned, Young or Old, Jew or Gentile, Bond or Free, Male or Female, muſt be born again, or they cannot ſee the Kingdom o God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6; 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.23. 2 <hi>John</hi> 1.13. <hi>John</hi> 3.7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.29. &amp; 3.9. &amp; 5.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Predicate;</hi> which being complex treats of two Things, viz.
<list>
                        <item>(1.) Of Happineſs under that Term the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>(2.) The <hi>Qualification</hi> univerſally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obtain it, which is <hi>being born again; ean me tis genneſthe anwthen.</hi> The Greek Word <hi>anwthen</hi> is generally render'd <hi>ſuperne,</hi> from above, but the Tenor of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, eſpecially <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his Anſwer to Chriſt, <hi>How can a Man enter the ſecond Time —?</hi> Verſe 4. ſufficiently proves that if ſignifies as much here as <hi>deuteron,</hi> or <hi>again, our dunatai idein, ton baſi$cian tu theou; be cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> by <hi>ſeeing</hi> here I underſtand poſſeſſing, according to that Phraſe of the Romans, <hi>Hereditatem cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere.</hi> A Proof of this we have in our <hi>Lord's Sermon</hi> on the Mount, Matth 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the Pure in Heart: for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> i. e. they ſhall ſee him to their Comfort, ſee him ſo as to enjoy him, ſee him as a Friend and Father, and poſſeſs him as a ſatisfying Portion. <hi>Cannot,</hi> an unregenerate Man is under a threefold Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, in Regard of the Enjoyment of <hi>God's Kingdom.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003967_0243_100379ED64ACF638"/>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural.</hi> He muſt take this Kingdom by main Force out of the Hands of a juſt and infinite GOD, if he gets it at all, while he remains in this State. Now what Power has a guilty Worm to do this? <hi>Whoſe Foundation is in the Duſt, and who is cruſhed before the Moth,</hi> Job 4.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Moral.</hi> He is a Subject utterly unqualified for the pure Pleaſures that <hi>Kingdom</hi> affords, being univerſally corrupt, and ſubject to the Government of Sin and Senſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Judicial.</hi> He is diſſeized of, and ſeperated from this Inheritance, by the Sentence of Chriſt the Judge of Quick and Dead; which no Power in Heaven or Earth can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: For He that liveth and was dead, carries the Keys of Hell and Death at his Girdle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p>An Unregenerate Perſon, as ſuch, neither can, nor ſhall ſee the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſo as to inherit lit, if there be Power enough in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to keep him out; for this <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives his <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>pawn,</hi> which he will ſurely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. Now there is a threefold <hi>Kingdom</hi> made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Kingdom of God's <hi>Providence,</hi> eſtabliſh'd upon the Baſis of God's uncontroulable Power, and unſearchable Wiſdom, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God has the reins of Covernment on his Shoulders, He weilds the Eternal Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſits at the ſacred Helm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Kingdom of God's <hi>Grace</hi> in the Church; built upon Chriſt the Golden Foundation, the chief Corner Stone: This <hi>Kingdom</hi> is given to the <hi>Branch</hi> by <hi>God</hi> the Father, as the inſpired Evangeliſt teſtifies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Kingdom of <hi>Glory</hi> and Bleſſedneſs: Matth. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you —</hi> This laſt mentioned I take to be the <hi>Kingdom</hi> deſign'd by <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> viz. that <hi>triumphant Quire</hi> in which the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> ſing <hi>Eternal Hallelujah</hi>'s, to the Everlaſting <hi>King. Heaven</hi> is call'd a Kingdom, becauſe in it God rules his Sons and Subjects. <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> is where he reigns: Now he reigns in Righteouſneſs, Heb. 1.8. <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever! a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Righteouſneſs, is the Scepter of thy Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, Verily.</hi> This <hi>Aſſeveration</hi> is a conſpicuous <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Truth of the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> tending clearly to manifeſt the great Momentouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Importance of it. There be two Things in the <hi>Aſſeveration</hi> which ſerve to eſtabliſh inviolably the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacity or <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> viz.
<list>
                        <item>(1.) The <hi>Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Particle Amen.</item>
                        <item>(2.) The <hi>Dignity</hi> of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003967_0244_100379F0C91560E0"/>Speaker. The Word <hi>Amen,</hi> rendred Verily in the Text, is twoſold, either <hi>Prefixed</hi> or <hi>affixed;</hi> when it is <hi>prefixed</hi> or put before a Propoſition, it is the Note of a certain and earneſt Affirmation, as in the Words of our Text, <hi>Verily, verily.</hi> When it is <hi>affixed</hi> or ſubſequent to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it notes two Things:
<list>
                              <item>Either (1.) The Aſſent of the Mind, Will, Affections, as at the Concluſion of the Creed and the Lord's Praver.</item>
                              <item>Or (2.) An Aſſeveration, or certain Affirmation, as the Word Amen, at the End of the Lord's Prayer, ſignifies not only our Aſſent to, but Aſſurance of the Reality and Certainty of the Things therein contained; now the Repetition of this Particle in our Text, like the redoubling of <hi>Pharach</hi>'s Dream, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. ſhews us at once the undeniable Certainty and great Weight of the Thing ſpoken of.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Speaker:</hi> Who is it that ſpeaks thus? The <hi>bleſſed and holy Jeſus,</hi> as our Text informs us; which Name ſome derive from <hi>Temi mitto,</hi> a Word that ſignifies to ſend, becauſe the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is the bright <hi>Angel,</hi> the faithful <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the everlaſting <hi>Covenant; Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. Others from <hi>jaw ſano,</hi> a Word that ſignifies to heal, becauſe our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was the true <hi>Phyſician, Math.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.17. <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Ancients</hi> are of this Opinion.</p>
                  <p>But the Angel explains the true Derivation of it, Mat. 1.21. <hi>And thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> And that not only typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as <hi>M$ſes</hi> and <hi>J$ſhua,</hi> and others, but really and truly. Nor (2) only temporally, as thoſe before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, juſt from bodily Miſeries, but from ſpiritual and eternal, from Sin and Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56, 57. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. (3.) Neither did he only free his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from Miſery, as <hi>M$ſes</hi> did Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt,;</hi> no, but as his Type <hi>Joſhua</hi> led Iſrael into <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo does the bleſſed jeſus the Anti-type, introduce his People into a State of endleſs, uninterrupted, and unſpeakably ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Delight, in the Imperial <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> of which the earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a dark <hi>Figure.</hi> Now I ſay, the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Perſon ſpeaking in our Text, gives great <hi>Weight</hi> and Confirmation to the Truth ſpoken. Will he who is <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf lie? Will he who is the great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> of his People, co-equal and co eternal with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Brightneſs of his Glory, the Expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb 13.4.8. deceive us? <hi>I ſay unto you:</hi> I who am the Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003967_0245_100379F487ED01C8"/>the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> and <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the third Particular, the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the Words of our Text, imply'd in that Phraſe, <hi>Jeſus anſwered.</hi> It is difficult to find out what were the Words <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſpake, to which <hi>Jeſus</hi> gave anſwer, there is a Diverſity of Opinions about it. Some think that Chriſt's Words, are a direct Anſwer to thoſe Words of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> mentioned in the ſecond Verſe; As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid, Thou lookeſt upon me as a Prophet only, thou can'ſt do no otherwiſe, unleſs thou wert regenerated. Others think, and that more probably, that from the good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he asked the Way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that our Text is an Anſwer to that Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>From the Words thus briefly explained, there ariſes theſe two <hi>doctrinal Obſervations,</hi> the one imply'd, and the other expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Obſer. I. <hi>That Man from his very Birth is depraved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſer. II. <hi>That Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary in Order to obtain eternal Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe which is this, <hi>That Man from his very Birth is depraved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Method I deſign to follow in proſecuting this Doctrine is
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>To prove the Truth of it.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Explain the Nature of it.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>To improve it.</hi> And</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I am to conſider the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Doctrine. This is plain from the Text, for if the firſt Birth was not viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, what need would there be of a ſecond. The royal Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> upbraids Iſrael with this, <hi>And was called a Tranſgreſſor from the Womb,</hi> Iſai. 48.8. The Pſalmiſt gives Teſtimony to the ſame Truth, Pſalm 51.5. <hi>I was ſhapen in Sin,</hi> not only corrupted with Sin as ſoon as born, but before, even in our Formation. <hi>Job</hi> confirms this in the 14th. Chapter of his Book, 4. Verſe. <hi>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> Yea, the <hi>bleſſed Jeſus</hi> makes this the Ground of the Neceſſity of a Change, in the 7. Verſe of our Context, <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh:</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, You need not wonder, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> at my Inculcation of the Neceſſity of this inward <hi>Change</hi> or <hi>New Birth;</hi> becauſe Men are corrupted from their <hi>firſt Birth.</hi> This original
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003967_0246_100379F9AB5B3288"/>Depravity is conveyed to all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> unleſs prevented by a Miracle, as in Chriſt. The Sickneſs and Death of Infants are a plain and umanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proof of this: <hi>For the Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Alſo the baptiſmal Laver ſhews this hereditary Contagion and Infection. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I am to explain the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Depravity.</hi> which conſiſts chiefly in theſe three Things, viz.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>In a Privation of Good.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>In an Antipathy to God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>In a Propenſity to Evil.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, In every Unregenerate Soul, there is a <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all <hi>good:</hi> There is no Spark or ſignature of that priſtine beautiful Image engraven at firſt on the Soul by God; no reliques of Man's primitive Righteouſneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in habit or in act, in inclination or motion, that is ſpiritually good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18 <hi>In my fleſh,</hi> i. e. in my Nature conſidered as corrupted, <hi>there dwells no good thing.</hi> The Soul is depriv'd of it's ancient <hi>Ornaments</hi> and <hi>Furniture;</hi> it is left <hi>poor</hi> without ſpiritual riches, <hi>blind</hi> without ſaving knowledge, <hi>naked</hi> without ſpiritual raiment. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>antipathy</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> his Ways, his People, his Image, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.7. The <hi>carnal mind is enmity to God.</hi> This is evident from the Speech and Practiſe of wicked People, their embittered jeers, and ſatyrical invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God's People. A <hi>Cain</hi> hated an <hi>Abel,</hi> and an <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and an <hi>Bſou</hi> a <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that becauſe of <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. Now this helliſh ſpite is to be found in all natural unregenerate People, till remov'd by the ſupernatural Change, of which I deſign to ſpeak afterwards. I now proceed to the</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Patticular contained in this <hi>depravity;</hi> which is the <hi>Propenſity</hi> that is in all Unconverted People to every Evil. Prov. 22.15. <hi>Focliſhneſsis bound in the heart of a Child.</hi> Indeed there is not an equal propenſity in all, to every Sin; no, for ſome by reaſon of their natural Temperament, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Education, or cuſtom, are inclined to one Sin more than ſome others; yet all Men by Nature are virtually diſpoſed to every Sin; for we are prone to Evil as the Sparks fly upward, <hi>Job</hi> 5.7. Every Sin is form'd in our Nature; they want only time, opportunity, temptation, and the removal of reſtraining Grace, to bring them forth into action.</p>

                  <p>USE. Hence we are informed (I.) of Man's miſerable and deplorable ſtate by Nature, which affords us ſufficient matter for the deepeſt <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and moſt doleful <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation!</hi> It's on this account that we are rendred obnoxious to the vindictive Juſtice of a terrible and holy God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. This it that makes our Lives ſo corrupted, and all our religious Services ſo defective and depraved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This informs us of the abſolute neceſſity of a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Change, of Heart as well as Practice, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fellowſhip and Communion with a holy ſin hating God here, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. or the more full Enjoyment of him in the Life to come. How can there be a ſweet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and full Enjoyment, without <hi>Love?</hi> and how can there be <hi>Love</hi> without <hi>Likeneſs?</hi> and pray what <hi>Likeneſs</hi> or Reſemblance is there between an infinitely <hi>pure God,</hi> and an Unconverted Sinner, who is a very maſs of Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Defilement? How can that <hi>God</hi> who is glorious in Holineſs fix his complacential Love upon that which is the object of his eternal abhorrence? And how can an unrenewed Sinner, who is fill'd with enmity againſt God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. fix his higheſt Love upon one he hates with an implacable hatred. All which conſider'd, complexly ſhews us the abſolute neceſſity of a $univerſal Change. Which naturally leads me to the <hi>ſecond Obſervation,</hi> which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary in order to obtain Eternal Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is evident from the words of our Text, <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> Alſo from Gal. 6.15. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion nor uncircumciſion avails any thing, but the new Creature. Therefore if any Man be in Chriſt Jeſus he is a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, old things are paſs'd away, and all things are become new.</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Rev. 21.27. <hi>And there ſhall in no ways enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither whatſoev$r worketh abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or maketh a lye, but they which are written in the Lamb's book of Life.</hi>

                  <p>As to the <hi>firſt propos'd,</hi> which was to ſhew what <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration</hi> is not. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not what <hi>Nicodemus</hi> groſly conceiv'd, a <hi>re$entry</hi> into the <hi>Womb</hi> of our <hi>Mother.</hi> It is ſurprizing that a Man of ſo polite <hi>Literature,</hi> as we have reaſon to believe <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> was: A <hi>Maſter,</hi> a <hi>Teacher</hi> in <hi>Iſrael!</hi> acquainted with the Law and <hi>Word of God,</hi> where doubtleſs he had read frequently ſuch paſſages as thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26 ſhould have ſuch groſs conceptions of this Work of <hi>God;</hi> but hereby are theſe ſayings of <hi>God</hi> verify'd, 1. Cor 1.21. and 2.14 <hi>For in the wiſdom of God the World by wiſdom knew not God; but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned</hi> Such is the inherent hereditary <hi>Contagion</hi> of our apoſtatiz'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that were we born a thouſand times in a natural way, it woul not <hi>remedy</hi> that <hi>Malady:</hi> This the <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>holy Jeſus</hi> plainly and clearly confirms in the 6th. ver. of our Context, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh. is fl$ſh,</hi> i.e. it is corrupted and contaminated.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears to be a <hi>prodigy</hi> of incomparable <hi>folly</hi> for any to boaſt of and glory in, the grandeur of their Deſcent and Lineage, ſeeing that whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and without outward <hi>Cultivation,</hi> and inward <hi>Renovation,</hi> muſt be the Subjects of indelible miſety. Neither</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is <hi>Regeneration</hi> a change of the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or being of the <hi>Soul: (haec ſemper eadem phiſicae maner)</hi> The Soul is not made new as to it's being or ſubſtance <hi>aut quo ad eſſe phiſicum)</hi> other ways a new Soul muſt be in$$$us'd, which we read not of; but as to it's qualities <hi>(aut quo ad eſſe morale)</hi> new qualities or principles of Action are infus'd into the Soul by <hi>God,</hi> by which it is inclin'd, and ſway'd after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, and to another ſcope, than formerly. Some do talk ſtrangely of this affair, that the ſubſtance of the <hi>Soul</hi> is chang'd, as <hi>Flaccus Fliricus, Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> and others, "that People are Goded into God, and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "into Chriſt, as their Expreſſions <hi>Theopoiein Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiein</hi> import. It's true, the Scripture calls this gracious <hi>Change,</hi> a participation of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. But this is only to ſhew (1) the <hi>reality</hi> and fixedneſs of this work of Grace, that it is no notion or fancy, but a ſolid reality. (2) the <hi>reſemblance</hi> it bears to the Divine <hi>Perfections.</hi> Such Perſons are renew'd after God's <hi>Image</hi> In Knowledge, Righteouſeſs, and Holineſs; they have a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003967_0249_10037A03F105E188"/>divine temper and diſpoſition of Soul; the principal <hi>by as</hi> of their Hearts is towards God and his Service. But tho' they are thus born <hi>after God</hi> and <hi>of God,</hi> yet they are not thereby made <hi>God.</hi> That which is by way of <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>eſſence</hi> in him, is only by way of <hi>accident</hi> in us. Neither</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doth it conſiſt in an <hi>outward Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Ways. The <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> had large <hi>Lamps,</hi> but no <hi>Oyl,</hi> Matth. 25. A Man may be reform'd from Paganiſm or Popery, to the Profeſſion of true Chriſtianity, and yet be a ſtranger to this <hi>Work</hi> of God. Nor</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the enjoyment of <hi>outward Priviledges;</hi> ſuch as Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, and others of the like nature. The <hi>Jews</hi> of old depended upon theſe outward Priviledges and Prerogatives, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. And ſo do many of the <hi>Goſpellized</hi> World now; but the divinely inſipi$ed <hi>Jeremiah</hi> pungently inculcates the invalidity of outward Ordinances, without the thing ſignifyed by them, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bliſs and glory; therefore he puts the circumcis'd Jews, who were uncircumcis'd in Heat, in a <hi>paralel Caſe</hi> Yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf had a Controverſy with the <hi>Jews</hi> upon the ſame account, he endeavoured to deſtroy their fond hopes of Heaven grounded upon their outward Priviledges, and for his plain dealing he receiv'd abuſive treatment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> very plainly ſheweth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of theſe things without an inward <hi>renovation,</hi> Gal. 6.15. Neither</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Doth it conſiſt in an <hi>external conformity</hi> to the <hi>Law of God:</hi> For this is ſomething inward, the Workmanſhip of God in the Heart. A Man may pray, read, hear outwardly, keep the Sabbath, be faithful to his Word, and juſt in his Dealings, and yet be a ſtranger to this Work of God in the Soul: For ſuch were ſome of the Phariſees of old, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.20. and yet our aſcended <hi>Lord and Saviour</hi> poſitively avers, that <hi>unleſs our Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, we ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.20.

                  <p n="6">6. In a <hi>reſtraint</hi> of the <hi>Old Man.</hi> God <hi>reſtrains</hi> many whom he never <hi>renews:</hi> So he did <hi>Abimelech</hi> a <hi>Heathen,,</hi> Gen 20.6. One that is not renew'd may avoid groſs ſins, through fear, ſhame, or the abſence of opportunities, and temptations; or through the influence of Nature's light, the Precepts of Morality, the Doctrines of the Goſpel, and the Cill Laws of the Land. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of ſome that had <hi>eſcap'd the Pollutions of the World through

Reſtraining Grace keeps only from the outward <hi>acts</hi> of Sin, through ſlaviſh fear, or ſome ſelfiſh motives; but ſaving Grace ſubdues Sin at the <hi>root,</hi> and raiſes an irreconcileable hatred in the Soul againſt it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.

                  <p n="1">1. More <hi>generally,</hi> it may be ſaid to be a <hi>reſtauration</hi> of God's defaced <hi>Image</hi> in Man, to ſome degree of it's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>luſtre.</hi> Our firſt Parents were made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God's Image, in <hi>Knowledge, Righteouſneſs</hi> and true <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> with <hi>dominion</hi> over the <hi>Creatures,</hi> Eccl. 7.29. Gen. 1.27. Pſal. 8.5. This Image of God conſiſted in a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>rectitude</hi> of the whole Soul, with all its Faculties, Powers and Affections; the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> being the guide and governour of the Soul's Faculties, had clear Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind and will of <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> was ſubject to the Underſtanding's directions, having an inherent inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to will that which the Mind by it's native light, ſhew'd
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003967_0252_10037A09E2B81790"/>to be good. The whole train of <hi>Paſſions</hi> freely follow'd the guidance of theſe ſuperiour Powers, without the leaſt <hi>reluctance:</hi> Thus there was a univerſal <hi>harmony</hi> at firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Soul's Faculties eſtabliſh'd by the God of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but Sin has introduced a confuſion and <hi>Chaos</hi> among theſe Faculties, it has darkened the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> rendred the <hi>Will</hi> obſtinate, and miſplac'd the <hi>Affections</hi> upon dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite <hi>Objects,</hi> hardned the <hi>Heart,</hi> ſtupified the <hi>Conſcience:</hi> Now the blind Will which was before a <hi>Subject,</hi> uſurps the <hi>Empire,</hi> and hurries the other Powers to a compliance, with its inordinate <hi>dictantes.</hi> Now <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is a <hi>renewing</hi> that gracious <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in us which we have loſt; for by it the blind Underſtanding is in ſome meaſure <hi>enlightened,</hi> Act. 26.18. the ſtony Heart <hi>mollify'd,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. the diſordered Affections <hi>rectify'd</hi> and <hi>fix'd</hi> upon the moſt ſuitable and noble <hi>Objects, God</hi> himſelf as their <hi>chief Good</hi> and <hi>laſt End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more particularly,</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Law Work</hi> generally preceeds this <hi>Change:</hi> Hence the <hi>Law is ſaid to be a Schoolmaſter to load us to Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.24. which I apprehend is wrought in the following manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>diſcovery</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> which the Lord effects by the Law and by the Spirit. Rom. 7.7. <hi>I had not known Sin, but by the Law.</hi> Before this Chriſtleſs Sinners are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, like <hi>Peter</hi> ſleeping in this Chains, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6. The Spirit of God concurs with the Law. This is one of his firſt Works with Unconverted Sinners; as is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. Before he convinces them of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> he convinces them of <hi>Sin;</hi> their Eyes are opened, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. Now they ſee Sin in its loathſome nature, deplorable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and dreadful conſequences; they begin to ſee the <hi>holineſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the ſpiritual <hi>latitude</hi> of his <hi>Law,</hi> and their own corrupt nature; then are they apt to cry out, Who can ſtand before this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>dreadful God!</hi> Now, tho' this diſcovery of Sin begins at a <hi>particular Evil,</hi> as with the <hi>Jews,</hi> Act 2.37. yet is proceeds to <hi>more;</hi> as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> was led to divers parts of the <hi>Temple to ſee greater and greater abominations,</hi> Ezek. 8.6—12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>application</hi> of the <hi>meric</hi> of <hi>Sin:</hi> God convinces the Sinner that all the threatnings belong to him; yea he particularly applits them to himſelf, as <hi>Nathan</hi> his parabolical Diſcourſe to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7. <hi>I am the man,</hi> that theſe Curſes are directed againſt: He hears his Condemnation founded by the Trumpet of the Word; he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003967_0253_10037A0D326B45B8"/>lees and feels that he is in the utmoſt diſtreſs, environed with dangers, and can at preſent ſee no way of eſcape o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. He is in the caſe of the afflicted pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the Red Sea, <hi>Exod</hi> 14.14, 15. This is that <hi>Spirit of Bondage to ſear,</hi> which ordinarily preceeds the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Compunction,</hi> or ſharp anguiſh for <hi>Sin.</hi> The fight of Sin and Wrath wound the Soul, as tho' it were ſtab'd with a Sword, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. They have ſuch acute Pains as if a ſharp Spear lanc'd their Hearts: it's elſewhere call'd the <hi>rending of the Heart,</hi> Joel 2.13. When we are greatly griev'd in Soul for Sin, ſo that it even cuts us to the Heart to think how we have <hi>diſhonoured</hi> God, and <hi>diſparag'd</hi> our ſelves by it; when we conceive an everſion to Sin, and earneſtly deſire and endeavour to get clear of the principles of it, and never to return to the practiſe of it, then we rend our Hearts for it, and then will God rend the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and come down to us with Mercy. Alſo this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction I am treating of is called breaking up of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law Ground, Jer 4.3. <hi>Break up your ſallow ground, and ſow not among therns:</hi> Which repreſents both the neceſſity and difficulty of it. <q>An unconvinced Heart, ſays one, is like <g ref="char:startq">“</g>fallow Ground, until'd, unfenc'd, unfruitful of any thing beſides Thorns, which is the natural produce of the Soil; which we are bound to get plow'd up by the Word of God, <hi>H$b</hi> 4.12. otherwiſe they will choke our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>and blaſt our hopes.</q> 
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11.

                  <p>Again, Regeneration hath ſuch a relation to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is indeed a part and beginning of it. <hi>Gratia eſt autora Gloriae; Grace</hi> is the very <hi>dawn</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>duration,</hi> from the happineſs of Heaven. <q>The truth is (ſaith <hi>Stanhope</hi>) God in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <g ref="char:startq">“</g>hath ſo ordered the matter, ſo admirably contriv'd our Nature and our Duty, that Virtue and Happineſs, Grace and Glory are one and the ſame thing, differing only in the Circumſtances and ſeveral Proſpects we view them under.

                  <p>Pray conſider ſeriouſly that precious, but awful place of holy Scripture, <hi>Gal</hi> 6.15.

Circumciſion was certainly and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God's own Appointment, a Seal of the Covenant between <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> Rom. 4.11.

Yet the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms thoſe who thought they were bound to obſerve it, that without an internal Change theſe ſuppos'd Priviledges would avail nothing, and by a parity of reaſon (as Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> juſtly obſerves) <q>he muſt be interpreted to ſpeak <g ref="char:startq">“</g>to us, that our Sacramental Waſhing in Baptiſm, our Spiritual Gifts and Endowments, our profound Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Learning, our obſervation of the Ordinances of Chriſt, and our outward acts of religious Worſhip, will all avail us nothing unleſs we have a new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple implanted in us, ſuch as influences our Lives, and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>produces evangelical Obedience.</q>

                  <p>Now the firſt Property of <hi>Regeneration</hi> is <hi>Divine Life.</hi> As <hi>natural Life</hi> is the natural product of <hi>Generation,</hi> ſo is a <hi>ſpiritual Life,</hi> of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> Gal. 2.20. 2 Cor. 4.10. Now this Divine <hi>Life,</hi> has theſe following <hi>Properties,</hi> by which it may be known <hi>analogous</hi> or agreable to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of a natural <hi>Life.</hi>

Thus it is with the <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. As new born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word: Some render the original Words <hi>(Logicon gala) rational Milk,</hi> ſuch as is fit for the nouriſhment, not of the <hi>Body,</hi> but of the <hi>Mind:</hi> A true Convert deſires the ſincere Milk, the pure Word of God, not blended or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with adulterating, depraving, and debaſing mixtures.

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003967_0265_10037A3412F58FB8"/>Food ſuited to it's nature, without which it can't ſubſiſt: Now as the natural man chiefly longs after the enjoyments of this World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. ſo does the new born Perſon after Heavenly Enjoyments. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Senſe.</hi> As a natural Life feels what oppoſeth it, graples with its Enermy, and if ſtronger, proves victorious: ſo it is eminently in the divine Life, which having ſuch ſupernatural Aſſiſtances, proves too hard for its Opponents. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, 18 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Growth.</hi> It's natural for Children to grow faſt, if ſome uncommon accident don't prevent it, and that not in the <hi>Head</hi> only, for indeed ſuch are diſtempered with the Rickets, but in all other <hi>Part proportionably;</hi> ſo do Babes in Chriſt grow faſt, if not diſtempered, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. and that not only in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but in <hi>Faith, Love, Holineſs.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18 1 Cor. 13.11. <hi>When I was a Child I ſpake as a Child, I thought as a Child, when I grew a Man, I put away childiſh things.</hi> So it is with the growing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. they put away Childiſh things; and this among the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> entertaining a fond imagination, that he ſhall be always <hi>dandled</hi> on his <hi>Father's Knee,</hi> or in his <hi>Lord's Lap,</hi> or always <hi>embrac'd</hi> in his <hi>Husband's Arms:</hi> When he was but a Babe in Jeſus, he was apt to conclude his Father had quite abandon'd him, if he loſt ſight of his Face but for a little, if he wanted the ſweet ſenſe of his Love he was peviſh and dejected; but now he knows better, that he is no to live by <hi>Senſe</hi> but by <hi>Faith,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Tho' he retains ſtill an earneſt deſire after Communion with God, yet it is more diſcreet believing and ſubmiſſive; and when they can't perceive any growth in themſelves after ſome time, they grieve and mourn. A Child of God not only weeps at his birth afterwards. Mr. <hi>Burkett</hi> has a very good Obſervation upon this, <q>that as natural Children <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

We may juſtly reckon thoſe graceleſs, and unrenewed Perſons, who do not earneſtly <hi>long</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> after <hi>growth,</hi> or mourn not for their little proficiency. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. They that are contented with ſtinted meaſures of ſuppoſed Grace, in reality have no ſaving Grace at all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Mation.</hi> This is an inſeperable property of a natural Life, <hi>Act</hi> 17.28. When we ſee anything ſtand <hi>ſtock ſtill</hi> for a conſiderable time without the leaſt <hi>motion,</hi> we know it is <hi>dead;</hi> e. g. when we obſerve a Statue void of motion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003967_0266_10037A37673D6130"/>with its Eyes fixed, for ſome ſpace of time, we are ſoon convinc'd for all its <hi>fair face,</hi> that it has <hi>no Life;</hi> ſo when we behold Profeſſors of Chriſtianity having but an empty <hi>form,</hi> without the powerful and progreſſive <hi>practice</hi> of Piety, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.

                  <p n="4">4. Late <hi>Repentance</hi> is ſeldom true and genuine.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Penman of this ſacred Epiſtle has been concluded by the univerſal Suffrage of the ancient Churches, to be the Apoſtle <hi>John;</hi> the amiable Signatures of his divine and calm Spirit breathes and glides through all it's golden Veins.</p>
                  <p>There is ſome Difference of Opinion concerning the Time wherein he wrote it; ſome aſcribing it to an earlier, ſome to a later Date; but the moſt reaſonable Conjecture is, that it was wrote a little before that awful Cataſtrophe was brought on the jewiſh Church and State, which the equal Retribution of their in$andous Obſtinacy. This Conjecture is grounded on the Apoſtle's ſpeaking of the laſt Times being at hand, which is generally underſtood to be the concluding Periods of the jewiſh State.</p>
                  <p>The general Scope and main Deſign of this ſacred Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was to confirm the parthian Jews (to whom it was wrote) in all the main Truths of Chriſtianity, both ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and practical: Particulary, in the Belief of our
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003967_0303_10035FD4F4F8E9C0"/>Lord Jeſus as being the promiſed <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and alſo, in the Neceſſity of internal and external Holineſs, againſt the impregnated and inpious Efforts of apoſtate quondam Profeſſors, particularly, the infamous Gnoſticks, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Brood of that grand Impoſtor, <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence this Apoſtle takes occaſion in divers Parts of this Epiſtle to excite Chriſtians to the Exerciſe of mutual Love, by a Variety of pregnant and pungent Arguments, as the neceſſary Bull warks to ſcreen them from the ſtrong and virulent Arreſts of infectious Seducers. Love is the Cement which unites Strength, and is not <hi>unita Vis ſortior?</hi> The Want of this is the Bane of Society, and expoſes them to the ravening Depredations of common Enemies. Surely there is a moſt cogent Motive of Love, in our Text, both to God our mighty Maker, and to Man our Fellow-Creature. <hi>Behold, what Manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle having in the foregoing Chapter and laſt Verſe, mentioned that great and neceſſary Qualification, <hi>being born of God,</hi> takes occaſion in the beginning of this, to celebrate with Wonder and divine Tranſport, it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Privilege, <hi>Adoption. Behold, what Manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Words are theſe <hi>four</hi> general Heads,
<list>
                        <item>1. A gret and honourable Gift bequeathed, <hi>that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The Donor of this ſpecified, <hi>The Father.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. The Donee, or Perſons upon whom this Gift was beſtowed and diſcovered, <hi>upon us:</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. The fontal or impulſive Cauſe of this, mentioned.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us a little explain theſe Particulars in the Order propoſed.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt general Head, <hi>Hath beſtowed,—that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> Here are two Things remarkable.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The Privilege conferred.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The Manner of conferring it.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The Privilege conferred, <hi>called the Sons of God. Ina teena the$u $lethomen. Tecna a ticlo, pario, &amp; ginomi, naſ$er. Eraſmus</hi> and ſome others render the Word <hi>tecna,</hi> according to our Tranſlation; but <hi>Theodor, Beza,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſor</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:003967_0304_1003630E06428DE8"/>think it is a larger Extent, and ſignefies <hi>Offſpring, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Scholes,</hi> a general Word that imports Offſpring, or Sons of every Age, Sex, Degree, in which Senſe I rather take the Word. <hi>Gl$thomen, a caleo, voco.</hi> This Word is not here inſerted with any Antiphraſis, Contradiction to, or Oppoſition of the Thing ſpoken of, in Reality. It is not an empty Name, or vain Title, no, no; but the bleſſed Privilege it ſelf is here aſſerted together with this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Badge and Epithet, as it's neceſſary Conſequent or Effect, by a Metonomy of the Conſequent or Antecedent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.13. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 19.46. <hi>Clethomen, called:</hi> This Word excellently holds forth the Nature and Dignity of <hi>Adoption.</hi> (1.) <hi>The Nature of it.</hi> That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a forenſick Declaration; and ſo is diſtinguiſh'd from natural Sonſhip. (2.) It's <hi>Excellency and Dignity.</hi> That this precious Privilege is not kept hid or latent, but declared and made manifeſt, not only in the Mind of God, but in the Conſcience of Believers. It eclipſes the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Goodneſs of Benefits when we know them not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Manner of conferring this Benefit, <hi>hath beſtowed. Dedocen, a doc, doſa, dedoca.</hi> There is no Difficulty that I know of in the Word; it ſhews with more than oriental Splendor, the admirable Freedom of God's Bounty in our Adoption, and cuts the Sinews of Merit. It's a Gift, no Debt; we have neither Wiſdom nor Dignity to procure ſo ineſtimable a Benefit. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond general Head concerns <hi>the Author or Donor of this Benefit; The Father; Ho Pater.</hi> A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Article is prefixed, emphatically ſhowing the glorious Dignity and matchleſs Greatneſs of the ſublime Donor. <hi>Pater, a Pao, paſco, quia Pater paſco liberos, velut Paſtor paſcit Oves.</hi> The whole Trinity doubtleſs is intended by this; for all thoſe ſacred Perſons act a Part in this glorious Work: But more particularly and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the firſt Perſon, God the Father, called ſo, not only for the eternal Generation of his Son, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.7. But alſo for the Adoption of his People, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. becauſe from him the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Head concerns <hi>the Donce, or Perſons upon whom this Privilege is beſtowed. Hemin, upon us.</hi> Not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all and ſingular, not upon any one or every one, but <hi>upon us,</hi> Believers excluſively, who have been effectually called, converted from Sin, and united to Jeſus, in which is the Foundation of Adoption.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:003967_0305_10037C95C6206F88"/>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth general Head, <hi>The fontal or impulſive Cauſe, Love,</hi> called in the Original <hi>Agape,</hi> either <hi>ab agan poiein, multum facere,</hi> doing much; becauſe it is effectual and operative. <hi>Vel ab agan cata pan</hi> Becauſe Love moves it ſelf every Way towards it's beloved Object. <hi>Vel ab agan paueſthai</hi> Becauſe the Lover reſts in the Object he loves Or, <hi>ab agan pao,</hi> to love much. And thus it is eminently in the Cauſe before us. Had not the bleſſed Lord loved much, would he ever have taken a ſinning Creature into ſo near a Relation to himſelf, as to have the Privilege not only of being the Servants of God, which is a great Honour, but the Friends of God, as was <hi>Abraham,</hi> which his much more? But to be the Sons and Children of God, is doubtleſs, the Flower of Mercy, the Crown and Garland of divine Love; ſo that Love here, ſurely ſignifies a vehement Affection to the Beloved, not only a generous Purpoſe of doing Good, but the actual Completion of it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Love of God is in general twofold, <hi>Immanent</hi> and <hi>Tranſient,</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. God's <hi>immanent Love</hi> is that perfect Property of God, whereby he is inclined to love <hi>himſelf.</hi> This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is terminated on no Creature, and is nothing elſe but God's pure and perfect Eſſence. This is not the Love ſpecified in our Text.</item>
                        <item>2. God's <hi>tranſient Love</hi> is that Property or Attribute of God, whereby he is inclined to love <hi>his Creatures,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good Pleaſure of his Will. And this Love is threefold, viz. Of Benevolence, Beneficence and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> is God's good Purpoſe <hi>before Time,</hi> of doing his People good <hi>in Time.</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, that we ſhould be holy and without Blame before him in Love.</hi> Eph. 2.10 <hi>For we are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God's Love of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> in his actual doing of them good <hi>in Time,</hi> according to his gracious Deſign from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Therefore they are ſaid to be called according to his Purpoſe. The great Jehovah in all his Dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his People in Time, acts according to the Pattern that was in his mind from Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God's Love of Complacence</hi> is that whereby <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Work$ $f his own Spirit wrounght in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003967_0306_10035D197104F728"/>Cant.</hi> 4. Theſe three laſt I take to be the Love meant in our Text. We find this fourth general Head uſhered in with a double Emphaſis, viz. A Note of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Note of Admiration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Note of <hi>Attention. Idete, behold, ab eido, video,</hi> to ſee, to lift up the Eyes of the Mind to behold a Thing more accurately and intenſely, as we lift up the Eyes of the Body to behold any remarkable Object that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs. This Note of Attention is uſed in a fourfold Scope.
<list>
                        <item>(1.) To awaken the Attention. Iſai. 65.1. <hi>I ſaid, Behold me, behold me, to a Nation that was not called by my Name.</hi> The univerſal Depravation of our deplorable Natures rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers us totally averſe to good; ſo that ſuch ſhocking Memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's are moſt neceſſary for us, to rouſe us from our lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Drouſe.</item>
                        <item>(2.) To excite <hi>Admiration,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſome new and admirable Thing, <hi>Iſai</hi> 7.14. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bring forth a Son,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>(3.) To ſhow the <hi>Certainty</hi> of a Thing ſpoken, Rev. 1.7. <hi>Behold, be cometh with Clouds, and every Eye ſhall ſee him.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>(4.) To ſhow the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a Thing, John 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Note of <hi>Admiration. What Manner of Love; pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> this Word is uſed both to denote the Quantity and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Thing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.27. It is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, what Kind, what Sort of Love is this? Surprizing, amazing Love! There is a vehement Emphaſis in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, of Aſtoniſhment and Tranſport. Hereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly ſhows, that the Love of God is exceedingly apparent, &amp; marvellouſly manifeſted in <hi>Adoption.</hi> What! For an alſufficient, ſelf ſufficient, independent Jehovah, to adopt a <hi>Stranger</hi> into his <hi>Family,</hi> a <hi>Rebel</hi> into his <hi>Boſom?</hi> Is it not ſtupendous, tranſporting Love? This is propoſed by Way of Interrogation or Queſtion, but implies a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Aſſertion. It is as if the Apoſtle feeling himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to comprehead this immeaſurable Ocean of divine Love, addreſſed himſelf to Believers in a kind of Amaze, and ſaid, Do you your ſelves ſpeak or judge if you can, what kink of Love this is? It is deep, I cannot fathom finite Love, well becoming the infinitely glorious Majeſty from whom it flows. <hi>Behold, what Manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:003967_0307_10037C97D8CF6508"/>
                  <p>From the Words, thus explained we obſerve, <hi>That the ſuperlative Love of God is tranſiendently diſplayed in the adopting Strangers into his Family, and giving them the Privileges of Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In treating upon this Obſervation, I would endeavour by divine Aſſiſtance, to ſpeak to theſe three Particulars, viz.
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Explain the Nature and Kinds of Adoption.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Show the Prerogatives and conſequent Privileges which flow from it.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Show how exceedingly the Love of God is diſplayed in it.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Shall endeavour to improve it (if God will) <hi>to our Edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt propoſed. I conceive <hi>Adoption</hi> may be thus deſcribed, that it is a gracious Declaration of the bleſſed God, whereby he admits and receives thoſe who were by Nature Strangers and Enemies in Heart and Life to his Majeſty; but now, through Grace are effectually called, juſtified, regenerated and united to Chriſt, into his Family as Sons, and communicates to them the Privileges of Children.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall endeavour to explain the ſeveral Parts of this Deſcription. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Adoption is a Declaration.</hi> So ſays our Text, <hi>called the Sons of God.</hi> This Declaration is expreſſed four Ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By <hi>eternal Election,</hi> or that everlaſting Purpoſe in the divine Mind, Eph. 1.5. <hi>He having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children.</hi> In this Reſpect, the Elect before their Converſion (by a certain Figure of Speech, Prolepſis) <hi>are called the Children of God,</hi> John 11.52.</item>
                     <item>2. By <hi>Redemption in Jeſus,</hi> with whom they are united, Gal. 3.26. <hi>For ye are all the Children of God, by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. By the <hi>Goſpel, and it's copious precious Promiſes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Believers have aſcribed to them that ample Dignity of Sonſhip, John 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. In their <hi>own Spirits,</hi> or Conſciences.

It is a Father's Property to have Children; hence that memorable Saying of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> Chap 3.15 <hi>Of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named.</hi> But it is alſo aſcribed to the Son to have Children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10.

                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>merciful and gracious Declaration;</hi> flowing freely from the unmerited Goodneſs and ſuperlative Love of an infinite JAH, without the leaſt Regard to the Creatures Deſert. The intrinſick, impulſive Cauſe, is the peerleſs Bounty and inexpreſſible Love of God, as our Text plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voucheth.

Our Jeſus aſſumed humane Nature in an hypoſtatical Union with the Divine, and ſubjected himſelf, as Man, to the Law he made as God, that we might obtain the Adoption of Children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>But when the Fulneſs of Time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>Manner of our Adoption</hi> is (1.) By <hi>Regeneration,</hi> whereby we are made Partakers of the divine Nature; not in it's <hi>Eſſence;</hi> but gracious <hi>Qualities,</hi> Juſtice, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. and receive Principles of divine Life to enable us to live to God.

                  <p n="9">9. The <hi>Terms of our Adoption.</hi> We are brought from Darkneſs, and the Dominion of Sin and Satan, into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the bleſſed God, and made houſhold Friends and Children.

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. There be <hi>two Kinds of Adoption,</hi> divine and humane. The firſt we have in ſome Sort treated of. The ſecond, viz. <hi>Humane</hi> Adoption, may be deſcribed thus, to be <hi>an Act of Love</hi> or <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> ordinarily ariſing from the Want of Children, whereby a Perſon admits an Alien or Stranger into his Family, and communicates to him a Right to his Goods or Eſtate, to be enjoyed by him after his Deceaſe. In this brief Deſcription, we may gather the main Differences between a divine and humane Adoption.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They differ in their <hi>Surce</hi> and <hi>Original.</hi> A humane Adoption is generally occaſioned by the Defect of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:003967_0310_10037CA1EF3426F8"/>Offſpring; but the Divine flows from the Abundance of God's Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Perſons <hi>adopted.</hi> In humane Adoption they are Strangers, or ſuch as have no Right to Adoption; but in the Divine, though by Nature they are Strangers and Aliens, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. yet through Grace they are called and juſtified, and conſequently, have a Right to the bleſſed Inheritance, even before the adopting Act.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They differ in <hi>their Nature.</hi> The Humane being but an external Denomination and Bequeathment of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Goods; whereas the Divine conſiſts in a real Act of Jehovah, whereby he confers on his People ſpiritual. <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the very <hi>Tranſcript</hi> of his own <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Humane confers the Inheritance to the adopted, after the Adopter's <hi>Death;</hi> but the Divine confers it while both <hi>ſurvive.</hi> But I proceed to the</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Propoſed, which was to ſhow the <hi>Prerogatives and conſequent Privileges of Adoption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not here eſſay to enumerate all and ſingular of them, only the more <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>ſpecial.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>honourable and amiable Denomination</hi> is one of the Privileges of Adoption. <hi>They ſhall be called the Sons of God,</hi> John 1.12. As thoſe who are humanely adopted, in a civil Senſe, bear Name of their adopting Father; ſo thoſe that are ſpiritually or divinely adopted, bear the Name of their celeſtial Father, as our Text teſtifies. Jeſus is their elder Brother, they are not only called Friends, but Children. This is not an empty Name, but the Thing named is, in ſome Meaſure, conferred, viz. The Image of God, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Dominion over</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſion of</hi> the Creatures; in as much as God not only created them for them, but hath given them a Right to them. In Chriſt all Things are ours, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. Many earthly Things are properly and proximately in our Power, many thought at a Diſtance, ſerve us; the Sun, Moon and Stars, yea, the angelick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, thoſe <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> above, <hi>ſerve Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Pſalm</hi> 34.7. Even <hi>penal Evils,</hi> through the <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Guidance</hi> of <hi>divine Providence,</hi> promote their <hi>Good.</hi> They have the free (but lawful) Uſe of all terrene En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. <hi>To the Pure all Things are pure,</hi> Tit. 1.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Son of God by a Communion of his prophetical, ſacerdotal, and regal Dignity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth Privilege of Adoption, is <hi>chriſtian Liberty.</hi> A temporal Son in a Family hath a Freedom abovea Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:003967_0311_10037CA6770B2020"/>Jeſus hath purchaſed a ſpiritual Freedom for his Children, at the Coſt of his deareſt Blood, <hi>Gab. 5.1.</hi> which contains theſe things,
<list>
                        <item>1. A <hi>Freedom from the Guilt of Sin;</hi> obtained by Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, confirmed and applied by Adoption.</item>
                        <item>2. A <hi>Freedom from the Dominion of Sin,</hi> by Sanctifice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>From the Condemanation of the maral Law,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>From the Yoke of the ceremnial Law,</hi> which was nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt's Croſs.</item>
                        <item>5. <hi>From humane Traditions and Inſtitutios in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> Col. 2.20, 21, 22,</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another Privilege is. the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> to which is oppoſed the <hi>Spirit of Bondage, Rom</hi> 8.15. Now this Spirit of Adoption hath a twofold Operation.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To <hi>aſcertain</hi> us of our <hi>Sonſhip.</hi> Hence it is ſaid <hi>that the Spirit teſtifies with our Spirit,</hi> or Conſcience, <hi>that we are the Sons of God.</hi> And this the Spirit effectuates theſe three Ways,

We read of the <hi>ſealing</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſure, the <hi>Seal</hi> leaves it's <hi>Signature.</hi> I know that ſome Divines, of no ſmall Figure, oppoſe this. I ſhall not aſſume the Arrogance to tarniſh the <hi>Character</hi> of thoſe great Men, only, I would venture to ſay, that I believe many incline to <hi>ſpeak</hi> &amp; <hi>write</hi> as it ſuits their own <hi>Experience</hi> beſt.

                     <item>2.

                           <g ref="char:endq">”</g>not ſuffer their Servants to call Father,</q> but God ſuffers his Children, in all their <hi>Preſſures</hi> and <hi>Diffi ulties,</hi> yea, in all their <hi>ſolemn Approaches,</hi> to claim this filial Relation to himſelf.

                  <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>Price of our Adoption. It was not purchaſed with Silver of Gold, but with the precious Blood of the Son of God, as of a Lamb without Spot.</hi> Not with a great Sum of Money, which the chief Captain purchaſed his Freedom with, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.28. Nor with Abundance of Foreskins of the Philiſtines, whereby <hi>David</hi> purchaſed his Sounſhip from the King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.27. No. The <hi>Son</hi> of God muſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend</hi> from the <hi>Boſom</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and aſſume the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and have his <hi>Glory vailed</hi> in a <hi>Mantle</hi> of <hi>Fleſh.

                     <p>USE 1. This Truth we have inſiſted on may ſerve for a Uſe of <hi>Admiration:</hi> This ſeems to be the Uſe the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himſelf makes of it. It was meer Condeſcenſion in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter to preſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> an innocent Babe and a Stranger from periſhing by Water: But, O how much greater Kindneſs was it in almighty God, to ſave guilty wretched Man from periſhing by eternal Flames, and to take a Rebel into his Boſom!

What may we ſay of God's taking ſinful Man into his Family, and giving them the <hi>Privileges</hi> of his <hi>Children?</hi> May we not ſay with the Prodigal, <hi>Lord we are not worthy to be called to thy Children?</hi> From that, to what, has God brought Believers? From what a <hi>deep Degree of extreme Miſery,</hi> to what a <hi>Height</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Glory?</hi> O! let us call to Admitation our Souls, and all that is within us at this bleſſed Love, this free and undeſerved Love, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching and everlaſting Love. Did the <hi>Angels</hi> wonder when they brought the happy Tidings of this Love to the World, did they look with Admitation into theſe Things, and will not <hi>our Souls?</hi> Shall <hi>Sheba's</hi> Queen wonder at the <hi>Splendor</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Solomon's Court,</hi> and ſhall not we wonder at the <hi>Privileges here conſerred!</hi> What! to be brought freely from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> from the <hi>beſeſt Slavery</hi> to the moſt <hi>honourable Liverty,</hi> from being <hi>Heirs of Hell</hi> to be <hi>Heirs of Heaven,</hi> from being <hi>Children of Satan</hi> to be <hi>Children of God,</hi> to have <hi>Familiarity</hi> and <hi>Child-like Boldneſs</hi> with the higheſt. <hi>Wonder O Heavens, and be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed O Earth at this!</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Effectual Calling.</hi> (1.) Have we heard and obeyed God's <hi>Calls</hi> by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit?</hi> (2.)

                     <p n="2">2. Some are Concomitants of Adoption, and ſome follow after it As (1) <hi>Child-like Love.</hi> (2.) <hi>Child like Fear</hi> and Reverence to God, as a Father, Mal. 1.6. <hi>A Son ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſier.</hi> (3.) <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Boldneſs</hi> and <hi>Acceſs to God,</hi> as <hi>a Father,</hi> Crying, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15.

                     <p>USE 3. Of <hi>Comfort to the Children of God.</hi> Look to the great Privileges God has given you by Adoption. (1) Your <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>changed.</hi> You have the <hi>new Name,</hi> and

You are through Grace, brought to a happy State, <hi>born of God, made Partakers of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made Kings and Prieſts to God,</hi> Rev. 1.6. <hi>Privatively,</hi> ye are freed from the Guilt and Power of Sin <hi>Piſitively,</hi> ye are made Partakers of all Things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. <hi>All Things ſhall Work for your Good,</hi> Rom. 8.28. God hath a fatherly Care over your Souls, he bleſſeth you with all ſpiritual Bleſſings, he will not let Sin rule over you, yea, he bares your Offences as a Father his Child, <hi>Mab.</hi> 3.17. He will <hi>comfort</hi> you in your <hi>Straits, inſtruct</hi> you in your Bodies, your <hi>Bread and your Water is ſure.</hi> He that <hi>hears</hi> the <hi>Ravens,</hi> and <hi>cloaths</hi> the <hi>Lillies</hi> will not be <hi>deaf</hi> to your <hi>Cries</hi> If the Lord afflicts you he doth it nor willingly from his Heart, but as a tender Father, that you may not periſh with the World, who are fed for the Slaughter, and whoſe Tables are their Snares. He pities his Lambs in Affliction, and hears their Sighs and Groans. Pſalm 103.13. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi> He gives you an Intereſt in a Crown that ſhall never fade away. May not then the Children of God rejoyce in their <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>bountiful Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
