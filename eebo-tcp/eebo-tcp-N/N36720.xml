            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I WAS born within ten miles of the town of Aberdeen, in the north of Scotland; of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table parents; at eight years of age, being a ſturdy boy, I was taken notice of by two fellows belonging to a veſſel, employed (as the trade then was) by ſome of the worthy merchants of Aberdeen, in that villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and execrable practice, of ſtealing young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their parents, and ſelling them as ſlaves in the plantations abroad, and on board the ſhip eaſily cajoled by them, where I was conducted between decks, to ſome others they had kidnapped in the ſame manner, and in about a month's time ſet ſail for America. When arrived at Philadelphia the Captain ſold us at about ſixteen pounds per head. What became of my unhappy companions I never knew; but it was my lot to be ſold for ſeven years, to one of my countrymen, who had in his youth been kidnapped like myſelf, but from another town.</p>
            <p>Having no children of his own, and commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my condition, he took care of me, indulged me in going to ſchool, where I went every winter for five years, and made a tolerable proficiency. With this good maſter, I continued till he died, and, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my faithful ſervice, he left me two hundred pounds currency, which was then about an hundred and twenty pounds ſterling, his beſt horſe, ſaddle, and all his wearing apparel.</p>
            <p>Being now ſeventeen years old, and my own maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having money in my pocket; and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, I employed myſelf in jobbing for near ſeven years; when I reſolved to ſettle, and married the daughter of a ſubſtantial planter. My father-in-law made me a deed of gift of a tract of land that lay (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily for me, as it has ſince proved) on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the province of Pennſylvania, near the forks of Delaware, containing about two hundred acres, thirty of which were well cleared and fit for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:048027_0003_1024DC96C230E1F0"/>
uſe, on which were a good houſe and barn. This pleaſing me well, I ſettled on it, My money I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in buying ſtock, houſhold furniture, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements for out of door work; and being happy in a good wife, my felicity was compleat: but in 1754, the Indians, who had for a long time before ravaged and deſtroyed other parts of America unmoleſted, began now to be very troubleſome on the frontiers of our province, where they generally appeared in ſmall ſkulking parties, committing great devaſtations.</p>
            <p>Terrible and ſhocking to human nature were the barbarities daily committed by theſe ſavages! Scarce did a day paſs but ſome unhappy family or other fell victims to ſavage cruelty. Terrible, indeed, it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, as well as to many others; I that was now happy in an eaſy ſtate of life, bleſſed with an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate and tender wife, became on a ſudden one of the moſt unhappy of mankind: ſcarce can I ſuſtain the ſhock which forever recurs on recollecting the fatal ſecond of October, 1754. My wife that day went from home to viſit ſome of her relations; as I ſtaid up later than uſual, expecting her return, none being in the houſe beſides myſelf, how great was my ſurprize and terror, when about eleven o'clock at night, I heard the diſmal warhoop of the ſavages, and found that my houſe was beſet by them. I flew to my chamber window, and perceived them to be twelve in number. Having my gun loaded, I threatened them with death, if they did not retire. But how vain and fruitleſs are the efforts of one man againſt the united force of ſo many blood thirſty mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters! One of them that could ſpeak Engliſh, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me in return, <q>That if I did not come out, they would burn me alive,</q> adding, however, <q>That if I would come out and ſurrender myſelf priſoner, they would not kill me.</q> In ſuch deplorable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I choſe to rely on their promiſes rather
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:048027_0004_1024DC9B156A8B40"/>
than meet death by rejecting them; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went out of the houſe, with my gun in my hand, not knowing that I had it. Immediately on my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they ruſhed on me like tigers, and inſtantly diſarmed me. Having me thus in their power, they bound me to a tree, went into the houſe, plundered it of every thing they could carry off, and then ſet fire to it, and conſumed what was left before my eyes. Not ſatisfied with this, they ſet fire to my barn, ſtable, and out houſes, wherein were about 200 buſhels of wheat, ſix cows, four horſes, and five ſheep, all which were conſumed to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Having thus finiſhed the execrable buſineſs about which they came, one of the monſters came to me with a tomahawk<note n="*" place="bottom">A tomahawk is a kind of hatchet, made ſomething like our plaiſterers' hammers, about two feet long, handle and all. They generally uſe it after firing their guns, by ruſhing on their enemies, and fracturing or cleaving their ſculls with it, and very ſeldom fail of killing at the firſt blow.</note> and threatened me with the worſt of deaths, if I would not go with them. This I agreed to, and then they untied me, and gave me a load to carry, under which I travelled all that night, full of the moſt terrible apprehenſions, left my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py wife ſhould likewiſe have fallen into their cruel power. At day break, my infernal maſters ordered me to lay down my load, when tying my hands again round a tree, they forced the blood out at my fingers ends. And then kindling a fire near the tree to which I was bound, the moſt dreadful agonies ſeized me, concluding I was going to be made a ſacrifice to their barbarity. The fire being made, they for ſome time danced round me after their manner, whooping, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and ſhrieking in a frightful manner. Being ſatisfied with this ſort of mirth, they proceeded in another manner; taking the burning coals, and ſticks flaming with fire at the ends, holding them to my
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048027_0005_1024DC9F56481230"/>
face, head, hands and feet, and at the ſame time threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to burn me entirely if I cried out: thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured as I was, almoſt to death, I ſuffered their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities, without being allowed to vent my anguiſh otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than by ſhedding ſilent tears; and theſe being obſerved, they took freſh coals, and applied them near my eyes telling me my face was wet, and that they would dry it for me, which indeed they cruelly did. How I underwent theſe tortures has been matter of wonder to me, but God enabled me to wait with more than common patience for the deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance I daily prayed for.</p>
            <p>At length they ſat down round the fire, and roaſted the meat of which they had robbed my dwelling.—When they had ſupped, they offered ſome to me: though it may eaſily be magined I had but little appetite to eat, after the tortures and miſeries I had ſuffered, yet was I forced to ſeem pleaſed with what they offered me, leſt by refuſing it, they ſhould re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their helliſh practices. What I could not eat, I contrived to hide, they having unbound me till they imagined I had eat all; but then they bound me as before: in which deplorable condition I was forced to continue the whole day. When the ſun was ſet, they put out the fire, and covered the aſhes with leaves, as is their uſual cuſtom, that the white people might not diſcover any traces of their having been there.</p>
            <p>Going from thence along the Suſquehannah, for the ſpace of ſix miles, loaded as I was before, we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at a ſpot near the Apalachian mountains, or Blue-hills, where they did their plunder under logs of wood. From thence they proceeded to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe, occupied by one John Snider and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conſiſting of his wife, five children, and a young man his ſervant. They ſoon got admittance into the unfortunate man's houſe, where they immediately,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048027_0006_1024DCA0F3BF9EA0"/>
without the leaſt remorſe, ſcalped both parents and children: nor could the tears, the ſhrieks, or cries of poor innocent children, prevent their horrid maſſacre: having thus ſcalped them, and plundered the houſe of every thing that was moveable, they ſet fire to it, and left the diſtreſſed victims amidſt the flames.</p>
            <p>Thinking the young man belonging to this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py family, would be of ſervice to them in carrying part of their plunder, they ſpared his life, and loaded him and myſelf with what they had here got, and again marched to the Blue-hills, where they ſtowed their goods as before. My fellow ſufferer could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the cruel treatment which we were obliged to ſuffer, and complaining bitterly to me of his being unable to proceed any farther, I endeavoured to ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate him, but all in vain, for he ſtill continued his moans and tears, which one of the ſavages perceiving, as we travelled along, came up to us, and with his tomahawk gave him a blow on the head, which felled the unhappy youth to the ground, whom they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſcalped and left. The ſuddenneſs of this murder ſhocked me to that degree, that I was in a manner motionleſs, expecting my fate would ſoon be the ſame: however, recovering my diſtracted thoughts, I diſſembled my anguiſh as well as I could from the barbarians; but ſtill, ſuch was my terror, that for ſome time I ſcarce knew the days of the week, or what I did.</p>
            <p>They ſtill kept on their courſe near the mountains, where they lay ſkulking four or five days, rejoicing at the plunder they had got. When proviſions became ſcarce, they made their way towards Suſquehannah, and paſſing near another houſe, inhabited by an old man, whoſe name was John Adams, with his wife and four ſmall children, and meeting with no reſiſtance, they immediately ſcalped the mother and her children before the old man's eyes. Inhuman and horrid as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:048027_0007_1024DCA46B09AB70"/>
this was, it did not ſatisfy them; for when they had murdered the poor woman, they acted with her in ſuch a brutal manner, as decency will not permit me to mention. The unhappy huſband, not being able to avoid the fight, intreated them to put an end to his miſerable being; but they were as deaf to the tears and entreaties of this venerable ſufferer, as they had been to thoſe of the others, and proceeded to burn and deſtroy his houſe, barn, corn, hay, cattle and every thing the poor man, a few hours before, was maſter of. Having ſaved what they thought proper from the flames, they gave the old man, feeble, weak, and in the miſerable condition he then was, as well as myſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> burdens to carry, and loading themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with bread and meat, purſued their journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Great Swamp. Here they lay for eight or nine days diverting themſelves, at times, in barbarous cruelties on the old man: ſometimes they would ſtrip him naked, and paint him all over with various ſorts of colours: at othertimes, they would pluck the white hairs from his head, and tauntingly tell him, 'He was a fool for living ſo long, and that they ſhould ſhew him kindneſs in putting him out of the world.' In vain were all his tears, for daily did they tire themſelves with the various means they tried to torment him; ſometimes tying him to a tree, and whipping him; at other times, ſcorching his ſurrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cheeks with red-hot coals, and burning his legs quite to the knees. One night after he had been thus tormented, whilſt he and I were condoling each other at the miſeries we daily ſuffered, 25 other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians arrived, bringing with them 20 ſcalps and three priſoners, who had unhappily fallen into their hands in Conogocheague, a ſmall town near the river Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehannah, chiefly inhabited by the Iriſh. Theſe priſoners gave us ſome ſhocking accounts of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and devaſtations committed in their parts; a few
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:048027_0008_1024DCA999338DA8"/>
inſtances of which will enable the reader to gueſs at the treatment the provincials have ſuffered for years paſt. This party, who now joined us, had it not, I found, in their power to begin their violences ſo ſoon as thoſe who viſited my habitation; the firſt of their tragedies being on the 25th of October, 1754, when John Lewis, with his wife and three ſmall children, were inhumanly ſcalped and murdered; and his houſe, barn, and every thing he poſſeſſed, burnt and deſtroyed. On the 28th, Jacob Miller, with his wife and ſix of his family, with every thing on his plantations, ſhared the ſame fate. The 30th, the houſe, mill, barn, 20 head of cattle, two teams of horſes, and every thing belonging to George Folke, met with the like treatment, himſelf, wife, and all his miſerable family, conſiſting of nine in number, being ſcalped, then cut in pieces and given to the ſwine. One of the ſubſtantial traders, belonging to the province, having buſineſs that called him ſome miles up the country, fell into the hands of theſe ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, who not only ſcalped him, but immediately roaſted him before he was dead; then, like canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, for want of other food, eat his whole body, and of his head made, what they called, an Indian pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>From theſe few inſtances of ſavage cruelty, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſituation of the defenceleſs inhabitants, and what they hourly ſuffered in that part of the globe, muſt ſtrike the utmoſt horror, and cauſe in every breaſt the utmoſt deteſtation, not only againſt the authors, but againſt thoſe who, through inattention, or puſillanimous or erroneous principles, ſuffered theſe ſavages at firſt, unrepelled, or even unmoleſted to commit ſuch outrages, depredations, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>The three priſoners that were brought with theſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:048027_0009_1024DCAEBB195560"/>
additional forces, conſtantly repining at their lot, and almoſt dead with their exceſſive hard treatment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived at laſt to make their eſcape; but being far from their own ſettlements, and not knowing the country, were ſoon after met by ſome others of the tribes, or nations at war with us, and brought back. The poor creatures, almoſt famiſhed for want of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, having had none during the time of their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, were no ſooner in the power of the barbarians, than two of them were tied to a tree, and a great fire made round them, where they remained till they were terribly ſcorched and burnt; when one of the villains, with his ſcalping knife, ripped open their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, took out their entrails, and burned them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, whilſt the others were cutting, pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tearing the fleſh from their breaſts, hands, arms and legs, with red-hot irons, till they were dead. The third unhappy victim was reſerved a few hours longer, to be, if poſſible, ſacrificed in a more cruel manner; his arms were tied cloſe to his body, and a hole being dug, deep enough for him to ſtand upright, he was put into it, and earth rammed and beat in all round his body up to his neck, ſo that his head only appeared above ground; they then ſcalped him, and there let him remain for three or four hours, in the greateſt agonies; after which they made a ſmal fire near his head, cauſing him to ſuffer the moſt excruciating torments; whilſt the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could only cry for mercy, begging to be killed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, for his brains were boiling in his head; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable to all he ſaid, they continued the fire, till his eyes guſhed out of their ſockets; ſuch agonizing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did this unhappy creature ſuffer for near two hours before he was quite dead. They then cut off his head, and buried it with the other bodies; my taſk being to dig the graves; which, feeble and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified as I was, the dread of ſuffering the ſame fate enabled me to do.</p>

A great ſnow now falling, the barbarians were fearful, leſt the white people ſhould, by their tracks, find out their ſkulking retreats, which obliged them to make the beſt of their way to their winter-quarters, about two hundred miles farther from any plantations or inhabitants. After a long and painful journey, being almoſt ſtarved, I arrived with this infernal crew at Alamingo. There I found a number of wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams, full of their women and children. Dancing, ſinging, and ſhouting were their general amuſements. And in all their feſtivals and dances, they relate what ſucceſſes they have had, and what damages they have ſuſtained in their expeditions; in which I now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily became part of their theme. The ſeverity of the cold increaſing, they ſtripped me of my cloathes for their own uſe, and gave me ſuch as they uſually wore themſelves, being a piece of blanket, and a pair of mockaſons, or ſhoes, with a yard of coarſe cloth, to put round me inſtead of breeches.</p>
            <p>At Alamingo I remained near two months, till the ſnow was off the ground. Whatever thoughts I might have of making my eſcape, to carry them into execution was impracticable, being ſo far from any plantations or white people, and the ſevere weather rendering my limbs in a manner quite ſtiff and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs: however, I contrived to defend myſelf againſt the inclemency of the weather as well as I could, by making myſelf a little wigwam with the bark of the trees, covering it with earth, which made it reſemble a cave; and to prevent the ill effects of the cold, I kept a good fire always near the door. My liberty of going about, was, indeed, more than I could have expected, but they well knew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of my eſcaping from them. Seeing me outwardly eaſy and ſubmiſſive, they would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give me a little meat, but my chief food was Indian corn. At length the time came when they
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:048027_0011_1024DCB3B6427CD8"/>
were preparing themſelves for another expedition againſt the planters and white people; but before they ſet out, they were joined by many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſnow was quite gone, they ſet forth on their journey towards the back parts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Pennſylvania; all leaving their wives and children behind in their wigwams. They were now a formidable body, amounting to near 150. My buſineſs was to carry what they thought proper to load me with, but they never intruſted me with a gun. We marched on ſeveral days without any thing particular occurring, almoſt famiſhed for want of proviſions; for my part, I had nothing but a few ſtalks of Indian corn, which I was glad to eat dry: nor did the Indians themſelves fare much better, for as we drew near the plantations they were afraid to kill any game, leſt the noiſe of their guns ſhould alarm the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>When we again arrived at the Blue-hills, about thirty miles from the Iriſh ſettlements before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we encamped for three days, though, God knows, we had neither tents nor any thing elſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from the inclemency of the air, having noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lie on by night but the graſs. Their uſual method of lodging, pitching, or encamping, by night, being in parcels of ten or twelve men to a fire, where they lie upon the graſs or bruſh, wrapped up in a blanket, with their feet to the fire.</p>
            <p>During our ſtay here, a ſort of council of war was held, when it was agreed to divide themſelves into companies of about twenty men each; after which every captain marched with his party where he thought proper. I ſtill belonged to my old maſters, but was leſt behind on the mountains with ten In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, to ſtay till the reſt ſhould return; not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it proper to carry me nearer to Conogocheague, or the other plantations.</p>

Here I began to meditate an eſcape, and though I knew the country round extremely well, yet I was very cautious of giving the leaſt ſuſpicion of any ſuch intention. However the third day after the grand body left us, my companions thought proper to traverſe the mountains in ſearch of game for their ſubſiſtence, leaving me bound in ſuch a manner that I could not eſcape: at night, when they returned, having unbound me, we all ſat down together to ſupper on what they had killed, and ſoon after (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly fatigued with their day's excurſion) they compoſed themſelves to reſt, as uſual. I now tried various ways to try whether it was a ſcheme to prove my intentions or not; but after making a noiſe and walking about, ſometimes touching them with my feet, I found there was no fallacy. Then I reſolved, if poſſible, to get one of their guns, and, if diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to die in my defence, rather than be taken: for that purpoſe I made various efforts to get one from under their heads (where they always ſecured them) but in vain. Diſappointed in this, I began to deſpair of carrying my deſign into execution: yet, after a little recollection, and truſting myſelf to the divine protection, I ſet forwards, naked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs as I was. Such was my terror, however, that in going from them I halted, and pauſed every four or five yards, looking fearfully towards the ſpot where I had left them, leſt they ſhould awake and miſs me; but when I was two hundred yards from them, I mended my pace, and made as much haſte as I poſſibly could to the foot of the mountains; when, on a ſudden, I was ſtruck with the greateſt terror at hearing the wood-cry, as it is called, which the ſavages I had left were making, upon miſſing their charge. The more my terror encreaſed the faſter I puſhed on, and, ſcarce knowing where I trod, drove through the woods with the utmoſt precipitation,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:048027_0013_1024DCB9B225EFB8"/>
ſometimes falling and bruiſing myſelf, cutting my feet and legs againſt the ſtones in a miſerable manner. But faint and maimed as I was, I continued my ſlight till day-break, when, without having any thing to ſuſtain nature, but a little corn left, I crept into a hollow tree where I lay very ſnug, and returned my prayers and thanks to the divine being, that had thus far favoured my eſcape. But my repoſe was in a few hours deſtroyed at hearing the voices of the ſavages near the place where I was hid, threatening and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how they would uſe me, if they got me again. However, they at laſt left the ſpot, where I heard them, and I remained in my apartment all that day without further moleſtation.</p>
            <p>At night I ventured forwards again, frightened; thinking each twig that touched me a ſavage. The third day I concealed myſelf in like manner as before, and at night travelled, keeping off the main road as much as poſſible, which lengthened my journey many miles. But how ſhall I deſcribe the terror I felt on the fourth night, when, by the ruſtling I made among the leaves, a party of Indians, that lay round a ſmall fire, which I did not perceive, ſtarted from the ground, and, ſeizing their arms, ran from the fire amongſt the woods. Whether to move forward or reſt where I was, I knew not, when to my great ſurprize and joy, I was relieved by a parcel of ſwine that made towards the place where I gueſſed the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be; who, on ſeeing them, imagined that they had cauſed the alarm, very merrily returned to the fire, and lay again down to ſleep. Bruiſed, crippled, and terrified as I was, I purſued my journey till break of day, when, thinking myſelf ſafe, I lay down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great log, and ſlept till about noon. Before evening I reached the ſummit of a great hill, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out if I could ſpy any habitations of white people, to my inexpreſſible joy, I ſaw ſome which I gueſſed to be about ten miles diſtance.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:048027_0014_1024DCBB4F930B98"/>
In the morning I continued my journey towards the neareſt cleared lands I had ſeen the day before, and, about four o'clock in the afternoon, arrived at the houſe of John Bell, an old acquaintance, where knocking at the door, his wife, who opened it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in ſuch a frightful condition, flew from me, ſcreaming, into the houſe. This alarmed the whole family, who immediately fled to their arms, and I was ſoon accoſted by the maſter with his gun in his hand. But on making myſelf known, (for he before took me to be an Indian) he immediately careffed me, as did all his family, with extraordinary friendſhip, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my being murdered by the ſavages having reached them ſome months before. For two days and nights they very affectionately ſupplied me with all neceſſaries, and carefully attended me till my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and limbs were pretty well recovered, and I tho't myſelf able to ride, when I borrowed of theſe good people (whoſe kindneſs merits my moſt grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns) a horſe and ſome cloathes, and ſet forward for my father-in-law's houſe in Cheſter Country, about one hundred and forty miles from thence, where I arrived on the 4th day of January, 1755, (but ſcarce one of the family could credit their eyes, believing, with the people I had lately left, that I had fallen a prey to the Indians) where I was received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the whole family with great affection; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inquiring for my dear wiſe, I found ſhe had been dead two months! This fatal news greatly leſſened the joy I otherwiſe ſhould have felt at my deliverance from the dreadful ſtate and company I had been in.</p>
