            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HEARING an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſay, that he uſed not the excellencies of ſpeech, nor the enticing words of man's wiſdom, when he came preaching the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus</hi> amongſt the Gentiles: I conclude, that what was <hi>then</hi> uſeleſs, is altogether as unneceſſary <hi>now.</hi> Truth needs no art, but manifeſts itſelf by plainneſs of ſpeech, in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</p>
            <p>I believe I may ſay, without unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cenſure, that mankind in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, judge according to appearance, and not with righteous judgment; the flowery ſtile, the ſwelling word of vanity alluring to the fleſh, is that, which, (by reaſon of the depraved ſenſes) is moſt pleaſing to the ear, and ſtriking to the mind, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not important, whether it contains any matter or not: The Truth itſelf, being ſeldom that which the reader falls in love with; it is language, founds, and pomp of words, that enamours a flattering world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:046269_0003_1021159E3ABD0878"/>
To urge, that the allurements and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of ſpeech adorns the Truth, and removing the prejudice which many have conceived againſt it, excites them to read with delight, &amp;c. I ſay, this plea will be found upon impartial inquiry, to be a flat contradiction of the ſcriptures, a ſtale device of Truth's grand enemy: For let the <hi>ſame ſubject,</hi> be but treated of in the true apoſtolic language, viz. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech; and thoſe raptured ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the ſublime, however nervous its argument, will reject it.</p>
            <p>To aſſert that the excellency of ſpeech, and the enticing words of man's wiſdom, is neceſſary to enforce the Truths of the Goſpel; is to impeach the judgment of one whoſe choice did not proceed of neceſſity, when he choſe plainneſs of ſpeech, ſuch as was familiar to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity; I mean the apoſtle to the Gentiles; he looked on the enticements of ſpeech, as a proceeding unworthy the majeſty of his matter, yea rather <hi>hurtful</hi> than <hi>

               </hi> unto his hearers; left their faith ſhould ſtand in the wiſdom of man, and not in the power of God. Hence I am encouraged to hope, that the abſence <pb n="v" facs="unknown:046269_0004_102115A325C743C0"/>of thoſe embelliſhments from my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, (though it proceed of neceſſity) will neither marr the beauty, nor relax the nerves of Truth contained therein: And, what further conſpires to render my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations ſanguine in this particular, is the perſuaſion, that there are ſuch in the world, whoſe ears cannot be charmed with dead unmeaning ſounds, and whoſe hearts are ſuſceptible of Truth, in its artleſs native dreſs.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>multitude</hi> think otherwiſe, and are contrary to <hi>me;</hi> in the grace and love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I ſtand prepared for cenſure, and reproach, and am not afraid of their utmoſt enmity: nor is it in the <hi>power</hi> of the world to <hi>torment</hi> me with diſappointments, becauſe my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations are ſuited to their candour and clemency.</p>
            <p>Through the knowledge of myſelf, and the obſervation I have made in life, I underſtand a little of human nature; and having learned of the Father, am not altogether ignorant of him who is the Truth: I therefore perceive, that <hi>reproach</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are inſeparably <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:046269_0005_102115A66D0A2AA8"/>connected; that it is impoſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and bear witneſs of the <hi>one,</hi> without being expoſed to the virulence of the <hi>other,</hi> therefore God forbid that I ſhould ſeek to avoid it, but rather meet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and receive it with open arms; being thereby crucified unto the world, and the world unto me.</p>
            <p>As I make no pretenſion to infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nay as I pretend not to the abilities of fallible authors: reſpecting wiſdom, and Letters, it will not ſurpriſe me, nor need it ſurpriſe any <hi>body e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lling to attempt it. But, when <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:046269_0006_102115A833DBAE38"/>any conceited ſpirit, from meer <hi>wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> majeſterially declares me wrong, I ſhall not reply; becauſe <hi>the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As I do not remember to have read the author, who hath treated of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject contained in the following Tract; any farther than to drop ſome very brief hints of ſuch a Truth, which hath been immediately contradicted by ſome other poſition: So neither do I remember to have read any thing wrote in conſutation thereof, except a few admirable pieces lately handed about; in ſome of which, my name ſtands conſpicuous as an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick. I have reaſons with me very ſufficient, why I take no notice of thoſe important ſpirits, ſo as to anſwer them in form.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Reſpecting ſuch that I have ſeen, their performances evidence beyond all controverſy, that they did not underſtand the matter which they wrote againſt, and therefore treated that with contempt which was above them, being not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities. I would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:046269_0007_102115AB475EB030"/>(unprovoked by their petulancy) anſwer thoſe with ſilence, as being beneath my attention. I would harden my ear againſt the roarings of ignorance, and be utterly inſenſible of their invectives:</p>
            <p>It being ridiculous to fret at the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Cur, when it is the nature of the animal to be noiſy. Moreover, my wife, and powerful Antagoniſts, are generally poſitive without candour; yea even <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> in their own conceit: With ſuch it is unlawful to reaſon. To ſee what important airs thoſe little maſters give themſelves, ſtrikes one at once with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and contempt; and conſtrains the <hi>ſerious</hi> mind to commiſerate the abject ſtate of Man, which nothing more fully diſcovers, than the egregious vanity, and inſolence, of abſolute determinations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon. For my part, after having abjured the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I can never ſubmit to any infallible chair of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Sort: Therefore their poſitions have no weight with me, where they produce not their reaſons, and ſuch reaſons as immediately relate to the matter in hand, and take in its meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:046269_0008_102115AE4EE5EB48"/>
Until then, they may think as high as they pleaſe of themſelves, (as vain conceit ſeems neceſſary to keep up their ſpirits) I muſt of neceſſity reſpect them, ſo, as to take no notice of their Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, but boldly confeſs that after the way which they call Hereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon, why I do not chooſe to anſwer (in form) thoſe Antagoniſts who have as yet appeared in public againſt me, is, that perſonal pique, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, ſelf-intereſt, &amp;c. was not the leaſt powerful motive with them in their oppoſition; and where thoſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations influence the mind, it is an eaſy matter to find fault, Yea <hi>prejudice</hi> is dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous at <hi>making</hi> faults, where there are none. I would not anſwer ſuch as theſe, left, by inflaming them, I ſhould drive them to an utter renunciation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: Left they ſhould caſt off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that meaſure of Truth which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they <hi>may</hi> have, only becauſe, (from perſonal enmity) they may be in all things my oppoſites. For, where a ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and ſelf-ſeeking takes the lead, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> not ſtrange to ſee men change their <pb n="x" facs="unknown:046269_0009_102115B27B88EBC8"/>Maxims, leſt they ſhould be thought to agree in any particular with the objects of their envy; it is a pity the Evidence that ſome of my opponents are already too guilty of this Charge, is ſo full.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there were many other ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating conſiderations, well nigh as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as that of perſonal enmity, and revenge, which made them opponents to me, and my doctrine: ſuch as making their peace with the World, at the expence of the <hi>perſons,</hi> and <hi>matter,</hi> trampled on. They were well aware, of its being a very likely method to gain the favour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in the general, eſpecially of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous populace; the light, in which things ſtand at preſent, adminiſtering them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant opportunity for ſo doing, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhrewdly foreſeen, that <hi>prejudice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſon and matter exploded, would not permit the world to inquire impartially, into the merits of the Cauſe. They could not but be greatly encouraged, being aſſured of victory, before they came to the trial. It might reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from hence, that their exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and invectives, would have a large run in the world; to the great advantage <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:046269_0010_1020EFCD7703FFE8"/>of the Authors: This Thought had a ſweet feeling in it. But, I believe, there has been a diſappointment here; it ſhould have been conſidered, that the Perſon, and Doctrine, which they beſpatter, are not ſufficiently popular, and formidable, to raiſe a general Call, for their confutations, and preſervatives.—The <hi>deliverance,</hi> is always proportionable to the <hi>Danger,</hi> nor can the <hi>latter</hi> be great, from what is only the object of hatred, and contempt, and not of fear: Had this been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, their expectations had not been ſo ſanguine. I might by appealing to <hi>Human nature,</hi> prove that thoſe my reaſons, for not taking any farther notice of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts, are not mere <hi>ſurmiſe;</hi> which may poſſibly be falſe: But I decline this, and declare myſelf well aſſured of what I have ſaid, from circumſtances ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convincing; however, I bid them all farewel in the words of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>If Want provoke, or Madneſs makes them print,</l>
                  <l>I wage no War with <hi>Bedlam,</hi> nor the <hi>Mint.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>

            <p>It is not my aim in this Treatiſe, to defend by external <hi>Argument,</hi> againſt gainſayers, what I conceive to be the Truth, as it is in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> but ſimply to <pb n="xii" facs="unknown:046269_0011_102115B707FF12C8"/>throw ſuch a light upon the matter, that <hi>as</hi> it is true, it might appear in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure intelligible alſo. I was for a long ſeaſon, after ſatisfied of the redemption which is in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; very uneaſy at times, concerning the Equity thereof: Indeed the hints which occaſioned thoſe diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in my Mind, were merely acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; for having received much conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt perſuaſion of redemption, the forgiveneſs of ſins, in the Blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I judged myſelf ſufficient, (from the Argument I fancied I was Maſter of, and that reſiſtleſs authority, which I dreamt attended my words when I ſpake of divine things) for the conviction of the moſt <hi>hardened,</hi> and <hi>averſe</hi> to ſalvation by <hi>Jeſus</hi>; and accordingly, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered, failed not to exert myſelf upon this principle: at length I met with one, who (though his zeal, and ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, bare no proportion to mine,) was far my ſuperior in underſtanding: after he had with <hi>coolneſs</hi> heard what I had to ſay, he aſked me wherein was the juſtice, and equity, of one Man's ſuffering Death, yea even the torments of Hell, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo contrary to reaſon and alſo to the teſtimony of ſcripture, which often <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:046269_0012_102115BBDF452468"/>declares, that <hi>the Righteous ſhall not ſuffer for the Wicked; but that every man's ſin ſhould be charged upon his own head,</hi> &amp;c. I was not prepared for ſuch a queſtion as this and was therefore involved in a difficulty, which I could not obviate. I appealed to the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, it was granted that God was <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and that from his <hi>Sovereign</hi> pleaſure, he created us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, &amp;c. having nothing to move him to it, but his own will: yet he wills nothing but what is juſt, and equitable, becauſe he is juſt when he judgeth, and juſtifieth. I would then have urged, that as God is infinitely above us; his tho'ts, and ways above ours; we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of <hi>him,</hi> his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our low, and ſcanty notions thereof. It was anſwered, if I granted that mankind had any true notion of Juſtice, and Equity, though but in the ſmalleſt degree, then what is contrary to <hi>this,</hi> muſt be much <hi>more ſo</hi> to God, whoſe Juſtice and Truth, is infinite, pure, and eternal. I urged other matters, to as little purpoſe, and though I conſidently continued in my former aſſertion, yet I was forced to abate much of my ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>importance, and very often afterwards, <pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:046269_0013_102115BD655E40F0"/>was greatly diſturbed in my mind, on account of theſe things. As far as my capacity would admit, I applied myſelf to reading; and read a great many Books, treating of redemption by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and found them all run in one Channel, <hi>viz.</hi> that Man being a debtor, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and unable to ſave himſelf, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> became his ſurety, under an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pay his Debts, and to bear his puniſhment: The <hi>Equity</hi> of which, is generally reſolved into the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, or accounted for, from the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as an <hi>independent Divine Perſon</hi>) to ſuffer, in the ſinners ſtead: whilſt others ſatisfy themſelves, with the bare poſitive aſſertion, that it is equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for one perſon to be ſurety for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only in caſe of Debt; but even in capital offences. Thoſe reſolutions, I read, over, and over, but rather more <hi>perplexed</hi> than <hi>ſatisfied</hi> thereby. In vain it was, that the moſt pious and orthodox writers, and preachers, explained the matter thus; I was <hi>constrained</hi> to deſpiſe all human authority, in things of this nature; eſpecially where there was not the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of Reaſon and Fquity. I applied myſelf more carefully, to the <pb n="xv" facs="unknown:046269_0014_102115C0A8FDCE10"/>reading and ſtudy of the Scriptures; as without notes, or expoſitions: ſubmitting in ſpirit, unto Him, who at firſt dictated, and hath taken it upon him to make us underſtand them. And thence it was, I diſcerned according to that ſcanty mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I have attained, what I conceive to be the harmony of divine Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and, how clear the equity of redemption by the blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> appears in this Truth, in the following Treatiſe I have attempted to thew. And, becauſe I have thereby found a retreat in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> from the face of the Enemy, and all his dangerous inſinuations, whereby he would have ſhaken the foundations, I publiſh it to others, that if there ſhould be amongſt my readers, <hi>ſuch</hi> who are tried with trials of like nature, they may poſſibly have inſtruction ſealed, to their peace, and conſolation. It is alſo probable, that ſuch may read, whom either preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or lack of opportunity, will not permit to hear.—There are generally but few, amongſt the great multitude, who inquire into the merits of the cauſe they engage in: Tradition, received from their Fathers, zeal and affection for <pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:046269_0015_102115C28C63EBB8"/>their Leaders, ſpirit them on to perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion beyond ſcruple, that they are in the Truth. It is very probable, there are others, who ſimply crediting the ſcripture teſtimony, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died for our ſins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, are happy in that Truth; without once inquiring into the equity thereof, or ever thinking it neceſſary ſo to do. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of their peace, I will not pretend to deny, as they believe the Facts, which the goſpel relates, and propoſes as the Joy and Peace of Mankind. But yet, the neceſſity of examining the equity thereof, remains; as is evident, firſt from the ſcriptures treating ſo plentifully of it: To deny the neceſſity of attending to which teaching, would be the higheſt arrogance. Again, though they may hitherto have eſcaped the temptation <hi>within,</hi> and the argument of ſuch <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> who walk enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt; yet it proves not, that they ſhall <hi>always</hi> eſcape: therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, they ſhould, from the faithful apprehenſion of their <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be ſo rooted, and grounded in Love, that their Joy may abide, and no man take it from them. Again, it is neceſſary, that <pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:046269_0016_102115C72E2EB548"/>knowing God, they may glorify him <hi>as God,</hi> who, being infinitely glorious, and exalted, in all the perfections of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath in this gracious plan, moſt wonderfully exhibited that Divine har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which to <hi>man,</hi> is ſo rich a proof of his unity.</p>
            <p>As to my talking ſo much of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his perſon, and excellencies, my continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al endeavour to point <hi>him</hi> out, as <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life</hi>; I hope, even ſuch who would be thought the <hi>guardians</hi> of true godlineſs, will bear with me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, when I give them my reaſons for ſo doing. Firſt, I am under very great obligations to Him, which coming to light every Day, more and more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me to ſpeak of him, and to eſteem Him very precious. Again, I may be excuſed a little, becauſe teſtimonies of this nature, are very rare: whilſt <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I hope ſo inſigniſicant a perſon as I, may be indulged with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat of Jeſus Chriſt. The phraſe <hi>Practical,</hi> when applied to Divinity, ſeems to be made uſe of, in direct oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and that, which <hi>immediately</hi> treats of him: as though <hi>he</hi> was dry Theory, a Fable, or an idle ſpeculation only. Will it be anſwered, that the wickedneſs of the age is <hi>ſuch,</hi> as renders it needful to write, and preach, <hi>practically</hi> as called? Is not this giving up the cauſe to the enemy, and a tacit acknowledgment, that the Article <hi>Chriſt</hi> is inſufficient? Yea, that this Article rather tends to corrupt mankind, and promote bad morals; or indeed to ſay thus: fain would we reform the world, we have uſed all means to do them good, we have tried <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we have preached, and wrote of <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> would not do: He only made all things worſe, how can <hi>he</hi> be of God, whoſe Diſciples break the Sabbath Day? &amp;c. we are therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to lay <hi>him</hi> aſide, and betake our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Law of <hi>Meſes,</hi> with other good rules, which pious Men have plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and by inſiſting upon their living up to thoſe (promiſing <hi>ſalvation</hi> unto ſuch who <hi>do</hi>; and threatning all that do <hi>not,</hi> 
               <pb n="xix" facs="unknown:046269_0018_102115CD71C2AD90"/>with <hi>Eternal Damnation)</hi> we hope to ſtem the torrent of vice, and turn mankind into the paths of virtue and piety.</p>
            <p>Have your inventions anſwered the End intended; are they more reformed than they were in the days of the Apoſtles, who made it their buſineſs to preach a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Jeſus</hi>? where is the Church, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians <hi>now,</hi> who attain to this Character, <hi>The multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and of one ſoul, neither ſaid any of them, that ought of the things which he poſſeſſed was his own, but they had all things common?</hi> Acts iv. 32. This was effected by the ſimple teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his death, and reſurrection; the people were <hi>then</hi> taught, that they were the body of <hi>Chriſt in particular, and members one of another.</hi> Whereas, the more modern doctrines have taught man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to reſpect each other as <hi>Aliens,</hi> each eſteeming of himſelf, better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; imagining he has property diſtinct from his brother, yea even in ſpirituals; he looks on his <hi>own</hi> things, and not on the things of <hi>another.</hi> Thus the modern doctrines, and traditions of men, are calculated to promote ſelf-love, ſpiritual <pb n="xx" facs="unknown:046269_0019_102116DFE1945040"/>pride, bigotry, and hatred of each other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tead of love. Therefore is it, that the morals of mankind are as bad as ever, not withſtanding the neceſſity and benefit of holineſs, and good works, is daily ſounded in their ears. And even amongſt the <hi>reformed,</hi> as they would be thought, is there not envying, ſtrife, contention, backbiting, evil-ſpeaking, whiſpering, uncharitableneſs, the putting forth of the finger, revenge, inhumanity with every evil work and diſpoſition? and indeed this is the genuine fruit of the doctrines of the age; for where people are taught to diſtinguiſh between ſaints and ſinners, and to think themſelves holier than their neighbours, it is not ſtrange that they uſe them ill. As this is ſo general, I ſuppoſe it will not greatly irritate, that a few worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men, without character, or popularity, ſhould make Chriſt their ſubject, and be ever <hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>writing</hi> of him. It is to be feared, that being meerly orthodox, in point of works, with a deſire at times of <hi>doing,</hi> and at other times, a ſigh &amp; ſorrow for <hi>not</hi> doing, with a zeal for propagating the doctrine, is that which <hi>ſooths</hi> and <hi>keeps</hi> in peace the conſciences of many, who otherwiſe are very ſenſible of their <pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:046269_0020_1020EFE0419CC7E0"/>deficiency in this particular: And to talk of <hi>practice,</hi> and knowing nothing more of it; yea in ſhort, to talk of it, without keeping the <hi>whole Law,</hi> is ſuch a decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where ſcripture authority is admitted, yea or even what reaſon ſuggeſts of the nature of the divine Being,) as cannot be accounted for, but by the pride, bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and madneſs which we are naturally involved in. Perſons in this caſt, pleaſe themſelves, like the kings of <hi>Bedlam,</hi> who imagine their rags a purple robe, and their heap of ſtraw a throne; and are very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with all who will not humour their vain conceit.</p>
            <p>As to the zealous promoters of the doctrine of works, in oppoſition to the complete ſalvation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, we know what <hi>he</hi> ſays of them: That they lay heavy burdens upon mens ſhoulders, which they <hi>themſelves</hi> will not touch with one of their fingers: and the Apoſtle ſays, neither they <hi>themſelves</hi> keep the Law, but deſire to have <hi>you</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifed that they may glory in <hi>your</hi> fleſh. Thus we are not always to judge of men by their ſounds, or to imagine a man greatly pious becauſe he talks of works, or <pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:046269_0021_1020EFE1C90F1398"/>writes practical Treatiſes; nay, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reaſonable and juſt for us to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our credit, and ſhut our ears, until his <hi>tempers</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> ſpeak: and of <hi>ſuch</hi> I have no need to be afraid, however zealous they may be, for as Mercy, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Charity, are none of the leaſt prevalent in the compoſition of true Piety, their precious balms can never break my head.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more probable than that it will be objected, I am an enemy to good works, or, that convinced by the holy practice of ſome particulars amongſt the Profeſſors of Religion, I pine with envy; affecting to <hi>

               </hi> what I cannot <hi>attain</hi> unto. To which I anſwer, I am far from being an enemy to <hi>good</hi> works, that which is truly <hi>Good,</hi> when manifeſt, always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my reſpect: nor can <hi>I</hi> conceive how any man, when convinced of the good, ſhould hate it for <hi>being</hi> ſo. I do not mean to deny, that the truly Good, is at any time the object of Man's hatred; but then we always ſuſpect that of <hi>evil,</hi> which we allow ourſelves to hate; and if from the corruption of nature we hate the Good, becauſe it forbids us the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:046269_0022_102115D058D7D148"/>of the ſenſual appetites, yet even <hi>that</hi> hatred doth not totally exclude from the Boſom a ſecret approbation of the Good. But as weakneſs and ignorance are (acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally) properties of human nature, we are not always capable of diſtinguiſhing, <hi>perfectly,</hi> between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>am</hi> not, cannot, poſſibly be an enemy to <hi>Good</hi> works; but then, I muſt have ſome more inconteſtable proof of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before I become an admirer, than ignorant <hi>roarings,</hi> the clamours and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant airs of vain pretenders.

            <p>THE doctrine of <hi>Union</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> renders the Syſtem of man's redemption by his Blood, beautifully conſiſtent, and worthy its glorious Author.</p>
            <p>It explains the harmony of the divine perfections, and reveals God, acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of his nature, in the ſalvation of mankind by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord.</p>
            <p>Hence, it appears greatly worthy of our conſideration; and in treating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I would obſerve the following method:

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> appears to me a Truth of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that I can ſee no conſiſtency in the Doctrine of Salvation by <hi>Jeſus</hi> without it.
<note n="*" place="bottom">The method of grace and ſalvation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Union: is not at all contradictory to the ſovereignty of God: That being ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt, where he hath decreed the honour, and glory of his Son, as the principal and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maxim in all his divine appointments. <hi>He was before all things, and by Him all things conſiſt.</hi> The creation of Man, and his being appointed to obtain ſalvation, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is a farther proof of divine ſovereignty; nothing moving the Almighty thereunto, but his own will: Yet this hinders not the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> of this Grace, its being according to equity, and <hi>that ſuch</hi> as We, by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> may properly conceive of. But when ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty is introduced from firſt, to laſt; to the utter excluſion of equity, which is often done; (as a palliative for man's ignorance in divine things) the conſequences attending are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Firſt, as it depreciates the ſacriſice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and makes his Death unneceſſary: ſince <hi>Abſoluteneſs</hi> might have remitted the offence without ſhedding of blood. Or if it is hinted, that this Condition <hi>took place</hi> and was <hi>accepted</hi> from meer ſovereign pleaſure only: Then, of conſequence it was not proportionable, as an attonement unto the offence; and its Dignity as the Blood of God denied: Nor (upon ſuch a ſuppoſition) was it neceſſary that our Saviour ſhould be more than man. But, if the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dignify the Blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in ſaying, that God purchaſed the Church <hi>with his own Blood</hi>; if <hi>he</hi> was made a curſe for us: if <hi>his</hi> ſufferings as the puniſhment of ſin was equal to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; then was it accepted, not from <hi>meer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs,</hi> but from the harmony and full conſent of Mercy and Truth, Righteouſneſs and Peace. Again, ſuch an uſe made of Divine Sovereignty, would be to reject the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; where they declare that God will not hold the ſinner guiltleſs, nor acquit him without the ſhedding of Blood, even the Blood of the offender. To throw a light upon which, and to inſtruct the people in the myſtery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they were taught from the Union ſubſiſting between themſelves, and their ſacrifices, to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Blood, and death, of their ſacrifice, as their own: and as ſuch, was the Blood taken by the High prieſt into the holy preſence; where the names of the people ingraven on the ſtones o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which bleſſings were remiſſion and juſtification to Life. Thus through all the diſpenſations committed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſymbols of equity are inſeperably connected with the Figures of Salvation by <hi>Jeſus.</hi> From all which it appears, That God's ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace, and Will to ſave mankind, hath been executed according to ſtricteſt Truth and Equity: and ſuch is the Wiſdom, that God is unſpeakably glorious in the Honor, and Glory his <hi>Son</hi> hath obtained thereby; and mankind infinitely advantaged.

               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Exod. xxiii. 7.</note> Thus the voice of <hi>Truth</hi> is, that the Sinner ſhall die for his own ſin: and that the Righteous ſhall not ſuffer. <hi>Say ye to the Righteous it ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eat the Fruit of their doings: Woe unto the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his Hands ſhall be given him.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Iſai. iii. 10, 11.</note> This is the Language of <hi>Truth:</hi> one jot, or tittle of which, ſhall not fail; though Heaven and Earth ſhould paſs away: Therefore ſuch an <hi>Union,</hi> or relation, between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> as gives <hi>Him</hi> the right of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and brings <hi>Him</hi> under that Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="7" facs="unknown:046269_0040_1021160B861DBC20"/>which is obnoxious to puniſhment; is abſolutely neceſſary: that His ſufferings for ſin, might accord with the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and demands of truth.</p>
            <p>2dly. It is contrary to <hi>Juſtice</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Innocent: to puniſh and deſtroy him, is cruelty and injuſtice.

To ſay that the undertaking on <hi>Chriſt's</hi> part was voluntary, neither proves nor implies, his right to ſuffer: becauſe it is not his <hi>willingneſs,</hi> but the approbation of <hi>divine Juſtice,</hi> which proves His right to taſte the Death of the Croſs. And, as the nature and property of Juſtice, is always its own rule of acting; it cannot admit of the Innocent's being puniſhed, nor of the Tranſgreſſor's being acquitted: For God the righteous Judge, hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a <hi>woe unto ſuch who ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah v. 23.</note> I am aware of an objection here, from ſuch who <pb n="8" facs="unknown:046269_0041_1021160D0EEFF1B0"/>would eſtabliſh imputation, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or <hi>union,</hi> viz. that the Law admits of one Man's being ſurety, or bondſman for another; and can juſtly oblige him to fulfil his engagements: To this I anſwer, It is moſt abſurd to make human Laws a ſtandard for God's method of dealing with mankind; except it be firſt proved that thoſe Laws are fully conformable to the Law of God; in Juſtice and Equity: Until this be proved, what Man decrees, or what the Law of Nations is, hath no weight at all when brought to teach the way of God with Man. Beſides, I know not of any human Laws, which admit of ſuretyſhip in <hi>capital</hi> Offences; and Sin is not only a <hi>Debt,</hi> for which ſuretyſhip is ſometimes admitted, but a <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> a <hi>Crime,</hi> capital in the higheſt ſenſe, only attoned for by the ſhedding of Blood; by the <hi>Death,</hi> yea, by the <hi>eternal Death</hi> of the Sinner: which Juſtice muſt inflict, before it can be properly ſatisfied; nor can it poſſibly admit of a Surety here: becauſe, it can only puniſh Him, whom it <hi>firſt</hi> finds guilty; and that not by rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning him to <hi>be</hi> what he is <hi>not,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to human quibbles; but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to artleſs, reaſonable, divine Equity; <pb n="9" facs="unknown:046269_0042_1021161063028258"/>which can only declare ſuch guilty, on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on ſuch who have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it; <hi>We</hi> only committed the fault, upon <hi>Us</hi> only can it be found: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without ſuch an <hi>Union</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> as expoſes <hi>us</hi> in <hi>his</hi> perſon, to Judgment and Condemnation; the harmony of the divine perfections, doth not appear in the things which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe contrary to Truth and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Again, it is contrary to <hi>Mercy,</hi> as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may not, conſiſtent with it own nature, treſpaſs the limits of Truth and Juſtice.

            <p>Again, it is contrary to <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> yet God hath marked out all his ways in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom: But that Syſtem which is not founded in equity, hath no exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true wiſdom in it; nay rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes God (if imputed to Him) either as lacking wiſdom when concerting His plan, or elſe, of <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to give us a ſpecimen thereof; and conſequently of denying his own Praiſe, and Man's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; which conſiſts in admiring, and glorifying Him, in the diſcoveries of His infinite wiſdom. For, where is the wiſdom of imputing Sin to Chriſt, which he had no right to bear? and whence his right, if not from Union to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? but grant <hi>this,</hi> Then indeed the great Deep breaks open, and Wiſdom, infinite Wiſdom appears: whilſt each beholder, with wonder cries, O! the <pb n="11" facs="unknown:046269_0044_102116180F815470"/>Depth! who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor?</p>
            <p>It is alſo contrary to <hi>Love:</hi> the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are very explicit, in declaring the Father's Love to the Son; but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this Son, for crimes he ſtood in no relation to, implies a defect in Love: yea, rather a greater Love to <hi>Man,</hi> the offender, than to his well-beloved <hi>Son,</hi> who was the <hi>Brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs Image of his perſon:</hi> and is withal a manifeſt contradiction to the divine Teſtmony, which aſſerts the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in all things. Withal, to love the impure, is inconſiſtent with the morality of the divine nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where the Father giving his ſon, is at any time mentioned as an evidence of his Love to mankind, it is a proof of his ſuperlative Love unto Him,

                  <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c.

God's giving his <hi>Son,</hi> and giving himſelf, is a Synonymy in Scripture; and confirms the above propoſition: The Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer being always bleſſed of the Greater.

Thoſe words of the Apoſtle, are a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from

It is evident from his words, that this relation did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in that matrimonial connection, which commenced, when by mutual conſent, and covenant, they cohabited and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed each other: But was dependant on ſomething prior to this. The ſource of their <hi>Union,</hi> and kindred relation, was their being <hi>one</hi> in the Love of the Father; where they were undiſtinguiſhed in ſex, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> there being neither Male nor Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in whom they were loved, and choſen, before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. And yet the man was not without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord: This ſource, had its firſt opening in their concreation, in one Body, and Human intelligence: which Body, and intelligence, was Male; though not without including the Female: But the Latter, according to the diſtinction of Sex and perſonal exiſtence, was, as being in the Male in a ſtate of paſſivity, and the Male, the active conſciouſneſs of the twain in one. <hi>Adam</hi> conſidering his <pb n="58" facs="unknown:046269_0091_102116A670370098"/>perfection in knowledge, could not be ignorant of this, his true ſtate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expecting the Woman, to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in perſon and ſex, as a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſenſes, of the truth of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Union</hi> unto him; he knew her when the Lord God brought her unto him: And though there was a deep ſleep upon him, when ſhe was built from his ſide, yet when he ſaw her, he ſaid, <hi>ſhe was fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone;</hi> alluding unto the <hi>former</hi> truth, and not unto any thing which was to follow. For they were not made more one fleſh, by that mutual, matrimonial embrace which followed, than they were before: The latter, as a fruit or conſequence, being only declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the original truth, always apparent to God, and in itſelf, with him, perfect, and permanent.</p>
            <p>Thus the matrimonial bond of <hi>Union,</hi> was with them a <hi>conſequence,</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> of an antecedent <hi>Union</hi> and kindred. This alſo is more manifeſt, where <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was old, cauſed his ſervant to ſwear by the Lord God of heaven and earth, that he would not take a wife to his Son of the Daughters of the Land: <pb n="59" facs="unknown:046269_0092_102116A82E6B54D0"/>But that he would take him a wife of his kindred: Such alſo was <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Jacob.</hi> In this particular alſo, <hi>Eſau</hi> offended; by marrying the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Heth,</hi> where there was no <hi>Union</hi> or kindred previous to the Marriage. From all which, it appears that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſpeech to <hi>Eve,</hi> was grounded upon that kindred <hi>Union</hi> which ſubſiſted between them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Marriage.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle had ſaid, that a Man and his Wife ſhould be one fleſh; he immediately adds, <hi>This is a great Myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and his Church.</hi> From whence we may obſerve, that the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> of which I have already ſpoken, was truly a figure of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church:</hi> And again, that this figure, though cloſe and pertinent, is but a figure; an imperfect repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, which made the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle turn from the fleſhly marriage, and ſay it is a great myſtery; and pointing to the Union of Chriſt and the People, as the grand truth or thing ſignified, ſay, <hi>but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> The Union and kindred relation of Adam and Eve, and of the Patriarchs and <pb n="60" facs="unknown:046269_0093_102116ACB05E6688"/>their Wives, previous to their marriage (the latter being ſubſequent to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and a poſitive proof thereof). ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the primitive Law: The earthly things being a pattern of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, repreſents the <hi>oneneſs of Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> Their marriage as a figure, ſhews our believing or cloſing with Chriſt by Faith: And that <hi>Union</hi> and kindred, which ſubſiſted between them before Marriage, was a ſhadow of the <hi>Union</hi> between Chriſt and his Church, before the Church is brought to the knowledge of her Huſband; by believing, or ere they are married unto him who is riſen from the dead: But, as marriage is the conſummate end of <hi>Union,</hi> it is to be conſidered as explanatory of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings contained therein; it ſhews the <hi>Woman</hi> under her <hi>Huſband's</hi> name, in a joint poſſeſſion; and enjoyment with him, of his ſtate and condition. As one fleſh they cannot be inſenſible of each other's ſtate, but muſt naturally feel pain, eaſe, hunger, thirſt, joy, ſorrow, happineſs, and unhappineſs; cannot poſſibly hate each other, becauſe no man hateth his own fleſh. As one fleſh they have but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, one aim, and end, are not twain <pb n="61" facs="unknown:046269_0094_102116AF79575628"/>in any condition, but conſtantly one in all things. If this idea of marriage is true, it is eaſily perceived that it is only true in Chriſt. Previous to our marriage by Faith with him who is riſen from the dead, there is a diſcovery made of his perſon, of his being our kinſman redeemer, of his right to demand us: hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears wrong to refuſe him, nor are we under the <hi>compulſion</hi> of that divine right which he hath to us, only; but he alſo ſhews us his glory, his perſonal beauties, his ſuitableneſs to our wants, and this he doth, until our <hi>Reaſon</hi> is convinced, our objections ſilenced, and the full conſent of all our powers gained, to be his; to bear his name, to commit ourſelves fully to him, with all our concerns; until we ceaſe from care, contented and rejoiced that he ſhould cloath us, feed us, inſtruct us, protect, nouriſh, guide and preſerve us unto everlaſting life. The conſcience judging of Chriſt (thus revealing himſelf) that he is pure, accepted of God and lovely, diſcerning withal the right of appropriation (from <hi>Union</hi> and relation unto him) joins itſelf in affinity unto him: yea, puts him on, wrapping itſelf in him; and thus ſtanding in his ſtate and <pb n="62" facs="unknown:046269_0095_102116B10C1A6B50"/>condition, it is purged from all guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and retaining no conſciouſneſs of evil, it is holily bold towards God, having <hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Union</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> is a matter univerſally acknowledged; where that deference, which is juſtly due <pb n="65" facs="unknown:046269_0098_102116B9ED2D8D40"/>to the ſcriptures, is paid; though, it is a ſubject very rarely treated of: Which ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence concerning it, implies, either a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ignorance of the nature thereof, or, that it is reſpected as a matter, neither conducive to the glory of God; nor the happineſs of mankind; and therefore not neceſſary to be taught. And where the nature thereof is in ſome meaſure known amongſt men, and the utility of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine allowed, they are much divided about its antiquity; before our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Faith in Chriſt, ſay ſome: Whilſt others with as much ſtrenuouſneſs aſſert the contrary. But, if what I have already offered to the conſideration of the public, ſhall be allowed to have any weight, or argumentative force; it will appear, that our <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not only antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our Faith, and believing, but alſo to all that <hi>he</hi> did, and ſuffered, for us men and for our ſalvation. The matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the goſpel to be believed is true: And relates to the Perſon of Chriſt, and his benefits. That he was the Son of God, the Chriſt, the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>I am,</hi> is a matter propoſed to be believed, upon the credit of the divine teſtimony: Becauſe this is a truth, therefore it is to <pb n="66" facs="unknown:046269_0099_102116BB8E076E40"/>be believed, and as it is a truth before believing; it is evident that it is not made a truth by believing; but is in itſelf a truth, perfect, and permanent, whether believed or not.</p>
            <p>So alſo with relation unto his Benefits, that the Father is well pleaſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, is a truth; to be believed: And not to be made a truth, by believing. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and as a Cloud thy ſins, turn unto me, for I have redeemed thee.</hi>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">John xvii. 22.</note> But to be brief, what hath already been urged to prove the neceſſity of <hi>Union,</hi> proves it to be alſo before faith; it being neceſſary unto the <pb n="70" facs="unknown:046269_0103_102116CB68D39960"/>Father's loving <hi>us,</hi> as he loved his <hi>Son,</hi> yea unto his choice of us in his Son; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto the engagements of Chriſt on man's behalf; otherwiſe he had not the right of redemption: Neceſſary unto his ſuffering the Death of the Croſs for us, as hath been largely ſhewn in the former part of this work. It is alſo neceſſary unto our believing a truth, except it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that our faith, or believing, makes it a truth. Indeed the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>through faith we underſtand the worlds were framed by the word of God,</hi> but he doth not ſay that Faith made the worlds. So truly through Faith we underſtand our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with <hi>Chriſt</hi>; yet it is not our Faith that makes it.</p>
            <p>But if it is not true until our believing, and by means thereof; then doth believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make that a truth, which was not a truth, and ſaith creates its own object, and then embraces it. This looks like the heathen Idolatry, firſt making their gods and then traiting in them. Or, like Milton's adventurous flight of Satan, through Chaos into the new world; which he performed before the bride was made. That this is contrary to the Scriptures is <pb n="71" facs="unknown:046269_0104_102116CED3196780"/>EVIDENT FROM<note n="*" place="bottom">I John v. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> The truth here propoſed to be believed is this, that God hath given to us eternal life in his Son; and that this is a truth before it is believed, is evident; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it doth not appear, how our unbelief makes God a liar. Beſides, to deny this truth, is to depreciate the ſacrifice of Jeſus; and to make it an inſufficient atonement for ſin; without faith and compliance on our part: Thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the glory of Chriſt, and the truth of the promiſes made unto him, wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the will and actions of the creature. And how fully this fruſtrates the grace of God, I leave unto every man who knows himſelf, to determine. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I take it, that where the all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the ſacrifice of Jeſus to put away ſin, and that without any act of ours, either mental or external, is denied; it amounts to what the Scriptures call a crucifying of the Son of God afreſh, and putting him to open ſhame. But to <pb n="72" facs="unknown:046269_0105_102116D1D55A6E40"/>acknowledge the all-ſufficiency of the ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to put away ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any act of ours; and yet to deny this a truth until believed, (viz. that he hath put away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) is a palpable contradiction; a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition founded in prejudice and obſtinacy, without the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are to conſider ſuch a confeſſion, as containing an equivocation; and when they confeſs the ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put away Sin, they make it ſynonimous with the Sorrow, Hatred, Fear, Faith, Love, Joy, &amp;c. which they feel in their own boſoms: Thereby making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the perſon and perſonal ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they embrace a phantaſm. Of this ſpake the Saviour, when he ſaid falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſhould ariſe and deceive many. And indeed, our modern profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſeems to be taking large ſtrides towards this deception; where paſſion, humour and pride is oppoſed unto the Lord that bought us. Or, will there yet be ſome way found out, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile its being a truth <hi>before</hi> believing, with its becoming a truth <hi>by</hi> believing? A poſition of this ſort might ſuit the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of <hi>Scotue</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> but the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition <pb n="73" facs="unknown:046269_0106_102116D35D2424E0"/>thereof, would be too laboured, artificial and ſophiſtical, for Honeſty and common Senſe. The Goſpel is plain, ſimple and unartificial, ſuited to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity; and would be more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known, was it not for that unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtimate which men ſet on themſelves, on account of their learning, wiſdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thence judging themſelves qualified to direct the conſciences of their fellow-creatures, they will not ſuffer them to think for themſelves; nor commend them to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the word of his Grace; but always amuſing them with an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial religion, conſiſting of directions how to attain to Faith, to Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet to conſent that they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that the agency of the ſpirit is free as the wind: With reſolving caſes of conſcience, and thereby appropriating the authority of Lawgivers withal giving ſuch definitions of ſaving faith, true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as none but ſchoolmen can underſtand: Thereby puzzling the minds of people, puſſing up the vain and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated with pride and arrogance, from a ſuppoſition of their being poſſeſſed of thoſe excellencies; and diſtracting the minds of the more phlegmatick and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, <pb n="74" facs="unknown:046269_0107_102116D666FFB420"/>through the fear of their <hi>not</hi> being poſſeſſed of them. But ſhould mankind be releaſed from thoſe chains, and ſuffered to think for themſelves, how natural would it be for them to conclude when God propoſes a matter in his word to be believed, that that matter is true before they have believed it. Therefore, if it is true, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification, and that before our faith, that which was neceſſary unto this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, namely our <hi>Union</hi> with him, is true alſo before faith. If it is not our faith or believing that makes this <hi>Union,</hi> then it is an act of eternal love, the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began;</hi> the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which is obvious, nor may its date be fixed, becauſe exceeding the limits of time. And what hath been from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting will be unto everlaſting, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſameneſs of the perſon of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> being an undeniable proof of the unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this <hi>Union.

            <p>The old trite objection, of its tending unto Licentiouſneſs, leads the way, ſaying if <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the ground of our acceptance with God, and our ſecurity in his favour; then the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, is overthrown; and man hath nothing left to ſtimulate him to virtue.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To work from an expectation of being rewarded, is to make it of Debt; and not of Grace: But the nature of the Deity is ſo infinitely pure; ſo holy, juſt, and true his Laws; that it is impoſſible Man ſhould make him his Debtor: Nay it would be the higheſt arrogance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it: The <hi>ſcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the obedience of fear, is diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite unto the obedience of faith: The former, hath its riſe and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from a <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, that ſuch an obedience, is far from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate, for the deſpight done thereby to the ſpirit of Grace, and diſhonour to the crucified One, they ſhall ſooner or later know; when all their works ſhall be burnt up, and they ſhall ſuffer loſs. But the obedience of faith is genuine, free from artifice, without fear, dependant on the perfect amity of God; yea, conſiſts in a conſtant perſuaſion <hi>of,</hi> and rejoicing <hi>in</hi> this truth; that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God, died upon a croſs, and roſe again from the dead, having thereby juſtified us, from every charge once brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; and ſanctiſied us from all our pollutions: To ſubmit unto <hi>this,</hi> to have the conſcience purified thro' the view and belief of <hi>this,</hi> yea to have every thought brought in captivity unto <hi>this,</hi> is the true obedience of faith.

And as this is needful to be known, ſo is it alſo, that we ſhould be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh one from the other; elſe how doth it appear that we rightly divide the word of life? If the Goſpel be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as God's good ſayings, or glad Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to mankind, we need only conſider briefly the ſtate and condition of Man; and then, what may with any propriety, be called glad Tydings, unto one thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, will eaſily appear. Man is a fallen creature, who breaking the Law of his God, incurred the penalty of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death: And, is ſo far from having ability to extricate himſelf, that all the imaginations, and thoughts of his heart, are continually evil; without wiſdom, without ſtrength, there being none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, no, not one; all being ſhut up, and concluded under ſin, they have neither power to <hi>will,</hi> nor to <hi>do</hi>; Now, what can be called glad Tydings unto a Creature in this condition? ſurely nothing ſhort of <pb n="82" facs="unknown:046269_0115_102116F1FAFB55B0"/>that which tells him all is given: And that freely, without condition on <hi>his</hi> part becauſe he can perform none; without <hi>Money,</hi> and without <hi>Price,</hi> becauſe he hath nought wherewith to purchaſe; and that the Grace, which redieſſeth all his griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and replemshed him with all good, is given him in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who hath brought this life, and immortality to light by the Goſpel; by his Birth, Life, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Death, and Reſurrection; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming all <hi>his</hi> bleſſing, and Glory, unto his <hi>Church,</hi> by the Grace of <hi>Union:</hi> This appears to be the goſpel of glad Tydings, and is a Doctrine with which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures abound.</p>
            <p>The Law, is conſidered as the very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite of <hi>this;</hi> conſiſting of commands, to fulfil its precepts on pain of damnation, of threatnings, and curſes, againſt all who offend it, tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Doctrine of rewards and puniſhments, is <pb n="83" facs="unknown:046269_0116_102116F3C78C1930"/>indeed contained in the Law; but then, it rewards none but ſuch who fulfil every jot, and tittle thereof: And curſeth every one, who continueth not to do <hi>all</hi> that is written in the Book thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Goſpel</hi> gives us all, without requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought of us. But the <hi>Law,</hi> giving us nothing, requires all of us. And thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing them in the ſcriptures, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the <hi>Law,</hi> unto the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> Our Authority for ſo doing, is founded on what follows; whatſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith unto them that are under it: But <hi>Jeſus</hi> was made of a woman, made under the Law, therefore the Law ſpeaks unto <hi>him;</hi> and commands <hi>him</hi> to perfect obedience. But, the Law can only curſe the ſinner: God ſent <hi>his Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh, he was made ſin for us, Chriſt hath delivered us from the Curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us:</hi> The equity of which proceeding, appears from the <hi>Union</hi> ſubſiſting between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi>; of which I have ſufficiently ſpoken.

And, according to the conſciouſneſs we have of our ſalvation ſtate, ſtanding here; we are free from the fear of <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> puniſhment: Having ſeen the <hi>end</hi> of it in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and therefore are no longer to be influenced thereby. And as the promiſed reward, the promiſes were made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed; which ſeed according to the Apoſtle) is Chriſt; it is alſo to be obſerved, that <hi>previous</hi> unto inheriting the promiſe, there muſt be a fulfilling of the Law; to make it appear that the promiſes of God are not againſt the Law.

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xvi. 17.</note> It is evident, that our Saviour means by <hi>this</hi> Law <hi>that</hi> which was given upon Sinai: nor did he give any new commandment, which was not included in that Law, as appears from his teſtimony elſewhere. But, when I aſſert that the promiſes are only fulfilled on ſuch whom the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of, and that <hi>Jeſus only</hi> was the Man thus approved of God; I conſider him, under the capacity of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> including the <hi>People</hi> in himſelf; who, by <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> inherit the bleſſing. And though they can upon this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, claim the forgivneſs of Sin, as an act of Juſtice in God; yet are they ſaved by Grace: Their Election in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> their eternal life, with all the bleſſings thereof, was God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Grace, given them in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> before the world began; according <pb n="90" facs="unknown:046269_0123_10211700950DEC50"/>to which grace they are ſaved. Again, as it was <hi>Grace</hi> that founded, ſo was it <hi>Grace</hi> that executed this Plan of Salvation; we being paſſive in the hand of <hi>Grace,</hi> when <hi>he</hi> waſhed us from our Sins in his own Blood, when <hi>he</hi> created us a-new, and preſented us unto <hi>himſelf,</hi> a glorious Church without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; <hi>we</hi> as in <hi>him,</hi> being in paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; inactive and incapable of merit, makes that to be meer <hi>Grace</hi> unto <hi>us</hi> as individuals, which unto <hi>him</hi> as including mankind was conditional.</p>

I would only aſk, is it from the belief of our <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſalvation in him; or from the diſbelief thereof; that occaſion is taken to live in unbelief, and believing counted unneceſſary?

            <p>Every man, propoſing a ſyſtem unto his fellow-creatures, doth it with a view that they ſhould believe it; be it true or falſe; ſo alſo, when <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſalvation in him before they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, is taught the people; is it not with a view that they ſhould believe it; and believing, rejoice, with joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of Glory?

Thus our natural ideas of Juſtice, Truth, Mercy, Love, &amp;c. (as ſimple before debauched with paſſion and prejudice) are improved by the ſcriptures: Until he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the infinite difference between the nature of God, and the nature of man; the <hi>former</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears Holy, Juſt, True, Merciful and Gracious, whilſt the <hi>latter</hi> is quite the reverſe: every man living being altogether vanity. If its poſſible thoſe our ideas of the divine perfections ſhould be wrong, then have we no rule whereby to diſcern between good and evil; we may give up the ſcriptures, renounce the evidence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhut our ears to its voice, and commence Scepticks in right earneſt: we may no longer reprove any thing a Man can poſſibly be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, for fear loſt from a wrong idea of the disine perfection, we ſhould reprove the Good. And yet ſuch is the pride of Man, that rather than he will be thought ignorant, or give up any indefenſible Tenet imbibed, he will ſhelter himſelf from the attacks of Truth under ſuch pleas as theſe: How know we whether our ideas of the divine perfections are right or not thus to ſap the argument of his antagoniſt, he would fain remove the foundation, yea renounce the only Authority which <hi>he</hi> or <hi>any other</hi> has to conclude his own tenets right. Where the ſcriptures are acknowledged, the divine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are confeſs'd the <hi>origin</hi> of that revelation: the <hi>latter</hi> being always conſidered as a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of <hi>his</hi> nature and properties: And there we find Him declared Holy, Juſt, Righteous, True, Wife, Merciful, Love, &amp;c. Nor hath he left us in the dark concerning the meaning of thoſe Terms; but by his commands, promiſes, threatnings and prohibitions, and in the later Days more perfectly by the Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Son; he hath diſtinguiſhed the <hi>good</hi> from the <hi>evil,</hi> ſeparating between the precious and the vile. After <hi>ſuch</hi> an exhibition of the divine properties, we are no longer at a loſs to conceive of them with certainty; but are taught to look for Truth in the harmony of them: it being found there, and only there. True it is, no man can comprehend <hi>him,</hi> nor by <hi>ſearching find him out to perfection</hi>: Nay we ſee but in part, we know but in part; nevertheleſs, we <hi>apprehend</hi> and <hi>conceive</hi> of him, and by what we underſtand of him, we determine with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Therefore, whatſoever appears contrary to his perfections, according to what we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend of him, muſt be <hi>much</hi> more contrary with <hi>him,</hi> in proportion as his excellencies and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge exceeds what we can poſſibly know of him: And here all proportion fails, and is loſt for ever.</note> And, I am perſuaded that <pb n="102" facs="unknown:046269_0135_102117242BE2B5F0"/>this imagination is very natural unto all ſuch who have ſeen human nature in its <pb n="103" facs="unknown:046269_0136_1021172C05C5F378"/>ruins; and, ſtriving with all wiſdom, power, and diligence, to repair its breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <pb n="104" facs="unknown:046269_0137_1021172D8DF84B40"/>have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The precept, the threatening, the promiſe, and gracious declaration, are all jumbled together; often overthrowing by one, what they have ſet up by the other. But in <hi>Chriſt</hi> they all agree in one: in him the precept is fulfilled, the threatening endured, the promiſed reward received, and the free and eternal ſalvation of God, continually <pb n="107" facs="unknown:046269_0140_102117392D579EC8"/>embracing the Children of Men: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtanding in the Grace of <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are at peace with all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>He</hi> in us and <hi>we</hi> in him, have fulfilled all righteouſneſs, fully kept the commandments of God, and ſuffered the puniſhment due unto our ſins, and now inherit the promiſe, whilſt the voice of words, yea every terrifying ſound is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced; and nothing now heard but the ſound of Grace, Love, and good will. <hi>Jeſus</hi> is now the ſhield of our Faith, by which we reſiſt the fiery darts of the wicked one, would he come upon us with the threatening; and urge, becauſe we anſwer the Character of the Sinner threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, it muſt be executed upon us. Unto this fiery dart we oppoſe our ſhield <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>made a curſe for us:</hi> would he ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the Precept, and inſiſt, on our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, becauſe we cannot fulfil it; we ſtill hold up our ſhield, and plead <hi>Chriſt the end of the Law for righteouſneſs.</hi> Will he trouble us about the promiſes, and urge that God is either unfaithful, (who hath promiſed) otherwiſe we are not the people unto whom they are made, becauſe we do not inherit them, have not the pure heart, the right ſpirit, do not yet ſee all <pb n="108" facs="unknown:046269_0141_1021173AB33FE750"/>things put under our feet, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> our ſhield is ſtill our defence; we anſwer <hi>but we ſee Jeſus,</hi> and can teſtify that he who hath promiſed, is faithful; for <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath the clean Heart, the right Spirit, the Heart which hath the Law written therein, that it may not depart from God; we ſee all things put under his feet, <hi>inſomuch that all the promiſes of God are in him, yea, and in him,</hi> Amen. Where <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is manifeſt; it is enough for ſalvation and happineſs, in time and eternity, that <hi>he</hi> hath ſuffered, that <hi>he</hi> was obedient, that the promiſe is fulfilled in <hi>him,</hi> becauſe being joint heirs with <hi>him,</hi> we have a juſt claim unto <hi>his</hi> inheritance; hither are we led unto righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>This man is our Peace,</hi> yea even when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> comes into the land; our <hi>Union</hi> with him is our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and defence againſt the face of the enemy: and as I have hinted before, his fiery darts cannot hurt the ſoul that abides in <hi>him</hi>; we are then able to reſiſt them all, by holding up our ſhield, by oppoſing <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto all: He being <hi>our Sun and our Shield,</hi> not only our ſhield for defence, but our ſun to enlighten and quicken us unto the uſe thereof. Did men but know <pb n="109" facs="unknown:046269_0142_1021173C3AE62BB8"/>what ſafety and peace we have here, they would deſpair of terrifying us, as they hope to do, by their writings and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: loading us with opprobrious names, and ignorantly levelling the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings and curſings in the ſcriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.

What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with Man, is poſſible with God. If we read the Scriptures out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they require impoſſibilities of us: hence it is, that ſome who are aware of this, and yet ignorant of the power of God, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to have recourſe unto new Laws; Laws of their own making, where, by a ſincere intention and all poſſible obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they would evade the force of the ſcripture perfection, and put a foil upon the ſword of the ſpirit; But truth needs <pb n="110" facs="unknown:046269_0143_1021173E110EF180"/>no artifice; unto this ſword, unſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is that which at firſt authorizes, excites and encourages us to credit the Goſpel report. This is that, which ſtrengthens in us what is often <pb n="117" facs="unknown:046269_0150_102117559A7573E8"/>ready to die. This is that which raiſes us when fallen, which bring us back when we have wandered, and affords ſtrong Conſolation, unto all who have fled unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> for refuge; hence if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the righteous, &amp;c. whilſt <hi>he</hi> wears the Character of righteous, <hi>we</hi> ſhall be accepted of God, and Glorious in his ſight: And that is everlaſtingly, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>ſame Yeſterday, To-day and for ever.</hi> The Goſpel is here a relation of facts, of who <hi>Jeſus</hi> is, what he hath <hi>done,</hi> and that he hath loved us, hath <hi>ſaved</hi> us; hath waſhed, forgiven and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted us; the divine beauty, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of which, appears in the Grace of <hi>union.</hi> This Grace doth not require us, ſophiſtically and unnaturally, to make that a truth by believing; which was not a truth before; but firſt propoſes <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the truth, the grand original truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, and by whom all things conſiſt.

Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> is Grace, and <hi>Eſau</hi> is Works, the one obtaining what he had not expected, nor ſought after; Whilſt the other, who ſought it carefully with tears, obtained it not. Yea, and where there hath been a drawing back, a falling away from the truth as it is in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> until ſunk in Miſery and Darkneſs, until having nothing left them to look at but themſelves, they are affrighted, and at their wits end: Unto them would I call and exhort them not to ſorrow as men without hope; becauſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> is alive, and <pb n="122" facs="unknown:046269_0155_102117651F4FD2C8"/>liveth for evermore. Your God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,e is not diſappointed in you; you have not deceived him: He never expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing from you, more, or leſs, than what he hath found. The ſatisfaction which he had in you at firſt, was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you as the travail of his ſoul, and as ſuch, he beholds you ſtill. Your unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief cannot make his grace of none effect, and though you have denied him, yet he cannot deny himſelf. That which was a truth before you believed, at the firſt, <hi>viz. Chriſt</hi> being your <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> is a truth now, even when you have ceaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: Inſomuch, that in every time of need, though you have ſadly departed from him, you have the ſame foundation, authority and encouragement, to believe and be aſſured as you had at the firſt. It is the ſcripture teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> what <hi>he</hi> is, and what <hi>he</hi> hath done, and ſuffered, that is the ground of our confidence; and not the reflection that <hi>we</hi> repent, believe, or obey; and it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this ground remaineth, that this foundation is unſhaken, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is <hi>the ſame Yeſterday, To-day, and for ever</hi>; and that <hi>our</hi> unbelief, or any change paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <pb n="123" facs="unknown:046269_0156_10211767F626B778"/>over <hi>us,</hi> as in ourſelves, cannot alter him who is unchangeable, and always Righteous and accepted. In him we are always as He is, according to which ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude God always beholds us, and accepts us; therefore, our change of frame or diſpoſition, cannot change His views of us; for, as he only beholds us in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> He can always ſay that <hi>he beholds no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor perverſeneſs in</hi> Iſrael. <hi>The Lord his God is</hi> always <hi>with him, and the ſhout of a King is among them.</hi> O! glorious Grace! O triumphant Love! let him who is fallen from hence, ſay, rejoice not againſt me, O mine enemy, for though I fall, I ſhall yet ariſe. Doth not this teſtimony quicken unto faith, and confidence in <hi>Jeſus!</hi> Doth it not obviate and ſilence <hi>all</hi> the complaints and objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the broken and deſpairing Spirit, and bring back to the Saviour, that which was driven away? ſurely it does. Thus from the Grace of <hi>Union,</hi> which renders <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuch an High Prieſt as becometh us, we obtain favour, and find Grace to help us in every time of need. Salvation and Perfection in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, by <hi>Union</hi> with Him, is that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Truth, which firſt authorizes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages <pb n="124" facs="unknown:046269_0157_1021176B364979E8"/>and influences to believe: and that which preſerves us ſpotleſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, when we fail to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and credit his teſtimony; and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above all other conſiderations, hath a tendency to raiſe us in our hope and confidence towards God; and to preſerve us from deſperation. It is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and unnatural, to charge this Doctrine with having a tendency to indulge people in unbelief. Conſidering the condition of Man, and the teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I would challenge all the maſters of Iſrael, to produce a ſyſtem more powerfully tending to reconcile Man unto God, and to raiſe the doubtful Soul unto confidence in Him: let all ſuch who (through the experience of human weakneſs, or the power of temptation, are fallen from the faith of the Son of God, and ſunk to the Hell of their ſenſes, conſider this matter, and renew their ſtrength as Eagles.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, from the grace of <hi>Union,</hi> we are taught to conſider <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the hero of the ſcripture. All the members bring their tribute unto him, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted head. If what I have already aimed at proving, is true; that primarily as the <pb n="125" facs="unknown:046269_0158_1021176E8160D438"/>head of his body the church, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made unto him, all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings fall upon him, &amp;c. then by him we inherit, by him we have atoned; we claim no good out of him, nor will we acknowledge the evil, for as much as in him we have been purged. All the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous characters in the ſcripture are his, and are only <hi>typical</hi> in the perſons unto whom they are given in the letter; which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evident, from the contraſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in every one of them; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all guilty of vices, diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the virtues for which they are famous; Righteous <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> both charged with Drunkenneſs, and one with horrid inceſt. Faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> with ciſtruſt, meanneſs of ſpirit, lying or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating, as in the caſe of <hi>Saran.</hi> Meek <hi>Moſes,</hi> with unwarrantable paſſion, unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſpeech, and ſuch ſwellings at the waters of ſtrife as barred his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the promiſed land. It charges holy. <hi>David,</hi> the man after God's own heart, with ſuch weakneſſes and crimes, as are by no means conſiſtent with holineſs; but were a glaring proof of his heart being very unlike the heart of God. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſo famous for wiſdom, had his dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: <pb n="126" facs="unknown:046269_0159_10211771ED7BA570"/>how great were his follies! And whilſt much might be ſaid for his wiſdom, how many inſtances might be given of the moſt ſtupid and God provoking fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs in him. <hi>Job</hi> alſo, admired for his patience, gave the moſt pregnant proofs of impatience and peeviſhneſs. It will be natural to inquire from hence, why the ſcriptures which gives thoſe men the moſt beautiful and amiable characters, as righteous, faithful, meek, holy, wiſe and patient, ſhould at the ſame time, preſent us with a contraſt in each of them, drawn in ſuch ſtrong colours, that the moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable contradiction appears? The anſwer is eaſy, Let God be true and every man a liar. Thoſe men were all types of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> their characters figurative of his. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divine wiſdom thought proper, not only to ſtain their glory, by ſuffering ſuch blemiſhes in their ſpirit and conduct, as gave the lie unto their virtues, but alſo to record the ſame; that at beſt they might appear but meer ſhadows, reſerving the ſubſtance for <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Therefore, whoſo reading the characters of thoſe men, are not taught to look beyond them, unto the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> have yet read the ſcriptures to little purpoſe; having not yet known <pb n="127" facs="unknown:046269_0160_102117750EC5C0E8"/>them, nor the power of God. Neither the Prophets nor Apoſtles wrote with the view that ſuch who venerate their <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> ſhould have their <hi>perſons</hi> in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; neither theirs, whoſe character they drew, as eminent and famous, in the Church of God. But the ſpirit which mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, deſigned through the whole, the honour and glory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: that paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on from every man, we might attain to the admiration of the perſon and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the only Righteous, the only Faithful, the only Meek, Wife, Holy and Patient, until <hi>all</hi> with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wavering. Tongue, ſhall cry, Thou art altogether Lovely, worthy is the Lamb of the Kingdom and Glory. But leaſt any who are uſed to pleaſe themſelves with Mankind, having men's perſons in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhould think we deal hardly with the ſaints of old, (for it is often found more dangerous, even among Chriſtians, to ſpeak lightly of the pious men, than it is to ſpeak ſo of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) when we ſav that they were not the men which they are repreſented to be, their conduct and behaviour conſidered:—I would here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe what will be equally obnoxious unto them, that thoſe perſons were really <pb n="128" facs="unknown:046269_0161_1021177821745C90"/>what the ſcriptures ſay they were, that is, Righteous, Faithful, Meek, Holy, Wiſe, Patient, &amp;c. without any exception: they were ſo in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I know the Jew, however Chriſtianiſed by Profeſſion, will either rave or ſneer at this; but let him; He that ſitteth in the Heavens will laugh him to ſcorn: and the Chriſtians <hi>indeed,</hi> will remain undiſturbed. I would calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſk, what is the medium between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Man?—If its not true of them in themſelves, as I have ſhewn it is not; nor true of them in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Greek and Jew inſinuates, where is it true of them? It muſt have its <hi>truth</hi> ſomewhere; I ſpeak unto you who acknowledge the ſcriptures. I am well aware of your Anſwer, viz. the Divine Wiſdom characteriſes them according to what they were in <hi>part</hi> and not in the <hi>whole.</hi> I would aſk ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, Have we any other Rule for the trial of right and wrong, good and evil, than the Divine Law? And doth not the Law demand perfection? Doth it not when broken in one point, declare the tranſgreſſor guilty of the whole? Doth it not curſe whomſoever continueth not to do all things written in the Book thereof? And <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaith, that Heaven and Earth <pb n="129" facs="unknown:046269_0162_1021177D16BDCAE8"/>ſhall paſs away, but one jot or tittle of the Law ſhall not fail, until the whole be fulfilled. But having ſpoken of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, I refer you unto it: and ſhall only obſerve here, the arrogance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of aſſuming the Character of Righteous, Meek, Faithful, Holy, &amp;c. according to the works of our own Hands or habits of the Heart: This is flying in the face of God, and giving the lie to the Divine Perfections as revealed in the Law; yea, it is in fact a denying our only Lord God and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> for unto what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is he made Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption? Is it not that whoſoever glorieth, ſhould glory in the Lord? But when Perſons aſſume thoſe Characters from the conſideration of what they are in part, as in themſelves; they glory in themſelves and not in the Lord. This is that Antichriſt of whom we were told that He ſhould come, yea, was ſo early in the World as the Days of the Apoſtles; and prevails ſo mightily in the Chriſtian World at preſent that the generality of Chriſtains under <hi>his</hi> influence, are upon a level in Faith and Doctrine with the Jews: or but very faintly diſtinguiſhed from them: The <hi>Jew</hi> maintains the neceſſity <pb n="130" facs="unknown:046269_0163_102117803AD21B00"/>of inward, and outward holineſs in every Man, and looks for the <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come: The <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> eſpecially the reformed, with ſuperior ardour, and repeated aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, declares for the ſame way of holineſs, and looks alſo for a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come; an inward Chriſt, conſiſting of gracious habits, pious breathings, ſincere and upright diſpoſitions, and which in effect, is to agree with the Jew, in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Man of Galilee, who was crucified without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the reign of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erius,</hi> was not the true <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Or according to the <hi>higheſt Idea</hi> of him, was but the figure of an inward and Spiritual <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come: thus Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly denying the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come in the Fleſh. Again there are others, who would be diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Jew,</hi> by confeſſing that the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, and that according to his Obedience, Death and Reſurrection, he is the remote cauſe of Man's Salvation. But, then it ſeems if he is not applied, he is no <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all. Hence it is, that many who call themſelves Preachers of the Goſpel of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> make uſe of this expreſſion, <hi>An unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Chriſt is no Chriſt at all.</hi> What can a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> think of ſuch a vile Phraſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Come Life, come Death, I am ready: Thus can the falſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhew great Signs and Wonders. True it is, this is aſcribed to different cauſes; one cries, Why me, Why me, <pb n="136" facs="unknown:046269_0169_1021179316EC7FF0"/>What am I that I ſhould be ſo bleſt! and talks of diſcriminating Grace, as though God was a reſpecter of perſons.

Thus however things are aſcribed to different cauſes, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent terms made uſe of, yet the ſame <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is intended; and all come to this <pb n="137" facs="unknown:046269_0170_10211794E3B816B8"/>point at laſt: that the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a compound of religious qualities, and holy diſpoſitions in Men.

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I would not be underſtood as ſpeaking ſlightly of the Spirit of <hi>Truth,</hi> or of his operations in the Heart of Man, according to the ſcripture account thereof: which, is there undeniably made to conſiſt in receiving of the Things which are his, (viz. Chriſt's,) and in ſhewing them unto us: that Jeſus Chriſt alone might be glorified: and this the Spirit is conſtantly engaged in, until we anſwer fully in Heart, and Mind, unto the Character of the true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; <hi>who worſhip God in the ſpirit, rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> But the Spirit of Error, reverſes this Character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretends to ſhew mankind other excellencies than what are found in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſuch as refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, changes, pious motions and deſires in themſelves: and this it doth, until their worſhip of God dwindle into Form, their rejoicing be in the work of their own Hands, and all their confidence be in things of the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Antichriſt, or the falſe Spirit, ſeeks not the Glory of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; but ſpeaks of himſelf, of its own operations: of Joys, Sorrows, Hatred to the Evil, and Languiſhment after Goodneſs; by him wrought on the Heart: and teaches his anointed ones, to conclude <hi>thence,</hi> that they are favourites of Heaven: to look on themſelves as greatly diſtinguiſhed amongſt Mankind, by what they call inherent holineſs: Yea, and to be Jealous of the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it holds forth to man, the Teſtimony of Salvation; bound up, and ſealed, where <hi>Jeſus</hi> is Alpha and Omega. This Spirit, inſinuates that the Doctrine which treats of the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of His Life, Sufferings, Death, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; of our being juſtified and ſanctified in Him; is a very <hi>Dangerous,</hi> if not a <hi>Diabolical</hi> Doctrine, and chiefly, becauſe if it does not immediately <hi>oppoſe,</hi> it teaches to <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard</hi> the work of the Spirit upon the Heart: will not ſuffer men to look unto that quarter for comfort: will not admit of it as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Heaven: nor ſuffer them from thence to exalt themſelves above their Fellows: but will always be propoſing <hi>Jeſus</hi> as a ſalve for every ſore, and a perfect redreſs of all grievances. Thus Antichriſt accuſes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, (becauſe he gloriſies <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) of Hereſy: in denying the work of the Spirit upon the Heart: and ſupported by Tradition, and its Cloud of witneſſes, it ſtorms ſo violently, prates and inſinuates ſo ſucceſsfully, that it hath almoſt joſtled Chriſtianity out of the World: and hath introduced inſtead thereof, groſs Enthuſiaſm, Self-righteouſneſs, Bigotry, and Superſtition, amongſt the more zealouſly religious part of Mankind, and amongſt ſuch who are <hi>leſs</hi> concerned, Deiſm; with all the pride of moral virtues.

If it <hi>does,</hi> receive it; if it does <hi>not,</hi> reject it; let it be what it will. From hence it is evident, that this Holineſs <hi>within them,</hi> hath infinitely the Preference before the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince He ſhall not be allowed to plead his own Cauſe, where there is the leaſt Suſpicion of his Doctrine claſhing with their Conceptions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Holineſs, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them: Like the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Antagoniſts, they will then put their Fingers in their Ears, and run down his Teſtimony with Noiſe and Tumult.

Yea, he ſuffered the Tempter to ſift him like wheat; to ruſh upon him with all his policy and power, by every Gate of Hell; to try him with Deſpair, Preſumption, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther, and with an inordinate love of Life; by uſing the moſt extravagant means for the preſervation thereof: yea even to hazard his knowledge of him ſelf, of his own Dignity and Glory, as the Son of God, upon the ſucceſs thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus ſeeking, if by any means he might oblige him to deviate from his own Law, and rule of righteouſneſs, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets.

How conſpicuous his love, through the things which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered! many Waters could not quench it, neither could the Floods drown it. His meekneſs! how apparent, when as a Lamb led to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep before her ſhearers Dumb, he opened not his Mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, nor did he hide his face from ſhame and ſpitting, but calmly gave his Back to the ſmiters, and his Cheeks, to them who plucked off the Hair. Theſe, and every other Godlike diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and perfection, ſhining in Him, through his Life and Death, renders him at <hi>once</hi> the object of wonder, delight and pleaſure.

            <head>A SUPPLEMENT UNTO THE FOREGOING TREATISE ON THE DOCTRINE OF UNION: EXHIBITING A SPECIMEN OF APOSTOLIC PREACHING.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the Apoſtles Preaching, appears, when among Jews and Gentiles, they taught that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the Meſſiah, the Son of God; and that he was crucified unto Death, and on the third Day roſe again from the Dead, for the Forgiveneſs of Sins, and the Juſtification of Mankind. And this they proved from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Prophets, from the pattern ſhewn unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, and by undoubted miracles wrought in the Name of that Jeſus whom they Preached. All who believed their Teſtimony, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſenſible of Salvation: there were no ſuch doubts as theſe amongſt them then, viz. How do I know whether he died for me, or whether I am particularly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, &amp;c. Thoſe queries and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms, are of later date than the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Age: and owe their exiſtence unto the wiſdom of this world, which in the decline of true Chriſtianity, took place of <pb n="155" facs="unknown:046269_0188_102117D09CE650C0"/>that primitive ſimplicity, with which the firſt Preachers of <hi>Jeſus</hi> bare witneſs of Him. They had their riſe from the diſtinctions made amongſt men: of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, and Reprobate, as unqualified, for the Grace of the Goſpel: of Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as having a <hi>right</hi> to believe their perſonal intereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi>: or unfruitful, whoſe intereſt in him is doubtful. Thoſe diſtinctions once concluded upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſelf-righteouſneſs, and ignorance of the ſcriptures; have, from generation to generation, been carefully handed down: Whilſt all the World aſſented to them, as traditions of gracious Men, taking it for granted, without <hi>impartial</hi> inquiry, that they were deducible from ſcripture.</p>
            <p>This, by degrees, rendered the things belonging to our peace ſo intricate, that the knowledge thereof was conſidered as wholly confined to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus are mankind taught to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs: where, upon the authority of ſome goodneſs wrought <hi>by</hi> them, or found <hi>in</hi> them, they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to conclude of the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and of their perſonal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But what ſhall that man do, who is aſſured that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. vi. 5.</note> whoſe goodneſs is as a morning cloud; and as the early dew it goeth away,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoſ. vi. 10.</note> and that he is as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, and all his righteouſneſs

I ſay, What ſhall the man do, who by deep experience, every day and hour is ſenſible of thoſe awful Truths, and knows them applicable to every child of Man? Who has a continual ſenſe of <pb n="157" facs="unknown:046269_0190_102117D3B847D258"/>his Poverty, Miſery, Blindneſs and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs According to the forementioned tradition he muſt deſpair and be damned accordingly: for thoſe Traditions ſay, it will avail him nothing to believe all that the Bible reports of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> if he has not good Works, good Fruits in himſelf, as more corroborating Evidences, more infallible Recommendations unto God, yea, as more undeniable marks of his acceptance with <hi>him</hi> than <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> than <hi>his</hi> Birth, Life, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion. Let us only compare thoſe concluſions with the Scriptures, and we ſhall quickly perceive them to be the very ſinews of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>It is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 15.</note> But Antichriſt ſays, You cannot be ſaved, except you are holy and good in yourſelf; nor ſhall the Death and Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> profit you, except you are changed and made fruitful in all good Works, Words and Thoughts. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that</hi> 
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:046269_0191_102117D54776BC70"/>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 5.</note> But Antichriſt ſaith, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not Juſtify the Ungodly; and that he Juſtifies only ſuch who are Godly: who are repentant, humble, meek, loving righteouſneſs, and hating iniquity. And where the fore-cited text ſhews us, that <hi>Chriſt's Faith</hi> is accounted for Righteouſneſs, to all ſuch who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not, believeth on him, as Juſtifying the Ungodly: Antichriſt ſays, You are Juſtified by <hi>your own Faith,</hi> which will produce Righteouſneſs in you, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it.

The ſcriptures ſay, that <hi>we are ſaved by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>;

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 8.</note> But Antichriſt ſays, there are <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> to be complied with and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, before you can be ſaved.

            </p>
            <p>From whence it is plain, that he who believeth not, hath eternal life given him in the Son of God, as fully as him who believeth: elſe it doth not appear how he could make God a liar, by not believing; nor, how the unbeliever can be <hi>cenſured</hi> for <pb n="160" facs="unknown:046269_0193_102117DE8C48FD30"/>not believing what was not true.

From the appearing of this Antichriſt in the world, we may date the AEra of the Apoſtacy, or falling away from the Apoſtles Doctrine; when Mankind began to entangle each other with their own Inventions. The Apoſtles, as I have hinted, preached the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſimple facts of his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as Juſtification and Forgiveneſs of Sins to the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi> It was enough that their hearers believed their report of the crucified One: and as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, the perſons thus believing, never once queſtioned but it was for them, <pb n="163" facs="unknown:046269_0196_102117E636147798"/>becauſe hitherto they had not been taught that <hi>any</hi> were excluded from it. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt had not as yet the <hi>boldneſs</hi> to affirm, that there were ſome amongſt Mankind, who though they heard of the Death and Reſurrection of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> yea, though they believed it, yet had no right to conclude it was for them. Nor had he as yet, propagated that ſubtil diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between the belief of the Truth, and the knowledge of their perſonal intereſt therein. For in thoſe days of undiſguiſed truth &amp; ſimplicity, when any man believed the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles concerning <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his heart exulted in the Truth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubtful of his intereſt therein. The <hi>belief of the Truth,</hi> and the <hi>purged conſcience,</hi> were then inſeparable. For the Teſtimony is, not only that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died and roſe again, ſuch as we might hear of ſome other Perſon, as <hi>Lazarus:</hi> but the <hi>truth</hi> is, that he died for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification: inſomuch that believing the truth, neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the knowledge of our perſonal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the latter is always in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the former. To diſtinguiſh between the belief of the Truth, and the knowledge of our <hi>intereſt</hi> therein, is the <pb n="164" facs="unknown:046269_0197_102117E7C17E2808"/>invention of a Spirit, who profeſſing Chriſtianity, would not be thought to be an unbeliever, but at the ſame time, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the teſtimony of a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> the <hi>inward witneſs,</hi> which the ſcriptures affirm to be the caſe with ſuch who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but full retaining a <hi>conſcience of ſin,</hi> he was obliged to ſcheme this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; to keep up his credit as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but ſuch a one as was doubtful of his perſonal intereſt in the truth believed. Yea, and to ward off all cenſure on this account, this doubtfulneſs muſt be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and cheriſhed, and ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to others, as prudent religious fear; from which we are very rarely to be delivered; and that only in proportion to our <hi>fruitfulneſs,</hi> as the effects of the Truth believed. And to make this the more plauſible, it is inſinuated that the greateſt danger lies on the ſide of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident believing; ſignifying, that men are rather damned for believing (which is called preſuming) than for doubting; thus from every quarter, Antichriſt aims by his Traditions, at making void the Word of God. It is very ſurprizing to obſerve, after a perſon hath made a great buſtle about <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and raiſed a duſt, by <pb n="165" facs="unknown:046269_0198_102117EAE1638028"/>propoſing a Truth to be believed, unclog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any conditions whatſoever in the perſon believing; requiring no other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in him, than what is naturally common to mankind; and that the truth which is thus to be believed, is none other than the ſimple fact of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death and Reſurrection: I ſay, after propoſing this, and quarreling with all the world about it, giving the hardeſt names, even unto ſuch, who only differed unhappily in the Mode of Expreſſion: To find <hi>ſuch a one</hi> ſink to this, that a man may believe the forecited truth, and not know his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in it; yea, have no intereſt at all in it; and that ſuch who <hi>have</hi> can only know it by their fruits, gives as a ſtriking proſpect of Antichriſtian policy, and makes us ſuſpect the intention, where it is propoſed to exalt Chriſt alone. The Scriptures aſſure us that Mankind as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are intereſted in the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi>: Therefore to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and believe that Truth <hi>properly,</hi> is to believe our perſonal intereſt in him. If it ſhould be objected, that Chriſt doth not now ſay to any individual, thy ſins are forgiven thee; I anſwer, he doth: for what he ſaid unto <hi>one,</hi> he ſaith unto <pb n="166" facs="unknown:046269_0199_102117EF6420BFB0"/>
               <hi>every one</hi> who believeth it: otherwiſe, we may ſay there is nothing in the Scriptures ſaid unto us; the Old Teſtament being written unto the <hi>Jews</hi>; the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome to one Church and ſome to another, but none to us: If we have not a right to believe that what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid unto them, he ſaid unto us; but, that we can only know our intereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by our fruits; is firſt a denial of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſpirit; except it is ſuppoſed that he bears witneſs by thoſe things, and not by <hi>Chriſt</hi>: which by the way, is to ſpeak of himſelf, &amp; prove himſelf a Spirit of Error. Again, it is to make our goodneſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the knowledge of our Salvation, which is a manifeſt going about to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our own righteouſneſs, as the <hi>medium at leaſt</hi> whereby we believe; and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Scripture; which ſaith, <hi>To him who worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the Ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> Again, it makes void the law: by not adhering to its determination, concerning good and evil: for were we always to determine of our good and evil by the perfect law, it would be much more eaſy, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pretender to piety, to <hi>number</hi> his good <pb n="167" facs="unknown:046269_0200_102117F48488DBB0"/>fruits, than it is to <hi>find</hi> them. Was <hi>this</hi> but truly conſidered amongſt mankind, we ſhould not have ſuch proud boaſtings, and pretenſions to know <hi>this,</hi> and the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> matter, by their good works, and holy fruits, as we <hi>have</hi> in the world. I might ſay, it ſmells much ſtronger of the Church of Rome, (if it does not look a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Deiſm) than of the Proteſtant Faith; but as that would be ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to ſuch who think the Romiſh Faith true, and the Proteſtant wrong; I ſhall content myſelf with ſaying, that it is a flat contradiction of the Apoſtles Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as I have in part, and ſhall yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew; though it would fain ſhelter itſelf under their Authority. Where thoſe, and the like Suggeſtions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt take place in any Heart, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are ſhocking; as to ſuch who are <hi>vain</hi> enough to imagine themſelves fruitful in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and from thence to draw concluſions; as they muſt firſt make to themſelves a new Law, before they can thus think: ſo muſt they of neceſſity be puffed up, and come into the character of the ſelf-righteous. And, as to ſuch who are not ſufficiently vain, to think themſelves thus fruitful, as they cannot <pb n="168" facs="unknown:046269_0201_1020EFE657760EC8"/>know their intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nought for them but miſery and fear; though they have <hi>this</hi> conſolation, to be taught that unbelief and gloom, is a much leſs dangerous ſtate, than an unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken confidence. It is eaſily ſeen, that thoſe propoſitions are calculated to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and increaſe the perplexities, doubts, and objections of Mankind, againſt the Goſpel of Jeſus: therefore is it, that we have many more of thoſe in the world <hi>now,</hi> than in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles preached <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and his Benefits, promiſcuouſly to ſinners, and did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reighten his Grace, by ſhewing that there were ſome who had no right to it; either from their being <hi>reprobated</hi> or from their being <hi>unqualified</hi>; but by Divine Authority, they preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every Creature, and every Man who was a Sinner, yea whether he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch or not, (for they ſpake of things as true with God, and not according to the conceptions of man) was ſufficiently <hi>qualified,</hi> and had an indiſputable right, to conclude the Saviour's Death, and Reſurrection, <hi>his</hi> Juſtification unto Life. And this much is to be underſtood by the <pb n="169" facs="unknown:046269_0202_102117F95F7BEBD8"/>Apoſtles aſſertions, <hi>We preach Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> And again, <hi>We preach not ourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord: And with great power, gave the Apoſtles witneſs of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lord Jeſus; and great Grace was upon them all.</hi> And again, <hi>he preached unto them Jeſus, and the Reſurrection.</hi> Thus, the Apoſtles dwelt altogether upon the fact of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death and Reſurrection amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> as the alone ſalvation of Mankind. And what <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf thought of it, is evident from that Heart exultation of his, <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again:</hi> Thus the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> without the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any other matter, in <hi>Heaven</hi> or in <hi>Earth,</hi> was the Joy of his Heart: Yea all his Hope, and all his Salvation. He ſhewed, that the fact of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was his exemption from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He viewed it, and rejoiced in it, as ſuch. And without doubt, what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be Truth, he preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, as he ſought not himſelf, in the things which he ſpake: The Glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the happineſs of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, being that which he had always in view, in preaching the Kingdom <pb n="170" facs="unknown:046269_0203_102117FCB19A16F0"/>of God. As to Mankind, the Apoſtles thought them ſufficiently qualified, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all concluded under Sin) for the Grace which they preached. They were taught to drop all diſtinctions, and no longer to conſider men as <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> as <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> and <hi>rejected:</hi> For ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> the Lord hath ſhewed me, that I ſhould not call any Man <hi>common</hi> or <hi>unclean.</hi> This was not becauſe mankind were reformed and better <hi>now,</hi> than when God taught the <hi>Jews</hi> to reſpect the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as common and unclean; which he did under the Law; where he forbid the <hi>Jews,</hi> to have any connection with the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and, if it was not owing to any Change in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they were now received, and were no longer to be conſidered as <hi>

               </hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> The Query is, What was it owing to? I anſwer, it was unto the Death and Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; for it was there that God had cleanſed them. Therefore was it, that when <hi>Peter</hi> refuſed to eat, in the Vition of the Sheet, ſaying, Nothing that was <hi>unclean,</hi> had at any time come into his mouth; He was anſwered, Call not thou that <hi>common</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi> which God hath cleanſed. Thus was he taught, that mankind who in <hi>themſelves</hi> 
               <pb n="171" facs="unknown:046269_0204_102117FFA6BA17D0"/>were <hi>unclean,</hi> were cleanſed of God in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>: according to which <hi>cleanſing,</hi> he was inſtructed to reſpect them; and that he ought not any more to call <hi>any Man uncommon or unclean.</hi> Therefore, it was the buſineſs of the Apoſtles, to tell the People what God had done for them: Namely, that he had loved them, and waſhed them from their ſins, in his own Blood. Thus as to <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> did the firſt witneſſes of <hi>Jeſus</hi> preach his Salvation unto the Children of Men. For where they tell us, that they preached the Son of God; that they preached <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Lord, <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meddling with the characters and conditions of thoſe unto whom they preached, to point them out, as qualified or unqualified for the reception of the Truth. I ſay, this their Matter and Manner of Preaching, plainly ſhews, that they did not aim at making a ſchiſm in the Body, by dividing the Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as having ſeparate intereſts: But, they aimed at ſhewing that the intereſt of the Head, was that of the Members: therefore was it, that holding the Head, they conſtantly preached <hi>his</hi> Excellence, <hi>his</hi> Labours, Triumphs and Honours; that the people as his Members, hearing of it, <pb n="172" facs="unknown:046269_0205_10211802969520C0"/>might hear of their own ſalvation and grace; becauſe, the glory which is given unto him, as the Head, he gives to us, as his Members. From this <hi>Union,</hi> it appears, that hearing and believing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the Apoſtles teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we hear and believe, what truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates unto ourſelves. And thus did they, by preaching the Obedience, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> preach the ſalvation of Mankind in him; thus lifting <hi>him</hi> up that he might draw all men unto him; and, that they might eſpouſe the people unto this <hi>one</hi> Huſband, as chaſte virgins unto this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they were cautious of meddling with the Characters of their Hearers, as <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as Repentant or Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant, leſt by making a Diſtinction, thoſe who thought themſelves on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable ſide of the queſtion, ſhould be lifted up, and their minds be adulterated, and rendered unchaſte to the Crucified one: Nay, they had always <hi>cauſticks</hi> at hand, for the proud Fleſh of their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wherever they ſaw it riſing; and this they applied without fear, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons of men in reſpect, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſaw occaſion. And how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Paul</hi> was in this particular, appears <pb n="173" facs="unknown:046269_0206_10211805DB76D2A0"/>from his reproving <hi>Peter,</hi> for giving the leaſt occaſion to the <hi>Jews</hi> to glory in the Fleſh, and keep up a diſtinction, which God had before ſhewn him an end of; where he actually forbad him to call that common and unclean, which he had cleanſed.</p>
            <p>This is a ſhort ſpecimen of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Matter and Manner of Preaching: and according to <hi>my</hi> Apprehenſion, it is obvious that they had the Union between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the people in view, when they thus preached.</p>
            <p>There are many who reſpect the Epiſtles, written by the Apoſtles to the Churches, as a pattern of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but they are to conſider, that there is a wide difference between private Letters, written unto ſuch who already believed on the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> wherein there is promiſcuouſly thrown out ſuch hints, as were deſigned to eſtabliſh their Faith, and form their Manners. I ſay, a real difference between thoſe, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of preaching in publick, where having to do with the Multitude, their only ſubject was the Perſon, Death, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>; of which their ſermons recorded in the Acts of <pb n="174" facs="unknown:046269_0207_1021180A18911000"/>the Apoſtles are inſtances. But ſince then there has been a great <hi>falling away,</hi> and <hi>the man of ſin is revealed.</hi> And, as it is more than probable that the Day of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is at hand, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath great wrath, and ſtrives to the utmoſt extent of his Power and Cunning, to hinder the revival of the Apoſtolic Teſtimony, and the riſing of the witneſſes. Sometimes he ſeeks to eſtabliſh his own Maxims, under the popular names of Virtue, Benevolence, Repentance, Faith, Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, &amp;c. Then he calumniates the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> giving it the moſt opprobrious characters, and mad with rage againſt all the witneſſes thereof, breathes forth nothing but ſlaughter and threatnings. And many are they, whom he either prevails on to adopt his Maxims and become his willing diſciples, or ſo intimidates with his Threatnings, that they dare not embrace the Truth, becauſe of the certain reproach that follows. But let him rage, he has but a ſhort time, ere the Lord <hi>ſhall conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth,</hi> and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy him with the <hi>brightneſs of his coming</hi>: and then ſhall the witneſſes who now lie ſlain in the ſtreets of the great city, ſtand again upon their feet; and the ancient Teſtimony be revived.</p>
