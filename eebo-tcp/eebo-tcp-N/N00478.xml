            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Fundamental Truths of Christianity briefly hinted at, by way of Question and Answer.</head>
            <p>Quest. <hi>OF whom have we our Being, our Living, and Moving, and all the good things wenjoy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How know we that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is some-what in our own hearts that declareth it unto us.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is that our own Natural Reason, as Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Tho' we might gather it even from Reason, as men, yet there is some-what in us that doth more convincingly and manifestly declare it unto us, than our own Reason as men.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How do we distinguish it from Reason?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Very plainly, because it oft teacheth us this, and many other true things, when we are not exercising our Reason, but still and quiet in our Minds; yea, it oft preventeth all Reasonings in us, and in a more ready and immediate way convinceth us than Reason can do.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How so?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because Reason teacheth us things by a way of Discourse and Inference, gathering a second thing from a first, and a third from a second, and a fourth from a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which way is but mediate, and commonly is wearisom and tedious.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth that other teach us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By setting things before our Understandings simply and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, even as when the outward Light giveth us to see the shapes and colour of outward things immediately; without the need or use of our Reason.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How may this other thing be called which is in us, a dinstinct Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from our Reason, as men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000603_0002_0FA95F5496E0CFC0"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> It may be called (according to Scripture) a spiritual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, which hath the same use to the Mind, that the outward Light hath to the Eye.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What other Names hath it, according to Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Word of God, because thereby God speaketh his Mind and Will unto the Hearts and Souls of men, as one man speaketh his Mind to another by the word of his Mou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is this Light and Word God himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is one immediate Manifestation of him, which tho' it may be distinguished from him, yet is not, nor cannot be divided or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from him, for he is with it and in it, and is the Fountain and Life of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What other difference is there betwixt our Natural Reason and this Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Our natural Reason may be corrupted, and is oft corrupted, and so may teach us contrary things, unto what this teacheth, but this is altogether uncorruptible.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat other Difference is there betwixt them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Teachings of our natural Reason, even of things that may be true, are but dry and barren, and void of that living Virtue, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Vigour, which the Teachings of this Principle have; for this Principle is quick and powerful and pregnant, or full of heavenly and divine Virtue and Life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But do they not differ originally, as to their very Nature &amp; Being?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, they do; the one is Natural, the other Supernatural; the one is Humane, the other divine; the one is an essential Property of the Humane Nature, the other is the free Grace and Favour of God given unto Man to dignifie and exalt him above his natural Estate and Condition; if so he may be more than a natural Man, even a Son and Child of God, yea, to have a Name better than of Sons and Daughters.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is this Principle given unto all men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, it is given unto all Men.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>For what end is it given unto all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That they may become the Children of God thereby, and may live soberly, righteousl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By Jesus Christ, as <hi>John</hi> declared; <hi>The Law</hi> (said he) <hi>was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth cometh by Jesus Christ,</hi> and of his business have we all received Grace for Grace.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is Jesus Christ himself given unto all Men, or only his Grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He is given unto all men, in so far as he is sent of the Father unto all, and is come unto all, and is both offered of the Father as his Gift, and doth also offer himself unto all, so that his Grace is not alone without him, nor he alone without his Grace, they are given together, and are offered together, and are received together.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is Christ and his Grace to be distinguished?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> No otherwise than as the light, warmth and influence of the Sun is from the Sun himself, which proceedeth from the Sun, as out of his fullness, according to <hi>John</hi>'s declaration, who said, <hi>Out of his Fullness have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q <hi>How is Christ Jesus come unto all? Is he come outwardly as a Man unto all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He is not come outwardly as a Man unto all, tho' he is come even outwardly as Man for all (so that all may receive the benefit of his outward Coming as Man, who are not wanting unto themselves) but he is come inwardly unto all, as the true Light that lightens every man that comes into the World, and not only as the Light, but as the Resurrection and the Life.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>How is he the Resurrection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because he quickeneth and maketh alive the Soul unto God, &amp; raiseth it out of its sin, in which, as in a Grave, it hath layn dead and corrupted as to the Life of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is this the general Condition of Men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, the general Condition of Men in the first state, is, that they are dead in their sins and trespasses.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We are to distinguish betwixt things that are absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and things that are necessary in some respect; also, betwixt things absolutely necessary, and things very useful and profitable; for many things are greatly useful, which are not absolutely necessary. And thus, tho' men have no absolute need of outward means for the conveyance of Light and Life unto them, yet the outward means are very useful and helpful unto them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Give us one Example in another case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All men have a Principle of Natural Reason in them, which without all outward means (either of Men or Books) teacheth them immediately some things belonging to Natural Reason; and yet none will deny but that both Men and Books are very useful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to further us in the Knowledge of Natural Things, and in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000603_0005_0FA95F58CC3FA2A8"/>
exercise of our Natural Reason, to the further improving the same.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are the Immediate Teachings of God and Christ of absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity unto every Man, to give him the true and saving knowledge o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, they are; for indeed all outward Means could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the immediate teaching and ministring of God and Christ, by his holy Spirit, Light and Life; because the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate is the Ground and Foundation, or Principle, for or because of which the outward means are useful and profitable.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Give us one Example in another case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The same as before; for if men had not an inward and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Principle of Natural Reason in them, that taught them immediately some things belonging to Natural Reason, all the Men and Books in the World, though never so convincing, could not gain ground upon them; but because Men have a Principle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in themselves, therefore when things of Reason are presented and offered to them, by Men and Books, they imbrace them and receive them, not simply or only because the Men and Books say so, but because th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Principle of Reason in themselves faith so, and doth witness and answer to the same things.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By this it would seem that men are taught many more things imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, than mediately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Yea surely, for according to the aforesaid Example, what men are there (except Fools and Idiots) but the Principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason in them, teacheth them, in the things of Natural Reason, above an hundred to one, more than any Books or Men ever did, or can do? As is manifest in the daily Occurrances and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in the outward Life, a man's Natural Reason teacheth him a Thousand things wh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch he never learned from Men or Books. Even so, the Children of God are taught of God many Divine &amp; Spiritual Things, which Men nor Books never did, or could teach them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By all this it seemeth, that the Knowledge of Divine and Spiritual Things, must flow from a divine and spiritual Principle in the Heart, and that they cannot be known and learned sufficiently from or by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principle of Natural Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is even so; for tho' the Natural Reason in a subservient way, may be made use of, yet it can no more reach unto the things that are spiritual and divine, nor indeed so much, as a blind Man by all his Reason can reach unto Colours, to judge of them distinctly, or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000603_0006_0FA95F5AE38454B8"/>
a Deaf man to judge of Sounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for even as the things of Sence are judged or known by a Principle of their own Nature, which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cannot immediately reach unto by descending; so the things of Faith, which are divine and spiritual, are judged and known by a Princ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ple of Faith that is of their own Nature also, to wit, divine and spiritual, which Reason cannot immediately reach unto by its ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; but as a man, having the Natural exercise of his Senses, can use his Reason in Natural things that are sensible; so he who hath the use of his spiritual Senses, can use the same Reason in Spiritual things, to wit, in a subservient and subordinate way.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the first thing required of men, that they may learn of God &amp; Christ Jesus, so as to become wise through those immediate Teachings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That they believe those Teachings, and receive them in the love of them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How can they do that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not of themselves, but there is a Virtue in all the Teachings of God and Christ, that is operative and effectual to cause men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them and receive them, and the Truth of them in love.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is next required of them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That they continually apply their whole Minds, Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Hearts unto this spiritual &amp; divine Principle in them, and unto God and Christ therein, that it may have its universal influence in them and upon them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How can they do that?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> It hath a native Virtue and Influence in it, whereby it taketh root in the heart naturally, if men do not resist it; and though the ground where it seeketh to take root, be foul and unfit, yet it hath a cleansing and fitting Virtue in it, to prepare the ground, and make it good and fit; but it requireth mans consent and concurrence, by which it acts, and God in it, and with it draweth and moveth effectually the heart of man unto it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But may these drawings and movings be commonly resisted?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, they may, and so the work of mans Salvation may be hindered by Man himself, and that both in the beginning, or when begun in its progress.</p>
