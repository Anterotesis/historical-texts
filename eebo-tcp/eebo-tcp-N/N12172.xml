            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>LEAVING apologies for my inability to act the part I am to take, in this day's ſolemnity, to thoſe who might have remedied the evil by a more ſuitable appointment— I ſhall offer my ſentiments upon the ſubject with the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that I conceived them.—</p>
            <p>The advantages of ſocial Life, are the reſult of ſuch evident neceſſity, ſo extenſively diffuſive and univerſally felt, that all Mankind will readily acknowledge their exiſtence without the aid of metaphyſics or hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The right that every individual has to reaſon freely upon the nature of that government he is called to ſubmit to, having nature for its ſource, is no leſs obvious and perceptable—and hence as a neceſſary foundation for the exerciſe of this right, I define civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be, not "a government by laws" made agreeable to char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, bills of rights or compacts, but a power exiſting in the people at large at any time, for any cauſe, or for no cauſe, but their own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign pleaſure, to alter or annihilate both the mode and eſſence of any former government, and adopt a new one in its ſtead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015363_0005_0F98D346844356D0"/>
Placing ourſelves then upon this broad baſis of <hi>civil liberty,</hi> founded on <hi>natural right,</hi> we will unawed by the <hi>ſtanding armies</hi> of any tyrants, tools,
<note n="*" place="bottom">The petty ſtates and princes who have raiſed their armies as a peaſant would his game cocks, and ſent them to market for a price, are in the moſt infamous ſenſe of the word, <hi>tools.</hi>
               </note> or monarchs, deliberate freely upon the nature of their inſtitutions, and their dangerous tendency to the rights of man.</p>
            <p>Every military force muſt neceſſarily imply a right of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an arbitrary power, ſo far as reſpects the objects againſt which it is to be directed; and what will be the objects againſt which it will be in conſtant exerciſe in proportion to its extent, we may collect from the experience of ages, and the well-known ſource of human actions.</p>
            <p>The page of hiſtory ſeldom groans with the calamities of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but we may trace the ſource of their unhappineſs to this engine of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Projected in the blackeſt principles of the human mind, and ſupported by ambition and a luſt of unbounded ſway, this <hi>armed monſter</hi> hath ſpread havock and miſery throughout the world— We find the bloody traces of its footſteps through all the ruins of greatneſs, and freedom, either in ancient or modern times: the moſt free and opulent cities of the world, by conniving at its birth, have at laſt fallen a prey to its relentleſs fury.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Piſiſtratus of Athens, Dyoniſius of Syracuſe, and Caeſar of Rome, furniſh a few among num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs examples that hiſtory affords.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015363_0006_0F98D347444BC6F8"/>
While we are raviſhed with the politeneſs, wiſdom and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſtates, we can ſcarce believe that the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch art, refinement and learning, ſhould ever be ſubdued by a power that never could have crept into life, but through the channel of <hi>their</hi> indulgence.</p>
            <p>But alas! their fate remains a ſtanding MONUMENT of this truth, that freedom at ſufference is a ſolaciſm in politics.</p>
            <p>To avoid the pain that humanity muſt ſuffer, upon finding ſo few inſtances of virtue that have been proof againſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to proſtitute a delegated power—I am inclined to think— that the great FOUNDER of ſocieties has cauſed the CURSE of infatuating ambition and relentleſs cruelty to be entailed on thoſe whoſe vanity may lead them to aſſume <hi>his</hi> prerogative among any of his people as they are cantoned about in the world, and to prevent mankind from paying that adoration and reſpect to the moſt dignified mortal, which is due only to <hi>infinite wiſdom and goodneſs</hi> in the direction of <hi>Almighty power,</hi> and therefore that he alone is fit to be a MONARCH.</p>
            <p>Were we to traverſe the whole field of human tranſactions, and expect any where to find an exemption from this general charge, we ſhould moſt naturally fix our eyes upon the Romans—But how mortified do we find ourſelves by the ſurvey?</p>
            <p>At the very time this people were moſt famed for their virtue and greatneſs,—while they were regaling themſelves with luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015363_0007_0F98D34803F6FBF0"/>eaſe in the lap of freedom—the provinces they obtained by fraud and violence were ſuffering under every ſpecies of the vileſt ſervitude, and made to contribute to that very eaſe and luxury at the diſcretion of the moſt mercileſs unfeeling taſk-maſters.</p>
            <p>But they themſelves, by the ſame tools they had armed to execute their bloody purpoſes, in their turn, became the ſubjects of the ſame kind of oppreſſion they ſo liberally dealt out to others, and ſtand recorded in hiſtory equal monuments of the greatneſs and depravity of human nature.</p>
            <p>Taught by the experience of former ages—that a general at the head of an armed force would ever make himſelf ſuperior to the laws, Europe for ſeveral centuries raiſed effectual barriers againſt the danger (and I may ſay the poſſibility) of their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations—for the tenure
<note n="*" place="bottom">The feudal tenure.</note> of their lands though they acknowledge a ſuperior lord, was upon conditions ſo abhorrent to the idea of ſtanding armies, that it offered at once both a promiſe and a pledge againſt them.</p>
            <p>But to convince us that no human inſtitutions can inſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent felicity to mankind;—<hi>ſecurity,</hi> the offspring of eaſe and freedom, opened the door for one enterpriſing uſurper after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Charles VII and Lewis XI of France having ſet the example, all the crowned heads in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ſoon followed it.</note> till the inhabitants of the whole eaſtern world had but little left of the property of their ſpecies but what they poſſeſſed in their <hi>ſhape.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015363_0008_0F98D348C6164210"/>
Strange Metamorphoſis!—But is it not much ſtranger ſtill, to ſee theſe pitable wretches ſtript of every enjoyment that can render life a bleſſing, meanly courting favour of protection from the tyrants who enſlaved them, and eaſily miſtaken the <hi>chains of ſervitude</hi> for the <hi>garbe of nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>formalities</hi> of a <hi>free</hi> and the ends of a <hi>deſpotic</hi> State (ſays a modern writer) have often ſubſiſted together.—Britain furniſhes a moſt unhappy example of this ſhocking truth:—As if the reliſh of liberty was pampered to make ſlavery itſelf more intolerably loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, they feel all the mortifying conſequences of the baſeſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and are left to conſole themſelves with this conſideration, that the weight of their grievances can never be encreaſed, while they are <hi>complimented,</hi> or rather <hi>tantalized</hi> with the name of <hi>Free men.</hi> Theſe are ſome of the glorious effects of ſtanding armies among <hi>foreign nations.</hi> Let us now conſider their conſequences in that part of the world, in whoſe affairs we take a more intereſting part.—</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to conceive that thoſe men who would not ſcruple to make uſe of every artiſice and violence to reduce the very people to whoſe generoſity they were indebted for their ſplendor, wealth and greatneſs, to a ſtate of vaſſalage, would never heſitate to make their conqueſts as extenſive as their power,—they can feel the influence of no <hi>law</hi> but that of the <hi>ſword,</hi> and therefore (whatever may be their pretentions) you will in every caſe find them ultimately make an appeal to its deciſions.</p>
