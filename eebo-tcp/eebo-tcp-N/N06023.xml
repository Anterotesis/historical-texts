            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following <hi>Sermon</hi> needs no Commendation. The Truth, Weight and Seaſonableneſs of its Matter, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety of its Stile, the Modeſty of its Addreſs, together with the Spirit of Piety, of Humility, of undiſguiſed Zeal for God, and affectionate Love to Man, which breathes in every Part, and animates the Whole, will commend it to the Conſciences of all that fear God, who have the Pleaſure of peruſing it. Here are no high ſounding Words of Vanity, or little Artifices to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and catch a vulgar Applauſe; but an honeſt, ſerious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to honor God, and do good to Mankind.—Let not the pious Author be offended with our Freedom, in ſaying, that his Life adds Weight to this Diſcourſe; for the Latter is but a Copy of the Former: Nor ſhould it be forgotten, that the gracious God, who delights to honor the Humble and Sincere in Heart, gave manifeſt Tokens of his ſpecial Preſence, when this Diſcourſe was delivered: Not only the Speaker, but divers of the Hearers, both Miniſters and People, being ſolemnly affected and tenderly touched with the precious Truths therein contained.—May God, of his infinite Mercy, keep theſe Things in the Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts, and enable us to act accordingly:
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:007643_0003_102D97E77207B958"/>
May we, eſpecially who are of the Sacred Order, obtain Mercy to be faithful, as well as prudent and humble unto Death.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of greater Conſequence to the Weal of the Churches, than taking due Care reſpecting the Admiſſion of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates into the Miniſtry. If we are lax in this, and eaſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Perſons who have no poſitive Evidences of vital Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Error will come in as a Flood, and inundate the Churches; experimental Piety gradually languiſh, and at laſt totally expire: To prevent which awful Events, may Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD bleſs the following Diſcourſe.—We add no more, but remain thy Servants for CHRIST's Sake.</p>

            <p>THE Diſpenſation of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Men, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> in ſeveral important reſpects, far excels in Glory the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This the Apoſtle had obſerved and clearly proved in the preceding Chapter, and from thence draws the juſt Concluſion in our Text, <hi>Therefore ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may obſerve ſeveral Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have the Goſpel Miniſtry refer'd to, call'd, <hi>This Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here are ſome engag'd in this Work: WE HAVE <hi>this Miniſtry.</hi> They are put in Truſt with the Goſpel <note n="a" place="bottom">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is to be acknowledged as a Mercy from God: <hi>As we have</hi> RECEIVED MERCY, Some Expoſitors chuſe to join this Sentence with the laſt Clauſe, thus; as <hi>we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Mercy, we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007643_0005_102D97EC29ED8158"/>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> underſtood the Mercy here intended, to be, that of Miniſters being kept from fainting under their Trials.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Others</hi> join the two firſt Sentences in our Text together thus, <hi>Therefore ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Mercy.</hi> They conceive the Mercy here ſpoken of is that of being call'd and employ'd in the ſacred Work. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>'s Judgment in particular is mentioned in the Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotations, in theſe Words; <q>The Tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of this great Apoſtle took Advantage from his great Trials and Afflictions, by reaſon of them, to conclude him no ſuch Man, as he was by ſome repreſented; and the Apoſtle upon that takes Advantage to magnify his Office. God <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> having intruſted us with ſo <hi>glorious</hi> a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, as I have proved that of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to be, according to the Meaſure and Proportion of Gifts and Graces, which God hath beſtowed upon us, or by reaſon of that infinite Grace and Mercy, which God hath ſhewed us, in calling us to ſo <hi>honorable</hi> a Station and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, though we meet with many Adverſaries, many Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, many Difficulties, yet we bear up, and ſink not under them, nor faint in our Spirits becauſe of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far he. In this Senſe I propoſe to conſider the Words of our Text.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may obſerve, that great Difficulties muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry, or there would be no Danger of <hi>Fainting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, that we ought not to faint under theſe Difficulties and Trials, but ſhould be able to ſay, through Grace, with the Apoſtle, <hi>we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, that an excellent Argument againſt <hi>Fainting</hi> in this Work, may be drawn from the Goſpel Miniſtry it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the ſeveral Motives, that relate to it. <hi>Therefore ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007643_0006_102D97EDC1772AF8"/>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That faithful Miniſters are kept from <hi>Fainting,</hi> by theſe precious Truths and Motives ſet home with divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on their Souls; hence they can ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We faint not;</hi> otherwiſe we ſhould ſurely <hi>faint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might comprize theſe important Obſervations in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral One, and lay it down as the Foundation of the preſent Diſcourſe; but as that would open too large a Field for this Opportunity, I ſhall <hi>confine</hi> myſelf to the Conſideration and Improvement of theſe two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Mercy</hi> of being call'd to the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry, and ſome of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> which are adapted to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt extreme Diſcouragements, and to excite to active and perſevering Diligence and Faithfulneſs in the Work.</p>
            <p>And here I would humbly and earneſtly intreat my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> (with others of <hi>God's People</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) to lift up your Hearts with Faith and Fervency to the God of all Grace and Fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, that I may be enabled ſo to <hi>ſpeak</hi> on theſe Heads, and you ſo to hear, as that our Souls may be much quickened and animated in our Work, in order to the ſaving Good of many Souls, and the Advancement of the Divine Glory in the World.</p>
            <p>I am, according to the Method propos'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To conſider it as a <hi>Mercy</hi> to faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they have <hi>this Miniſtry,</hi> that they are call'd to this Work. <hi>We have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> ſaith our Text. God in his Mercy is ſet forth by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Divine, as God willing to ſuccour ſinful Men in their Miſery. And how is this remarkably manifeſted to, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by ſuch of the ſinful miſerable Sons of Men, as are prepared for, and improved in the miniſterial Work. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> with reſpect to the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, which was committed to his Truſt, ſays, <hi>I thank Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Miniſtry</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 11, 12.</note>.</p>

            <p>This the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt juſtly eſteem a <hi>Mercy,</hi> as it reſpects <hi>themſelves,</hi> as it reſpects <hi>others,</hi> and as they may thus in an <hi>eminent</hi> Degree promote the <hi>Divine Glory</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it reſpects <hi>themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a Mercy is it to be call'd to a Work, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to promote their Increaſe of <hi>Grace</hi> as well as <hi>Gifts?</hi> And what a <hi>Comfort</hi> muſt it be to the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, to conſider, that their <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Callings do happily coincide and ſubſerve each other? Their general Calling, the Care of <hi>their own</hi> Souls, their particular Calling, the Care of <hi>others</hi> Souls. The more cloſely they walk with God themſelves, ſo much the more faithful and engag'd they are in their Work, and the more likely to be ſucceſsful; and on the other Hand, the more faithful they are in their Work, through Grace, ſo much the more <hi>they grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="bottom">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 18.</note>. So much the more <hi>their Souls proſper and are in Health</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Epiſt. of John v. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> and ordinarily the more they enjoy the <hi>Conſolations</hi> of the Divine Spirit, <hi>which are not ſmall,</hi> the more their Light ſhines before others, and they adorn their

Profeſſion, and the more they are attemper'd to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly State, and prepared for eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>'Tis true they are from ſeveral Quarters beſet at times with Temptations, perhaps more ſo than others; as Officers in an Army are more aim'd and pointed at by the Enemy than private Soldiers; but theſe Temptations their great Lord and Leader wiſely permits, to <hi>prove</hi> them, and bring them to know more of themſelves, that they may take root downwards, in order to bear Fruit upwards; he ſhews them thus their own Inſufficiency, and leads them to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his All-ſufficiency in the New Covenant, and hereupon they find him <hi>a very preſent Help in Trouble</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal</hi> xlvi. 1.</note>: They are thus humbled and purified, and made more meet for their Maſter's Service, more watchful and circumſpect, more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and reſign'd under Trials and Sufferings, and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in their Work, and probably more ſucceſsful too; and this is a <hi>great Mercy,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, are to <hi>give themſelves to reading, to Meditation and Prayer;</hi> and how may they thus, through the divine Bleſſing, grow apace, both in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal and experimental Knowledge, yea, I may add, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian Grace and Virtue? And is not this a <hi>great Mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a further Comfort and a Mercy too, that we, who have <hi>this Miniſtry,</hi> may be preaching to ourſelves, as well as praying over the Sermons we prepare for, and preach to others; yea, we may ſee more clearly the beautiful Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Connection of divine Truths, as well as feel more of the happy Effects of them; while we are attending on the Expoſition of ſacred Scripture, and when catechiſing our People, or making Preparations therefor.</p>
            <p>In the Adminiſtration of divine Ordinances, eſpecially the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, how may we reap much Profit and Pleaſure ourſelves, through Grace, ſee more of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007643_0009_102D97F408F171A8"/>
the Faithfulneſs, Grace, Holineſs, and other Perfections of our God and Saviour; and grow more holy, comfortable and fruitful.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>Paſtoral Viſits</hi> we may often, through Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, caution and comfort, direct and edify others and ourſelves at the ſame Time,</p>
            <p>And in the Diſcipline of God's Houſe, while we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reclaim others, we may be not a little guarded and benefited ourſelves: We may be led to ſee much of the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations and Evil of Sin, the Snares that lie thick around, the conſtant Neceſſity of Watchfulneſs and Prayer, and of living by Faith on God in Chriſt; that we may as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and as <hi>Miniſters,</hi> bring forth much Fruit.</p>
            <p>In a Word, <hi>every</hi> Part of the miniſterial Work is in ſome reſpect or other adapted to promote our increaſing Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Perfections and Will of God in our Hearts and Lives: Is it not then a <hi>Mercy,</hi> a <hi>great Mercy,</hi> that we have been call'd to this Work? <hi>We have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though it is a difficult, yet it is alſo a delightful and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well as honourable Work; and it is a <hi>Mercy,</hi> not only with reſpect to <hi>us,</hi> but alſo,</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is truly adapted, both in the public and private Parts of it, as a Means to promote the beſt, the everlaſting Intereſts of all our Hearers; but Men are hardened by Sin and Unbelief, and blinded by Satan and the World: <hi>They hate the Light, and will not come to the Light, leſt their Deeds ſhould be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>

            <p>We are call'd in the miniſterial Work, as Inſtruments to <hi>inſtruct</hi> the Ignorant, to <hi>convince</hi> the Erroneous, to <hi>reclaim</hi> the Vicious, to <hi>awaken</hi> the Secure, to <hi>rouze</hi> the Slothful, to <hi>ſap</hi> the Foundation of Hypocrites, and to <hi>ſhew</hi> the Self-righteous their extream and deſtructive Folly; and though this is truly hard Work, yet it muſt be done in God's Strength, and when done and bleſt, very uſeful.</p>
            <p>It is further uſeful and pleaſant withal, to <hi>direct</hi> enquiring Souls to Chriſt, to <hi>win</hi> them over to him, through his all-powerful Grace, that they may receive him in his moſt glorious Perſon and precious Benefits, as he is offer'd in the Goſpel: And what a <hi>Mercy</hi> is this both to us and them.</p>
            <p>Again, we are call'd as Inſtruments, to <hi>build up</hi> the Saints in Faith, and Holineſs, and Comfort. We are to <hi>comfort</hi> them in their Trials from within and without, <hi>with the

Thus our Work, the <hi>miniſterial</hi> Work is adapted, and thus it is bleſt to the Benefit of many Souls: We may juſtly ſay then, <hi>We have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy:</hi> Eſpecially ſince,</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may, with Divine Aſſiſtance, by and in this Work, in an <hi>eminent</hi> Degree promote the <hi>Divine Glory</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>How is the Glory of God and Chriſt and true <hi>Religion</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by our Increaſe in Gifts and Grace, in Holineſs and Uſefulneſs Thence it appears in ſome Meaſure what a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſerve, what a God we worſhip, what a Saviour we preach and offer, what a <hi>Religion</hi> we profeſs and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Brethren,</hi> certainly God is the greateſt and beſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſurely then, the ſetting him forth to be, or manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as ſuch, is the greateſt and higheſt End that can be: This is his Glory, this End is worthy of a God, and this is the higheſt End of all his Friends, Children and Servants: This End, the Work of the Miniſtry, is wonderfully ſuited and bleſt to promote: What a <hi>Mercy</hi> is it then to any of us <hi>vile, apoſtate</hi> and <hi>periſhing</hi> Sons of Men, to be brought

home to Chriſt, and call'd to this ſacred Work. <hi>We have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would here make two <hi>Remarks</hi> on this Head, before we paſs to the next.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may plainly ſee, that we who are in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> have no reaſon to <hi>think highly</hi> of ourſelves, no reaſon to be <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>Vain-glorious.</hi> We ſhould indeed take Care to <hi>magnify our Office,</hi> and in no Inſtances or reſpects to under-act the ſacred Character; but at the ſame Time, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of each of our Souls, muſt be that of <hi>Job, Behold I am vile</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Job</hi> xl. 4.</note> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <q>It is a divine as well as wiſe and juſt Remark made by one of the greateſt <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Thought</hi> in the laſt Age, that Perſons of <hi>Quality</hi> and Character ought to have two Setts of Thoughts by which to regulate their Conduct: By the <hi>one</hi> they are to view themſelves in their State of diſtinguiſhing <hi>Elevation,</hi> which is not from Nature, but arbitrary <hi>Eſtabliſhment;</hi> by the <hi>other</hi> they are to take a Proſpect of themſelves in their natural Condition of <hi>Infirmity</hi> and <hi>Equality,</hi> with the reſt of Mankind.</q> (And I may here add, of Sin and Miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pemberton<hi>'s Election Sermon, p.</hi> 1.</note>. The Temper of our Minds, and the Tenor of our Lives, ſhould be humble and holy. How ſhould we be <hi>clothed with Humility,</hi> as it were from Head to Foot, who are Miniſters of the <hi>meek and lowly</hi> Jeſus: How ſhould we watch and pray againſt Pride, hate and ſhun this vile <hi>Monſter</hi> and this dangerous Snare, this awful <hi>Condemnation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Let us often think, for our Humiliation, <hi>What have we,</hi> that is in any Meaſure good and valuable, <hi>that we have not received?</hi> And again, what have we that we have not miſimproved? And as to the Goſpel Miniſtry, it will be a ſpecial Guard againſt Pride, to realize, through Grace, how we came by it, namely, by <hi>meer undeſerved Mercy,</hi> and ſhall we be proud of Mercy? <hi>We have this Miniſtry only as we have received Mercy.</hi> Where is Boaſting then? It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007643_0013_102D97FD95AAE7D0"/>2. Hence we may obſerve Ground of peculiar Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Work of the Miniſtry amidſt all the Difficulties that attend it. <hi>We have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy;</hi> and is it a Mercy we have it, and ſhall we be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with it? Shall we be diſcouraged with Mercy? <hi>Therefore let us not faint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this Thought we come by an eaſy Tranſition, to the</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>General Head,</hi> under which I am to conſider and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſome of the many <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> inducing to Faithfulneſs in the Miniſterial Work: And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Command</hi> in God's Word ſhould powerfully and conſtantly engage to be <hi>faithful</hi> and not <hi>faint</hi> in this great Work. This Command we have in theſe Words <note n="ſ" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 28. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 1, 2, 5,</note> 
               <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> And in another Place, <hi>Take heed to yourſelves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made You Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi> And again, <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and the Dead at his Appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Preach the Word, be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine. Watch thou in all Things, endure Afflictions, do the Work of an Evangeliſt, make full Proof of thy Miniſtry.</hi> With many other Paſſages to the ſame Purpoſe. Surely, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> the Mind and Will of the Lord, infinitely glorious in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and withal our Maker, Preſerver, and Governor, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> thus revealed in his Word, ſhould engage us, through Grace, to chearful, conſtant and faithful Obedience. <hi>Therefore ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy, let us not faint.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007643_0014_102D97FF4DBFA740"/>2. The <hi>Example of Chriſt</hi> ſhould animate us in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Work.</p>
            <p>Here we have a perfect Pattern to copy after. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus diſcover'd from Time to Time the moſt ardent Love to God and Man in his more public and private Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions and Miniſtrations, and ſought not his own Glory, but the Glory of him that ſent him; ſo ſhould we, through his Grace.</p>
            <p>How zealous and couragious was he, and yet how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and diſcreet? How plain and pungent, and yet how compaſſionate, how regardleſs of the Flatteries or Frowns of the World? how meek and lowly of Heart? how faithful in the Diſcharge of perſonal and relative Duties? how holy and pure? how reſigned to his Heavenly Father's Diſpoſal? how frequent and fervent in Prayer, and how laborious in his beloved Work? <note n="t" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> xi. 4. <hi>John</hi> iv. 34.</note> 
               <hi>I muſt work,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Works of him that ſent me, while it is Day.</hi> And again, <hi>My Meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How willing was he to do and ſuffer what he was call'd to, even to the Death? Oh Sirs! <hi>Let the ſame mind be in us, that was in him: Wherefore, holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling, let us conſider the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our Profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus; who was faithful to him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, as alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his Houſe</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Example of Chriſt's faithful Servants</hi> in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould animate us in the Work. 'Tis true, <hi>my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> the beſt of Chriſt's Miniſters are imperfect in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, and therefore not to be propos'd as perfect Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns

            <p>What a lovely Example is ſet before us in our Text, and the following Verſe; <hi>Therefore ſeeing we have this</hi> Miniſtry, <hi>as we have received</hi> Mercy, <hi>we faint not: But have renounced the hidden Things of Diſhoneſty, not walking in Craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the Truth, commending ourſelves to every man's Conſcience in the Sight of God.</hi> And again, in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>We do all Things, dearly Beloved, for your Edifying</hi>
