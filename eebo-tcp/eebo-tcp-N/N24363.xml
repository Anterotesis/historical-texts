            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>"And when the children of Iſrael ſaw it they ſaid one to another, it is <hi>MANNA,</hi> for they wiſt not what it was. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto them, this is the bread which the <hi>Lord</hi> hath given you to eat."</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE children of Iſrael, in their travels through the deſerts of Arabia towards the land of Canaan, murmured againſt Moſes and againſt the Lord becauſe the ſcanty ſtores they brought from Egypt were nearly exhauſted, and they were ignorant of the means for a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit. In particular they wanted <hi>bread.</hi> They were gratified by a miraculous providential ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Bread was granted them—BREAD FROM HEAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EN! myſterious in its origin and character, but highly agreeable in its reliſh, ſalutary in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and nutritive in its qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032229_0005_0FF19BF56736BDF8"/>
THERE are circumſtances, connected with its beſtowment and reception, deſerving our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice; and the ſubject will lead to ſome reflections applicable to the ſociety on whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we aſſemble. With this view I propoſe the following method.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt. TO conſider what notice was taken by the Iſraelites of the proviſion and refreſhment, divinely furniſhed them;</item>
               <item>2dly. SHEW what it really was; and</item>
               <item>3dly. APPLY the ſubject to the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, by enquiring what is ſaid of <hi>Free Maſonry</hi> by thoſe who know not what it is, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing its real nature and character.</item>
            </list>
            <p>WE are, <hi>firſt</hi> then to <hi>conſider what notice was taken by the Iſraelites of the proviſion and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment furniſhed them by a ſpecial divine providence in the deſerts of Arabia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO ſooner did they ſee it than they cried out one to another <hi>"it is manna, it it manna,</hi> for they knew not what it was." Whether this was an exclamation of ſurprize, a queſtion of curioſity, or an expreſſion of contempt, we ſhall not decide. Critics and commentators ſeem at a loſs how to underſtand it. One ſays it is <hi>this</hi> and another <hi>that,</hi> for they know not what it is.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide POLI ſynops. criticorum, in loc.</note> However, it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032229_0006_0FF19BF701432690"/>is plain enough that <hi>manna,</hi> let it mean what it will, was not the proper definition nor deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the admirable proviſion.<note n="‡" place="bottom">The derivation of the word <hi>manna</hi> is variouſly given by learned men. PHILO JUDAUS and JOSEPHUS make it to ſignify? <hi>what is this?</hi> and ſo do the ixx. and R. SOLOMON, R. MINACHEN, &amp; others. Accordingly it is thus tranſlated in MATTHEW'S, the GENEVA, and DOWAY verſions. It is ſo rendered, alſo, by the celebrated Dr. GEDDES. But COV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERDALE renders it <hi>"this is mans;"</hi> our tranſlation, <hi>"it is manna,"</hi> and others; <hi>"it is a portion,"</hi>—The declaration that "they knew not what it was, and the reply of MOSES, would lead one to ſuppoſe that the phraſe before was a <hi>queſtion.</hi> Our only ſurpriſe is that it ſhould afterwards paſs into a deſcriptive <hi>name.</hi> Thus <hi>we</hi> uſed a very vulgar phraſe in ſpeaking of ſome thing of which we have forgotten the name, and ſay <hi>"the what do you call it."</hi>
               </note> And ſo Moſes informed them by telling them, "this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat." Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they perſiſted in giving their own opinion of it, tho they were unacquainted both with its name and nature.<note n="†" place="bottom">Compare Deut. viii. 3. where Moſes expreſsly aſſerts their entire ignorance of it.</note>! What a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction! But not ſtranger than all are likely to fall into who pretend to decide upon matters which they do not underſtand. "They ſaid one to another it is manna;" and <hi>manna</hi> it has been called ever ſince. It is no eaſy matter to alter names. When people misjudge at firſt, it is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032229_0007_0FF19BFB52C7C8F8"/>very difficult to rectify their opinion. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is blind and perverſe; prejudice is poſitive and obſtinate. What is miſconceived and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied ſeldom afterwards retrieves its real eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Men are apt to judge at large, reflect at random and condemn at a venture; without waiting for patient examination or ſatisfactory evidence. Now, nothing can be more contrary both to equity and ſound reaſon than ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate judgments. Thoſe who build opinions upon conjectures muſt often be in the wrong. They may make groſs blunders, and do great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. The apoſtle Jude gives ſuch a rebuke: "Theſe, ſays he, ſpeak evil of the things they know not."—It has been the practice of vulgar ignorance to abuſe what it could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; and to aſſert that there muſt be faults, where it had not the ſagacity to diſcover excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>I. BUT I proceed to <hi>enquire what this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proviſion really was, about which they were ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</hi>—That there ſhould no doubt remain in the minds of thoſe to whom it was ſent, Moſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them that it was <hi>the bread which the Lord had given them to cat.</hi> In like manner David calls it "the corn of heaven," and "angels food."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxviii. 24, 25. See alſo its true name in <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ix. 15.</note> The
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032229_0008_0FF19BFE43CE1348"/>Scripture deſcribes particularly its appearance and properties, and mentions its coming down with the dew; alike the gift of refreſhment from above. And it retains ſtill its fame in the Eaſt, being called "celeſtial ſweetmeat."<note n="†" place="bottom">Les orientaux appellent la manne qui tomba aux He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breux dans le Deſert, la Dragée ou Conſiture de la Tours Puiſſance, ce que les Arabes ſignifient par Haluat al Kod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, et les Turcs par Kodret Kalvaſi." HERBELOT, <hi>biblioth. Orientale.</hi> The Greeks called it <hi>acromeli, acrial honey.</hi> ATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RN. l. 11. &amp; DIOS. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 101.</note> Nor can there be any propriety in denying to the gift its real character and intrinſic value, becauſe its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was not prepoſſeſſing. It is ſufficient that <hi>its origin was divine, and its uſes excellent.</hi> If this could not recommend it, we may expect that the beſt things and richeſt bleſſings will be treated with neglect or ſpurned with contempt.</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>it poſſeſſed remarkably palatable and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive qualities</hi> is evident both from the divine deſign of its beſtowment, and from its uſe. The author of the book of Wiſdom ſays that it ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated itſelf to every one's taſte as to prove agreeable to all. His words are, "thou feddeſt thine own people with angels food, and didſt ſend them from heaven bread prepared without their labor; able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taſte. For thy ſuſtenance
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032229_0009_0FF19C001246FC50"/>declared thy ſweetneſs unto thy children, and, ſerving to the appetite of the eater and tempered itſelf to every man's liking."<note n="*" place="bottom">Wiſdom xvi. 20.21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FROM modern ſamples of this ſubſtance, as it is gathered in the Eaſt, we perceive that it has the appearance of condenſed honey, and a taſte of agreeable ſweetneſs. A late celebrated travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler into Arabia ſays, "it is uſed now as ſugar in ſeveral diſhes—it is nouriſhing—and when new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered has no purgative qualities."<note n="†" place="bottom">NICBUHR, v 2. p. 362 <hi>of the tranſlation</hi>—and Father PINOLO, deſcribing that of California which falls as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with the dew, ſays, that, without the whiteneſs of refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſugar, it has all its ſweetneſs.</note> Its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal effects are probably occaſioned by its being left ſome time; in conſequence of which it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a degree, becomes candyed, and loſes its reliſhing taſte and nutritive properties.—To the Iſraelites, who were obliged to conſume, each day, their given portion, it afforded an agreeable, nouriſhing, wholeſome repaſt; and was their principal aliment during a period of forty years.—Though liable to corruption, it did not become bad unleſs improperly uſed or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xvi. 20.</note> And the beſt things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and debaſed by ill uſage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:032229_0010_0FF19C0498E06880"/>
IT is alſo worthy of remark that <hi>it had moral tendencies.</hi> It was granted in daily ſhowers, that they might be kept in a continual thankful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon divine providence. It was in ſuch ſmall grains, and was ſo ſcattered, that they were obliged early and ſeaſonably to begin their work of collecting it, or they would fail of a ſupply. Thus were they taught <hi>induſtry;</hi> and learned that their own endeavors were to be united to the aſſiſtance and to cooperate with the grace of GOD. And a double portion on the laſt day of the week, and its non-appearance on the ſabbath, gave them a very ſtriking intimation that the inſtitution of a day of actual reſt from labor was to be religiouſly and devoutly obſerved.</p>
            <p>THE manner too in which it was diſtributed was admirably calculated to excite and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age a ſpirit of <hi>liberality</hi> and <hi>generoſity,</hi> a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to impart to thoſe whoſe induſtry had been leſs ſucceſsful, or who were unable to gather for their ſelves: for in meaſuring their reſpective gatherings before they went to their tents, thoſe who had collected a greater quantity than ſufficed for their immediate need or uſe freely gave the overplus to thoſe who had not enough. "So that he who gathered much had nothing over, &amp; he that gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little had no lack." In this ſenſe the words are underſtood by the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. viii. 14, 15. who uſes the paſſage as an apt illuſtration of his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032229_0011_0FF19C07A5159B48"/>moſt excellent argument for that happy <hi>equality,</hi> in the diſtribution of the good things of this life, which our mutual relation to each other and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exigencies may requires; that he who abounds ſhould willingly impart of his ſuperfluity, ſo that he who is deſtitute may obtain a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſupply.</p>
            <p>IT would be eaſy to point out the very ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblance which FREE MASONRY bears to the <hi>moral qualities and purpoſes</hi> here enumerated; but it is too obvious to need a more particular reference. I ſhall, therefore, go on to make one more remark, in which the analogy is alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, <hi>there were ſome things in the nature of this heavenly proviſion which could not eaſily be accounted for.</hi> Where it was <hi>prepared,</hi> and how it was <hi>made,</hi> they could not tell. There they were in the dark.—Why the ſame ſubſtance which melted and evaporated in the heat of the ſun when it was left expoſed in the field, ſhould, only upon being brought into the tent, become of ſo condenſed a conſiſtence that it might be beaten to powder in a mortar or ground in a mill, and baked in an oven,<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xi. 9.</note> was beyond their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. And why it ſhould be endued with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032229_0012_0FF19C0A94BB0990"/>ſuch a religious reference to the obſervations of the ſabbath that none fell on that day, and a double quantity the day before was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that excited their ſurprize. Surprize ſometimes degenerates into ſtupidity. Oftener than once they diſpiſed and loathed this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and delicious proviſion.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the pride of the human underſtanding that it has no great opinion of that which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully comprehend. Whatever has any thing of myſtery in it is very likely to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though it poſſeſs all the characters of excellence, and all the recommendations of util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, yet if it elude inveſtigation and have ſome ſecret qualities "paſt finding out," doubt will be immediately entertained whether it be "wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation;" And opinions propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated tending to leſſen its character and deny its importance.—This was the caſe with regard to the heavenly refreſhment furniſhed in the wilderneſs to the Iſraelites. They valued it not becauſe they lacked "the onions, the leeks, and garlicks of Egypt." ¡Hear their diſcontented ſneers.! "But now our ſoul is dried away; there is nothing at all, beſides this manna, before our eyes."<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xvi. 6.</note> —A like ſpirit of diſapprobation and rejection the ſame nation diſcovered of

And how great a bar to all after information! For, if the mind be warped by prepoſſeſſions, free enquiry into the merits of a cauſe is prevented. Prejudice reſtrains all candid interpretations of motives or principles. It diſcolors every object; or repreſents it in a falſe light. It leads to a deciſion equally ungenerous and unfair; for it often preſumes to conſider the moſt ſlight and frivolous circumſtances as ſatisfactory materials for conſident aſſertion and deciſive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It is the immediate and copious ſource of evil ſurmiſes and unkind ſuſpicions. It gives riſe to a caviling cenſoriouſneſs, mean inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032229_0014_0FF19C0E0EF41060"/>and ſarcaſtic ſneers.—Wherever there is a ſecret bias of mind previouſly formed, it will catch readily at every little incident and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to increaſe its own propenſion: and turn every current of obſervation into its own corrupt channel.—It perverts and miſrepreſents the very beſt things: turns honor into diſgrace, merit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſchief, chriſtianity into ſuperſtition, and virtue into vice.</p>
            <p>CAUTIONED and inſtruſted by our ſubject, and the remarks which it has ſuggeſted, let us not, MY HEARERS, form our opinion either of perſons or things too haſtily; and never proceed upon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and precarious conjectures. There is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in making up a precipitate judgment. Haſty concluſions are the chief cauſe of all our miſtakes and errors. Let us not forget to examine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we judge; and to underſtand before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. To ridicule things we never took pains to enquire into, would be unfair. To condemn practices, the grounds and foundation of which we never examined and know nothing about. would be unjuſt and cruel. A diſcreet perſon will avoid being preremptory in his remarks, and decline hazarding an opinion upon that of which he is either totally ignorant, or but partially informed. He follows the prudent counſel of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032229_0015_0FF19C1697FFB8F8"/>the antient Wiſe Man; "blame not before thou haſt examined the truth. Underſtand firſt, and then rebuke. Anſwer not before thou haſt heard the cauſe; and ſtrive not in a matter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth thee not."—"He that anſwereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and ſhame unto him."—Upon the ſame principle of equity is that maxim in Common Law, "every man is preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be innocent till he is proved to be guilty." No one is to be arraigned without evidence, nor condemned before he has made his plea of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Verdict is never paſſed upon a cauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</p>
            <p>It is a good rule in all doubtful matters to ſuſpend our opinion, at leaſt till poſitive proof is obtained on which to found it. Until we have fully aſcertained the real ſtate of the caſe, let us always be willing to put the faireſt conſtruction it will admit; and even to hope the beſt of a thing where appearances are againſt it. Where <hi>doubt</hi> heſitates, let <hi>candor</hi> prompt; and where <hi>juſtice</hi> balances let <hi>mercy</hi> prevail. Even where we find ourſelves obliged to blame the principles of a certain ſect or party, let us not be ſo uncharitable as to confound all its adherents and followers under one general indiſcriminate cenſure. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially let us not charge them with ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their tenets as they diſavow.</p>

            <p>I HAVE dwelt the longer upon this part of the ſubject becauſe from <hi>prejudice,</hi> as well as from <hi>ignorance,</hi> ariſe moſt of the objections againſt FREE MASONRY, and all the miſrepreſentations of its principles and practices. As the origin of ſuch diſlike to our inſtitution is ſo well known, it might be deemed paying too great reſpect to its cavils to take any notice of them at all: but,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032229_0017_0FF19C18253C0B20"/>leſt it ſhould be thought that we are deſirous of evading an anſwer from an inability to vindicate, we ſhall now condeſcend, as was propoſed.</p>
            <p n="3">III, TO <hi>inquire what is ſaid of</hi> FREE MASONRY <hi>by thoſe who "know not what it is."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE opinion of the initiated is well known. They all unite in commending the Society with a warmth that borders upon enthuſiaſm. They diſcover an attachment to it, at which <hi>ignorance</hi> wonders and <hi>prejudice</hi> ſneers.</p>
            <p>ONE of the moſt frequent objections urged againſt FREE MASONRY is <hi>"the profound ſecrecy obſerved upon certain parts of the inſtitution."</hi> It is queried how it is conſiſtent with thoſe principles of good will we profeſs, to conceal any thing from the world. We anſwer, that, to the wiſe and virtuous the arcana of the Craft, under prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſanctions, are freely communicated. But to reveal them to the ignorant and vicious would be proſtituting their purpoſe and profaning their ſanctity. To divulge them in common would be to annihilate the ſociety: becauſe they are its diſtinguiſhing features, the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtics of the order, and the means of its preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Without them, therefore, it could not ſubſiſt.—Beſides, were all men acquainted with them, without regard to ſelection or deſert, <hi>the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032229_0018_0FF19C19B5F16708"/>peculiar obligation to good offices</hi> ariſing from the inſtitution would revert back to the general duty of all mankind, and be ſubject to all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions it now meets with in the world at large, and againſt which it is our firſt principle to guard.—</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, to have ſecrets is not peculiar to FREE MASONRY. Every trade, every art, and every occupation, has its ſecrets, not to be communicated but to ſuch as have become proficients in the ſcience connected with them, nor then but with proper caution and reſtriction; and oftentimes under the guard of heavy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties. Charters of incorporation are granted by civil Governments for their greater ſecurity, and patents for their encouragement.—Nay every Government, every ſtateſman, and every individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, has ſecrets, which are concealed with prudent care, and confided only in the truſty and true.</p>
            <p>NOTHING more ſurely, need be ſaid in apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy for the myſtery and concealment FREE MASONS profeſs.—I will proceed to another objection allied to the foregoing, which <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> alſo has ſurmiſed and <hi>prejudice</hi> prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032229_0019_0FF19C1B5BE309C0"/>
IT is pretended that <hi>"all who are initiated muſt ſwear to conceal certain ſecrets before they are communicated to them, or they have it in their power to examine their nature and tendency: and that this practice is unlawful."</hi> There would be ſome force in this objection were the obligation in itſelf immoral, or the communications &amp; requirements compatible with the great laws of religion or civil ſociety: the very reverſe of which is the caſe.</p>
            <p>WHAT the ignorant call "the oath" is ſimply an obligation, covenant, and promiſe, exacted previouſly to the divulging of our means of recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing each other, that they ſhall be kept from the knowledge of the world, leſt their original intent ſhould be thwarted and their benevolent purport prevented.—Now? pray what harm is there in this?? Do you not all, when you have any thing of a private nature which you are willing to confide in a particular friend <hi>before you tell him what it is,</hi> demand a ſolemn promiſe of ſecrecy? And,? is there not the utmoſt propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in knowing whether your friend is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to conceal your ſecret <hi>before</hi> you preſume to reveal it? Your anſwer confutes your cavil.—</p>
            <p>IT is further urged againſt FREE MASONS that <hi>"Their ſociety is not founded on univerſal
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032229_0020_0FF19C1F9F327340"/>benevolence, becauſe they oblige their ſelves to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt generous to their own members."</hi> We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of the declaration that our firſt and choiceſt ſervices are paid to our brethren: but then we think it would be the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice if it were otherwiſe. Certainly a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination ought to be made between the deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the underſerving; thoſe who have a claim upon our aſſiſtance and charity, and thoſe who have not. So the Apoſtle exhorts the Chriſtians to do good as they have opportunity to all men; but enjoins their ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to ſuch as are of the houſehold of faith.<note n="*" place="bottom">Galat. vi. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>YET though we give a decided preference to ſuch as have been tried, and proved, and found to be worthy; and have, in conſequence, been made members of the maſonic family; we are known to profeſs and practice charity unconfined and liberality unlimited, and to comprehend in the wide circle of our benevolence the whole human race.</p>
            <p>IT is, alſo, frequently argued againſt FREE MASONRY that <hi>"ſome of thoſe who belong to it are intemperate, profligate, and vicious."</hi> But nothing can be more unfair or unjuſt than to depreciate or condemn any inſtitution, good in itſelf, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032229_0021_0FF19C22983622A8"/>of the faults of thoſe who pretend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it. The abuſe of a thing is no valid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to its inherent goodneſs. Worthleſs characters are to be found, occaſionally, in the very beſt inſtitutions upon earth. "If the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of a profeſſor caſts a reflection upon the profeſſion, it may be infered, by parity of reaſon, that the miſconduct of a chriſtian is an argument againſt chriſtianity. But this, is a concluſion which, I preſume, no man will allow; and yet it is no more than what <hi>he</hi> muſt ſubſcribe who is ſo unreaſonable as to inſiſt on the other."<note n="*" place="bottom">See the excellent ſermon of the Rev. Brother BROCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL, preached at Boſton, 1749.</note> Nor is it any evidence that Civil Laws and Polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Inſtitutions are hurtful or unſerviceable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are corrupt citizens and diſorderly members of a community.</p>
            <p>THE fact is, the beſt things may be abuſed. The <hi>bread of heaven</hi> grew corrupt when uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretely. The common bleſſings of life are turned into curſes if miſapplied.</p>
            <p>WHEN you ſee baſe and unworthy men among the FREE MASONS, depend upon it, the fault is not in the Inſtitution, but in their ſelves. They have deviated from the principles of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032229_0022_0FF19C2428840E18"/>Craft. They have counteracted their profeſſion: and are as bad maſons as men.</p>
            <p>WE do not heſitate to appeal to the world in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the purity of our moral ſyſtem. Our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> are well known. We have ſubmitted them freely to general inveſtigation. We ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnly avouch them as the principles by which we are governed, the foundation on which we build, and the rules by which we work. We challenge the moſt ſevere critic, the moſt preciſe moraliſt, the moſt perfect chriſtian, to point out any thing in them inconſiſtent with good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, fair morals, or pure religion. We feel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that every one who will take pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the book muſt be convinced that the inſtitution is friendly to the beſt intereſts of mankind, well calculated to meliorate the diſpoſition &amp; improve the human character, &amp; to adorn its faithful adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with every natural, ſocial and religious virtue.</p>
