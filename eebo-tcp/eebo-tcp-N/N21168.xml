            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THIS day the Court met, when ROBERT WATT was put to the bar, in order to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Clerk of Arraigns, called upon the priſoner by his name, and deſired him to hold up his right hand, which he did. Mr. Knapp then read the bill of indictment which the Grand Jury had found againſt him to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purport:</p>
               <p>It charges the ſaid Robert Watt not having the fear of God in his heart, nor weighing the duty of his allegiance, but being moved and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the inveſtigation of the devil, as a falſe traitor againſt the King, his ſupreme, lawful, and undoubted Sovereign, and wholly withdrawing the cordial love and due and true obedience, fidelity, and allegiance, which every true and faithful ſubject ought to bear towards him, and wickedly, maliciouſly, and traitorouſly deviſing, contriving, and intending to break and diſturb

the peace and tranquility of the kingdom, and to change, ſubvert, and overthrow the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happily eſtabliſhed therein, and to uſurp, aſſume, and take upon himſelf, together with other falſe traitors, the power of Government within the kingdom, and to excite, move, and raiſe Rebellion againſt the King, within this kingdom, to depoſe and put down the King from the Royal ſtate, title, power, and government of the kingdom, and him to death to put and bring. With having maliciouſly, wickedly, and traitor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly met, conſulted, conſpired, and agreed to cauſe and procure meetings to be held within this kingdom, under the name of Conventions, for the purpoſes of uſurping and aſſuming the powers and government of legiſlation, in, for, and over the kingdom, of effecting an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the mode of electing Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or obliging the King againſt his will, to change certain laws relating to the adminiſtration of the kingdom, of raiſing an inſurrection, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the King to adopt certain laws which they wiſhed, of conſulting concerning the ſeizing upon the Caſtle of Edinburgh by force, with pikes, guns, battle-axes, &amp;c. and alſo upon the Exciſe Office and Banks, of ſeizing upon the Lord Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Clerk, Lords of Juſticiary and Seſſion, and Lord Provoſt of Edinburgh, of agreeing to be aiding in theſe conſpiracies, and of inſtigating other perſons to aſſiſt him in carrying the ſame into execution; of buying and procuring to be

made, divers pikes, ſpears, battle-axes, &amp;c. for the above purpoſes, of raiſing and levying, and cauſing to be raiſed and levied, money for the purpoſe of arming himſelf and his aſſociates with writing and publiſhing wicked addreſſes, adviſing the ſubjects of the King to ſubſcribe money, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying John Fairley to diſtribute the ſame, and to perſuade the people to give aſſurances to him of ſupport, to inform of how many they might depend upon, to perſuade the people to ſend money to David Downie, and to purchaſe pikes, &amp;c. for the purpoſe of arming themſelves, and with employing William Brown and Robert Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rock to make pikes, &amp;c. and cauſe them to be made for the above purpoſes, and which when made were concealed in the houſe of the ſaid Robert Watt.</p>
               <p>After the indictment was read over, Mr. Knapp aſked Mr. Watt what he had to ſay to it, and whether he was guilty or not guilty? To which the priſoner replied, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>

               <p>Lord Juſtice Clerk aſked the Counſel for the priſoner if he had any motion to make?</p>
               <p>Mr. Archibald Fletcher ſaid, that he wiſhed Mr. Robert Cullen to be appointed ſenior Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to aſſiſt him in the defence of Mr. Downie, in place of Mr. John Clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:027815_0006_0FD64CBD56E9EBC8"/>
This the Court agreed to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robert Hamilton, Counſel for Mr. Watt, ſaid, that as he obſerved a perſon of the name of Kennedy in the liſt of witneſſes againſt his client, and as he underſtood he would be a very material witneſs for the priſoner, he wiſhed to know from the Counſel for the Crown whether Kennedy was to be brought forward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anſtruther, for the Crown, ſaid, that every exertion had been uſed, both in England and Scotland to get hold of Kennedy, but hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to without effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton then ſuggeſted the propriety of delaying the trial till Kennedy could be found; but this Mr. Anſtruther oppoſed, aſſuring the Counſel for the priſoner, that if they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form where Kennedy was, they ſhould not be deprived of his evidence; for that if the King's Counſel knew where he was, Mr. Anſtruther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to have him brought forward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fletcher then ſuggeſted that it would be proper to have it fixed which of the priſoners ſhould be firſt brought to trial.</p>
               <p>The Lord Advocate ſaid, Mr. Watt was the perſon firſt meant to be tried.</p>
               <p>The Court then adjourned till Wedneſday next.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>SEPTEMBER 3.</head>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Clerk of Arraigns, proceeded to call the Jury, ſeveral of whom, in conſequence of the peremptory challenge which the Engliſh law
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027815_0007_0FD64CBF033676C8"/>
affords, the priſoner objected to; at laſt a jury of twelve citizens were ſworn in and impannelled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp recapitulated to the Jury the heads of the indictment, particularizing the different over-acts of treaſon of which the priſoner was accuſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dundas then roſe, and opened the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by addreſſing the Jury on the part of the proſecution. He ſaid, that as the Clerk of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns had read the ſubſtance of the indictment, it would be unneceſſary for him to recapitulate it fully. He would only notice, that it ſtated the Defendant having held a private correſpondence for the purpoſe of procuring and eſtabliſhing a meeting called a Convention, under the pretence indeed of obtaining a Reform, but really for the purpoſe of uſurping the powers of government, though they ſometimes ſaid it was to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of their ſuppoſed grievances. The indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo charges him with having aſſiſted in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing arms, which no doubt were to be employed againſt the government of the country; and finally the priſoner has conſulted on meaſures to overawe the legiſlature, and endanger the perſon of the King.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anſtruther ſaid, It is my duty to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the ſtate of the charge which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the Crown now bring againſt the priſoner at the bar—He remarked, that ſuch had been the peace the happineſs, and the proſperity of this country, and the Conſtitution under which we
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027815_0008_0FD64CC0E53BE7F8"/>
live, that the law of treaſon lives only in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; nor have we ſeen an inſtance of its exerciſe for half a century. He ſaid, he would ſhortly ſtate what the law is, and what are the crimes which conſtitute a breach of it.</p>
               <p>I profeſs not, ſaid he, to poſſeſs thoſe powers of oratory, for which ſome are ſo famed, but, if I did, I ſhould abſtain from exerciſing them on the preſent occaſion; for, I know I ſhould ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that duty I owe to my ſovereign, whom I ſerve, if I attempted to inflame your paſſions, or miſlead your judgement, againſt the perſon now at the bar. I ſhall, therefore, give you a plain ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtatement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anſtruther then ſtated, that at the time of the Union of England and Scotland, it was judged proper that the law of treaſon ſhould be the ſame in both countries; for as it was then brought about that we ſhould have one Sovereign, to whom we owed the ſame allegiance and duties, it was therefore determined, that in this reſpect we ſhould have the ſame law; and gentlemen, give me leave to remind you, it was a beneficent act that extended the Engliſh law of treaſon to this country, for that exiſting here before that period was infinitely more ſevere. The law of treaſon lies in little compaſs, and it has exiſted in England ſince Edward III. and was reduced to a certainty, which has little varied ſince that period.</p>
               <p>It ſtates three ſpecies of treaſon; compaſſing
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027815_0009_0FD64CC3F3F4D7A0"/>
and imagining the death of the King; levying war againſt him; and adhering to his enemies; and whoever is guilty of theſe, is guilty of treaſon.</p>
               <p>The offence charged is compaſſing and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the death of the King. The act charges not the offence done, but the intention of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, viz. that of compaſſing the death of the King. The law has been careful, becauſe the law knows the danger of allowing ſuch intention to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into effect; but while the law is thus ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in preſerving the life of the King, it is equally careful in preſerving the life of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and though it ſays compaſſing and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, yet it is not upon looſe grounds, for the act of Edward ſpecifies the manner to be by open deed.</p>
               <p>An overt-act is the mean uſed to effectuate the purpoſe of mind; but though you have thus heard of con<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſing and imagining the death of the King, you are not to ſuppoſe I muſt ſtate a direct act of attempting to poiſon or deſtroy the King. I muſt prove to you the means which the perſon has uſed to obtain his end; but, as I wiſh you to take no conſtruction of mine, therefore I will lay before you the opinion of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Judges upon the law of treaſon. Here Mr. Anſtruther ſtated a variety of law authorities. One author, he obſerved, ſays the law is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to direct attacks on his life, but to the means whereby the life of the Sovereign may be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered: that therefore, entering into meaſures to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027815_0010_0FD64CC3F7A24770"/>
get his perſon into cuſtody are overt-acts, becauſe they are means whereby his life may be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered. If I can bring any thing, by which the King's perſon and life were endangered, I call that high treaſon. Lord Chief Juſtice Hale ſays, if the conſpiracy be what muſt induce it, that is compaſſing the death of the King. So, if a conſpiracy is proved againſt the priſoner, which would have endangered the life of the King, that is what this Judge defines high treaſon.</p>
               <p>If I make out a charge againſt the priſoner, that he intended levying war againſt the King, to force him to do a particular thing, that is compaſſing the death of the King; for, as a learned Judge ſays, he that fights againſt the King, muſt know that it puts his perſon in danger; or, if I ſhow a deſign, which cannot be carried without evident danger to the King, it will be your duty to find the crime of treaſon. If a conſpiracy be formed to levy war againſt the three eſtates of the kingdom, how can that be carried on without endangering the life of his Majeſty?—It is an overt-act of treaſon wherever the deſign cannot be carried into effect without apparent danger to the King. Juſtice Hale ſays, a conſpiracy to levy war againſt the King, however diſguiſed under pretence of rectifying abuſes, caſting down incloſures, &amp;c. muſt be compaſſing the death of the King, for, it is ſaid, he that endeavours to conquer the King, cannot intend leſs than taking away his life.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I have no ſcruple to ſay,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027815_0011_0FD64CC400966FB8"/>
that the King's Council will prove that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner had entered into a conſpiracy to conquer the King, by levying war to force him to redreſs ſuppoſed grievances; and meetings to conſult about overawing the King, and levying war, is an overt-act of high treaſon. I will lay before you the means uſed by the priſoner to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his end; and if I prove it a conſpiracy againſt the King, it is high treaſon.</p>
               <p>In a caſe brought before Juſtice Coke, it was ſaid there was no war levied, and therefore the conſpiracy to levy war was not high treaſon. If there be a deſign to reſtrain his Majeſty by a conſultation to levy war, then it is high treaſon. In the reign of George I. in the caſe of Lair, it was agreed, that a conſpiracy to levy war was not high treaſon; but the judge ſaid, the law is, that a conſultation to levy war againſt the King in an overt-act of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>A conſpiracy to levy war has many times been indicted as an overt-act of high treaſon. Here Mr. Anſtruther ſtated a caſe of conſpiracy, and of the publiſhing a paper propoſing to ſeize the Tower of London and his Majeſty's Miniſters, which was conſidered as high treaſon, although compaſſing the death of the King was not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>The fact I mean now to try, after having thus ſtated the law, is ſuch a conſpiracy or deſign upon the part of the priſoner, as might have put the King's life in danger. This is not a ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027815_0012_0FD64CC7E23A40B8"/>
of a few individuals in an obſcure corner, but it is a conſpiracy ariſen from ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, under the appearance of ſeeking legal meaſures, urged on by perſons circulating ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious papers, and by ſeditious ſocieties here and elſewhere, and agreeing to a deſign to be carried into execution, which would have deluged this country with blood. Such is the conſpiracy charged againſt the priſoner.</p>
               <p>You know, Gentlemen, there have been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſocieties who aſſumed to themſelves the names of "Friends of the People." Their firſt pretended object was Reform by Petition; but whether they wiſhed to obtain their cauſe or be denied I know not; but their petition, however, did not meet ſucceſs. Soon after, a new ſcheme took place, and the firſt beginning of their plan will be found in a letter ſent to this country by Hardy, ſecretary to a London ſociety, where he ſays, "our petition has been rejected; our minds therefore muſt be turned to ſome other plan and more effectual means." To this Skirving return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an anſwer, and pointed out his plan, in which he foretells the downfall of Government. Then they turned their eyes towards a Convention; and no wonder they did ſo, as they had ſeen the effects of a Convention in another country. A variety of letters point out diſtinctly that this Convention was not to petition Parliament, but to act by their own authority. Now if I can prove that the deſign was to ſuperſede and annual the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027815_0013_0FD64CC99FC8A860"/>
of this country, and controul all its powers, I will certainly make out a caſe of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>Soon after this a body met at Edinburgh, who were afterwards joined by delegates from England, and took the title of Britiſh Convention. If you think their views were pure and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, there is no harm; but if otherwiſe, that their intentions were illegal, and to carry their plans by force, then it is neither more nor leſs than a plan to ſuperſede the Government and Legiſlature of this country, and ſet aſide the King. One part of the inſtructions by the Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Society in London to Margarot were to reſiſt the Legiſlature of the country in caſe they ſhould do a particular act, viz. to ſtop certain meetings of the people. This then is clearly a conſpiracy to reſiſt King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
               <p>This ſociety was divided into ſections and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and took the cant names which are uſed in the Convention of France. It may be ſaid, what harm in uſing French phraſes? This may abſtractedly be true, but you, Gentlemen, are to judge of the plans and views of men by all that you ſee them do. Various motions were made and diſcuſſed in this Convention; ſome for peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning for Reform, &amp;c. but from the moment they aſſumed the name of the Britiſh Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all idea of petitioning Parliament was laid aſide; and when it was even mentioned they paſſed to the order of the day, which was ſetting
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027815_0014_0FD64CCA9F72EF10"/>
aſide the queſtion altogether, and therefore I cannot but infer that ſome other mode was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And indeed they ſoon after agreed to certain reſolutions, too bold even for this ſociety to publiſh. Among others they reſolved to pay no attention to any Act of Parliament which they thought ſhould militate againſt the people, and continue to meet and reſiſt till compelled by ſuperior force to deſiſt. Every delegate was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed on his return home, to explain to his conſtituents the neceſſity of electing a delegate, and eſtabliſhing a fund for another Convention in caſes of emergency. Now I will ſhew you the priſoner agreeing to this reſolution, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to carry it into effect. This Convention was indeed diſperſed by the Chief Magiſtrate of this city, a gentleman whoſe honourable, upright, and ſteady conduct, has juſtly obtained for him the approbation of all good men; but ſoon after a propoſal was again made for calling another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in England. The firſt meeting for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Convention was held at the Globe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, London, where it was reſolved, to call a Convention to rule for themſelves, and to have no connection with Parliament; for ſay they, they muſt have a convention to obtain a redreſs from theſe plunderers and oppreſſors. And who were thoſe oppreſſors but the eſtates of the kingdom—King, Lords, and Commons, whom they thus meant to ſuperſede in all their functions?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:027815_0015_0FD64CCED463DD28"/>Their next meeting was held at the Chalk Farm, where they came to ſundry reſolutions: among others they declare, that certain acts of Parliament they will not obey, nor ſubmit to.—Theſe reſolutions clearly demonſtrate, that they meant to ſuperſede the Senators of the nation, whom they call the packed Repreſentatives of the People in Parliament, and take the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon themſelves. If you ſhall be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they meant to do ſo, you cannot doubt but their object was to deſtroy compleatly the Conſtitution of this Country. I may be told what is all this to the priſoner; but it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary I ſhould ſhew you, firſt, that there was ſuch a plan, and then ſhew, that the priſoner, was concerned; and his concern in this affair aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me the more, becauſe about two years ago, the priſoner pretended to be a zealous friend to Government, and had ſome communication with an illuſtrious character, who filled the office of Secretary of State.—To that reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he wrote, ſaying, he would be happy to give information reſpecting the Societies of the Friends of the People, and any other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that might be ſerviceable to Government. To this letter, an anſwer was returned, ſtating that ſuch information as ſhould be uſeful to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, would be thankfully received. After this, he had ſome correſpondence with my learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend, the Lord Advocate, who being ſubpoen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the priſoner, will, when called upon, give
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027815_0016_0FD64CD3A331A4C0"/>
a proper account of what tranſactions took place. The correſpondence, I believe, continued down to the middle of laſt year. Some applications were made by the priſoner to my learned friend; what were the nature of theſe applications I will leave with his lordſhip to ſay when he is called on.—Prior to the ceaſing of this correſpondence, however, the priſoner had refuſed to become a member of one of theſe ſocieties, and certainly was not a member of the Britiſh Convention; and unleſs I prove that he acceded to another Convention, and couple him with a conſpiracy in this country, he muſt be acquitted of that part of the charge.</p>
               <p>But, gentlemen, you know it is not neceſſary that I prove every act charged, if I prove one act it is ſufficient. If I prove he took certain means to effect the purpoſe of his mind, I then prove the concluſion of treaſon againſt him.—After the diſperſion of the Britiſh Convention, ſeveral members formed themſelves into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for the purpoſe of carrying on the very views of that meeting. Of this committee, the priſoner was a member, and one of its purpoſes was to ſelect delegates to another convention in England.</p>
               <p>This convention had alſo for its object to meet till oppoſed by force, and to collect a fund for ſupplying delegates. The priſoner moved for a committee of Union to collect the ſenſe of the People, and convene another Britiſh Convention,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027815_0017_0FD62583926BBA90"/>
He may indeed ſtate, that he had a peaceable meeting in view; but I ſhall ſhew my evidence that ſuch could not be his object; becauſe he acceded to the reſolution of oppoſing force, and to meet till diſperſed by force, and to call ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convention, ſuch as I have deſcribed a treacherous meeting, to overturn the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This convention ſeems to have taken great care of its members; its ſecond reſolution ſays, the <hi>"will</hi> of the conſtituent is the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent, therefore, if the repreſentative is attacked, it is the duty of the conſtituent to defend him by nature, reaſon, and honour."</p>
               <p>There was another Committee formed, of which Watt was alſo a member, called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Ways and Means.</hi> This was a ſecret committee; they kept no book, and committed nothing to writing. It was to tranſact all the money matters of the Friends of the People, and collect funds for what they called the <hi>Great Cauſe.</hi> This Society was alſo to correſpond with the Societies, who are to inform their committee what number of patriots they could depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch as would ſpare no pains in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Great Cauſe. This committee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of five perſons only, to whom all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties were to intruſt their money, and every concern. Upon one occaſion, this committee met to anſwer Hardy's letter, when Watt was preſent; and this I couple him both with the firſt Britiſh Convention and the one to be called.</p>
               <p>The next act of this committee was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027815_0018_0FD64CD6A4A43408"/>
to ſeduce the Fencibles in this kingdom, and excite commotion among the ſoldiers. To effectuate this, they circulated among the ſoldiers lying at Dalkeith, a printed bill of a moſt wicked tendency. The types of this bill were found in Watt's houſe, and I will trace copies of it from his hands to the perſon who actually diſtributed them.</p>
               <p>Both here comes another plan which Watt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and lead in the committee. In the night time a fire was to be lighted at the Exciſe Office, to attack the ſoldiers from the caſtle, and when they were to march down the ſtreet to aid in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing it, then were the Friends of the People to attack and maſſacre them with thoſe deadly inſtruments. This done, the caſtle was to be taken poſſeſſion of, together with the Banks and all Public Offices—The Judges and Magiſtrates were then to be ſeized and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when all this was accompliſhed, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was to be iſſued, ordering all farmers to bring their grain immediately to market, and ordering that no country gentleman ſhould go three miles from home, all under the penalty of death. This was to be followed by an Addreſs to his Majeſty, <hi>ordering</hi> him to diſmiſs his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and diſſolve the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, all this I will clearly prove; and if I do, ſurely there can remain no doubt that the plan of this priſoner was to overthrow the Government, and put the King's life in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027815_0019_0FD64CD82664B088"/>
I need ſcarcely add, that before this, the Friends of the People were to be all armed.—Theſe facts he had found it incumbent on him to ſtate; but at the ſame time, he requeſted the Jurymen not to allow his obſervation to ſway their judgment, but throw them out of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection till they were ſubſtantiated by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence now to be adduced.</p>

               <p>Edward Lauzon, King's Meſſenger, depoſed, that he knew Mr. Hardy, Secretary to the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Correſponding Society, and ſeized ſome papers in his houſe in London.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton ſtated, that he underſtood it to be law, that no proof can be adduced to any extraneous matter not in the indictment till ſuch time as an overt-act can be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Auſtruther anſwered, that before he could prove Mr. Watt to be acceſſary to a conſpiracy, he muſt prove that ſuch a conſpiracy did exiſt, and then he would ſhew that Watt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton ſaid, a plot in England is not the ſame charge with a plot in Scotland, which Mr. Watt is charged to have been concerned with,</p>
               <p>Mr. Auſtruther replied, it is ſtated a plot did exiſt, and I will prove, perhaps by evidence from England, that a plot in which Watt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027815_0020_0FD64CDCB8C2F9B0"/>
exiſted in Scotland. (The objection was over-ruled by the Court.)</p>
               <p>This witneſs then ſaid, he found ſome papers in Hardy's houſe, among which was a letter ſigned <hi>William Skirving,</hi> dated 25th May, 1793—another dated 10th June, 1792; alſo a printed letter, ſigned <hi>T. Hardy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Procurator-fiſcal, ſtated, that Mr. Skirving and others of the Britiſh Convention, were apprehended on 4th December, 1793; and ſeveral papers were found in Skirving's houſe. Here the witneſs identified ſeveral papers, ſome of which were addreſſed to Margarot, Gerald, and Skirving;—alſo, inſtructions from the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Correſponding Society for Conſtitutional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;—ſeveral letters from Hardy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Inſtructions for Citizen Gerald, Oct. 24, 1793. Mr. Scot then ſtated the circumſtances reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Margarot and Gerald being apprehended and the papers found on them.</p>
               <p>He next mentioned his having been preſent when the Convention was diſperſed at the Croſs-cauſeway, in December laſt. He ſpecified a letter of Skirving's hand-writing, dated in May, 1793, addreſſed to Thomas Hardy, London. It acknowledged a former letter which he ſays would be laid before the ſociety. It ſays "I know no more ſervice I can do to my country <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>John Taylor, Fleet-ſtreet, London, ſaid he was a member of the London Correſponding Society, and knows T. Hardy the Secretary and knows his hand-writing, which he now ſees upon a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per entitled, <hi>Certificate of Gerald's Election.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other letters were alſo ſhewn, which he ſaid were Hardy's writing. He ſaid, the London Correſponding ſociety was a large body divided into diviſions, amounting to fourteen. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral committee met on Thurſday. A committee of emergency was formed in May laſt. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meeting was held in January laſt, about a thouſand perſons preſent; ſo great was the crowd that the floor gave way. One Martin was Chairman. Reſolutions were agreed to, and afterwards printed. One ſpeaker propoſed, that the permanent committee ſhould meet every day, and diſtribute hand-bills; and, in caſe the Habeas Corpus Act ſhould be repealed, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſhould repel force by force. He received a copy of the Reſolutions of the Meeting from a perſon named "Moore," and now ſees in on the table.</p>
               <p>He remembers a meeting at Chalk Farm, two miles from London, where there were about two

thouſand people. A perſon named "Love," was in the chair. Some reſolutions were read. They were put ſeparately, and all carried, and printed. He received one from T. Hardy in May, at a meeting of the ſecond diviſion of the London Correſponding Society. The witneſs ſtated a variation in the copy of the Reſolutions. The one ſays, the conduct of the Miniſtry brought Charles I. to the ſcaffold, and expelled the Stuart family from the throne; therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>That the preſent Miniſtry were guilty of High Treaſon.</hi> The expreſſion in the other is, "Therefore Miniſters ought to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not guilty of High Treaſon."

He thinks it was about the time when Earl Stanhope delivered his ſpeech about introducing foreign troops. Some ſaid they would as readily arm againſt the French as againſt other foreigners; others ſaid they ought to arm in defence of liberty; but cannot ſay who were the perſons that ſaid ſo.

               <p>Mr. Erſkine ſaid he did not think it competent by the law of Scotland to queſtion a witneſs upon that ſubject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anſtruther ſtated the law of England to be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Lord Preſident ſaid, the law of Scotland was certainly as Mr. Erſkine had ſtated, but with reſpect to England he apprehended it was different, and hinted to Mr. Anſtruther that it would be better to avoid that in future.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anſtruther, ſaid he would take the hint, and would not have done it in this caſe, had not the witneſs acted in the very extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he had done; but he would now requeſt the jury to lay his evidence out of their view.</p>
               <p>George Roſs, late of the Gazetteer Office, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones, That he knows the priſoner, and has ſeen him in his own houſe about the end of the laſt or beginning of the preſent year. There was a committee, which began to meet in his houſe about the above period; Downie, Mac Ewen, Orrock, and Watt, were of that Committee which, he thinks, was called the Committee of Union. They went into a private apartment. There were two Committees; a ſmaller one met at one time, and a larger at another. They met once a week, and continued till Downie and Watt were apprehended, and at that time the witneſs left Edinburgh.</p>

One Bonthorn a teacher, attended, and Mr. Stoke was once or twice there. After the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention was diſperſed, two ſocieties continued to meet: one in Symon's-ſquare, the other in his houſe. In Symon's-ſquare, about 70 people met. Deponies, That he does not know Mr. Hardy; but once wrote to him: That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Mr. Hardy ſome printed papers, ſigned T. Hardy, which Mr. Stoke brought to him. Theſe were ſent to different perſons belonging to the ſocieties in the country, viz. in Perth, Paiſley, Strathaven, Dundee, &amp;c. The one ſent to Perth was directed to Walter Miller, the one to Strathaven to John Wilſon.</p>
               <p>Alexander Mitchell, manufacturer in Stathaven being ſhewn a letter, acknowledged he wrote it in anſwer to a printed letter ſigned Hardy, ſent him regarding a convention. In conſequence of that letter, a meeting of the ſociety was held, and a delegate choſen to the convention. His letter was directed to T. Hardy, London, and announced that a delegate was choſen.</p>
               <p>William Lockhart, ſheriff's chamber, ſaid, he went to ſearch the houſe of Mr. Watt for ſome goods, which were ſecreted, belonging to a bankrupt. In the ſearch he found ſome pikes. He made a ſecond ſearch the ſame week, May 15, and found ſome more in a cloſet. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs produced the pikes, and put two of them on a ſhelf which was alſo found in the priſoner's houſe and carried to the ſheriff's chamber. The
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027815_0028_0FD64CF28C75B668"/>
witneſs alſo found the types of a hand-bill, which he likewiſe carried to the ſheriff's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>William Middleton, ſheriff's officer, on 15th May laſt, ſearched the houſe of Orrock, ſmith, at Dean, and alſo ſearched Mr. Watt's where he found ſome pikes, and ſome types ſet up. In Mr Orrock's houſe he found 33 piker, ſome finiſhed, and ſome not.—Here the witneſs ſhewed the pikes, and deponed, that they were found in the ſmithy.</p>
               <p>James Walker, in the ſheriff clerk's office, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones, that he ſaw a form of types in the ſheriff clerk's office in May laſt: ſaw an impreſſion taken off them at Campbell Denovan's printing office; and being ſhown a copy, depones that it is the ſame impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff Clark ſaid, That upon the 15th May, Mr. Lockhart brought a pike to his office. A warrant was then granted to ſearch Watt's houſe, and he, the witneſs, went there; where in an upper room he found in a cloſet a form of types, two lines of which he could read; the one Dundee, April 12 1794, the other, for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes you were enliſted.</p>
               <p>James Somervell, printer, ſaid he took off an impreſſion from a form of types which he got from the ſheriff in May laſt, and identified a copy of it.</p>
               <p>William Watſon, Dalkeith, ſaid, he thinks he once ſaw the pannel in his own houſe, which is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027815_0029_0FD64CF3EAA66D30"/>
farther down the ſtreet than the North Bridge; that Mr. Downie ſent him there. It was about the beginning of ſummer. Recollects a fencible regiment at Dalkeith, and it was about the time he ſaw Watt and Downie. He was then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Ritchie's ſhop door when Downie paſſed; and, having heard of a hand bill about the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles, he aſked Downie for one, who ſaid, if he would follow him, he would gratify his curioſity. He then took the witneſs to Watt's houſe, where he remained a few minutes, and Downie ſaid he could not get them there. He then went to a Mr. Kennedy's, who gave them ſome of theſe bills. Mr. Downie deſired him to throw the parcel on the floor, and, if any body aſked him where he got it, he might ſay he found it. He did ſo, and took it up again; and, having carried it home, gave theſe bills to ſome of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, one of them named "Johnſton." The witneſs was a member of the convention, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Society of the Friends of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Dalkeith.</p>
               <p>William Johnſton deponed, that he got a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from William Watſon about the fencibles. It was dated Dundee.</p>
               <p>James Sandilands depones, that he got a paper from William Johnſton, and immediately gave it to Serjeant Hardy, of the Earl of Hopetown's fencibles.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Hardy deponed, that he got from James Sandilands a ſeditious paper regarding the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027815_0030_0FD64CF56B096138"/>
fencibles; this was on Saturday 10th of May laſt: the regiment was then going to Liverpool and Whitehaven.—(Here the witneſs identified the paper.)</p>
               <p>Arthur M'Ewan, Water of Leith, bred a weaver, deponed, that he was a member of a Society of Friends of the People there; was as delegate to the convention when they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; after the diſperſion the ſociety at Water of Leith continued to meet; That he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at a meeting of the Committee of Union at George Roſs's.—There were more than twenty members preſent. They formed another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, called the Committee of Ways and Means, of which he was a member. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this meeting was to conſider on a letter from Mr. Skirving, which ſaid, as the convention owed him money he expected they would pay it, and take care of his wife and children. The members were Watt, Stoke, Downie, Bonthorn, and himſelf.</p>
               <p>At the ſecond meeting, Watt, Downie, Stoke, Bonthorn, and ſelf were preſent. At the third meeting, Watt, Downie, Bonthorn, Stoke, and ſelf were preſent.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Watt read a paper for ſeizing on Lord Juſtice Clerk the Lords of Seſſion, and the Lord Provoſt. A fire was to be lighted at the Exciſe, and when the ſoldiers were coming down, the people were to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027815_0031_0FD64CF7AD4858A0"/>
fall on them and to ſeize the banks.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Thinks this was to be in the night <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There were to be commiſſioners to demand the caſh of the banks. Thinks, that Watt afterwards put the paper containing this plan into a preſs. In Watt's own room he read a paper or proclamation to this effect, "deſiring all farmers not to remove their grain under pain of death, and all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men not to go three miles from their houſes." This was to be iſſued immediately after the above mentioned attack.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the ſame paper was an addreſs to the King to diſmiſs his Miniſters, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Parliament, put an end to the war or he might abide by the conſequences: That Watt ordered him, to accompany him to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rock, when he deſired Orrock to make pikes, of which Orrock drew a model: That Watt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be buſy, as he had 4000 to ſend to Perth, beſides what was needed for Edinburgh, and ſo ſoon as they were made, he would get his money. The witneſs ſaw Orrock's ſervant making one, and a lad came in, who aſked him what was their uſe? He anſwered, an invention mounting for a gentleman's gates: That he has ſeen John Fairley at the committee, and he was told he had been ſent to the weſt, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was preſent when Fairley told he had viſited many places, of which Watt took a note.</p>
               <p>Fairley ſaid, Paiſly was in a ſtate of great
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027815_0032_0FD64CF7B32B9818"/>
readineſs. The witneſs ſaid, when the paper was read, he would by no means agree to any thing that would ſhed the blood of his countrymen: That he heard another letter read in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Ways and Means; has heard of ſome perſons called collectors in the committe of Union. The ſociety of Water of Leith gave 15<abbr>s.</abbr> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for Mr. Skirving's family, to be at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of this committee, and 15<abbr>l.</abbr> from Perth.—[Here the witneſs identified the paper produced by Watt.]</p>
               <p>William Bonthorn deponed, that he was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſub-committee, or committee of Ways and Means, but withdrew from them altogether about the 17th of April. Watt attended that committee, and the committee of Union—agreed with the preceding witneſs M'Ewan, as to the members of the committee of Ways and Means.</p>

               <p>Being farther interrogated, ſaid, he wiſhed the Court to aſk him no queſtions, for he remembered nothing at all of the matter; there was ſuch a confuſion that it cut off his whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection. On being told he was criminal in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the truth, he deponed, That he never heard Watt propoſe a plan, but heard him read a paper.</p>

It was not ſent, as at that time John Fairley called on the witneſs, and ſaid he was to take a jaunt to the Weſt Country, and wanted him to give ſome ſhillings, for which he would account.

                  <p>Yes, one morning by accident; he did not ſay where he had been, nor whom he ſaw.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Deponed that he heard of a printed letter which Hardy ſent, but knows nothing of the contents; an anſwer was ſent to Hardy's letter, but does not know the contents; it was wrote by Stoke, and was to be carried by himſelf, he being going to London in a few days by ſea.—Saw a paper about the Fencibles, wrote by Stoke, and Watt was preſent.</p>
               <p>John Fairley, Wright, ſaid he was a member of the Britiſh Convention, and was choſen by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to be a collector. They collected money and ſentiments, becauſe there was a number of people warmly attached to the cauſe who could
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027815_0035_0FD64CFE86FC77A8"/>
not give their attendance, but gave money, while others gave only their opinion. This was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called a Committe of Ways and Means, where he was ſometimes preſent with Watt. He heard there were ſome pikes got ready, and was not long acquainted with Watt when he ſhewed him ſome. They had once ſpoke about pikes before, and he (the witneſs) had a drawing of one made out, which he ſhewed Watt, who told him the pikes were intended for ſelf-defence, and no perſon was to get them but thoſe who wanted and paid for them.</p>

                  <p>I was expreſſing my fears that the meaſures of government would drive the people to deſpair, and Mr. Watt anſwered there would be no bloodſhed, for thoſe who were moſt active againſt the cauſe of the people would be impriſoned.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>He recollects Mr. Watt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſoldiers, on which the witneſs ſaid, that if affairs came to extremities, he had no fear of the ſoldiers, for he would juſt ſpeak to them, and they would be as glad of freedom as we can be.</p>

               <p>The witneſs then ſaid it was once mentioned, that after ſeizing the obnoxious people here, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers were to be ſent to the country, to announce what was done. That Mr. Watt once told him he would give him ſome of the arms to ſhow the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027815_0036_0FD64D0020C6A3E8"/>
collectors, upon which he made ſome objections and Mr. Watt replied there could certainly be no objections to a merchant ſelling goods in his ſhop. That Mr. Watt ſhewed him pikes in his own houſe, which he wiſhed him to carry and ſhew the collectors.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe none of the collectors ever aſked for them.</p>

                  <speaker>Crown.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Wit.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought no harm of it myſelf, but other people might think ſo, becauſe I was diſtributing them; and the collectors might have thought I wiſhed to urge them upon them before they were aſked. One day I propoſed going to Bo-neſs, when Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn aſked me to carry a letter. Next morning I called on Mr. Watt, and he deſired me to call at Mr. Campbell's, hatter, and get a parcel, which I did. It contained papers. Mr. Watt ſaid, I would know what to do with it. I went to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, viz. Glaſgow, Paiſley, Kirkintilloch, Kilſvth, Stirling, &amp;c. and had two papers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the one to deſire the ſociety to ſend Mr. Downie their money, and alſo to diſtribute papers; the other to aſk what number of patriots there were in the place. I then went to Stirling, and delivered a copy of theſe papers to all the people I called on, viz. Dr. Forreſt, in his own houſe, where were ſeveral others.

Thinks the name of one in Foreſt's houſe was Thompſon; they all remained about two hours. I told them the news in Edinburgh about what I have already mentioned; and drew a plan of a pike on Foreſt's table.—Then left Stirling, and went to Mr. M'Croſs, a relief Miniſter at St. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan's. Then went to Kirkintilloch, and called on Mr. Anderſon—next to Paiſley, on Mr. Haſtie, a member of the Convention. Then came to Edinburgh, and went to the committee of Union, where were M'Ewan, Downie and Watt, to whom I told what I had done, and returned the written inſtructions formerly received, to Mr. Watt, as alſo a liſt of the towns and places, and of the people where I had been.—Had alſo a paper on my journey, authoriſing me to call at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. There were ſeals at this commiſſion—no names; but it was ſaid it came from the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of ways and means. This was alſo returned to Mr. Watt. I received a line from Mr. Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn to Mr. Watt, who gave me a line to Mr. Downie, from whom I received 30<abbr>s.</abbr> to defray the expences of the journey.</p>

Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation took place of a plan for diſarming the ſoldiers, which, I underſtood, was to be done by the perſons who ſent Firley weſt. He ſpoke of ſome people in Edinburgh who would repent their conduct, and would be put up by the people who ſent him. He ſpoke of collectors who were to head and command the people when they ſhould riſe. It was ſaid there was to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, ſimilar to the Britiſh Convention which met at Edinburgh. From the Converſation I had with Fairley I gathered there was to be a riſing of the people, and a ſeizing of ſoldiers arms.</p>

               <p>Robert Orrock, ſmith, ſaid, ha was a member of the Water of Leith Society, the Convention, &amp;c. He firſt heard of arms in March, when in George Roſs's houſe—There were preſent Watt, Mac Ewan, and Downie. The converſation took place about ſome ſpeech in the newſpaper about arms, and the Goldſmiths-Hall people had got ſome, and we ſhould apply for ſome too. It was
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027815_0040_0FD64D0A63FE6E88"/>
ſaid we ſhould not get them, to which Watt anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—there was no law in Britan cold prevent us.</p>
               <p>Watt called on the witneſs and wiſhed to look at a weapon he had ſpoken of, and ſhewed him a draught of one, which he made, and carried to George Roſs's houſe, and ſhewed it there to Watt, Downie and others. Some days after, about the 1ſt of May, Watt called at the Dean, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to make a few pikes with croſs axes, and two or three dozen of different forms. He aſked me how many I could make a week? I ſaid fifty. He aſked if I could get ſticks? I ſaid I might. Some time after Martin Todd called on me from Watt, and aſked if I had made any of the inſtruments? He again called, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me a large one, and deſired I would make one like it—I ſaid I would not. One William Brown afterwards called, and aſked if I was making the pikes! I ſaid I was; but he aſked how we could get ſticks, for there were thouſands of them wanted. I then began to be alarmed, for Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Brown made all his in ſecret. Watt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſired me to ſay they were for the top of a gate.—At firſt I thought they were for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the country. Mr. Watt ordered them, and Mr. Downie was to pay for them. I have heard of a Committee of Ways and Means, of which Watt was a member. In the Committee of Union there was a converſation about getting arms, and I made one for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Martin Todd, ſmith, remembers going from
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027815_0041_0FD64D0D6F538A20"/>
Watt to Orrock with a pike. Orrock returned it, and ſaid he was going on with them as faſt as poſſible.</p>
               <p>William Brown, ſmith, ſaid, William Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſked me to make ſome ſpears for a Mr. Watt; and when I told him I did not know but I might, he deſired me to call on Watt, which I did, and he ſhewed me a ſpear, and aſked if I would make ſome. Mr. Watt afterwards called at my ſhop, when I ſhowed him one half done, and told him I did not chuſe to make any more of that kind. He then ordered ſpears with ſockets. I made fourteen and ſent them to Watt's houſe, when he gave me a line to David Downie, who paid me the money.</p>
               <p>John Fairley ſent notice to the Court, that he wiſhed to correct his former evidence. Being again called to the bar, ſaid, he recollected Watt ſaying, that the Banks and the Public Offices were to be ſeized. Thoſe moſt againſt us (the Ariſtocratics) were to be ſeized, and couriers to be ſent to the country with the news. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of Edinburgh were alſo to be ſeized.</p>
               <p>William Robertſon, ſchoolmaſter, Simon's-ſquare.—Watt once aſked me, if I knew any ſmith that could make ſpears. I mentioned Brown, to whom Watt gave me a meſſage. I was a member of a ſociety that met in my ſchool. It increaſed much after the diſperſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Their object was univerſal ſuffrage and annual Parliaments. Have heard of a committee
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027815_0042_0FD64D0E600B7208"/>
of Union. Was ſecretary to a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. Watt was at that committee when a motion was made for a committee of emergency. Has heard of a Committee of Ways and Means, and alſo that a perſon went to the north, and another to the weſt country. There was greater ſecreſy obſerved than formerly among the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Friends of the People, at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

               <p>William M'Ewan was again called into Court. He ſaid he heard Mr. Stoke ſay he would do every thing in his power to open a correſpondence between T. Hardy, the ſecretary to the London Correſponding Society and Watt.</p>

James Clerk, Eſq. Sheriff-depute of the county of Edinburgh, ſaid, When Watt was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he declined giving any anſwer to queſtions, until with the permiſſion of the Lord Advocate and Mr. Secretary Dundas. He was again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined next day, when he was told the anſwer he gave was no anſwer as to the pikes—He ſaid, at the ſecond examination, that on his table an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement would be found for the ſale of pikes, which he conſidered as an article of trade, and thought he would ſell them cheaper than any other.</p>
               <p>The Lord Advocate was then ſworn—His Lordſhip ſaid, that in October, 1792, when Mr. Secretary Dundas came to Scotland, he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral converſations with him about the ſtate of the ſocieties in Scotland. He then mentioned Mr. Watt's name, on account of a letter which Watt wrote him, offering his ſervices to government; in conſequence of which an enquiry was made concerning him. As he was thought faithful, he was truſted by thoſe in power. He gave ſeveral pieces of information, and ſometimes came to his Lordſhip's houſe, in George's-ſquare in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when dark. One piece of information he gave was, that ſome ſoldiers, on their march from Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Barracks to Perth, had on the road been tampered with by ſome perſons and Societies of the Friends of the People; but, on a thorough
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027815_0044_0FD64D142395C590"/>
inveſtigation, the whole ſtory turned out to be a falſehood.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip ſaid, Watt had ſent him a letter in March 1793, mentioning, that two perſons, whom he had reaſon to believe poſſeſſed a good deal of knowledge with regard to certain plans forming by ſocieties in Scotland, had told him they could give him a very important piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; but this they would divulge to no one unleſs 1000<abbr>l.</abbr> was paid down. This letter, his Lordſhip ſaid, he ſhewed to Mr. Dundas and Mr. Pitt, who agreed with him, that ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand could not be complied with, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly an anſwer to that purpoſe was ſent to Mr. Watt; but that afterwards Watt informed his Lordſhip, that before the perſons alluded to had ſpoken to him, they took him bound in a bill for 30<abbr>l.</abbr> which he paid; this bill his Lordſhip order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be paid. He does not think he received any letter from Watt ſince July 1793, nor has ſeen him ſince October laſt.</p>
               <p>(Here the whole Proof cloſed.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton then addreſſed the Jury on the part of the priſoner. He ſtated the importance of the trial as requiring their moſt ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was a charge, he ſaid, of the moſt heinous nature, accuſing of the higheſt crime: It was a caſe of blood, in which they were to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on the fate of this pannel. He obſerved, that by order of Court, the conducting of the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027815_0045_0FD64D162C267D80"/>
pannel's defence had been entruſted to him, and he now promiſed, a man of honour, to do him all the ſervice in his power. This he conſidered as a duty he owed to him, and a duty he owed to his own feelings. The crime, he ſaid, was not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect attak on the ſacred perſon of his Majeſty. If it had, I ſhould not have brought my voice to life in defence of the criminal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton now entered upon an inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law of treaſon, and, in a very maſterly manner, went through a voluminous body of law authorities, to ſhow its nature and diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>He then went over the whole evidence, and combated it in its various parts in the moſt able manner. He took notice of the ſuppoſed attack on the Caſtle as an irrational and extravagantly fooliſh idea. Of the pikes found, he remarked, that the ſmallneſs of the number was ſufficient to prove, they could not be intended to be uſed in any ſerious attack againſt this country; beſides only ſeven perſons were belonging to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee who are ſaid to have known of them. Could ſeven perſons uſe forty-ſeven pikes? Could forty-ſeven pikes take the Caſtle, maſſacre the ſoldiers, ſeize the Judges, and overcome the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Upon every topic of the evidence, he diſcanted with great ability, and particularly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to the panel's correſpondence with thoſe in power, ſaying, that was in order to follow out his plan of obtaining information, that he had done what was charged againſt him. His caſe was
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027815_0046_0FD64D192D0928D8"/>
ſimilar to that of a ſpy in an enemy's camp or army, where it was not only neceſſary he ſhould wear their uniform, but alſo carry arms againſt the power he meant to ſerve. Yet, could it be ſaid, that if ſuch a perſon is taken by that power who employed him as a ſpy, that he ſhould ſuffer for being taken under ſuch circumſtances? He argued that it was probable the priſoner meant to have given intimation to Mr. Dundas, of any of theſe plans that might be forming, ſo ſoon as he found it a proper time to do ſo. He obſerved, that it was moſt unqueſtionably neceſſary, that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have proper perſons to give them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of any improper ſchemes going on; but, what perſon will be found ſo hardy in future, if this man ſhall fall in the cauſe.</p>
               <p>After many moſt ingenious remarks, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by ſaying, That, if the cup of this man's iniquity be full, the dregs are bitter, yet he muſt drink them; but if otherwiſe, and he ſhall yet meet with a deliverance, then it falls to you, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the jury, to daſh the cup from his trembling lip, that he may not taſte its bitters.</p>
               <p>The Lord Advocate then roſe to reply; and ſaid, that as the trial had branched out ſo long, he ſhould be as conciſe as the nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the caſe required. His Lordſhip ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that although the learned gentleman who had preceded him ſaid, that no alluſions to the ſtate of affairs in another country, ought to be mentioned on this occaſion, yet, as the ſimilarity
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027815_0047_0FD64D1EEF95C340"/>
of the plans adopted by the diſcontented in this country ſo nearly reſembled that which was ſo unhappily purſued there, he thought it his duty to ſay, that what had appeared in evidence this day, fully juſtified him in ſaying, that there was but too much truth in it. His Lordſhip urged at great length, and with much ability, on the laws of Treaſon, particularly the Statute of Edw. III. and adduced the opinion of many able Engliſh Lawyers in ſupport of his conſtruction of that Statute. He was clearly of opinion, that the crime laid in the indictment, whatever conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his learned brother (Mr. Hamilton) might give it, was clearly that ſpecies of treaſon, of compaſſing and imagining the death of the King.</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to ſum up the evidence in ſupport of the charge; which he demonſtrated to be clearly and ſubſtantially proved; yet, if the Jury were not of his opinion he ſhould be happy at the acquittal of the priſoner—as the Jury were the Judges of that, not he; and if that was the caſe, none would more rejoice at ſuch an event than himſelf, though, from the complexion of the evidence, there was little hopes of that being the caſe. His Lordſhip then ſtated to the Jury the nature of the evidence beginning with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's correſpondence with Skirving. He then proceeded to ſtate the proceedings of the Britiſh Convention till its diſperſion, which was proved by Roſs, Aitchiſon, and others—the proceedings of the London correſponding Society at the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027815_0048_0FD64D20A6EC2450"/>
Globe Tavern and Chalk Farm, which was proved by Meſſrs, Taylor and Goſling. He then ſaid, he had proved the acceſſion of Watt to the ſchemes of the Friends of the People, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member of both the Committees of Union and Ways and Means, and that he was a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ringleader of the Committees—that he had propoſed the plan for the taking of the Caſtle of Edinburgh, ſecuring the perſons of the Judges, Lord Provoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—he taking poſſeſſion of the Banks and Exciſe Office, and the attacking and diſarming the ſoldiers. That, at an after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the committee, he had read an addreſs to the people in form of a proclamation: That he had diſpatched Fairly to the Weſt Country, to ſee <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> minds of the people ſtood affected: That he had employed Orrock and Brown to make pikes, which were afterwards found by Mr. Lockhart and Middleton in Watt's houſe. That the types of a feditious hand bill were likewiſe found in Watt's houſe, which was circulated among the fencibles at Dalkeith—and that, upon the whole, the indictment with reſpect to the priſoner was clearly proved by the concurring teſtimony of almoſt all the witneſs adduced for the Crown. With regard to the defence ſet up for the priſoner, that he had gone into all thoſe ſchemes merely that he might inform govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what was going on among the Friends of the People, he ſaid this was highly abſurd and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:027815_0049_0FD64D2115A21218"/>
improbable; for although for ſome conſiderable time he and Mr. Watt had been acquainted, and Mr. Watt had communicated various pieces of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to him, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the end of laſt year, he had joined the Friends of the People, and become an active <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> among them, without acquainting him or any ſervant of the Crown, of the alteration of his conduct. This defence, therefore, could avail him nothing, as before he joined the Friends of the People he had entirely withdrawn himſelf from giving information to the government.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027815_0053_0FD64D2FFA63D488"/>
Convention, ſimilar in its views with the one which ſome time ago met in this City, called the Britiſh Convention. He is alſo accuſed of procuring, or cauſing to be made, arms, or offenſive weapons, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to levy war againſt the King, with a determination to reſiſt his royal authority, and compel him to comply with certain meaſures, to diſmiſs his miniſters, diſſolve the parliament, and put an end to the war. Another charge is, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſeduce the ſoldiers from their duty and allegiance; and that ſhortly, he has taken ſuch meaſures as make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of compaſſing and imagining the death of the King.—Theſe particulars will be more fully ſtated by the Counſel who is now to addreſs you."</p>
            <p>The Lord Advocate then roſe, and ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"This is an indictment for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and my duty is to ſtate to you the law upon that ſubject, and the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and import of the facts which, on the part of the Crown and the public, I mean to bring evidence to ſupport. It is your duty, Gentlemen, to conſider the whole
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027815_0054_0FD64D300313E720"/>
evidence, and from thence form what your judgment ſhall be.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, it muſt be well known to you, that at the Union of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the ſyſtem of the treaſon law of this country ſuffered an alteration, founded on the beſt grounds of expediency; and ſince that period the treaſon law of England had been adopted in this country. Had the Scots treaſon law ſtill remained here, thoſe men who are now ſuffering the puniſhment of their crimes in a diſtant country, would have ſuffered a capital puniſhment. To the honour of the treaſon law of England it has remained ſince Edward III. the ſame down to this day, and has been the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the trials for treaſon that have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place ſince; and it has met the applauſe of our moſt celebrated lawyers, and beſt hiſtorians, and the people have lived happy under it:—for, while it guards and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the life of his Majeſty, it is equally careful of the life of the ſubject, being a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier againſt any overſtretched power.</p>
            <p>"It includes three diſtinct caſes of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: 1ſt, Compaſſing and imagining the the death of the King:—2d, Levying war againſt the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027815_0055_0FD64D31968D73E8"/>
King:—3d, Adhearing to his enemies.—The firſt, viz. compaſſing and imagining the death of the King, falls to be, in this caſe the moſt material. The ſecond alſo comes under your conſideration; for endeavouring to levy war, even although it is not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly levied, falls under the firſt head, that of compaſſing and imagining the death of the King. Since the Union, we have had two rebellions in this country; but by the ſpecial Statute, the perſons who were brought to trial for there concern in them, were tried in the Siſter Kingdom. We are the firſt in this kingdom who have had the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty to perform—that of applying it upon the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>"Recent occurrances have ſhown us the conſpiracy that has been formed to ſeduce the people from their allegiance, under the ſpecious pretence of Reform, but really with the purpoſe of diſtroying the lawful authorities of the country, and the fair fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of our Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>"The Act of Parliament, of which I am now to ſpeak, needs no explanation; yet for your ſatisfaction, I will ſtate, not in my own words, but in the words of the moſt
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027815_0056_0FD64D31D10C3648"/>
celebrated Engliſh lawyers, there opinion concerning it.—Here his Lordſhip went through a great number of law authorities, Judge Foſter, Hawkins, and Blackſtone. One of theſe, he remarked, ſaid, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to compaſſing the death of the King, "that the will muſt be taken for the deed."—The King is the head of the body politic, and members are connected under him; and his life cannot be taken away but it muſt involve the Nation in blood. If conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors meet, and conſult to take away the life of the King, every perſon who has a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge, and attends ſuch conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, if he does not give information, falls to be preſented to a Jury.—The law does not confine the crime to a direct attack, but to every attempt at compaſſing the death of the King, or ſeizing his perſon; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has ſhown, that, between the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the grave of princes, the diſtance is very ſmall. Every attempt even to ſeize his perſon is conſidered compaſſing his death: for, the purpoſe cannot be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without manifeſt danger to his perſon.</p>
            <p>Gentleman, you all well know, that about two years ago a number of perſons formed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027815_0057_0FD64D382235E770"/>
clubs and ſocieties, to obtain, as they ſaid, Parliament Reform; but whatever was their pretence, their real ſcheme was to ſubvert the Conſtitution, and introduce univerſal ſuffrage and annual Parliaments in place of that happy ſyſtem under which we ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely live. They accordingly applied to Parliament by petition, but Parliament, to its immortal honour, diſcovered what was couched under it, and rejected their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Being thus diſappointed, ſome of theſe clubs immediately ſet about other means; for, in a letter in 1792, from Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Skirving, he ſays, <q>Our petition has been rejected, therefore, we muſt take ſome more effectual means.</q> We have ſeen a Britiſh Convention in this country, aſſuming to itſelf very high powers indeed, and even going the length to ſay, they would watch the motion of Parliament, in caſe they <hi>dared</hi> to paſs certain acts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their determination to reſiſt till compelled to deſiſt by ſuperiour force; and that upon the firſt intimation given to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a certain act of Parliament, then were they to call a Convention of Emergency, and erect the ſtandard of rebellion againſt
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027815_0058_0FD64D3825B0C208"/>
the legal conſtituted authorities of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>To the honour of the Chief Magiſtrate of this city, whoſe conduct upon that as upon every other occaſion, has procured him the eſteem of every good citizen, he went and diſperſed this Convention. Proſecutions were afterwards brought againſt the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders in theſe tranſactions, and they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the juſt puniſhment which their crimes merited.—I will prove ſaid his Lordſhip, that the priſoner was a member of this Convention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Downie</hi>—My <hi>Lord Preſident,</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Lord Advocate ſtating this to the Jury; for I was formerly a witneſs in one of theſe trials, and was told by the Court, that I never could be charged for my conduct in theſe matters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> ſaid, the Lord Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate was not to charge him with any crime committed previous to that trial, but only what was done ſince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Advocate</hi> proceeded. "I muſt ſhow his connection with that Convention to prove his views the ſame in the one which was propoſed to be held. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027815_0059_0FD64D3C0231C868"/>
next proceeded to ſhew that he was a member of the different Committees of Union and Ways and Means, of acting as Treaſure, and collecting and paying money to promote the Grand Cauſe, as it was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. That theſe Committees had correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with a ſociety in London, who vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt calumnious reſolutions againſt the Judges of this country.</p>
            <p>"His Lordſhip then ſtated his intention to prove the priſoner guilty of endeavoring to ſeduce the military from their duty and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, by the diſtribution of a hand-bill among the Fencibles at Dalkeith, entitled, "An Addreſs to the Fencibles." That he was acceſſary to the plan read by Watt for taking the Caſtle, ſeizing the Judges, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, &amp;c. and to the embaſſy which was ſent to the weſt country, for ſounding the diſpoſitions of the people: that in his capacity of Treaſurer to the Committee of Ways and Means, he paid the ſmiths who were employed by Watt to make the pikes that he acceded to the plan of having Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors appointed, who were to collect the ſentiments of the people, and receive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027815_0060_0FD64D3C08F60D58"/>
from them, and likewiſe to act as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander when they were armed.</p>
            <p>"His Lordſhip with great ability expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on each of theſe charges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with obſerving, that if he could prove them to the ſatisfaction of the Jury, they doubtleſs would conſider the charge of High Treaſon as fully proved. The principle, however, his Lordſhip obſerved the Jury ſhould ever keep in their eye—the impartial diſtribution of Juſtice."</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Anſtruther</hi> ſaid, he did not mean to adduce evidence againſt the priſoner for prcuring a Convention that had met, but, for endeavouring to procure one to meet at a future period; and the Council for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:027815_0061_0FD64D3D9B074408"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>George Roſs</hi> ſaid, a Committee of Union met in his houſe in March laſt, and other times. Downie, Watt, Bonthorn, &amp; Stoke, belonged to it. There was alſo another Committee of a greater number. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Stoke a printed letter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſimilar letters were to be ſent to the country. He ſent ſome, &amp;c. to Paiſley, Strahaven, Perth—on theſe he wrote, "Shew this to your friends, and ſend an anſwer to George Roſs, Liberty Court, Edinburgh."</p>

                  <hi>William M'Cubbin,</hi> writer, was elected a member of the Committee of Union, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an acquaintance of his, who

was a member, being bound over to keep the peace for being in the Play-Houſe-Riots. Downie was a member. The purpoſe of the Committee was to co-operate in calling a Convention ſimilar to the Britiſh Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There was a Committee of Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to collect money to pay delegates, and relieve thoſe who were ſuffering for politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal opinions; likewiſe for collecting the ſenſe of the people. The witneſs was a collector; Mr. Downie was Treaſurer to the whole; Fairley was a collector, and was appointed convener, and to act always as ſuch. The witneſs was a member of the Convention when the Lord Provoſt diſperſed it, and he ſtated the particulars of what happened at that time. The Committee of Union was to have met the night Downie and Watt were apprehended, but on that account did not.</p>

Convention. They ſent delegates to the Committee of Union, viz. Orrock, Farquharſon, and M'Ewan. It was for the purpoſe of Reform. There was a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector to take the ſenſe of the people, and money to ſupport Mr. Skirving. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety gave their money to M'Ewan to pay to the delegates, or Mrs. Skirving. Mr. Downie was Treaſurer to the collectors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arthur M'Ewan</hi> was a member of the Water of Leith Society, which continued to meet after the diſperſion of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Was a member of the Committee of Union, which met in Roſs's. There was a Sub-Committee choſen from it, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeven perſons. Downie was one of them. It was afterwards called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Ways and Means. They were to pay ſome debt the Convention owed Skirving, and ſupport his widow. Heard Watt one night read a paper propoſing to ſeize Lord Chief Juſtice Clerk, &amp;c. [Here the witneſs gave the ſame account of this paper as he did in the trial of Robt. Watt.] He once ſaw Downie in Roſs's houſe with Fairley, Watt, &amp;c. Fairley had come from the Weſt Country. Saw Fairly lay down

15<abbr>s.</abbr> on the table, which he ſaid he had left, and Downie deſired him to take it up again. Fairley ſaid Paiſley was in a ſtate of great readineſs; this he thought was for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward Watt's plan. Watt ſaid he had 4000 arms to ſend to Perth. Downie called on the witneſs at his own houſe the day Watt was apprehended, and aſked, if he, the witneſs, had been before the Sheriff, and what queſtions had been put to him. He then ſaid, that if he was called upon, he would ſay he did not know me, and if I was called upon, he told me to ſay I did not know him. Heard William Brown once ſay he was employed by Watt, and paid by Downie. Heard Downie ſay, a very ſpirited letter had been received from Perth.</p>

                  <hi>William Bonthorn,</hi> teacher, was a member of a ſociety at Broughton, which ſent him as a delegate to the Committee of Union, and has ſeen Downie there. Another Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee

was choſen from the Committee of Union, called the Sub-Committee, viz. Aitchiſon, Burk, Stoke, M'Ewn, Watt, Downie, and himſelf, ſometimes called the Committee of Ways and Means. Saw in the Committee a paper called <hi>Regulations.</hi> Two pence were collected from each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to defray expence. Downie acted as Treaſurer. Collectors were appointed to collect money to ſend a delegate to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, to attend a Convention to be formed there. He left this Committee, becauſe he ſaw matters coming to a very great length, and alſo for another reaſon relating to the peace of his own family. He thought they were going great lengths, from hearing a paper read by Watt, when Downie was preſent; to which paper M'Ewen objected, as did, the witneſs, by ſaying "No, no; by no means," [Here he gave the ſame account of the paper as in Watt's trial.] The Committee met in Watt's houſe to anſwer T. Hardy's letter, which Mr. Stoke was to carry with him. After this night the witneſs determined to advertiſe his withdrawing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. This he did not advertiſe. He

ſhortly after wrote a letter to Mr. Watt, to deſire Downie to advance Fairley a few ſhillings, as he was going to the country, as he underſtood, upon the Committee buſineſs—He took a copy of a paper which he ſaw in the Committee of Union, and read it in Broughton Society. The collectors were appointed to numbers, not to diſtricts. Saw a paper about Fencibles in the Committee. He conſidered the paper read by Watt as a ſort of frenzy. Mr. Stoke and Mr. Watt wrote any papers the Committee had to write. Mr. Downie received all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and paid it out.</p>

Watt ſaid, there were arms came down to the Goldſmith's-hall people, and ſomebody ſaid we had better apply for them there. Some other perſon ſaid we could not get them. Watt anſwered there was no law could hinder us. I ſaid, I would make one for myſelf. Some time after, Watt called at my ſhop, and aſked if I had made the weapon. I ſaid I had not, but told him what like it was. It did not pleaſe him, and he marked on the table the form of one he wanted. I made it and carried it to Roſs's houſe; Watt, Downie, and ſome others were preſent—One ſaid it was too ſhort in the <hi>curve,</hi> and then made the ſhape of one longer; on which Watt and Downie deſired me <hi>to keep that in my eye.</hi> Watt and Downie ordered me to make a few dozens of the ſame kind.</p>

               <p>When the evidence was cloſed,</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cullen</hi> then roſe to charge the Jury on the part of the priſoner, which he did in an ingenious and argumentative ſpeech, which laſted upwards of three hours. He began with laying down the law of the caſe,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027815_0078_0FD64D686E39E878"/>
in which he differed very much from the Counſel on the other ſide. He read ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quotations, from which he drew this general inference, that although the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment charged the priſoner with compaſſing and imagining the death of the King, no ſuch crime had been committed—for the higheſt part of the crime charged, even allowing it to be true, was no more than a ſort of <hi>Conſtructive Treaſon,</hi> which the law was very cautious in with meddling. He next proceeded to comment upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the firſt part of which, he ſaid, proved nothing of the charge of treaſon; it only went to this, that the priſoner, along with a number of other perſons, ſome in a high and ſome in a low ſituation of life, had been active and zealous to procure a reform in the repreſentation of this country. If the priſoner carried his notions in this buſineſs only as far as ſome other members of the Britiſh Convention had done, he ought to have been tried for ſedition, which very probably might have been found a good charge againſt him; but there was no reaſon to preſume, from all this, that his being concerned in the cauſe of Reform,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027815_0079_0FD64D699E589DA0"/>
implicated him in the charge of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which, he was ſure, a candid view of the evidence would not make out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen next mentioned, that part of the evidence which regarded the taking of the Caſtle of Edinburgh; maſſacreing the ſoldiers; ſeizing the Judges, &amp;c. which ſaid he, was one of the wildeſt phrenzies that ever entered into the head of man. This was not the plan of the priſoner, but of Watt; he alone was the former and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of that diabolical buſineſs: but, he remarked, it is here attempted to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the priſoner and Watt were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty in this matter—this was by no means the caſe; for, though the priſoner was a member of the Britiſh Convention, and afterwards of the Committees of Union and Ways and Means, yet the intention of theſe Committees was not to promote the treaſonable plans and projects of Mr. Watt, but only to collect money to carry the plan of reform into effect, and for ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of their ſuffering friends. It had been attempted to be proved, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner had both employed and paid for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pikes, but the employment has not ſo
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:027815_0080_0FD64D6B1F27EBF0"/>
compleatly proved as the law directs, and as to the money paid to William Brown, it was entirely on Watt's account. With regard to the evidence of Fairley, to whom likewiſe the priſoner paid money; he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did ſo, on account of the Committee of Ways and Means; not to promote the plans of Watt, but merely to ſee how the the People in the country ſtood affected with regard to purſuing the plan of Reform: if he went farther, it was in conſequence of a private underſtanding between him and Watt, which the priſoner knew nothing of. The reſt of the evidence Mr. Cullen argued in a ſtrain of very ingenious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, amounting to nothing that could in the moſt diſtant manner, affect the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and, on theſe grounds, he hoped, the Jury would be of opinion with him, that the charge had not been ſufficiently prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would, therefore, acquit the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen pleaded the cauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate client with a zeal and ability that did him great honour.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Anſtruther,</hi> on the part of the crown, replied. He ſaid he was exceedingly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027815_0081_0FD64D6CE8A68650"/>
to ſay, that from his opinion of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence produced, the charge was complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved againſt the priſoner. He then took a pretty extenſive view of the Law of Treaſon, in which he differed very much from Mr. Cullen: he ſaid, it was by no means the caſe of <hi>Conſtructive Treaſon,</hi> but a deliberate plan to overturn the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſtitution of this country, and therefore came fairly under that part of the ſtatute of Edward III. of compaſſing and imagining the death of the King. He next proceeded to the evidence produced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the firſt motion of a deſign to call a ſecond Convention, which deſign he ſaid, was clearly and diſtinctly proved. The next part of the evidence was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's conduct as a member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Union and Ways and Means, whoſe views Mr. Cullen ſaid were ſolely to promote the cauſe of reform; but he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very much from him with regard to this. Mr. Anſtruther ſaid, for taking the correſpondence of Hardy and Skirving; the proceedings of the Britiſh Convention; the meetings held at the Globe Tavern, and Chalk Farm, upon the principles held out
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027815_0082_0FD64D702CF29780"/>
by themſelves, and upon whoſe reſolutions thoſe committees acted. what was their language? Was it to petition the King, or petition Parliament?—No! it was, as all their proceedings bear, to do ſomething ſtronger than to petition—It was to effect their purpoſe by <hi>force,</hi> which they ſaid pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning had not been able to do. There could be no doubt this was treaſonable, and, the evidence fully juſtified him in ſaying the priſoner had acceded to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. He next adverted to the plan of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caſtle of Edinburgh, &amp;c. which plan no doubt was Watt's—but the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did not diſſent from that plan, as Mac-Ewen and Bonthorn had done, nor abſent himſelf from the committees; but, on the contrary, he along with Watt employed Orrock to make the pikes—paid money to Brown for making them—to Fairley to enable him to go to the Weſt country upon their buſineſs. In ſhort, the priſoner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely acceded to every part of Watt's plan; and beſide s all this, the evidence ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, that a pike was found in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's houſe, and that he was concerned in circulating the ſeditious hand-bill, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027815_0083_0FD64D72D9369700"/>
to debauch the mind of the Fencibles of this country; a copy of which hand-bill was clearly traced to the priſoner. Mr. Anſtruther now took notice of the great pains that had been taken by ſome evil-minded people to ſeduce the lower ranks in this country from their duty and allegiance; and reſpecting this he gave an elegant quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the Roman Hiſtorian Livy, the purport of which was, that when the lower orders of the people roſe againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Authority of a country, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was, that nothing but anarchy and confuſion enſued, and that country was completely wretched. He concluded with ſaying, that no doubt remained in his mind, that the charge was completely proved; if, however, the Jury thought otherwiſe, he would be happy at the acquittal of the priſoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Anſtruther ſpoke an hour and fifty minutes, in a cool, deliberate, and elegant manner, and was liſtened to with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt attention by all preſent in court.</p>
               <p>The Lord Preſident then proceeded to charge the Jury. He began with ſaying, at a future period it would no doubt ſurpriſe poſterity to hear, that in this enlightened age crimes ſuch as that charged on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, could be committed. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:027815_0084_0FD64D7433EE5F60"/>
was not now what it had been ſome hundred years ago, when civil liberty was ill underſtood, when agriculture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce were not attended to, and when the nobles and heads of clans uſurped a deſpotic power over their vaſſals and dependants. Then nothing was heard but family broils, and endleſs quarrels for power and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.—Happily, things were now changed for the better—the power of the nobles was reſtricted, commerce, agriculture, and arts flouriſhed, and the people, from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and poverty, were rich and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Was it not aſtoniſhing then, ſaid his Lordſhip, that a period when the country was ſo proſperous, diſcontents ſhould ariſe from cauſes, of which our forefathers had never thought or heard; doctrines ſhould be broached, which, if acted upon, would completely ſubvert all order in ſociety, and plunge this country into all the miſery and wretchedneſs which ſo unhappily prevailed in a neighbouring nation.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this, his lordſhip read an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from a ſpeech delivered in the Iriſh Parliament, and a quotation from an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent author, who tells the following ſtory:—Suppoſe, ſays the author, a ſhip went to ſea completely manned; the crew acting upon theſe new principles ſay, Why is this
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027815_0085_0FD64D780B4CAB70"/>
man captain? Why is this man at the helm? Are we not his equals, and are not our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities equally good with the perſon at the helm?—From words they proceed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deprive the officers of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; they then elect others to ſucceed them from among themſelves, throw off all reſtraint, get drunk, and in conſequence of this the veſſel drives among rocks, is loſt and every perſon on board periſhes. Such, ſaid his Lordſhip, muſt be the caſe if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, who will not obey the wholeſome reſtraints of Law, were to aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Legiſlative and Executive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Country.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip next proceeded to give a clear and diſtinct view of the Laws of Treaſon, in particular that ſtatute upon which his indictment was laid. He ſaid, that it was a happy thing for this country, that at the Union the Treaſon Laws of both countries were made one, as it prevented all uncertainty about them; the Treaſon Laws being as well underſtood as any part of the crimal Juriſprudence of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip then commented upon the different parts of the evidence, pointing out with great preciſion and candour what was for, and what was againſt, the priſoner,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027815_0086_0FD64D7A77186690"/>
leaveing the whole with the Jury. If they found there was not proof ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the priſoner, or if there was even a doubt in there minds of his guilt, they ought to acquit him, as mercy ſhould always lean to the ſide of the priſoner; but if on the contrary, they were ſatisfied of his guilt, then they were to bring in their verdict accordingly.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip ſpoke above an hour, in his uſual able <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
