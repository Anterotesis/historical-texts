            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cxxii. 3.</bibl>
               <q>JERUSALEM IS BUILDED, AS A CITY THAT IS COMPACT TOGETHER.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>JERUSALEM was a city, defended with ſtrong walls, the metropolis of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Iſrael, and the capital ſeat of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew empire.—It's inhabitants were not a looſe, diſconnected people, but moſt ſtrictly united, not only among themſelves, but with all the tribes of Iſrael, into a holy nation and commonwealth, under JEHOVAH their king and their God.—And as Jeruſalem was the place, which he was pleaſed to honour as the ſeat of his royal reſidence and government, it was moſt truly the city of the Great King. Hence both by divine appointment, and the common conſent of the nation, it was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as the local centre of communion in all the privileges of their civil and ſacred conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. There were the thrones of judgement, the thrones of the houſe of David, and the ſupreme courts of juſtice, and of the public
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020393_0005_0FAF0523FAD12100"/>
adminiſtration: There were the Levites, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their courſes, and the Prieſts, miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their offices, before the LORD: There was the teſtimony, the ark of the covenant, the temple, and the ſolemn ſervices of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And there all the tribes and ſceptres of the people, aſſembled three times in the year, to preſent national homage to JEHOVAH, their king and their God.</p>
            <p>IN all theſe reſpects, whether Jeruſalem be conſidered in a natural, civil or religious view, its ſtrength and beauty conſiſted, in being builded "as a city, that is compact togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." Hence the Pſalmiſt's affection for Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem expreſſed in this Pſalm was not a meer partial and local fondneſs; but had in view, and was excited by the moſt noble objects. Theſe were the exaltation of JEHOVAH, the king and God of Zion—the honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the nation—the preſervation of the true religion, and the peace and beſt good of all the tribes of Iſrael. Religion therefore, and public ſpirit were untied in the ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the pious Iſraelites, toward Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which they preferred above their chief joy.</p>
            <p>WE have alſo a Jeruſalem, adorned with brighter glories of divine grace, and with greater beauties of holineſs, than were ever
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020393_0006_0FAF0524B9A5D000"/>
diſplayed, in the moſt auguſt ſolemnities of the Hebrew-temple-worſhip; and preſents, to our devout admiration, gratitude and praiſe, more excellent means of religion and virtue, peace and happineſs, than ever called the attention of the aſſembled tribes of Iſrael. We enjoy all the privileges of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the bleſſings of the goſpel of peace, and the honours of the church of GOD. This is our Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>THE ſafety and preſervation of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, under GOD, on the friendly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its citizens in all thoſe things, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its honour and defence, happineſs and glory. Without this agreement, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be "builded as a city, that is compact together." There will be no peace within its walls, nor proſperity within its palaces: It can have neither ſtrength or beauty, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter protection to its inhabitants; but it will be as a city broken down, and without walls.</p>
            <p>THE text therefore, and the great occaſion, on which we are aſſembled in the houſe of GOD, juſtify a diſcourſe on the great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and maxims, of civil union—the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a good, public adminiſtration, to anſwer the great ends of government—and the neceſſity of the joint exertions of ſubjects, with their rulers, in promoting the public peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020393_0007_0FAF0525764EBD90"/>
I AM then, in the firſt place, to point out ſome of the great principles and maxims, which are the foundation and cement of civil union and ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE principles of ſociety are the laws, which Almighty GOD has eſtabliſhed in the moral world, and made neceſſary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by mankind; in order to promote their true happineſs, in their tranſactions and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Theſe laws may be conſidered as principles, in reſpect of their fixedneſs and operation; and as maxims, ſince by the knowledge of them, we diſcover thoſe rules of conduct, which direct mankind to the higheſt perfection, and ſupreme happineſs of their nature. They are as fixed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable as the laws which operate in the natural world.</p>
            <p>HUMAN art in order to produce certain effects, muſt conform to the principles and laws, which the Almighty Creator has eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the natural world. He who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the cultivation of his field, and the proper time of ſowing, may not expect a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. He, who would aſſiſt mankind in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weights, and overcoming obſtacles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on certain rules, derived from the knowledge of mechanical principles, applied to the conſtruction of machines, in order to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020393_0008_0FAF052639568EF0"/>
give the moſt uſeful effect to the ſmalleſt force: And every builder ſhould well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the beſt poſition of firmneſs and ſtrength, when he is about to erect an edifice. For he, who attempts theſe things, on other principles, than thoſe of nature, attempts to make a new world; and his aim will prove abſurd and his labour loſt. No more can mankind be conducted to happineſs; or civil ſocieties united, and enjoy peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, without obſerving the moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and connections, which the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator has eſtabliſhed for the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the moral world.</p>
            <p>MORAL connections and cauſes in different circumſtances produce harmony or diſcord, peace or war, happineſs or woe among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with the ſame certainty, as phyſical cauſes produce their effect. To inſtitute theſe cauſes and connexions belongs not to men, to nations or to human laws, but to build upon them. It is no more in the power of the greateſt earthly potentate to hinder their operation, than it is to govern the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ebbing of the ocean.</p>
            <p>THE great and moſt univerſal principle and law of rational union and happineſs, is the love of GOD and of our neighbour: This in the moral, is like the great law of gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020393_0009_0FAF05270BEAA8C0"/>
and attraction in the natural world; and its tendency in human ſociety, is to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good. The firſt maxim derived from it, is that divine precept in the goſpel, "whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye alſo the ſame unto them." Hence religion and virtue are the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which the happineſs of human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties muſt be built; and from theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples muſt be derived the knowledge of all laws, which determine the order of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, we owe to one another, and point out the means of attaining the greateſt good.</p>
            <p>IF this were a ſtate of ſo much innocence and perfection, that the law of reaſon and of love directed and influenced all the views and actions of mankind, there would be no neceſſity for the coercion of civil government. But in the preſent depraved ſtate of human nature, the various diſpoſitions and differing purſuits, the jarring intereſts, and unruly paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, the jealouſies and miſapprehenſions of neighbours would ſpoil their harmony and good agreement; and, when diſputes aroſe, there would be no common judge, to whom they might refer their differences; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would be an avenger of his own wrong: This would ſoon end in a ſtate of hatred and war; and deſtroy all human peace and happineſs. To prevent this miſchief,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020393_0010_0FAF0527B82AFF70"/>
and to ſecure the enjoyment of rational liberty, which ſummarily conſiſts in the unmoleſted privilege and opportunity of "leading a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty," is the great end of the inſtitution of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſociety and government.</p>
            <p>THE end therefore, and nature of civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment imply that it muſt have for its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the principles and laws of truth, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and righteouſneſs, mercy and the fear of GOD; or it can never advance the happineſs of mankind. For that mankind by uniting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſociety, and putting themſelves under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government, can promote their true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, otherwiſe than by obſerving theſe laws, is as contrary to reaſon as, that a machine may be of great and beneficial uſe in human life, when its whole conſtruction is contrary to all the principles, by which the world of nature is actuated and kept together.</p>
            <p>THERE can be no beneficial union among the members of a community, where theſe great principles of righteouſneſs and truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and the fear of GOD, are not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both among themſelves, and towards all mankind. Any number of men, confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in wickedneſs and injuſtice, can have no ſtrength, but what they derive from being faithful to oneanother. Such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020393_0011_0FAF05289688A570"/>
may exiſt among robbers and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: but their agreement ought not to be dignified by the name of civil union: it ought rather to be eſteemed a wicked conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the rights of mankind, which can never be juſtified by number, nor on any pretence of public good.</p>
            <p>THESE moral principles and connections are moral laws, not only, as they point out a fixed order of events reſpecting moral ends, in which view the meer politician, who has no fear of GOD before his eyes, may conſider them; but to the enlightened and religious mind, they are moral laws, in a higher ſenſe—laws of our creator, for the conduct of our life and manners. They cannot therefore be tranſgreſſed, without offending againſt his will and authority—without incurring guilt in his ſight, and rendering ourſelves obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his wrath and diſpleaſure, as the great and righteous governor of the world. <q>The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven; his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, his eye-lids try the children of men. The LORD trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence, his ſoul hateth. Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone and an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt. This ſhall be the portion of their cup. For the righteous LORD
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020393_0012_0FAF05295DE14EA8"/>
loveth the righteous, his countenance doth behold the upright.</q>

            <p>IF we can find what are the laws and rules, which men, as rational creatures, muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that they may arrive at the greateſt happineſs and perfection of their nature, theſe are the laws which they muſt obſerve, when united in political bodies, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the common good of ſociety. The ſame virtue and integrity, truth, juſtice and honour, which, we venerate in a private cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, muſt be found in the public admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and generally prevailing among a people, or a ſtate, cannot be united, peaceful and happy in itſelf, and reſpectable in the world.</p>
            <p>HENCE in all well regulated civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, laws of natural, univerſal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable obligation hold the firſt rank: They are ſuch fixed means of union, peace and happineſs, that no other can or ought to be ſubſtituted in their room. It may howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be obſerved, that the force of civil ſociety cannot extend to all laws of this kind; but only to ſuch upon the obſervation of which the common quiet of mankind entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. To do to our neighbour as we would that he ſhould do to us is one of the plaineſt dictates of reaſon, and a law of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020393_0013_0FAF052A543704B0"/>
equity and obligation. It compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the whole of ſocial duty, and extends to kindneſs, humanity and mercy, as well as to truth and juſtice. But although it is the great rule of our conduct and the bond of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, it cannot in its whole extention have the force of a civil law in commonwealths. Controverſies about the violation of it would be perplexed and intricate: Litigious ſuits would be infinitely multiplied: The good and virtuous would be deprived of the moſt valuable part of their character: and the ſtate would be torn with inteſtine diviſion and diſcord.</p>
            <p>BUT, tho' all the laws of nature cannot be enforced with civil ſanctions, yet every righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate adopts thoſe, which are neceſſary for the preſervation of the public peace, and for an equal and impartial diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments. The good and virtuous, who are influenced to do well out of rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to GOD, and ſincere love to mankind, muſt be protected and encouraged; and the wicked and diſorderly, reſtrained by the dread of puniſhment. The great laws of juſtice muſt be armed with a civil force, and never allowed to be tranſgreſſed with impunity. Such, for inſtance, is that ſtatute of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, the GOD and King of Iſrael, <q>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs; in judgement,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020393_0014_0FAF052AD6877C90"/>
in mete-yard, in weight or in meaſure. Juſt balances, juſt weights, a juſt ephah, and a juſt hin, ſhall ye have.</q> This law muſt be admitted into every civil ſtate; but, that it may have force in ſociety, the public ſtandard muſt be fixed; the moſt convenient weights and meaſures, determined; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their being tried, aſcertained; and an awful penalty annexed to tranſgreſſion. Theſe are circumſtances, which are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the law of nature; but muſt be adjuſted by civil regulations ſuited to the condition of particular commonwealths.</p>
            <p>THE principles and laws of juſtice are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unchangeable—they depend not on human authority; but the particular regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which they have force in ſociety, as civil laws, not being determined by the law of nature, may be changed, when they are found inconvenient and hurtful to the community. Hence the legiſlative authority of a ſtate, extends to the repealing of old, as well as the making of new laws.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS, great care ſhould be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in framing laws, that they may be ſuited to the peculiar ſtate of a people, and have an equal and uniform operation for the public good. New and different circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire new and different regulations in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020393_0015_0FAF052E08DCF778"/>
fitted to the occaſions which produce them: But the fundamental laws, by which a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are compacted together, like the laws of the natural world, muſt have a fixed conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and duration. Such, in general, are laws relating to perſonal liberty, the privileges of the ſubject, and the powers of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate—to private property and the execution of juſtice—to the puniſhment of evil-doers and the preſervation of the public peace—to marriage, education, religion, and the rights of conſcience—to the public forms, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of government—and to the revenues and taxes, by which the ſtate is supported. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changes even in the external appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, much more an unfixedneſs in the laws, and a want of ſtability in the public adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, diminiſh the energy and dignity of government, and will be attended with unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and diſcord.</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add, that as the beſt and moſt uſeful laws can be of no uſe, unleſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be trained up and educated in a manner of living conformable to them, every wiſe ſtate will pay great attention to the education of children, and to all ſuch regulations, as are neceſſary for the inſtruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the principles of piety and virtue. The beſt ſecurity men can have, of living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in harmony and love, is from the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020393_0016_0FAF05302AE2C280"/>
prevalence of true religion, and a due regard to the will and authority of the ſupreme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Religion and virtue, are the ſtrongeſt bond of human ſociety, and lay the beſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of peace and happineſs in the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED, in the next place, to conſider the importance of a good public-adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of government, to the peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a people.</p>
            <p>ALL the qualifications of a good adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration may be ſummed up in two heads, the ability and faithfulneſs of thoſe, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the weighty concerns of the ſtate: To one or the other of theſe two things may be referred, whatever can be deſired or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in a good ruler. Theſe qualifications are of the higheſt importance, in every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. A free people, under GOD, may juſtly put confidence in ſuch an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and not find themſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as they muſt unavoidably be if they commit themſelves into the hands of weak or wicked men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The former, though they mean never ſo well, are unable to do good; the latter may improve their great talents, to do miſchief: Neither of them are fit to be intruſted with the great affairs of ſtate. Who, on the one hand, would willingly truſt his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020393_0017_0FAF0530D271A630"/>
whole intereſt to the power and diſpoſal of a man of the greateſt abilities, but deſtitute of honour and conſcience; or on the other hand, who would undertake a dangerous voyage, on the boiſterous ocean, under the command of the moſt upright and honeſt man, who had no knowledge of the art of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, nor any acquaintance with the ſeas. In common affairs no honeſt man will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any buſineſs for which he knows he is unfit, though he ſhould be ſolicited to do it: The ſame ſhould be obſerved by men, invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve the public. When a people have raiſed men of weak abilities to poſts of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, it may ſeem hard to neglect them; and it muſt, indeed, be ungrateful, if in any good degree, they maintain the dignity of their ſtations, and advance the public good; and eſpecially, if the poſts they hold, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought, and conferred without ſolicitation. Nevertheleſs it ſhould be conſidered, that thoſe, who undertake the affairs of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, are as anſwerable for their abilities, as the ſoldier for his courage, when he inliſts into the ſervice of his country. The ſafety of the public is to be preferred to the honour of an individual.</p>
            <p>HERE I might delineate more fully the character of an able and faithful adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I will not enlarge, and ſhall ſay
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020393_0018_0FAF05319ECC4700"/>
only in a few words, that the principal lines of it, are knowledge, wiſdom, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, courage and unſhaken reſolution, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and juſtice, tempered with lenity, mercy, and compaſſion, and a ſteady firmneſs of public meaſures, when founded in wiſdom and the public good, together with inflexible integrity, the fear of GOD, and a ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the moral and religious intereſts of the community. Theſe are the great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of an adminiſtration, which will procure reſpect and confidence; and has the beſt tendency to promote the happineſs, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſtrength of a people, and to render them as a "city, that is compact together."</p>
            <p>IF a virtuous people venerate rulers of this character, and unite their endeavours with them in advancing all the noble ends of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, they will have the faireſt proſpect of peace and proſperity; which was the laſt thing, I propoſed to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>LET the firſt object, exciting the attention of a free people, be the character of thoſe, whom they introduce into public offices; and, the next, that they reverence the worthy magiſtrate, ſupport him in his office and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſhew a ready obedience to the laws of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:020393_0019_0FAF053245BAEF28"/>
NOT only may a people be delivered into the hands of tyrants, as the rod and ſcourge of heaven for their impiety and madneſs; but through their own folly, "children may be their princes, and babes rule over them." Such a "people ſhall be oppreſſed every one by another, and every one by his neighbour."</p>
            <p>HAPPY the free and virtuous people, who pay ſtrict attention to the natural ariſtocracy, which is the inſtitution of heaven; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in every aſſembly of mankind, on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occaſion, thy are met together. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the people who have wiſdom to diſcern the true patriot of ſuperiour abilities, in all his counſels ever manifeſting a ſincere regard to the public good, and never with a ſelfiſh view attempting to deceive them, into hurtful meaſures; and happy the people who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh him from the deſigning dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who, while he ſooths them in their vices, and flatters them with high notions of liberty, and of eaſing their burdens, is plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the depths of miſery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>HOW idle are all diſputes about a technical ariſtocracy, if people diſregard that divine injunction, given by Moſes, to the free elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Iſrael, when he was about to appoint ſome aſſiſtants in government. <q>Take ye
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020393_0020_0FAF05337638C490"/>
wiſe men and underſtanding and known among your tribes</q> for their great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and good deeds, "and I will make them rulers over you."</p>
            <p>SUCH an ariſtocracy is founded in merit and deſigned by the GOD of government and order to direct a free people in the choice of their judges and public magiſtrates. Riches are ſo far neceſſary as to raiſe the judge and counſellor above the temptation of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing for a peace of bread, nevertheleſs this ariſtocracy is derived from merit and that influence, which a character for ſuperiour wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and known ſervices to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, has to produce veneration, confidence and eſteem, among a people, who have felt the benefits, and enjoy the advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſo happy a direction.</p>
            <p>THIS influence of character in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Roman republic, was called <hi>Auctoritas patrum,</hi> and the veneration paid to it by the people, <hi>Verecundia plebis.</hi> It is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary in all good governments, but eſpecially the life and ſpirit of a happy, free and republican ſtate, which ſubſiſts on the virtues of its citizens, and can never, while any found wiſdom is left to direct the public choice, by deſign commit the civil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration into the hands of men deſtitute of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020393_0021_0FAF0533C43A8118"/>
political abilities, or who are the patrons of vice.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore, of the higheſt importance to the being, happineſs and peace of free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, to ſhew a fixed and unalterable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to merit in the choice of their rulers: The next thing is to diſcover a deference and ſubmiſſion to authority, obedience to the laws, a ſpirit of righteouſneſs and peace, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to promote the public good.</p>
            <p>HONOUR and reſpect are due to rulers: The order and good of ſociety require exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal marks of diſtinction, and titles of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to be given them. This is due to their office; an honour paid to the inſtitution of government; but there is a further honour due to them, when they are faithful in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the truſt committed to them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all their actions to advance the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the ſtate. In this view, good rulers alone can be honoured, becauſe they alone deſerve eſteem and reſpect. We owe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubjection to all rulers in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their office, according to the laws of the land; but, as to cordial affection, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, eſteem and gratitude, theſe are due only to the worthy magiſtrate; and the debt will be paid by all virtuous citizens, although he ſhould be blaſphemed, arraigned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020393_0022_0FAF053498CCA200"/>
by the factious and diſcontented, who wiſh that there ſhould be no righteous government in the world.</p>
            <p>IF we wilfully tranſgreſs the laws of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſiſt the juſt commands of civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, we do an injury not ſo much to the magiſtrate, as to the community, and expoſe ourſelves to the high diſpleaſure of Almighty GOD, whoſe authority is above all human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and can never be annulled by the decrees of kings and nobles, the conſults of ſenates, or the joint conſent of a people.</p>
            <p>THIS is the ſentiment of a great and good man, who well knew the rights of human nature, and the privileges of a ſubject, which he had the courage to plead before kings and magiſtrates; I mean the apoſtle Paul, who, illuminated with the knowledge of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and inſpired with the benevolence of the goſpel, the ſlave of no party, in the greateſt tranſports of zeal, ſpoke only the words of truth and ſoberneſs. The doctrine he deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered was not the effect of ſervile flattery and ſhameful cowardice: It proceeded not from the ſpirit of fear, but of love and a ſound mind: It is ſo expreſſed as at once to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the great end of civil government, the duty of the magiſtrate, and the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the ſubjects obedience. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020393_0023_0FAF053570022558"/>
both an effectual guard againſt ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyranny and oppreſſion, and a moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſolemn warning againſt lawleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, anarchy and confuſion: It is deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a divine injunction upon chriſtians, in a letter to the ſaints at Rome, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for all ages, and eſpecially ſeaſonable for the preſent. <q>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of GOD. The powers that be are ordained of GOD. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of GOD, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive judgment to themſelves. For ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wouldſt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame. For he is the miniſter of GOD to thee for good. But if thou doſt evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vain: for he is the miniſter of GOD, a revenger to execute wrath, upon him that doeth evil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake. For, for this cauſe pay ye tribute alſo: for they are GOD'S miniſters, attending continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; cuſtom, to whom cuſtom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</q>

WHEN a conſtitutional government is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into tyranny, and the laws, rights and properties of a free people are openly invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there ought not to be the leaſt doubt but that a remedy conſiſtent with this doctrine of the apoſtle, is provided in the laws of GOD and reaſon, for their preſervation; nor ought reſiſtance in ſuch caſe to be called rebellion. But who will imagine, that GOD, whoſe firſt law, in the world of nature and reaſon, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and love, has commiſſioned men of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate character, with a lawful power, on every pretence of ſome public miſmanagement, to inflame and raiſe the multitude, embroil the ſtate, and overturn the foundations of public peace.</p>
            <p>CIVIL ſociety can exiſt no longer, than while connected by its laws and conſtitution: Theſe are of no force, otherwiſe than as they are maintained and defended by the members of the commonwealth. This regular ſupport of authority is the only ſecurity, a people can have againſt violence and injuſtice, feuds and animoſities, in the unmoleſted enjoyment of their honeſt acquiſitions: Hence the very end of civil ſociety demands, that the orders of government b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> enforced; the fountains of juſtice, kept open; the ſtreams, preſerved pure; and the ſtate, defended againſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and foreign violence. Theſe ends can
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020393_0025_0FAF0536CE7DA7E0"/>
never be attained, under the moſt excellent conſtitution and laws, but by means of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faithful adminiſtration, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring zeal and aſſiſtance of all good and virtuous citizens.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH ſome exclude religion and the profeſſion and worſhip of the goſpel from having any concern in the happineſs of civil ſociety and in the choice of rulers among a free people, yet without religion, a people hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily united in all other reſpects, want the bond, moſt eſſentially neceſſary to preſerve the union, and to excite every one to faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his ſtation.</p>
            <p>THE chief glory of the goſpel is, that it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the way of ſalvation to a fallen world, and contains the words of eternal life: And were not this its great and diſtinguiſhing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, it would be of ſo much leſs import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to mankind, as the concerns of eternity are greater than thoſe of time. It does every thing for our happineſs in this world, which can be effected by the moſt excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of morality, and by inſtructing us in all the duties, we owe to GOD, our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ourſelves: At the ſame time, it binds us to the moſt unremitting diligence and perſeverance in all good works, by the ſolemn account we muſt give to our righteous judge, for all the deeds done in the body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:020393_0026_0FAF053775B3C998"/>
THE bleſſed goſpel is therefore the beſt privilege which a people can enjoy; and were its precepts duly obſerved, the civil ſtate would be in the beſt order, and in the moſt excellent condition. Perſons of all ranks, according to their abilities, would be bleſſings to the community. The foundations of our Jeruſalem would be laid with poliſhed ſtones, and the city of our habitation be built up without the noiſe of ſaws and hammers. The ſtone would not cry out of the wall of public fraud and oppreſſion, nor the beam out of the timber anſwer it; but our officers would be peace, and our exactors righteouſneſs; our walls would be called ſalvation and our gates praiſe, and no waſting violence and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be heard in our borders.</p>
            <p>HAVING pointed out the principles and maxims, on which civil union and happineſs depend, and conſidered both the character of a good adminiſtration of government, and what is required of the ſubjects and citizens of a free ſtate, I proceed to addreſs and exhort the ſeveral orders of men preſent, that in their ſeveral places they uſe their beſt and moſt faithful endeavours for promoting the public peace and proſperity, that this and the United States, may, after the model of Jeruſalem, be "builded, as a city that is compact to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether."</p>

IN the firſt place, duty requires, that with the greateſt reſpect and reverence the public exhortation be addreſſed to his Excellency, Governor HUNTINGTON, the Chief Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrate of this free State.</p>
            <p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,</p>
            <p>WHILE I congratulate my fellow-citizens, on the return of this joyful anniverſary, I beg leave to addreſs your Excellency, with the honours of the day, and the thanks of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people for all the peaceful bleſſings of your adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>THE many faithful and important ſervices rendered to your country, in the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and intereſting affairs of this and the United States have diſtinguiſhed you with honour, among the patriots of America—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled your name, in the immortal liſt of thoſe great and noble perſonages, who in the moſt heart-ſearching times, ſealed the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of America, adventured to ſit at the head of the national council—and added you to the bright conſtellation of the illuſtrious Stateſmen and Governors of this free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>How different is the ſtation of a chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in a free government, who lives in the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020393_0028_0FAF0539191F7520"/>
hearts of the people, from that of the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſpot, who has many ſlaves, but not a loyal ſubject? All ſeem to adore the tyrant, and tremble at the leaſt motion of his eye, while they ſigh for a change; and at the firſt blow, the idol is pulled down, and trampled under foot. The confidence and eſteem of a virtuous and free people are derived from known and approved merit, and have a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation. The chair of ſtate is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this motto, FOR THE BEST AND THE WORTHIEST CITIZEN.</p>
            <p>I SINCERELY wiſh your Excellency, the moſt pleaſing ſatisfaction, in the eſteem, veneration and gratitude of your citizens; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf, you look to an higher ſource of joy, and to a greater witneſs of integrity, than the moſt unanimous approbation of a ſenſible and grateful people: I mean the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſcience, appealing to the great ſearcher of hearts, that in the whole of your public conduct, and in all the private walks of life, you have conſidered yourſelf, as the ſervant of the Moſt High GOD, and devoted all your abilities, ultimately to the honour and ſervice of the eternal king.</p>
            <p>THIS is that rectitude of intention and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, which is able to give calm peace through all the changing ſcenes of life, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020393_0029_0FAF053BF0F3B530"/>
all the uncertainties of earthly greatneſs; and even in the view of approaching death, and the proſpect of the appearing and kingdom of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, fail of affording your Excellency ſerene joy, while with an unreproaching heart, you look round on the aſſembled commonwealth; and with an unruffled mind, meet the great event of this day.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the providence of GOD, and the voice of this free people continue your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the firſt ſeat of government, I would with the deepeſt humility and reſpect, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured ſir, beſeech and even charge you, in the preſence of the ſupreme judge and this great congregation, to look to the grace of the eternal JEHOVAH, that you may be furniſhed for, and be found faithful in the high em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. You will not think it, beneath your exalted dignity, to be exhorted by one of the meaneſt of CHRIST'S ſervants, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the infinite ſource of wiſdom, in all your ways, and to aſk the direction of heaven, in all your paths, that truth and integrity may ever guide you; and righteouſneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be the girdle of your loins.</p>
            <p>I AM perſuaded, that the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this, and the United States, cannot be built up and eſtabliſhed, but upon the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims

I have pointed out and recommended. You, Sir, are a maſter-builder on the walls of our Jeruſalem: Let not theſe walls be daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the untempered mortar of injuſtice, jealouſy and diſcord; but may they be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the uniting principles of juſtice, benevolence and public ſpirit.</p>
            <p>THE poſt aſſigned your Excellency, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, is high and honourable,—the employment, great and weighty, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in view, beautiful and glorious, and the motives, ſuch as may well inſpire a noble and generous breaſt, with the warmeſt zeal, the moſt unſhaken fortitude, and the moſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting perſeverance, in the moſt faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to anſwer the great ends of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſtation, you hold in this commonwealth. Some of theſe objects, motives and ends are the exaltation of JEHOVAH, the King and Governor of the univerſe—the high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and dignity of government, the great foundation of peace and quiet—your own honour in being furniſhed by GOD with great abilities of eminent uſefulneſs—the loſs or preſervation of public liberty, and the rights of a free people, on which depends the happineſs of thouſands, or the miſery of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,—the cauſe of religion and virtue, and the conſequences of them on the preſent and eternal intereſts of mankind—the peace and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020393_0031_0FAF053D07D7B4A8"/>
beſt good of civil ſociety, and the honour and ſafety of this, and the United States,—and finally the joys or the ſorrows of that great and glorious day, when dignity and power will be no defence; but the higheſt potentate, and the meaneſt ſlave, will ſtand without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction before the ſupreme and eternal judge, and receive the ſolemn, and deciſive ſentence from his mouth.</p>
            <p>THESE, Sir, are weighty conſiderations, which I humbly addreſs to your conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that under the influence of them, you may be found faithful, and meet the final approbation of your Lord. In the weight of government, you will be encouraged and aſſiſted by good men and virtuous citizens; whoſe continual and earneſt prayer will be, that the bleſſing of Almighty GOD may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and render your adminiſtration ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the honour of GOD, the advancement of piety and virtue, the true intereſt of this and the United States of America, and the general good of mankind.</p>
            <p>MAY your Excellency long live, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of your country and the church of CHRIST.—May you be happy in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faithfully ſerving GOD and your people; and have the unſpeakable joy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them ſafe, virtuous and free.—And,

when the Supreme Diſpoſer of all events, ſhall diſmiſs you from the ſervices of this world, whether you ſhall then be in public life, and the chief magiſtracy over this people, or free from public cares in the ſerene retirements of a peaceful old age, may you experience the ſolid ſupports of the chriſtian hope, ſhare in the rewards of grace, and ſhine with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading glories, in the kingdom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
            <p>LET the public exhortation in the next place be acceptable to His Honour, Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-Governor WOLCOTT, the Honourable COUNC<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>LORS, and the Reſpectable REPRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTATIVES of this State.</p>
            <p>HONOURED GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>How happy will it be if the Magiſtrates and Repreſentatives of this State ſhall enter upon public buſineſs, with a noble ſpirit of true patriotiſm, having no narrow and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſts at heart; but ſeeking the good of our Jeruſalem, build it up on the great foundations of truth and righteouſneſs. Then peace will be within our walls, and proſperity within our palaces.</p>
            <p>A SELFISH and contracted ſpirit in any member of ſociety is a great blemiſh; but in a chief ruler—in a ſenator—in the repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020393_0033_0FAF053FC2C3E6A8"/>
of a free people, it is vile—it is odious, and unpardonable. Let this ſpirit be ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed from public counſel; or it will deſtroy all harmony of ſentiment, and lead into the narrow by-paths of private ambition and ſelf-exaltation: The builders will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand each other's language; ſcenes of confuſion enſue, and the public reſolutions ſhew more the complexion of party-attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the public good.</p>
            <p>IF the leaders of a people are not united in the great maxims of government, and maintain not ſteadineſs in the public admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, the people never will, nor can be eaſy. And when a community is rent by the animoſities and different views of their principal leaders and citizens, a republic is verging towards an ochlocratical ſtate, in which the prevalence of a party, is no ſure token of truth. In this ſituation, juſtice may be overborne by the violence of miſguided paſſion, blind to the true intereſt of the people and, the beſt means of ſafety. An Ariſtides through envy, was baniſhed by his citizens; and Cicero, the friend of liberty, of the laws and conſtitution of his country, for his wiſe and vigorous meaſures, in defeating and cruſhing the Catalinarian conſpiracy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, under the adminiſtration of a furious tribune was driven from Rome: But, when
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020393_0034_0FAF054081C29B78"/>
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of party had ſubſided, and the people were recovered to their ſenſes, they recalled him, with every mark of public honour; and ſtiled him the father and preſerver of his country; an honour never before conferred, on a Roman citizen.</p>
            <p>NEVER was union in counſel and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exertions, more neceſſary in America, than at the preſent day. If we improve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which Providence has put into our hands, we may be a great and flouriſhing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, happy and united among ourſelves, and our name be reſpectable among the nations. But, if we forget the GOD of our ſalvation, and neglect the means of virtue and religion, with which we are favoured above any people on earth—if we are divided, and contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every plan deviſed for ſtrengthening the national union, and reſtoring the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al honour and ſafety—if the ſeveral ſtates, loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight of the great end of the confederation, are influenced by meer local and partial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and if, in their reſpective and diſtinct juriſdictions, they forſake the paths of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, we ſhall become the ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of foreign nations, a prey to every bold invader; or fall by inteſtine diviſions, till we ſink into general ruin, and univerſal wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:020393_0035_0FAF0541720C9B58"/>
IF any one doubt this, let him conſult the hiſtory of nations, and eſpecially of Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let him look into the book of the Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Jeremiah. There, the Hebrew Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and mourner appears a man of ſorrows, and compacted with griefs: He breaths in ſighs, and ſpeaks in groans: Complicated ſcenes of horror and diſtreſs ſtrike all our ſenſes, while we hear the lamentations of his broken heart, mourning the ruins of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the cruel ſlaughter, and captivity of the people, the deſolation of the temple, and that "from the daughter of Zion, all her beauty" was "departed."</p>
            <p>I THEREFORE, purſuade myſelf, Gentlemen, that in full confidence of your zeal for the public good, I may with all deference and freedom, recommend to your attention, the honour and ſafety of the confederate repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, as being of the ſame importance to the happineſs and defence of the ſeveral ſtates, as the peace and proſperity of Jeruſalem, were to the ſeveral tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>IF the national union, by concentrating the wiſdom and force of America, was the means of our ſalvation from conqueſt and ſlavery—if the exiſtence, liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of theſe ſtates, and their national character, importance and glory depend ſtill
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020393_0036_0FAF0541F4508C30"/>
upon their united firmneſs and ſtrength—if this union be neceſſary for the deciſion of controverſies, which might otherwiſe engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wars among themſelves, and be the only probable means of their ſafety and defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt foreign nations,—and if without it, the American commerce and intercourſe can never be reſpectable, ſafe and extenſive in the various parts of the world.—If theſe things are true, which I leave, Gentlemen, to your own conſideration, certainly there are no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of greater magnitude and importance, more loudly calling the attention of America, than the national union, the neceſſity of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the national honour, and to give the federal government energy at home, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectability abroad.</p>
            <p>I WOULD, Gentlemen, beg leave to aſk, whether to neglect the great intereſt of the whole, and to imagine that each ſtate can ſingly preſerve and defend itſelf, be not as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as if ſeveral men, at an amazing coſt, ſhould lay a coſtly foundation, and erect the mighty frame of a moſt magnificent palace; and then, before the expence be paid, from a fondneſs of finiſhing, each one, his own room, and of enjoying the pleaſures of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate apartment, they ſhould fall into ſuch contention and diviſion, as not only to leave the frame neglected, uncovered and expoſed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020393_0037_0FAF0542C4BC7A88"/>
to continual decay and ruin, but the whole undertaking liable to that curſe, pronounced in the book of GOD. Wo unto him, that buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong; that uſeth his neighbours ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work.</p>
            <p>I OWN, Gentlemen, I am concerned for the national honour and happineſs; and were I to conſult only my own feelings, I might hold up to your view, the dying languors of the national union, as foreboding ruin, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or ſome dreadful convulſion, to theſe ſtates. But perhaps, my fears are grounded not in the ſtate of the nation, but in the want of an extenſive knowledge of public affairs. You will, however, give me leave to hope, that the greateſt attention will be paid to all juſt and reaſonable meaſures, for ſupporting and maintaing the liberty and glory of the American ſtates, and republic.</p>
            <p>I ONLY add, Gentlemen, on this ſubject, my moſt ſincere prayer, that heaven would gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> all your deliberations, and collect and unite the wiſdom and patriotiſm of America, in the propoſed convention of the ſtates, in ſome juſt and equal ſyſtem of federal ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, effectually ſecuring the internal lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and ſovereignty of the ſtates, and giving
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020393_0038_0FAF054376FB16A8"/>
ſuch dignity and authority to the federal government, that it may be the means of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the peace, and proſperity of the whole; and the benefit of it reach to the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ages, and increaſe from generation to generation to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>I PERSUADE myſelf, Gentlemen, you will have a watchful regard to the rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of this people; and in all reaſonable ways, eaſe their burdens and relieve their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. You are too well acquainted, to need any information of the uneaſineſs, diſcontent and complaints, which prevail in the ſtate. I will not preſume to ſay, how far, theſe complaints are without any juſt foundation—how far, they ariſe from the real diſtreſſes and burdens of the times—how far, they are founded in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real, or ſuppoſed miſtakes, in the public adminiſtration—or how far they have been nurſed and cheriſhed, by men of power and influence; whoſe office required them, to quiet the voice of murmuring, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming the public, in order to anſwer their own ends, and procure ſelf exaltation, or to prevent that of others. But, from whatever different and oppoſite ſources, theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ariſe, you cannot do your people more eſſential ſervice, than to apply the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful counſels and prudent means, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and healing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:020393_0039_0FAF0544341B66B8"/>
IF any of the evils, the people ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have been occaſioned by their own imprudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, you will nevertheleſs pity them; and afford all the relief in your power. This is to act the part of a kind and tender father, who would not by unreaſonable ſeverity, puſh his children on to ruin and deſpair. But, though you pity and ſtudy to relieve them in trouble, you muſt not ſupport them in vice and diſorder. As a faithful phyſician will ſometimes uſe palliatives, but will never gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a ſick patient to his diſtruction: So as far as may be conſiſtent with the great rules of righteouſneſs: you will ſuit the public conduct to the infirmities of the people, but you cannot conſent to meaſures of iniquity, which will work ruin and miſery to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>HEAR all the equitable petitions of the people; but ſhould they aſk you to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, ſtop your ears: Be merciful and compaſſionate; but maintain a conduct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the dignity, faith and honour of government, and with thoſe fixed rules and everlaſting maxims, by which it is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered. It is a day, in which trimmers and time-ſervers are very unfit to direct the affairs of ſtate. I wiſh, none ſuch may be found among the honourable perſonages, whom I now addreſs. If any of you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for acting the dictates of an upright
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020393_0040_0FAF05485EFF2E40"/>
conſcience, ſhould fall under the diſpleaſure of the people, you will have infinitely greater ſupport and conſolation in the rectitude of your own minds, than the higheſt applauſe fellow-mortals can give. Superior digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virtue, in theſe circumſtances of trial, appear to the beſt advantage, and ſhines with the brighteſt luſtre; and will meet the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the great judge in the preſence of an aſſembled world. The frowns of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided, and the reſentments of an ungrateful people, cannot bend the true patriot to meanneſs; nor the loſs of honour and public ſtation, tempt him to iniquity, and to conſent to ſuch meaſures, as in his fixed opinion and judgement, will end in public ſhame and ruin.</p>
            <p>REMEMBER, Gentlemen, that while you are examining the rights of individuals, and their claims on one another, or on the public, you drop the character of legiſlators, and ſhould act by the ſame fixed rules of law and equity, as the judge on the bench. In cauſes of a judicial kind, your high character of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty will not excuſe an arbitrary deciſion, or denial of juſtice, any more than the ſame may be excuſed in the loweſt executive court. In granting favours, you have only to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether they are equitable and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the good of the community; but in doing juſtice, you have no ſovereign diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020393_0041_0FAF054A3078F750"/>
No wiſe man thinks his life and eſtate ſafe in the hand of a tyrant, bound by no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of law: Excuſe me, Gentlemen, when I add, that the diſcretion of a popular aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, acting by no fixed and known rules of equity, is a different expreſſion, but the ſame in effect, as the arbitrary will of a deſpot. Sovereign power ſhould never be perverted to acts of unrighteouſnnſs: Let not therefore the notion of omnipotence, and of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove controul, inſenſibly inſinuate itſelf into your deliberations, and lead to a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, from what you would give in a different character. With deference to your high ſtations, I am warranted with all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to aſſure you, in the fear of GOD, the almighty and eternal Judge, that the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of not being accountable to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er court on earth, ſhould be one of the moſt forcible motives, to engage you to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uprightneſs and impartiality, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſubject and ſubject, but eſpecially the ſubject and the public. Remember, that as in this world, there is an appeal from a lower to an higher court, ſo when the moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and uncontroulable court on earth, gives an unrighteous ſentence, and wickedly perverts judgment, there is immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the high court of heaven, an appeal, which, in the great day of general aſſiſe, will be called, and muſt be anſwered. Then you,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020393_0042_0FAF054A5124CB40"/>
my honourable Auditors, and all the kings and judges of the earth ſhall appear, and give an account for your conduct, while you acted in the character of Gods, on earth.</p>
            <p>I HAVE not pointed out, wherein the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and embarraſſments of the preſent day conſiſt; nor what political meaſures are beſt to extricate the people from them: Theſe things, Gentlemen, belong to you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the exerciſe of your ſuperior wiſdom and prudence; but I am confident of the real advantage of thoſe principles and max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, I have inſiſted on as the gteat founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the happineſs and ſtrength of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. In this, I think, I have kept within my own limits, and can therefore with an humble freedom, commend them to your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and conſideration. To you it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to build upon them, and to improve all your dexterity, zeal and authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact us together. To you we look to heal our wounds, to appeaſe our diſquiet, to rectify our diſorders, and to apply thoſe bands and ligaments, which ſhall hold us together, and prevent our diſſolution and ruin. This is the righteous expectation of GOD, and the deſire and hope of all good men. Be not like the ten ſpies, who brought up an evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the good land of Canaan, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the hearts of their brethren: but
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020393_0043_0FAF054B3AC570D0"/>
like Joſhua and Caleb, who endeavoured to ſtill the people with the aſſurances of good hope, that under GOD they were able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the difficulties before them.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the darkneſs of the preſent day, and the public difficulties we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, be of good courage, and the LORD be with you: Though the earth and it's inhabitants be diſſolved, hold up the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof; and never let this ſtate be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the foundations of righteouſneſs and truth. If theſe foundations have by any means received a ſhock, and ſeem to be in a tottering condition, let your wiſdom and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage give them ſtability. If the pillars of public faith and juſtice, judgment and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have been bent and twiſted, like the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber offer, give them that ſtrength and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they may hereafter ſtand unſhaken as the aged oak: and let this people, and all the world know, that you mean to be a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous legiſlature; and wiſh to rule over a righteous people.</p>
            <p>I SHALL add only in a few words, that while in all other ways, you endeavour the good of this people, and expect from them a reverential regard for magiſtracy, and a peaceable behaviour in the ſtate, you will, Gentlemen, appoint men of virtue and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020393_0044_0FAF054BD2B5AC40"/>
to all important offices of executive truſt: And be yourſelves the beſt examples of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs and the fear of GOD. Shew your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves friends to religion and virtue—to the church of CHRIST, and the worſhip of GOD—to the miniſters of the goſpel—and to the great and important intereſts of education and learning in the ſtate: By this you will do honour to yourſelves, and eſſential ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to your country, merit the eſteem and gratitude of good men, and meet the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of GOD. If religion and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be legible, not only in your laws, but in your lives, rendering you conſpicuous for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and mercy, juſtice and ſobriety, your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority will be ſtrengthened, and your admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration ſupported. The attractive force of your examples, will engage your people to that behaviour, which is neceſſary to the peace and proſperity of the ſtate; and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of good citizens will be united in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and advancing the noble and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ends of ſociety. Thus you will be the lights of the world, the ornaments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and having with eminent uſefulneſs ſerved your generation according to the will of GOD, may you finally enjoy the rewards of faithful ſervants.</p>
            <p>THE public exhortation and addreſs now turns itſelf to the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:020393_0045_0FAF054CBA7F8660"/>
MY FATHERS AND BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>WE are members of civil ſociety, equally intereſted in it's peace and proſperity, with the reſt of our fellow-citizens; and eſpecially "becauſe of the houſe of the LORD our GOD," we are bound "to ſeek" it's "good." The immediate ends of the magiſtracy and miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are different, but not oppoſite: They mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually aſſiſt each other, and ultimately center in the ſame point. The one has for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the promotion of religion and the cauſe of CHRIST; the other immediately aims at the peace and order of mankind in this world: Without which, there could be no fixed means of religion; nor the church have a continuance on earth, but through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a miraculous providence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſplayed for its preſervation. Hence the church of CHRIST will have no fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, where there is no civil government, until he, whoſe right it is, ſhall take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his great power, and reign King of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even as he is King of ſaints.</p>
            <p>How thankful then ſhould we be for the ordinance of civil government, which is a token of divine forbearance to a guilty world; and will continue till the deſigns of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miniſtry, are accompliſhed. How many have no higher conception of the chriſtian
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020393_0046_0FAF054D36AAB488"/>
miniſtry, and the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD in appointing it, than as relating to this world? Hence, while they pride themſelves in civil privileges, and perhaps, allow the morality of the goſpel to have ſome good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the happineſs of ſociety, they have no idea of the glory of the chriſtian ſcheme of ſalvation, and deſpiſe the goſpel, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and the church of GOD. And yet, were it not, that the goſpel might be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the church have a being on earth, civil government would ceaſe among men.</p>
            <p>To preach the goſpel of the Redeemer, to open his ſalvation, to explain and urge his precepts, and to repreſent the motives of the religion taught by him, together with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the ordinances, which he hath appointed, are the immediate end; and the peculiar work of the chriſtian miniſtry. This is the part, my Fathers and Brethren, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, on the walls of our Jeruſalem; and whoever is faithful in this divine employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will at once advance the temporal and eternal intereſts of mankind.</p>
            <p>To this work, therefore, let us attend with all diligence and faithfulneſs, and uſe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to promote the deſigns of redeeming love; in recovering ſinful, guilty and miſerable men, to the image and favour
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020393_0047_0FAF054DF5AF2230"/>
of GOD, in bringing them to a life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to the practice of all righteouſneſs and virtue. In doing this, we ſhall be the happy inſtruments of advancing the beſt good of ſociety, by leading them to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent practice of all the duties of the ſocial and chriſtian life; and render them, moſt uſeful in their reſpective places: But, more eſpecially, we ſhall be happy, in being made inſtruments, under the ſacred influence of our divine LORD, of plucking them from the jaws of deſtruction, and the power and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Satan, of raiſing them to the greateſt dignity and perfection of their nature, and of preparing them for the new Jeruſalem, the city of our GOD, "wherein dwelleth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs."</p>
            <p>WHILE we look to our civil fathers for their kind countenance and protection, it will be our conſtant care to ſtrengthen and encourage them, in the great and weighty concerns of government, by our prayers, by our public inſtructions, and by our examples, not only of civil ſubjection and obedience, but of all virtues, which adorn the chriſtian profeſſion and miniſtry, and conduce to the peace and proſperity of the commonwealth.</p>
            <p>IN this let us ſtrive to excel, and unite all our endeavours. What is more neceſſary,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020393_0048_0FAF054ECA8C2648"/>
than union among the miniſters of CHRIST? What gives the enemies of religion more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than the diſcord, which has prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among chriſtians? Or what ſtabs the cauſe of the Redeemer, with deeper wounds, than the contention of his miniſters? Let us not look to the coercive power of the civil ſword, to heal theſe wounds; but to our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and almighty Saviour, to give us one heart and one way; and let us ſtudy his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which contains not only the doctrines we are to teach, and the duties we are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate; but the moſt forcible motives of mutual love, kindneſs and forbearance. If we drink at this pure fountain of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and imbibe the ſpirit of the meek and lowly JESUS, it will cleanſe away our envy, pride and ambition, the great ſources of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſterial contention. We ſhall love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſtrive together in our endeavours, and in our prayers for the ſucceſs of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the peace of churches.</p>
            <p>BRETHREN, our time is ſhort: Our fathers many of them are gone: Every year makes breaches upon our order. May GOD ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the heavy ſtrokes of the year paſt, upon the churches, and the miniſtry that we may be quickened to greater zeal and diligence in our important work. He that is faithful to the death, ſhall receive the crown of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020393_0049_0FAF054F82DA9F10"/>
life and love, in the kingdom of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father.</p>
            <p>AN Addreſs to the numerous audience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, on this joyful occaſion, ſhall conclude my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>A CONSTITUTION of Government, which gives a people the liberty of chooſing their own rulers, and of being governed by laws, eſtabliſhed by common conſent, while they make a wiſe uſe of it, is a privilege more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, than the gold of Ophir, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importance to public happineſs, than the rich mountains of Peru. What ſhall you do to render this privilege, a bleſſing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, and hand down the joys of it to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations? Make it your conſtant aim to chooſe able and faithful men, who fear GOD and hate covetouſneſs, to be your rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; honour and encourage them in all their endeavours to make you a virtuous, proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy people, and apply yourſelves with diligence to your own buſineſs, that in your ſeveral ſtations, you may contribute to the public good.</p>
            <p>THE burden of government at all times, and eſpecially at the preſent, is very great:
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020393_0050_0FAF05506E561F20"/>
We may ſo behave as to render it, far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more difficult, by our miſconduct and diſorderly practices; and prevent the beſt fruits of the moſt wiſe and righteous adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. We may diſcourage the hearts and ſlacken the hands of the moſt worthy magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, by an unruly and diſcontented ſpirit, and by an oppoſition to all their deſigns for the public good. How many endeavour to enervate and avoid the force of the moſt wholeſome laws of ſociety; and uſe every art to make the people diſcontented, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote factions in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>I THINK it my duty on this ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to warn my fellow citizens, againſt all ſuch vile and wicked practices, which tend to the ruin of magiſtracy, and the deſtruction of peace and order. I wiſh, my Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, all had a due ſenſe of the high importance of civil government, and the protection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us by the laws of our country. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſecurity and peace, we enjoy by day or night, at home or abroad, in the houſe, in the field, or by the way, are by means of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil union and ſociety. Without this bond, and the reſtraint of civil inſtitutions, no one would be ſafe in his perſon or property. The weak would be continually expoſed to the oppreſſion and injuſtice of a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful neighbour. Civil government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020393_0051_0FAF05512036A4A0"/>
well conſtituted, and impartially admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered, is one of the moſt important bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a gracious GOD has beſtowed upon a guilty world; and the laws and conſtitution of our country are our beſt inheritance, which we ſhould defend at the hazard of our lives and fortunes.</p>
            <p>IF any real or ſuppoſed grievances ſhould ariſe in a republic, they may be examined and redreſſed, without having recourſe to arms, and oppoſing the government of the people, in the hands of the conſtitutional authority of the ſtate. Good rulers will eſteem it, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that the public conduct ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and the errors of adminiſtration rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: And if rulers appointed by the people abuſe their authority, they may be diſplaced. A republic has the means of redreſs within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and cannot be oppreſſed, but by its own fault and neglect.</p>
            <p>BUT while in a free government, the public conduct is open to inſpection and diſcuſſion, there is a great difference between the reproof of friendſhip, and the reproach of an enemy; much more between perſonal ſlander and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, and a candid examination of public miſtakes and grievances, that they may be rectified and redreſſed. The latter is the right of the people and may be encouraged;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020393_0052_0FAF055514773648"/>
the former is to be deteſted, nor can its venom be hidden, or juſtified, under the cloak of public good. Its tendency is to introduce an imbittered party-ſpirit, and to promote factions and diſturbances: It ſavours, not of that wiſdom from above, pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſy, but of that which is earthly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, devliſh: It is not a cement, having the leaſt tendency to add ſtrength to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beauty to the walls, or peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity to the palaces of our Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>I SINCERELY condole with my country, under the heavy burden lying on the people. If a conſiderable part of this burden has been brought upon ourſelves by imprudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, we ought not to complain to our rulers, and think ourſelves hardly uſed, if the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of juſtice be not removed for our ſakes. If any part of it be occaſioned by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expences in government, and by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries and rewards, too laviſhly beſtowed on thoſe, who ſerve the public, we have right to complain, and to expect redreſs. And if the claims of any men on the public, or other burdens in the ſtate, be unjuſt, we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply to our rulers for relief: For to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement, to do juſtice, to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020393_0053_0FAF0556ABB00D30"/>
to let the oppreſſed go free, and to break every yoke, is the great end of their inſtitution and office: Surely then, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Legiſlature will hear all our reaſonable complaints, and eaſe our ſorrows.</p>
            <p>BUT if theſe burdens are juſt, the price of our liberty, and of all the privileges which we enjoy, what can our rulers do, but encourage us to be a righteous and induſtrious people, and contrive the beſt, moſt eaſy and effectual meaſures for diſcharging the public debt?—They cannot deny that we have had an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my—hired ſoldiers, and carried on a long and expenſive war, in which through the ſignal interpoſition of a wonder-working Providence, we have been gloriouſly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful—that we are indebted to France, Holland and Spain, in ſums to a large amount—and that thouſands of our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens have lent their ſubſtance and treaſure to this and the United States; many of whom are diſtreſſed by the public failure.—They cannot create ſilver and gold: But ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it were in their power to furniſh a full and rich ſtore of theſe articles, for which we might ſell and mortgage our eſtates, would not this be the ruin of the greater part of the debtors in the ſtate, and of many other citizens, now in flouriſhing circumſtances?—But, it will be ſaid, they can emit a bank of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020393_0054_0FAF0556F6CECEB8"/>
paper money, the benefit of which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in former times. A mighty bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; a bleſſed privilege, indeed, if it be on ſuch a ſinking foundation, that the diſhoneſt taking advantage of its depreciation may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud their creditors, and live and riot on the ſimplicity of their neighbours, and the ſpoils of public faith. Would it be right, my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens, to force ſuch a medium into the hands of the people, againſt their will and conſent? A tyrant may compel his vaſſals for gold or ſilver promiſed, to take lead, tin, wood or ſtubble: But this would be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an eaſtern deſpot no better, than open and bare faced robbery. Such a thought ought not to be entertained of the righteous Legiſlature of a free people, who enjoy the bible, in which we are taught, that whoever expects to be an inhabitant of the heavenly Jeruſalem, though he ſware to his hurt, changeth not. If this bank of paper-money be on a ſure foundation, and have a currency, equal to gold and ſilver, the queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, how ſhall we obtain it, unleſs we earn it, or pledge our eſtates for the redemption of it? In the firſt method, we might as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſilver and gold; the latter is big with ruin to thouſands, and would tend to diſcourage the frugality, induſtry and economy, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to have ſo promiſing an appearance; and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:020393_0055_0FAF0557C5CF2308"/>
muſt be the means of freeing us from the great embarraſſments we are under.</p>
            <p>A SUDDEN plenty of money, would not help us; nay it would do us hurt, unleſs it were obtained in that way, which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe virtues in ſociety, which are the ſtrength, the happineſs, and beauty of a people. Theſe are induſtry, honeſty, frugal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and the reciprocal acts of friendſhip, kindneſs, and mercy, which ariſe from the dependencies of one upon another. Had we a thouſand tons of ſilver diſperſed in this ſtate, in ſuch manner as ſhould check the growth of thoſe virtues, it would be truly the root of all evil, and diſpoſe us to ſuch a conduct, that in a few years, this mighty ſum would vaniſh and the people become reduced to a more wretched ſtate of indigence and want, than before: The years of plenty would ſoon be over, and there ariſe a louder cry for the ſuſpenſion of public and private juſtice, than has ever been heard in America.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT my Fellow-Citizens but flatter myſelf, that the neceſſity of the times has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to work for its own relief, in a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the public good, and the virtue and peace of the people. Agriculture is more encouraged and attended to—the herds and flocks of large and ſmall cattle are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:020393_0056_0FAF0558755CBC70"/>
creaſing—wool and flax are more prized—home-manufactures begin to be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary—the diſtaff, the wheel and loom are becoming more faſhionable—the ſhops of trifling baubles and gewgaws are leſs croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—ſuits at law diminiſhed—a general ſpirit of induſtry is more prevalent, and patience and perſeverance ſeem only neceſſary to crown the work.</p>
            <p>BUT to cloſe this diſcourſe and addreſs; let us my Friends and Fellow-Citizens, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend to our true intereſt and ſafety, in all thoſe ways which are pointed out in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the circumſtances we are under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Encourage your rulers in building up our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, on the ſtrong foundations of truth and righteouſneſs—maintain in your hearts and conduct, thoſe principles and maxims of love, benevolence and goodneſs, which will render you a united, happy and proſperous people. Let GOD be honoured, and the grace of the Redeemer exalted; the ſabbath ſanctified; the worſhip and ordinances of the LORD'S houſe, maintained: The pious and virtuous education of the riſing generation, religiouſly regarded; and a firm and inviolable adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the laws and inſtitutions of CHRIST, manifeſted by all orders and ranks of men. Then virtue and peace, righteouſneſs, mercy and the fear of GOD, will flouriſh; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020393_0057_0FAF055969B94640"/>
member of the community, will be found, fixed in his proper place, and diſcharging the duties of it.</p>
            <p>THIS is that peaceful and happy ſtate, which King David ſo earneſtly deſired might be the portion of Jeruſalem, and make it a joy and a praiſe in all the earth. Let his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pious wiſh be the language of all our hearts: Pray for the peace of our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: They ſhall proſper that love thee: Peace be within thy walls, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity within thy palaces: For my breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and companions ſake, I will now ſay, peace be within thee; becauſe of the houſe of the LORD our GOD, I will ſeek thy Good.</p>
