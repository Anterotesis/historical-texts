            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>United States</hi> are a new nation, or political ſociety, formed at firſt by the declaration of independence, out of thoſe <hi>Britiſh ſubjects</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> who were thrown out of royal protection by act of parliament, paſſed in <hi>December,</hi> 1775.</p>
            <p>A citizen of the <hi>United States,</hi> means a member of this new nation. The principle of government being radically changed by the revolution, the political character of the people was alſo changed from ſubjects to citizens.</p>
            <p>The difference is immenſe. Subject is derived from the latin words, <hi>ſub</hi> and <hi>jacio,</hi> and means one who is <hi>under</hi> the power of another; but a citizen is an <hi>unit</hi> of a maſs of free people, who, collectively, poſſeſs ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>Subjects look up to a maſter, but citizens are ſo far equal, that none have hereditary rights ſuperior to others. Each citizen of a free ſtate contains, within himſelf, by nature and the conſtitution, as much of the common ſovereignty as another. In the eye of reaſon and philoſophy, the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical condition of citizens is more exalted than that of noblemen. Dukes and earls are the creatures of kings, and may be made by them at pleaſure; but citizens poſſeſs in their own right original ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a great difference between citizens, and inhabitants or reſidents.</p>
            <p>Any perſon living within a country or ſtate, is an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of it, or reſident in it.</p>
            <p>Negroes are inhabitants, but not citizens. Citizenſhip confers a right of voting at elections, and many other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges not enjoyed by thoſe who are no more than inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:022088_0003_0FB788BDB9B09DA0"/>The preciſe difference may be thus ſtated: The citizen of a free ſtate is ſo united to it as to poſſeſs an individual's proportion of the common ſovereignty; but he who is no more than an inhabitant, or reſident, has no farther connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſtate in which he reſides, than ſuch as gives him ſecurity for his perſon and property, agreeably to fixed laws, without any participation in its government.</p>
            <p>Republics, both ancient and modern, have been jealous of the rights of citizenſhip. The new conſtitution carries this matter ſo far, as to require not only preſent citizenſhip in federal repreſentatives and ſenators, but antecedent citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenſhip for the term of ſeven and nine years. The time and manner of acquiring the high character of a citizen of the <hi>United States,</hi> is therefore well worthy of public diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>The following appear to be the only modes of acquiring this diſtinguiſhing privilege.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By being parties to the original compact, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of independence.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. By taking an oath of fidelity to ſome one of the <hi>United States,</hi> agreeably to law.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. By tacit conſent and acquieſcence.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. By birth or inheritance.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. By adoption. Of each of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By the declaration of independence congreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to the world, that their conſtituents, "the people of the united colonies, were abſolved from all allegiance to the crown of <hi>England,</hi>" and that the late colonies were "free and independent ſtates." For the ſupport of this bold meaſure, they confederated together, by pledging to each other "their lives, fortunes, and ſacred honour." By this eventful declaration, "a nation was born in a day." Nearly three millions of people who had been ſubjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came citizens. Their former political connection with <hi>George</hi> the third was done away, and a new one was formed, not with another king, but among themſelves, by which they became coequal citizens, and, collectively, aſſumed all the rights of ſovereignty. As this was done by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022088_0004_0FB788C09109ADD8"/>
of the people of this country, and in their name, and on their behalf, all who had concurred in inveſting congreſs with power, acquired citizenſhip, by being parties to this ſolemn act. Theſe original citizens were the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>United States.</hi> Citizenſhip could not be acquired in this way by abſentees from <hi>America,</hi> for two reaſons; 1ſt. Such were not thrown out of <hi>Britiſh protection</hi> by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining act of parliament, and therefore continued <hi>Britiſh ſubjects,</hi> under the obligations, and in quiet poſſeſſion of their <hi>Britiſh allegiance:</hi> And, ſecondly, Such could not be parties to the conſtitution of congreſs. The members of that body were not their deputies, or agents, and therefore could not bind them, or act for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. To cement the people of <hi>America</hi> more firmly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, oaths of fidelity to the ſtates were reſpectively admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered ſoon after the declaration of independence, to all above a certain age. By theſe oaths, a compact was eſtabliſhed between the ſtate and the individuals; and thoſe who took them acquired or confirmed their citizenſhip by their own perſonal act. By ſwearing to do the duty of citizens, they, by law, acquired a right to the privileges and protection of citizens. Thoſe who refuſed, were ordered to depart, as being perſons unfriendly to the revolution.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. As the war drew near a cloſe, the adminiſtration of oaths being leſs neceſſary, was leſs frequent. Citizenſhip was then, and now is, daily acquired by tacit conſent or acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence. Minors who were not old enough to be parties to the declaration of independence, or to take the oaths of fidelity to the ſtates at the time they were impoſed, became citizens in conſequence of their continuing to reſide in the <hi>United States</hi> after they had arrived to mature age, eſpecially if at the ſame time they claimed the protection, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the duties of citizens.</p>
            <p>At twenty-one years of age, every freeman is at liberty to chuſe his country, his religion, and his allegiance. Thoſe who continue after that age in the allegiance under which they have been educated, become, by tacit conſent, either ſubjects or citizens, as the caſe may be. In this manner, young men are now daily acquiring citizenſhip, without the intervention of an oath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:022088_0005_0FB788C176CFFF68"/>It is to be obſerved, that in order that ſuch perſons may acquire citizenſhip in this way, their reſidence ſubſequent to the revolution is indiſpenſably neceſſary, previous to the commencement of their citizenſhip: for no man can be ſaid ſo far to acquieſce in, or conſent to a government, before he has lived under it, as to become a citizen thereof by tacit conſent.</p>
            <p>Citizenſhip, when acquired in this way by an abſentee at the time of the declaration of independence, can therefore only be dated from the time in which the claimant of that high privilege became a reſident under the independent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſtate of which he claims to be a citizen.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. None can claim citizenſhip as a birth-right, but ſuch as have been born ſince the declaration of independence, for this obvious reaſon: no man can be born a citizen of a ſtate or government, which did not exiſt at the time of his birth. Citizenſhip is the inheritance of the children of thoſe who have taken a part in the late revolution: but this is confined excluſively to the children of thoſe who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves citizens. Thoſe who died before the revolution, could leave no political character to their children, but that of ſubjects, which they themſelves poſſeſſed. If they had lived, no one could be certain whether they would have adhered to the king or to congreſs. Their children, therefore, may claim by inheritance the rights of <hi>Britiſh ſubjects,</hi> but not of <hi>American citizens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5th. Perſons born in any country may have acquired citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenſhip by adoption, or naturalization, agreeably to law.</p>
            <p>The citizenſhip of ſuch muſt be dated from the time of their adoption.</p>
            <p>From theſe obſervations, the following inferences reſult.</p>
            <p>Citizenſhip is an adventitious character to every adult in the <hi>United States;</hi> and there was a certain period in the lives of ſuch perſons, when they ceaſed to be ſubjects, and began to be citizens.</p>
            <p>The citizenſhip of no man could be previous to the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of independence, and, as a natural right, belongs to none but thoſe who have been born of citizens ſince the 4th of <hi>July,</hi> 1776.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:022088_0006_0FB788C42DB8C1F8"/>This accounts for the uſe of the word <hi>reſident</hi> in that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of the new conſtitution, which deſcribes the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the preſident of the <hi>United States.</hi> The ſenators muſt be <hi>citizens</hi> nine years, and the repreſentatives ſeven years; but it is not ſaid, that the preſident muſt be a citizen for fourteen years. The thing was impoſſible, for independence was then not quite twelve years declared; therefore the word <hi>reſident</hi> was introduced in order to comprehend time before the declaration of independence.</p>
            <p>By the ſame paragraph, the diſtinction between a citizen and a reſident is conſtitutionally recognized; for tho' it is neceſſary, that the preſident muſt have been "fourteen years a <hi>reſident,</hi>" it is ſufficient for him to have become a <hi>citizen</hi> "at the time of the adoption of the conſtitution." By this it is acknowledged, that one may be much longer a reſident within the <hi>United States,</hi> than a citizen of the ſame. The preciſion of this paragraph, in reſpect to language, is worthy of obſervation. It is not ſaid, that the preſident muſt have been a reſident <hi>in,</hi> or an inhabitant <hi>of</hi> the <hi>United States,</hi> for fourteen years. The word uſed is <hi>within,</hi> which, as explained by Doctor <hi>Johnſon,</hi> means, "in the compaſs of,"—"the incloſure of." The ſentence, therefore, when analyſed, means nothing more than that the preſident muſt have been a reſident within the <hi>limits</hi> of the <hi>United States</hi> for fourteen years.</p>
            <p>Though the ſtates have not exiſted as ſtates for fourteen years; yet, their geographical boundaries, or limits, have exiſted from the firſt ſettlement of <hi>America.</hi> But to proceed with inferences. From the premiſes already eſtabliſhed, it may be farther inferred, that citizenſhip, by inheritance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to none but the children of thoſe <hi>Americans,</hi> who, having ſurvived the declaration of independence, acquired that adventitious character in their own right, and tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to their offspring. The children of thoſe who died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the revolution, who are now citizens, muſt have acquired that privilege in their own right, and by their own perſonal act; that is, by joining their country at or ſince the revolution.</p>
            <p>Citizenſhip, acquired by tacit conſent, is excluſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the caſes of perſons who have reſided within the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022088_0007_0FB788C820CC1670"/>
               <hi>United States</hi> ſince the declaration of independence, and could not have commenced prior to their actual reſidence under their new and independent governments.</p>
            <p>From the whole it is plain, that no private individual, tho' a native, who was abſent from this country at the time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence was declared, could have acquired citizenſhip with the <hi>United States,</hi> prior to his returning and actually joining his countrymen ſubſequent to the revolution.</p>
            <p>Dangerous conſequences would follow from admitting that birth and reſidence, before the declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the country now called the <hi>United States,</hi> were ſufficient to confer the rights of citizenſhip on perſons who were abſent during the late war, before they returned to their native country.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould be eſtabliſhed, many perſons, hoſtile to our liberties and independence, might put in their claim to be citizens. All the children born in the interval between the peace of <hi>Paris,</hi> 1763, and the declaration of independence in 1776, within the <hi>Britiſh</hi> poſts on our north-weſtern frontier, now wrongfully held from us, would be citizens. Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> trade would be laid open to many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, who have contributed nothing towards the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our liberties: for the natives of this country, born before the revolution, who are now diſperſed over the world, might, on that principle, fit out ſhips, make voyages to <hi>India,</hi> come here and ſell their goods, under the character of citizens, from the circumſtance of their having been born among us thirty or forty years ago, and return with the net proceeds of their cargoes, to their preſent reſidence in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign countries. Theſe, and many other conſequences, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the liberties and commerce of theſe ſtates, would reſult from admitting the dangerous poſition, that birth and reſidence in this country, before the revolution, conferred citizenſhip on abſentees, antecedent to their return after that event had taken place.</p>
