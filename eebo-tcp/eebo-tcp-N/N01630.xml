            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> I have heard from ſeveral, that the Preaching of the following Sermons has not been altogether in vain, but rather profitable to ſome. And I hope (by God's bleſſing) the Reading of 'em may be uſeful to thoſe, who will take the pains to do it. Our Time of Life is ſo ſhort &amp; uncertain, our Hearts ſo trifling &amp; deceitful, our Snares and Temptations ſo many &amp; dangerous; that we had need diligently to Improve all proper Means, to help us forward in the way of Salvation. I hope the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermons may be uſeful to this end, to thoſe who will diligently Read them. I ſhall not here give any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account, of theſe ſeveral <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Subjects</hi>; the <hi>Texts</hi> &amp; <hi>Titles</hi> are here ſubjoyned. It was with a deſire &amp; deſign, to promote the Glory of God &amp; good of Souls; that I have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd them for the Preſs, &amp; that they may be ſucceſsful in attaining what's thus aim'd at, is &amp; ſhall be the Prayer of the unworthy Author,</p>

with this tedious Journey, and we find, v. 5. <hi>They ſpake againſt God, and againſt Moſes.</hi> Often before this, when they met with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, they murmured againſt God, and againſt his faithful Servants, <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi>; and this vile practice they renew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat upon this new difficulty they met with. And for this their Sin, God plagues them. v. 6. <hi>And the Lord ſent firy Serpents among the People; and they bit the People, and much Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael dyed.</hi> It's likely theſe <hi>Serpents</hi> were called <hi>firy,</hi> either becauſe their <hi>colour</hi> ſomewhat reſembled that of fire; or rather, becauſe thoſe bitten with them were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a <hi>Scortching burning heat</hi> in their Bodies, being greatly <hi>Inflam'd,</hi> ſcortch'd with thirſt which nothing could quench. Theſe Sinners were ſerv'd in their kind, were fill'd with their own ways; their Tongues had been Influenc'd by the old Serpent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, they were ſet on fire of Hell in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and now firy Serpents are ſent to puniſh them. Under this Plague, the People confeſs their Sin, deſire <hi>Moſes</hi> to Pray to God for them, which he did, v. 7. We don't find, that God preſently deſtroy'd or remov'd theſe Serpents; but our Text tells us, God order'd a remedy for thoſe bitten and wounded with the Serpents. He orders <hi>Moſes</hi> to make a brazen Serpent, and ſet it on a Pole, that the bitten Iſraelites looking to it might be heal'd and live. Now this <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> which was thus ſet up on a Pole to heal the wounded Iſraelites; was a <hi>Type</hi> of Jeſus

Chriſt, who was lifted up and dyed on the Croſs, to ſave Sinners. Our Saviour Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo expounds and applies it. Joh. 3.14, 15. <hi>And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up. That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting Life.</hi> As every Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite ſtung with the firy Serpents, liv'd, if he did but look on the brazen Serpent; ſo, every Sinner that believes in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall live for ever. The Hebrew word, <hi>NES,</hi> which in our Text is rendred a <hi>Pole</hi>; is tranſlated an <hi>Engſign,</hi> and plainly refers to Chriſt. Iſai. 11.10. <hi>And in that day, there ſhall be a root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the People; to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his rest ſhall be glorious.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that Enſign of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to which many of the Gentiles ſeek and are Saved.</p>

The Devil made uſe of a Serpent, to draw our firſt Parents into Sin. Gen. 3.1. <hi>The Serpent beguiled Eve thro' his ſubtlety,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.3. This Dragon, this old Serpent was the Devil and Satan, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the whole World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 9.

Our Tongues can't expreſs the Grief and Horror, the Anguiſh, Pain, amazing Trouble and Diſquietment, which Perſons often feel in their own Souls by reaſon of their Sins. All the Wounds which a Man's Body can receive, are not ſo hurtful to him, as the Wounds which Sin gives to his Soul. Sin is ſuch a mortal Stab, ſuch a poyſonous Wound, as will certainly Kill and Damn a Perſon for ever, unleſs the healing Blood of Chriſt be applyed to it. Surely, Sin is a moſt grievous Wound. If any ask, Why don't Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain more of this wound? If all are thus wounded, why don't they expreſs their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, danger, concern more frequently than they do? I anſwer, they are not duely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their wounds.

They're ſo much taken up about their bodies, that they utterly neglect their Souls. Sin is a wound, and a dreadful dangerous one too; this is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe bitten Iſraelites could not be heal'd or cur'd, by any art or skill of their own.</hi> Writers ſay, that when perſons were bitten by theſe poyſonous Serpents, Phyſicians were wont to give them over as uncurable, irrecoverable: No art or skill of men could ſave them. If they appli'd never ſo many Medicines of their own contriving, yet they could not be cured thereby. So, Men can't by any skill, art or power of their own, ſave themſelves from that eternal death which their Sins have juſtly deſerved. Fallen men, Sinners, are <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. Their deſtruction is of themſelves, they are the guilty Authors of it; but they have no ſtrength to deliver themſelves from the power, guilt or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not from the power of Sin.</hi> Men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes and in ſins,</hi> Eph. 2.1. And they can't create new Life in their own Souls: no man can come to the Son, except the Father draws him. True believers are born, <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the freſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.13. 'Tis God of his own will that does beget them; that creates them in Chriſt Jeſus, according to the exceeding greatneſs of his power, the

working of his Mighty Power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>Gods Gift,</hi> Eph. 208. So is <hi>Repentance</hi> too, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Alas, without Chriſt Sinners can do nothing: 'tis God that works in them to will and to do of his own good pleaſure. So that Men can't ſave or deliver themſelves from the filth, the power, the prevailing efficacy of Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor from the guilt or puniſhment of Sin.</hi> They cannot by all their doings or ſufferings, ſatisfie Gods juſtice, and purchaſe their own deliverance. When they have done their beſt, they are unprofitable Servants. If they ſhould offer thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſands of Rivers of oyl; give their firſt-born for their tranſgreſſion, and the fruit of their bodies for the ſin of their Souls, yet it would not be a ſufficient Sacrifice. They are not redeemed with <hi>corruptable things,</hi> ſuch as <hi>ſilver and gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>They can by no means redeem their Brother</hi> (nor themſelves neither) <hi>nor give to God a ranſome for him,</hi> Pſal. 49.7. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Soul, is too precious to be wrought by them. They can't buy off eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal plagues and puniſhments. There is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in none but Chriſt; <hi>Neither is there any other name given under heaven among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4.12. As theſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Iſraelites, could not heal nor cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo neither can Sinners deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the power, guilt or puniſhment of Sin, by any art, skill or power of their own. If they have no help but of their own procuring, they muſt neceſſarily periſh for ever.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001936_0014_0FBA339C8685EFE8"/>3. <hi>It was God that appointed this brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the healing of the people.</hi> 'Twas not any device or contrivance of their own, 'twas not man's Wiſdom that propos'd this method. So, 'twas God that appointed Jeſus Chriſt to be the Saviour of Sinners. The Way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinners thro' Chriſt, was not the reſult of the Wiſdom or Contrivance neither of Men nor Angels; 'twas originally and wholly from God. God did elect and chuſe Chriſt, to the Office and Work of a Redeemer. Hence Chriſt is called, God's <hi>Servant,</hi> and His <hi>Elect,</hi> Iſai. 42.1. 'Tis ſaid of Chriſt, He was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Him that <hi>appointed</hi> Him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. God choſe, call'd, appointed Him to His Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Work and Service. Tho' Mans Miſery is of his own procuring, yet his Salvation is of God's contriving and procuring.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>'Twas of God's meer undeſerved Mercy and Grace, that He provided a Remedy for the bitten Iſraelites.</hi> They had provoked God, ſpoken againſt Him, and againſt His faithful Servant <hi>Moſes</hi>; God was juſtly angry with them. He had ſent Serpents to bite and wound them, many dyed of their Wounds; and if all had dyed that were bitten, 'twas no more than what they had juſtly deſerved. Now for ſuch unworthy, provoking Sinners as theſe, God provided a Remedy; ſurely 'twas nothing but meer, ſovereign, undeſerved Mercy and Grace that could move him thus to do. So, 'twas meer, ſovereign, undeſerved Mercy and Grace and nothing elſe, that mov'd God to provide a Saviour for poor, miſerable, ſelf-undoing Sinners. God did not give his Son to ſave
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001936_0015_0FBA33A073B28710"/>
Sinners on the account of any Merit, Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or good Deſerving in them, for they were unworthy of any Favour. They juſtly deſerv'd Eternal Wrath and Vengeance: God might have glorify'd His Juſtice in their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ruin and Deſtruction. God's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does not depend on the Sinners Salvation. God ſtood in no need of their Happineſs; He had no neceſſity of their Recovery. If He had pleas'd to have ſinleſs Men to ſerve and praiſe Him; He might have created a new, holy Stock, and have given them Grace to be eternally Obedient to Him, if He had ſeen meet ſo to do. Or if He had deſir'd to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy His Grace in the Redemption of Sinners, He might have done it (if he had ſeen meet) in the Salvation of fallen Angels, who were originally of a Rank and Order ſuperior to Man. Indeed ſinful Men did no way deſerve God's Favour, nor had He any need of their Salvation; 'twas therefore of His moſt free and ſovereign Grace, that He gave His Son to be their Redeemer. So we read, Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, as to give his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son; that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have everlaſting Life.</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Christ dyed for us.</hi> Thus we ſee, that Gods ſending His Son to ſave Sinners, is aſcribed to His <hi>Love</hi>: 'Tis menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (and that very juſtly) as an admirable Effect of His amazing, unparallel Love. 'Twas (as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4.) His <hi>great Love</hi> wherewith he loved us. 'Twas <hi>great Love,</hi> if we conſider the <hi>Author</hi> of it, the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001936_0016_0FBA33A626B276B0"/>
infinitely Great GOD; <hi>Great,</hi> as to the <hi>long ſtanding</hi> of it, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. <hi>Great,</hi> as to the <hi>Objects</hi> of it, who were vile Sinners, <hi>greatly Unworthy</hi> of it. 'Twas <hi>great Love,</hi> elſe He would never have given His only begotten Son, to dye for the ſaving of thoſe whom He thus Loved. 'Twas Great as to the <hi>Fruits</hi> of it, delivering from great and everlaſting Miſery, and bringing poor unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sinners to great and everlaſting Glory. Indeed 'twas great Love, free, ſovereign, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Grace and Mercy, that moved God to provide ſuch a Saviour as He has done for poor Sinners. Therefore Believers ſhould learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to aſcribe any of the praiſe of their Salvation to any thing of their own.</hi> Oh Man, haſt thou a ſaving Change wrought in thy Soul? Art thou become a New Creature? Art thou indeed Intituled to Eternal Life and Glory? Is it thus with thee, while others are haſtening on in their Ways of Sin to Eternal Miſery? Whence came this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thee and them? Is it to be aſcribed to any Worthineſs or Merit of thine own; or to any Power which thou hadſt to ſave thy ſelf, more than what others have? No indeed, nothing of the praiſe of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be aſcribed to thy ſelf. If thou ſhouldſt be dealt with according to thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings, Hell would be thy Portion for ever. If no Power but thine own were employed for thy Deliverance, thou wouldſt never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at all.</p>

'Twas ſovereign Mercy that ordered thy being born under the Goſpel, or at leaſt thy being brought under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: 'Twas free Grace that ſet home Divine Truths on thy Soul, and made thee a New Creature. 'Twas free Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, that in the Blood of Chriſt blotted out thy Sins, and that gave thee a new and firm Title to Eternal Bleſſedneſs. The whole of thy Deliverance and Salvation, is to be aſcribed to free, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace: 'Tis the fruit and effect of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign divine Mercy. Therefore the whole praiſe is due to God, to Chriſt. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ſhould ſay, as Pſal. 115.1. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us; but to thy name give Glory, for thy mercy and thy truths ſake.</hi> I'm ſure, the bitten Iſraelites were indebted to free, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, divine Favour, for providing a Remedy for them. So, Sinners are inconceivably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to ſovereign, divine Grace, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a Saviour, an holy, powerful Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If the bitten Iſraelites had done nothing but pore and ponder on their Wounds, this would not, could not have cured them.</hi> Though they were ſenſible of their Wounds, did ſee them, feel them, complain of them, ſmart under their Pain, grieve and mourn for them; yet if they did no more, this could not cure them. They muſt not only conſider their own Wounds, but alſo look on the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001936_0018_0FBA33AB9AB2B780"/>
elſe they were not healed. So, if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only keep looking and poring on their own Sins, this can never ſave them. Indeed a ſight and ſenſe of Sin is proper for them, but this is not ſufficient. Men ſhould ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their ſickneſs and wounds, as to ſee their need of a Phyſician, a Surgeon; ſo, Men ſhould ſo conſider their Sin and Miſery, as to ſee their need of a Saviour, and truſt in Him for Salvation. But if they only keep poring on their Sins, this won't ſave them. They may poſſibly ſee themſelves very vile and ſinful, be very much diſtreſſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed for their Sins, have ſome Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and Humiliations for them, and yet periſh for ever. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, and put on Sackcloth; yet there is no Evidence of his true Repentance. <hi>Judas Repeated,</hi> brought back the Price of his Treaſon; ſaid, he had ſinned in betraying innocent Blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4. He had great Convictions and Horrors for Sin, yet he was the Son of Perdition, and periſhed for ever, becauſe he did not heartily Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, 'tis not a meer ſight and ſenſe of Sin, horror and diſtreſs of Conſcience for it, that can bring Perſons to Heaven. Perſons may have great Awakenings and Horrors for Sin in this World, and yet be Damn'd Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the next. 'Tis not enough that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be frighted with their Sins, but they muſt abhor and forſake them, and truſt in Chriſt alone for the Pardon of them, if ever they would be ſaved. Men muſt not only ſee their Malady, but alſo apply the Remedy, if they would obtain the Relief they need.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001936_0019_0FBA33AD140AFB40"/>6. <hi>This piece of Braſs, though made in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Serpent, yet had not the Poyſon of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in it; but was for the healing of thoſe that were poyſoned.</hi> So, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, tho' made in the <hi>likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8 3. Yet <hi>he knew no Sin</hi> (that is, he had none) a Cor. 5.21. <hi>He did no Sin, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22. He had no Sin, but came to ſave thoſe that had ruined themſelves by Sin.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>'Twas the Duty of the bitten Iſraelites to look to the brazen Serpent for Cure, though to an Eye of Senſe, there was little if any likelihood of Cure by it.</hi> The brazen Serpent had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Vertue to communicate from it ſelf to thoſe that were bitten, for the healing of them. There was no natural Efficacy in that piece of Braſs, to heal wounded Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as there is in the Sun to warm the Earth it ſhines on. Nay, Writers ſay, that when Perſons were bitten with thoſe poyſonous Serpents, 'twas very hurtful for them to look upon bright ſhining Braſs. Carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a bitten Iſraelite might ſay, What ſhould I look upon that piece of Braſs in the Figure of a Serpent for, what good can it do me? And yet 'twas the Duty of ſuch bitten Perſons to look on it for healing. The healing did proceed from Gods Appointment and Inſtitution; and from His own efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Power exerted in that His own Way. So, the Way of Salvation through Chriſt, is very unlikely, if nothing but Mans carnal Reaſon makes the Judgment of it. Carnal Men were apt to think concerning Chriſt,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001936_0020_0FBA33AF58ADCB78"/>
that He had no <hi>form, comlineſs or beauty</hi> for which He ſhould be deſired, <hi>Iſal</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 53.2. The Preaching of Salvation through a Crucified Chriſt, was <hi>to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23. Thus carnal Reaſon often rejects and diſapproves the Means appointed by God, even by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom and Goodneſs. Yet tis the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all that live under the Goſpel, to believe in Chriſt for Salvation. 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the Way of Gods chuſing and appointing, therefore all ſhould walk in it, though never ſo contrary to carnal Reaſon. They alſo ſhould expect the Bleſſing from God <hi>in His own Way,</hi> and not from any Worthineſs in themſelves or Actions. When a bitten Iſraelite looked on the brazen Serpent, twas not any Vertue or Merit in his <hi>Act of looking,</hi> that obtained the Cure; but the whole Benefit did proceed from Gods Inſtitution and Bleſſing. So, when we truſt in Chriſt for Salvation, tis not our <hi>Act of truſting</hi> that really merits or deſerves the Benefit; but this truſting is appointed by God, as the Way in which we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect His Favour. We ſhould expect Gods Bleſſing in His own Way, and not give heed to any contrary Arguings. This might teach us, diligently to attend on all Ordinances of Gods appointment. Let us not ſay, What good ſhall I get by theſe and thoſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; what ſpiritual good can I get by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper?</hi> How can theſe convey any Benefit to my Soul? No, this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001936_0021_0FBA33B24B5104B8"/>
is carnal Arguing and Reaſoning; for theſe are Means of Gods appointing, therefore we ought heartily and obediently to attend on them, depending on God alone for the Bleſſings repreſented and exhibited thereby. If the bitten Iſraelites had inſiſted on this, We wont look on the brazen Serpent, it can do us no good; then they might all have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Wounds. So, if we will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the good of our own Souls, but juſt what carnal Reaſon ſuggeſts, we muſt then periſh for ever.

And Miniſters of the Goſpel, in their Preaching, ſhould lift up, or hold and ſhew forth Chriſt Jeſus to Sinners, that they may ſee Him by Faith, and live.

What if his bitten Parents, Children, or other Friends were heal'd by looking to it? What of all this, yet if he did not perſonally look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, then he died of his wounds. So, tho' a perſon lives under the Goſpel, and hears a Multitude of excellent Sermons, tho' he's much urg'd and ſollicited to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; yet if he does not believe in him, he ſhall not be ſaved by him. It may be his Father and Mother, and many of his near Relatives and Friends believ'd in Chriſt for the ſaving of their Souls; yet he will be never the better for this, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does not believe in Chriſt he muſt be damned for ever. If a ſtung Iſraelite heard never ſo much about the brazen Serpent, or ſpake never ſo much about it; yet if he perſonally did not look on it, he was not benefitted by it. So, tho' a perſon hears never ſo much about Chriſt, ſpeaks or preaches never ſo much about him; yet if he perſonally does not believe in him, he muſt periſh for ever. If he has ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand offers of Chriſt, yet if he does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him by heart-purifying Faith, he muſt be Eternally Damned. <hi>He that believeth not on the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3.36.</p>

Whoever was bitten, whether Male or Female, Young or Old, High or Low, Rich or Poor, Bond or Free; whether he had been bitten a longer or ſhorter Time, whether he had received one Wound or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whether his Anguiſh and Pain had been great or ſmall, yet he might look on the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent. None were forbidden to look, all bitten Perſons were equally welcome; and all that looked on it lived. So, All Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners under the Goſpel, are equally welcome to come to Chriſt; all that will come ſhall be welcome. He has ſaid, Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> All that hear of Jeſus Chriſt, whether they are Younger or Old, Rich or Poor, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever circumſtanced in the World; yet they are invited to come to Chriſt.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons, when they can't get thoſe things they deſire, will Fret, Vex, be Uneaſy and Diſcontent: This is Murmuring, 'tis a fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Divine Providence, which Governs all Things.</p>

When thoſe who labour'd but one Hour in the Vineyard, receiv'd as much as thoſe who labour'd all Day; thoſe who had labour'd all the Day <hi>Murmured</hi> at it, though they themſelves received all they had agreed for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.11. The holy Pſalmiſt was <hi>envious at the fooliſh, when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked,</hi> Pſal. 73.3. Envy always implies Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring in it; 'tis an implicit charging of God with an undue, unbecoming Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Favours. Indeed Gods Providence governs the World; <hi>His throne is prepar'd in the Heavens, his kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Pſal. 103.19. He does <hi>according to his pleaſure in Heaven, Earth, Sea, and all deep places,</hi> Pſal. 135.6. Let Inſtruments be who or what they will, yet all Benefits and Troubles are diſtributed, ordered forth, by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. God <hi>forms the Light, creates Darkneſs, makes Peace, creates Evil</hi>; 'tis the Lord does all theſe things, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.7. Men therefore ſhould look above and beyond Inſtruments, in all the Mercies and Afflictions they meet with, and conſider the Hand of God in every one of them. If therefore they <hi>Murmur</hi> when they want what they deſire; or when they meet with Loſſes in their Eſtate in their Children or other dear Relatives, indeed when they meet with any Afflictions; or when they ſee others in Proſperity whom they
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001936_0031_0FBA33C7C9581700"/>
think unworthy of it; I ſay, if they Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at theſe things, 'tis plainly a faulting and condemning of what God does. We therefore now proceed to conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Greatneſs of this Sin.</hi> Murmuring is a very vile Impiety, a very great Sin. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience (as ſuch) to the Divine Law, is a practical contempt of Gods Authority; a ſaying, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him</hi>? Murmuring is an implicit faulting of Gods Government; a condemning the Steps and Methods he takes in ordering of his Creatures. Indeed there <hi>may be</hi> ſuch a thing, as faulting (and that juſtly) the Inſtruments of our Trouble, where yet there is no Murmuring againſt God; but a Patient bearing of his Hand in the Tryal. But on the other hand, when Perſons are Fretful, Impatient, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content under Afflictions, whether they have much regard to Inſtruments or not; this is Murmuring, and a great Crime it is: For it highly and baſely reflects on God, who orders and governs all things in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as he pleaſeth: 'Tis an implicit judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faulting, condemning what God does. This highly Reflects,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Upon Gods Sovereignty.</hi> As for Gods own Being, it is Neceſſary and Eternal. As for the Being of Creatures, it depends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on Gods Sovereign Pleaſure. <hi>For his pleaſure, all things are and were created,</hi> Rev. 4.11. God has made <hi>the Heaven, Earth, Sea, and all things therein; and he preſerveth them all,</hi> Neh. 9.6. 'Tis of Gods meer Sovereign Pleaſure, that he has made Creatures, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001936_0032_0FBA33C8D00E5A00"/>
that he continues them in Being. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt needs have the moſt abſolute Lordſhip and Dominion over them, that poſſibly can be. He is the Supream Lord and owner of them, and may therefore order and diſpoſe of them as he ſees meet. <hi>The Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof; the World and they that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 24.1. Therefore <hi>he may do according to his will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; none may ſtay his hand, or ſay to him, what doest thou</hi>? Dan. 4.35. Perſons commonly reckon, that Men may diſpoſe of their own things as they will; as the Lord of the Vineyard ſaid, Mat. 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good</hi>? Surely then, the Great GOD may do what he will with his own: He's the ſovereign Potter, we are the Clay; he may make one Veſſel to Honour and another to Diſhonour as he will. Now, when Perſons Murmur and Repine at that Condition, at thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which Providence orders to them; therein they do as it were arraign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Gods Sovereignty; they implicitely ſay, God has no right thus to order things as he does, at his own Pleaſure. Surely, 'tis great and daring Wickedneſs, thus to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach and condemn Gods Sovereignty, his ſovereign Government of the World. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to our Lord, <hi>What ſhall this Man do</hi>? Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee</hi>? Joh. 21.21, 22. So, O Man, though thou art in great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001936_0033_0FBA33CA4A567FE8"/>
while God beſtows great Proſperity on others; yet, what is that to thee? May he not diſpoſe his own Favours as he will? What is that to thee, if others have Health while thou haſt Sickneſs; if others are loaded with Honour, while thou art loaded with Contempt; if others are Rich while thou art Poor; if others have their Houſes and Eſtates continu'd, while thine are taken away; if others have their Wives, Children, or other dear Relatives continu'd, while thine are taken away? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God may do what he will with his own When thou doſt fret and vex at thy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou doſt Murmur againſt God; thou doſt practically condemn his Sovereignty, and ſhow thy ſelf diſpleas'd that he has the actual Government of the World in his own Hand. Thy Murmuring is as it were a practical Eſſay to rob God of his Crown, thruſt him from his Throne, and wreſt his Scepter out of his Hand. Such proud, daring Arrogance as this, muſt needs be a great and heinous Offence. Murmuring does Reflect,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>On Gods Infinite Wiſdom.</hi> God is the Father of Lights, his Underſtanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, he is Wiſdom it ſelf. He acts with infinite Wiſdom, in all his Works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Providence too: Pſal. 104.14. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in Wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi> The Lord of Hoſts <hi>is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Counſel, and excellent in Working,</hi> Iſal. 28.29. <hi>He worketh all things according to the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001936_0034_0FBA33CED35F3698"/>
Counſel of his own will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. God in all he does, always aims at the higheſt and beſt End, even his own Glory; he has made all things for himſelf, and he orders all things after the beſt manner that can be, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this beſt End; and therefore he orders all things in infinite Wiſdom. But when Men Murmur, Repine, Fret, and are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at the Diſpenſations of Providence; therein they reflect on Gods Wiſdom. They practically ſay, God does not know how to govern the World well and wiſely, he does not take right and proper Steps in his Rule and Conduct; for if he orders things well and wiſely, then why do they yet complain? Now it muſt needs be a very great Crime, thus to reflect on the unſearchible Wiſdom of the great God. Shall ſuch Bats, ſuch ignorant, ſhort-ſighted blind Creatures as we are, arraign and condemn the wiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Divine Providence? Yet thus wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly we do, when we Murmur at Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Job 40.3. <hi>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty, inſtruct him! He that reproveth God, let him anſwer it.</hi> 'Tis wicked Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, for any to pretend to inſtruct the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, or reprove him for any part of his Conduct. He that Murmurs, practically ſays, that God does not govern wiſely; and this Reflection muſt needs be a great offence. Murmuring Reflects,</p>

Yes ſurely, he cannot do a wrong, or an unrighteous thing. <hi>He is Righteous in all his ways, and Holy in all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145.17. Men often do unjuſt things; yea, Good Men, through Ignorance, or preſent Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Corruption, ſometimes do unjuſt things, and ſo may juſtly deſerve Blame. But God is unchangibly Wiſe, Juſt, Holy, Righteous; and ſo cannot do an unjuſt thing. As 'tis <hi>impoſſible for God to lye,</hi> ſo 'tis impoſſible for God to be unjuſt, or to act unjuſtly; for <hi>there is no variableneſs with him, nor any ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. Yet when Men Murmur at their Condition, they practically charge God with treating them hardly, with dealing unjuſtly with them. If they meet with no unjuſt Treatment, then they have no reaſon to find fault; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their finding fault plainly implies, that they think themſelves unfairly dealt with, and that they don't deſerve the tryals they meet with, or that others ought not to be ſo high, and they ſo low in the World: Ezek. 18.25. <hi>Yet ye ſay, the way of the Lord is not equal.</hi> They wickedly charg'd God with Innequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Injuſtice in the Methods of his Providence. This was the Spirit and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thoſe, Mal. 3.13, 14. <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt me, ſaith the Lord, yet ye ſay, what have we ſpoken ſo much againſt thee? Ye have ſaid, it is vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it, that we have kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord</hi>? They ſeem evidently to complain, that God did not deal with them ſo well
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001936_0036_0FBA33D82F7EDFE0"/>
as he ſhould; that he did not beſtow on them the Benefits and Bleſſings which they deſerved. The ſame ill Spirit appear'd in thoſe, Iſai. 58.3. Wherefore have we fasted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge? By theſe Queries, full of Diſcontent and fretful Complaints, they practically ſaid, Gods Ways were not equal, he did not deal juſtly with them, they deſerv'd better at his Hands. This is the Heaven-provoking Language, of a Murmuring, Diſcontented Spirit. Murmuring is a great Crime, 'tis a charging of God with Injuſtice. Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly Reflects,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>On the Goodneſs of God.</hi> Murmuring implies a contempt of, and unthankfulneſs for the Goodneſs of God. <hi>God is good, and his tender Mercies are over all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145.9. There's no Perſon in the World, but what receives more or leſs of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods Goodneſs. All Men are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Wages of Sin is Death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere all that perſons have on this ſide Death, on this ſide the unquenchible Flames of Hell, is owing to meer Divine Mercy and Kindneſs; 'tis better than they deſerve: For they are <hi>leſs than the leaſt of Gods Mercies,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> confeſs'd of himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their heavieſt Loſſes, Tryals, Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, Afflictions, they ſhould yet ſay, <hi>God puniſhes us leſs than our Inquities deſerve; 'tis of the Lords Mercy we are not conſumed: Wherefore ſhould a living Man complain, a Man
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001936_0037_0FBA33D94F85BD58"/>
for the puniſhment</hi> of <hi>his Sins?</hi> Under our ſoreſt Afflictions, we yet have many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, though we deſerve none; therefore we have always cauſe to be Thankful, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any cauſe to Complain. But when we Murmur and Repine, it ſhows a contempt of Gods Goodneſs to us; as though it did not deſerve our Notice of it, or Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for it. This deſpiſing of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt needs be highly provoking to him. Oh Man, doſt thou Murmur at thy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? Thou doſt Reproach God in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. God deals far better with thee than thou deſerveſt, thou haſt no reaſon to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, but much reaſon to be Thankful. Haſt thou loſt part of thy Eſtate? 'Tis a Mercy thou haſt not loſt it all. If thou haſt loſt all thy Eſtate, yet 'tis a Mercy thou haſt thy Liberty, and art not a miſerable Captive among cruel Enemies. It may be thou haſt Health and Eaſe in thy Body; that's a great Mercy. Or if thou haſt Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pain, yet 'tis a great Mercy that thy Sight and thy Hearing are continued to thee. 'Tis a Mercy that the uſe of thy Reaſon is continued to thee. In a Word, Sure I am, 'tis a great Mercy that thou art out of Hell, that thou art under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that thou haſt the Bible for thy Guide and Comfort; and ſo haſt an Opportunity to lay up Treaſures in Heaven, to ſecure an unfading Inheritance, an eternal weight of Glory. 'Tis wicked Ingratitude, a vile contempt of Gods Goodneſs, for one ſo circumſtanced as thou art; to Murmur and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001936_0038_0FBA33DAD20BCBF8"/>
Repine at Troubles and Afflictions. Thus we ſee, that Murmuring is a very great Sin; it highly reflects on the Sovereignty, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs of the Great GOD; and this muſt needs be a great Offence, an high Affront indeed to the Great GOD.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The danger of this Sin.</hi> The Sin of Murmuring, greatly provokes God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth perſons to His terrible diſpleaſure.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Judgments God has Inflicted for it.</hi> Our Text tells us, that ſome of the Iſraelites Murmured, and <hi>were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> God deſtroy'd many of them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, for their Murmuring at his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.

<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001936_0041_0FBA33DF7A367358"/>
that Murmuring is a Sin very highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to God. And by the way, ſurely theſe things ſhould Caution us againſt wicked wiſhes, vile abominable Imprecations. Some are very apt to wiſh ſuch and ſuch evil things to themſelves, to their Wives, their Husbands, their Children or other Relatives; it may be they may wickedly and raſhly wiſh that they may <hi>be Hanged,</hi> or that they may never ſee one another again, or the like. 'Tis very Sinful to do thus, avoid ſuch wicked wiſhes, leſt God fulfil them in his wrath. Iſrael wiſh'd they had di'd in the Wilderneſs, God ſaid Amen to it, He was ſo provok'd that He caus'd them to die there. Let none be diſcontent and fretful, becauſe they can't have theſe and thoſe things they deſire; let them not ſay, that they can never be eaſy or content without them, leſt God ſend the things thus deſired and a Plague and Curſe with them. <hi>Rachel</hi> can't be content without Children, well then, She ſhall have Children and be kill'd in bearing them.

               <p>We proceed to the USE, from what we have heard we may Infer,</p>

breaks out in Words and Actions; and yet more frequently rageth in the Secret of the Soul. Though 'tis a very common Sin, yet 'tis a very great one. How often have we been Impatient, Fretful, Diſcontent at the Diſpenſations of Divine Providence? This was a charging of God fooliſhly, a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with our Maker; we ſhould be deeply humbled for it, and ſay as he, Pſal. 73.22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee.</hi> Job 42.6. <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and Aſhes.</hi>

There's no Evil of Affliction, but what is of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering. Therefore, though we may be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed</hi> with the <hi>Sin</hi> of Inſtruments that afflict us; and may <hi>grieve</hi> for the Afflictions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too; yet we ſhould not Murmur at them for the ſending of them is a <hi>Divine Work.</hi> Pſal. 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi> Pſal. 39.9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi>

Much more ſhould we think, that God always does what's beſt, though we can't at preſent ſee through the meaning of his particular Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. <hi>Our Lord</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 13.7. <hi>What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>PROP. I. <hi>The Fear of God ſhould keep us from Sinning.</hi> Sin is a breach of Gods Law. 1 Joh. 3.4. <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo the Law; for ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> Sin is a very great evil, Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as 'tis an affront to the Infinitely Great GOD. And as 'tis a great Evil, ſo it deſerves great Miſery. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Thoſe who are the Servants of Sin, are like to be the Subjects of Death, even of Eternal Death and Miſery. This Eternal Miſery, will be Inflicted by Divine Juſtice, on thoſe who go on obſtinately in ways of wickedneſs. Therefore the true Fear of God, and of His holy diſpleaſure, is the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or Preſervative againſt Sin. Every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Perſon, every true Convert, has in him the root and principle of every true ſaving Grace. As he has true Faith &amp; Truſt in Gods Mercy thro' Chriſt; ſo he has true Love to God, and true filial Fear of Him. True Fear God, is a ſaving Grace. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are bidden, to paſs the time of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

ſhould cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs <hi>in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. The more Men fear God, the more careful they'l be to avoid Sin, and to practiſe holineſs. Job 28.28. <hi>The fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</hi> A Perſon's truly fearing of God, Implies in it, his <hi>real belief</hi> that God is ſuch an One as He has declar'd Himſelf to be, and his being <hi>ſuitably Affected</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and ſo it tends directly to keep him from Sinning. A realizing belief of his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Holineſs, Power</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> does ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A realizing belief of His Knowledge.</hi> Gods Law ſhould be our rule in all things; we ſhould conform our Thoughts, Words, and Deeds unto it continually. And God moſt critically obſerves whether we do ſo or not. Tho' many of our Actions may be hid from Men, yet none of them can be hid from God. He ſays, Jer. 23.23, 24. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> God is preſent every where, ſees all things, ſtrictly obſerves whether we regard his Authority and obey His Precepts, yea or no. God's Eyes are on all our ways: there's not a word in our Tongue, but lo, He knows it altogether: Yea He knows the things that come into our Minds, even every one of them. <hi>His eyes are in every place beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15.3. <hi>There is no Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight; all things are open and naked to the eyes
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001936_0051_0FBA33F8D41C02A0"/>
of him with whom we have to do.</hi> Heb. 4.13. Tho' many Sins are ſecret as to Men, yet none are ſo as to God; His Knowledge is Infinite. A realizing belief of this extenſive univerſal Knowledge of God; would tend very much to keep us from Sinning. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are often reſtrain'd from Sin, by the Preſence of ſerious, grave, godly Men, their Fellow. Creatures; and how much more would it reſtrain them from Sin, if they ſeriouſly believ'd and conſider'd, that the All-ſeeing Eye of their infinitely Holy and Glorious Judge, is continually upon them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A realizing Belief of his Holineſs.</hi> As God <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſees and knows all the Sins any are guilty of, ſo, he as <hi>neceſſarily</hi> hates and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors them. Sin is the moſt hateful thing to God that can be, yea, the only thing that <hi>provokes</hi> him; 'tis the abominable thing that his Soul hates. <hi>He has no pleaſure in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, evil ſhall not dwell with him; he hates all workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 5.4, 5. <hi>He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, he cannot look on iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. No vile Object in the World, is ſo loathſome and abominable to Men as all Sin is to God. 'Tis nothing but Sin, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Communication of Bleſſings and Favours from God to Men. <hi>Your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have ſeparated between you and your God.</hi> Iſai. 59.2. <hi>Your ſins have witholden good things from you,</hi> Jer. 5.25. God has manifeſted his matchleſs, glorious Holineſs and Purity, and ſo his Hatred of Sin, in caſting the fallen Angels into Chains of Darkneſs, in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001936_0052_0FBA33FA5FCA84F0"/>
Death as the Wages of Sin; in drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old World with a Flood for their Wickedneſs; in bringing numberleſs terrible Judgments on particular Perſons, Families, Nations, Kingdoms, Countrys for their Sins; and in bringing terrible Sufferings on our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, who became <hi>Surety</hi> for his choſen People, and undertook to <hi>ſatisfy for their Sins.</hi> Though God through Chriſt can be Reconciled to <hi>Returning Sinners,</hi> yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Reconciled to Sin it ſelf. Now a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alizing Belief of God's infinite Holineſs, his unnutterable Hatred and Loathing of Sin, tends to keep Men from Sinning. While the true <hi>Fear of God</hi> actually and vigorouſly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in the Soul, a Perſon would not dare knowingly to Sin againſt him, to do any thing which he knows to be ſo <hi>unutterably Hateful</hi> to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Realizing Belief of his Power.</hi> Gods <hi>Power</hi> is as great to puniſh Sin, as his <hi>Holineſs</hi> to hate it. Sometimes Juſt and Righteous Judges can't come at <hi>vile Criminals,</hi> to puniſh them as they deſerve. But Gods Eye beholds <hi>all Tranſgreſſors,,</hi> he needs no Witneſſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him; his Hand alſo is <hi>long</hi> enough to reach them all, and <hi>ſtrong</hi> enough to inflict the moſt terrible Judgments on them. He is the Lord Almighty; the Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Reigneth; nothing is too hard for him, all things are poſſible with him. <hi>Obſtinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> can't poſſibly eſcape his <hi>terrible Revenges.</hi> Who ever hardened himſelf againſt God and proſpered? <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſy,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001936_0053_0FBA33FC2E8A0448"/>
are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. Tho' Sinners <hi>exalt themſelves as the Eagle, and ſet their Nest among the Stars; yet God will bring them down,</hi> Obad. v. 4. He can inflict intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Plagues and Puniſhments on Sinners, on their Bodies, on their Souls, in Time, and throughout Eternity. Who knows the <hi>Power of his Anger?</hi> Oh, it is a <hi>fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</hi>! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Realizing Belief of the <hi>Almighty Power</hi> of that God, who ſees all the Sins of Men, who infinitely hates them, muſt needs have a proper Tendency to keep Men from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Who but Mad-Men, would heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and knowingly anger and provoke One, whom they know has preſent, conſtant, ſufficient <hi>Power</hi> to deprive them of all their Comforts, to Ruin and Deſtroy them, to make them <hi>unutterably Miſerable</hi>?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A Realizing Belief of Gods Faithfulneſs.</hi> God has denounced <hi>terrible Threatnings</hi> againſt Sin and Sinners. The Soul that ſins ſhall die. The Wages of Sin is Death. Every Sin is a Capital Crime, by the Righteous Law of God. Thoſe who are <hi>obſtinate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of Sin in this World, ſhall be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Eternal Miſery</hi> in the next. <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark. 16.16. The God that has denounced theſe <hi>terrible Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> is unchangibly True and Faithful to his Word. <hi>He is not a man that he ſhould lye, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould repent. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? Or hath he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſhall he not make it good</hi>? Numb. 23.19.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001936_0054_0FBA33FF1C01FF88"/>
                  <hi>It is impoſſible for God to lye,</hi> Heb. 6.18. God is unchangibly True, and will fulfil his <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the <hi>Everlasting Deſtruction</hi> of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if Repentance prevent not. He is as true alſo to his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and will Pardon all true Penitents, will ſave all that heartily hate Sin, ſtrive and watch againſt it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be <hi>Holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi> None have a right, true <hi>Fear of God,</hi> but thoſe who believe theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; even his infinite <hi>Knowledge, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Power</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi>; and thoſe who do really believe theſe things, duely conſider them, and ſuitably apply them to <hi>their own Hearts,</hi> they cannot but <hi>Fear God,</hi> fear to ſin againſt and offend him. They cannot but eſteem his Favour better than Life; and ſo they cannot but <hi>Fear the Lord and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Hoſ. 3.5. They cannot but fear the offending of that God, on whoſe Favour the whole of their Welfare and Happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. And on the other hand, they cannot but <hi>Fear his Wrath</hi> more than Death. The Fear of God <hi>ſhould,</hi> and as far as it is in lively Exerciſe it <hi>will,</hi> keep them from ſinning. If the Saints do fall into known Sin at any time, 'tis becauſe the <hi>Fear of God</hi> was not at that time in due <hi>Exerciſe</hi> in their Souls. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Fear of Men,</hi> more than the true <hi>Fear of God,</hi> prevail'd in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he deny'd Chriſt with <hi>Curſing and Swearing.</hi> But ſo far as the true <hi>Fear of God</hi> prevails in any, 'twill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from ſinning; it won't ſuffer them to indulge Sins of Omiſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. It is not Fear of Shame or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001936_0055_0FBA34004BCA4F80"/>
from Men, that is the chief <hi>Restraint</hi> on them; for then they would ſin in <hi>Secret,</hi> or when they had a Proſpect of eſcaping Puniſhment from Men; but ſo far as the true <hi>Fear of God</hi> prevails in them, they are as careful to avoid <hi>ſecret Sins</hi> as <hi>open</hi> ones, (for they know, Gods Eye is always upon them) they are afraid of Sins which would not expoſe them to humane Cenſures, as well as of thoſe that would; for they know that God will be <hi>provok'd</hi> with Sin, whether Men are or not. True <hi>Fear of God</hi> will make them argue in their own Conſciences, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> once did to his wicked, tempting Miſtreſs: Gen. 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t God</hi>? True, holy <hi>Fear,</hi> puts Men upon <hi>Obeying God.</hi> Heb. 11.7. <hi>By Faith, Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with Fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe.</hi> God told him, a Flood would come and deſtroy the wicked World, bad him prepare an Ark for ſafety when the Flood ſhould come; <hi>Noah</hi> believ'd the threaten'd Judgment would come, was <hi>afraid</hi> of it, and ſo <hi>obeyed</hi> God in providing an Ark for ſafety, as he had been directed. True <hi>Fear of God in Exerciſe,</hi> will make Men chuſe <hi>Suffering</hi> rather than <hi>Sinning. Daniel Feared God,</hi> and rather than diſpleaſe God by omitting <hi>Prayer,</hi> he choſe to be <hi>caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Den of Lyons.</hi> The three Children <hi>Feared God,</hi> and they choſe to be bound and <hi>caſt alive into a fiery Furnace,</hi> rather than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God by worſhipping an Idol, <hi>Dan. ch.</hi> 3. 'Tis the Character of the true <hi>Fearers of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001936_0056_0FBA34038A134CC8"/>
that <hi>they love not their Lives to the Death,</hi> Rev. 12.11. They have not ſo great a <hi>Fear of Men,</hi> who can do no more than <hi>kill the Body</hi>; as they have of God, <hi>who can deſtroy both Soul and Body in hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. The Fear of God ſhould, and ſo far as it operates and prevails it will, Reſtrain Perſons from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſo far as holy <hi>Fear</hi> prevails in them, they will act moſt for Gods Glory and their own Good. And, as the <hi>Fear of God</hi> ſhould keep us from ſinning in general, ſo,</p>
               <p>PROP. II. <hi>The Fear of God ſhould particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly keep us from following ill Examples.</hi> When godly <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had mentioned ill Practices in others, he adds, <hi>But ſo did not I, becauſe of the Fear of God.</hi> As if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Though they have ſinned thus and ſo, yet I dare not do like them; their Example cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and therefore ſhall not obtain, my Imitation. I know that God is my Maker, Lawgiver and Judge, that I am accountable to him for all my Ways, that his Eye is always upon me; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dare not offend nor ſin againſt him, tho' never ſo much prompted by ill Examples.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the Fear of God ſhould, and where 'tis duely exercis'd it will, ſtrengthen the Soul againſt the <hi>Snares &amp; Temptations</hi> by which it is endangered; particularly againſt <hi>ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> which are very <hi>dangerous Snares</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. God ſays, Exod. 23.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi> If this or that Sin becomes very common, cuſtomary, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001936_0057_0FBA34064851F1A0"/>
if the <hi>Multitude</hi> do it; yet God forbids our imitating them therein. Eph. 5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> Do others tempt us to Sin, by their vile <hi>Examples</hi> or <hi>Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?</hi> We ſhould be ſo far from <hi>comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that we ſhould rather <hi>reprove</hi> them. If the Multitude go wrong, we ſhould not go wrong for Company ſake. Are we willing to be Damned, to go to Hell for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſake? If not, let us not Sin for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſake. Rev. 18.4. — <hi>Be not partakers of her ſins, that ye partake not of her plagues.</hi> Indeed there is no Preſervative againſt the poyſonous Influence of ill Examples, like this of the true and lively <hi>Fear of God.</hi> The Goſpel teaches us <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly lusts; and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent world,</hi> Tit. 2.12. The Fear of God ſhould quicken us to avoid the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that are contrary hereunto. As,</p>

            <p>THeſe Words were ſpoken by our <hi>Holy Redeemer,</hi> when he was about to work a <hi>Miracle.</hi> The Context tells us, that our Saviour ſaw a Man <hi>Blind from his Birth</hi>; and that he miraculouſly gave Sight to him. When our Saviour ſaw this <hi>Blind Man,</hi> his Diſciples ask'd him, v 2. <hi>Who ſinned, this Man or his Parents, that he is born blind</hi>? They reckon'd, that ſome extraordinary Sin had

procured this extraordinary Affliction of <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> v. 3. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, neither hath this Man ſinned, nor his Parents; but that the works of God ſhould be made manifest in him.</hi> The meaning is, 'twas no remarkable, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sin, either in this Man or his Parents that <hi>procured</hi> this remarkable extraordinary Affliction, of his <hi>being born Blind.</hi> God ſees ſo much Sin in any, in all, in the beſt, that he can without any <hi>Injuſtice or Unrighteouſneſs</hi> bring great and remarkable Afflictions on them; Witneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> All meer Men are Sinners, and the Wages of Sin is Death, even Eternal Death; and all that Men have on this ſide ſuch Miſery, is better than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. <hi>It is of the Lords Mercy that we are not conſumed. — Wherefore doth a living Man complain, a Man for the puniſhment of his Sins?</hi> Lam. 3.22, 39.

               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:001936_0066_0FBA3419195F6C20"/>As if he had ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <q>God, my Eternal Father (whoſe only begotten Eternal Son I am) has ſent me into the World to Redeem Sinners, to teach them the Way of Life and Salvation; and has commiſſioned me to work Miracles, to confirm this Miſſion, and the truly Divine Doctrine which I Preach: This is the Work God has ſent me about, and this Work I muſt follow, while the Day of Life laſteth. Therefore I'll give Sight to this blind Man, that by this Miracle (as well as many others) ye may know that God has ſent me, that the Doctrine I Preach is true, that I am the true and only Saviour of Sinners, long ago foretold by the Prophets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though our Saviour was to Die for the Redemption of Sinners, and <hi>riſe from the Dead,</hi> and ſo manifeſt himſelf to be the Son of God with Power; yet before this Night of Death came, he would take all <hi>proper Opportunities</hi> to do the <hi>Work</hi> God had ſent him about, to Preach <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> and confirm them by <hi>Miracles.</hi> And in the cloſe of the Verſe, gives a general Reaſon which extends to <hi>all Men,</hi> viz. <hi>The Night cometh when no Man can work.</hi> The <hi>Day,</hi> while the <hi>Sun gives Light,</hi> is the moſt convenient time for Men to <hi>Work in</hi>: The <hi>dark Night</hi> renders it impoſſible for them to follow at leaſt <hi>ſome ſorts of Work.</hi> In allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to what is thus <hi>univerſally</hi> known to, and regarded by Men, our Saviour compares the time of <hi>Mans Life in this World,</hi> to the

                     <hi>Death</hi> ſeems undeniably to be meant, by the <hi>Night</hi> ſpoken of in our Text. When Night comes, that's the proper Time for <hi>Sleeping</hi>; and ſo <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf is ſometimes compar'd to <hi>Sleep.</hi> Pſal. 13.3. <hi>Conſider and hear me, O Lord my God; lighten mine eyes, leſt I ſleep the ſleep of Death.</hi> Pſal. 76.5. <hi>The stout-hearted are ſpoiled, — they have ſlept their ſleep.</hi> That is, they are <hi>Dead.</hi> And as <hi>Death</hi> is compar'd to Sleep; ſo in our Text
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001936_0068_0FBA341C34208738"/>
'tis compar'd to Night, the proper Time for Sleep. <hi>Death</hi> may be compar'd to <hi>Night,</hi> inaſmuch as then Men commonly <hi>ceaſe from Working</hi>: Pſal. 104.23. Man goeth forth to his Work and to his Labour, <hi>until the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> When Night comes, Men commonly <hi>leave Working,</hi> eſpecially <hi>without Doors</hi>: Some Works can't be done in the Night. So, when <hi>Death</hi> comes, Men can work no more (as the next <hi>Propoſition</hi> will ſhow) and on this account it may be compar'd to the <hi>Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Night,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Death,</hi> is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all Men</hi> The Day of Life laſts but a while with them, the Night of Death is <hi>approaching</hi> to all Men. <hi>'Tis appointed for Men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9.27.

Though the Earth abides for ever, yet the Inhabitants of it do not; for one Generation goes and another comes. Men are Born to Die: Sin has made Men Mortal, the Body is Dead becauſe of Sin. <hi>By one Man ſin entered into the world, and Death by ſin; and ſo Death hath paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. All are Sinners, and therefore all muſt Die; the Godly and Ungodly muſt Die. Pſal. 49.10. <hi>He ſeeth that the wiſe Men die, likewiſe the Fool, and the bruitiſh Perſon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> Indeed, the Saints found <hi>Alive</hi> when

Chriſt comes to Judgment, ſhall not Die; but ſhall ſuddenly be Changed, and be like the glorious, raiſed Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51, 52. But excepting thoſe then remaining alive, all muſt have their Bodies and Souls parted from one another. Men and Women, Young and Old, High and Low, Rich and Poor, Learned and Unlearned, Godly and Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; all muſt Die: They muſt Sleep the Sleep of Death: The Night of Death will ſoon overtake them. And <hi>how ſoon</hi> it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any particular Perſons, they don't know: Tho' Death certainly will come, yet 'tis uncertain how ſoon. <hi>Iſaac</hi> once ſaid, Gen. 27.2. <hi>I know not the day of my Death.</hi> Every one that can ſpeak, may truly ſay the ſame of himſelf. Prov. 27.1 <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> So, Jam. 4.14. <hi>Ye know not what ſhall be on the morrow: For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> The Day of Life is like a Vapour, a Smoak or Fog; no one knows how ſoon it may diſappear and be gone. It is evident therefore, that the Night of Death is coming on all Men, though none of them know how near it may be to them.</p>

                     <hi>In the place where the tree falleth, there it ſhall be,</hi> Eccl. 11.3.

When Men Die, their Souls go to their particular Judgment, and are doom'd to a ſtate of Miſery or Glory, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what their Works and Behaviour in this World were. When Pious <hi>Lazarus</hi> Died, his Soul went to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, to a ſtate of Happineſs: When the wicked Rich Man Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Soul was ſent to Hell-Torments, and the great Gulf was then fixed; he was ſtak'd down (as it were) in Miſery, he could not poſſibly eſcape or get out of it, Luk. 16.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was beyond the Poſſibility of Mercy, all his Cries, Prayers, Tears could not obtain the leaſt Relief for him.

Oh, there's not <hi>one Drop of Mercy</hi> for thoſe that Die Chriſtleſs and Graceleſs, though they plead and beg never ſo much for it. If Death finds a Man Chriſtleſs, the Day, the Seaſon for working out his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is ended for ever.

After death, Men can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prepare for Eternity: nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining of peace with God, and endleſs happineſs in his favour. If Men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace with God in their Life time, then death can't take it away. Death can't ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from the love of God. But if peace with God be not obtain'd before death, it can never be had at all. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord,</hi> Rev. 14.13.

All Men ſhould <hi>Obey</hi> God, that in general is the work he requires of them. I'm now ſpeaking more eſpecially of thoſe, who Injoy God's reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will, His Written Word: they have greater advantages to know God's Will, and greater Motives to do it, than meer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have. God has ſhewed them what is good, and what he requires of them; <hi>To do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with their God,</hi> Mic. 6.8. In general, 'tis their duty to <hi>believe</hi> all that God <hi>declares,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> all that He <hi>commands.</hi> Thus He ſaid to Iſrael: Jer. 11.4. — <hi>Obey my voice and do them, according to all that I cammand you.</hi> Would we know what is the work God requires of us? Tis this in general, That we ſhould obey His Voice, do all that He bids us; yield ſincere, univerſal, unwearied Obedience to His holy Precepts: this is the work He calls us to, and ſets us about. And there is One parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Momentous Command of God, which we ſhould Obey, elſe we can't obey any other ſo as to find acceptance with Him; and that is, to <hi>Believe in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of and ſubmit to Him on Goſpel Terms as Prince and Saviour. 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that we ſhould believe in the

Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When the Jews ask'd our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall we do that we may work the works of God?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh 6.28, 29. This indeed is <hi>the</hi> work, the great work, the moſt abſolutely neceſſary work that God calls all under the Goſpel unto, and requires of them. Oh Man, Woman, whoever thou art, there's a work, an Important work which the Great GOD calls thee to, and ſets thee about, even <hi>thee,</hi> thee in particular whoever thou art; and this work is, that thou ſhouldſt heartily Repent of all thy Sins, and heartily Submit to the Lord Jeſus as the only Prophet, Prieſt and King of thy Soul. This is the great call of God in the Goſpel to thee, if thou doſt not heartily. Obey this call, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; then thou canſt not poſſibly do any one particular work, that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and be pleaſed with. Heb. 11.6. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, it is Impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.8. <hi>They that are in the fleſh,</hi> (that is, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate) <hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi> And as God requires all under the Goſpel, to believe in Chriſt, accept of Him as Prince and Saviour; ſo their doing this Implies in it, their taking Him for their Lord and Lawgiver, and ſo their yielding unfeigned Obedience to his Precepts.

to do the duties of thoſe <hi>ſeveral Capacities, Stations, Relations</hi> which His Providence has ſet them in. 1 Cor. 7.24. <hi>Let every man wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</hi> We ſhould heartily do all that God ſets us about, relying on His Grace thro' the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Chriſt for acceptance. This in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is the work God ſets us about, and requires of all under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The thoughts of Death and what follows, ſhould make them diligent in this work.</hi> All of us ſhould be greatly mov'd and quicken'd, ſpeedily and heartily to Repent of all our Sins, to Believe in the Lord Jeſus, ſubmitting to Him on Goſpel Terms. The calls and offers of the Goſpel will ſoon be ended with us; therefore we ſhould forthwith hate and forſake all our Sins, and give up our ſelves to the unfeigned, conſtant practice of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. We can't poſſibly be too ſpeedy, hearty, diligent, reſolute, conſtant in this work, this neceſſary work. This indeed is the One Thing needful, the great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs we ſhould be chiefly concern'd about. We ſhould ſhow unutterable Folly, and be unſpeakably Miſerable, if we neglect this work till the Night of Death overtakes us. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, if he gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul</hi>? Mat. 16.26. Many are greedy after much of the World, as tho' they could never have enough of it; but if a perſon might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to gain the whole World, and yet loſe
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001936_0076_0FBA3431DB881880"/>
his Soul by neglecting the work of God, he would then be a moſt miſerable loſer. Thoſe who entertain'd themſelves with worldly pleaſures and profits, tho' they had never ſo great a meaſure of them; yet by neglecting to get into the <hi>Ark,</hi> they periſhed when the Flood drowned the old World. So, if Men get never ſo much of this World's good, yet if they neglect the work of God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect getting an Intereſt in Chriſt, till the Night of Death comes, then they'l periſh for ever. How often are <hi>Servants beaten,</hi> and that very juſtly, for Playing, for Idling away their Day-time, not doing what their Maſters bid them; and when Night comes on, their Stint, their Work is not done? God ſets us a <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our tender hearted Redeemer, once <hi>wept</hi> over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for neglecting the things of their Peace in the proper Seaſon of them, ſaying, Luk. 19.41, 42. <hi>If thou hadst known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are had from there eyes.</hi> The day of Gods Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is yet extended to us, He waits to be Gracious; but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in this our day we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the things of our Peace, we're then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever: it would have been good for us that we had never been born. It's ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Lam. 1.9. —— <hi>She remembreth not her latter end, therefore ſhe came down won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully:
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001936_0077_0FBA34334A649178"/>
She had no comforter.</hi> Surely, thoſe will come down wonderfully, down indeed, down to hell it ſelf; and will have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, who dont remember their latter end ſo as to prepare for it. Well then, let us work the work of God, while it is Day; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Night comes wherein no Man can work.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore a few things may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, by way both of <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>Direction, viz.</hi> Seriouſly conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Death moſt certainly will come, and 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain how ſoon.</hi> This is ſo plain a Truth, that doubtleſs none will dare to deny it; yet 'tis not ſo duely and ſeriouſly thought on as it ſhould be. Oh let us daily think of Death, let it be often in our Thoughts: our thinking daily and frequently on it, need not take up our Time ſo as to hinder us from any proper buſineſs. Death will moſt certainly come. It may be we ſometimes fear theſe and thoſe Outward troubles, think they will come, yet 'tis not certain that they'll come, poſſibly they may not. But as for <hi>Death,</hi> it certainly will come, whether we expect and fear it or no, yet it will come, there's no eſcaping it. Yea, 'tis coming near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and nearer to us, every Day, Hour and Moment. The longer it is ſince <hi>Sun riſe,</hi> the nearer it is to <hi>Sun-ſet.</hi> Every time the <hi>Clock-strikes,</hi> it ſhows that ſo much of the Day is gone already; and therefore there is the leſs remaining before Night comes. Every ſtep we take, and every breath we draw,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001936_0078_0FBA3434CD420EE8"/>
brings us ſo much nearer to the end of our Time, of our Life. But as it's <hi>certain</hi> Death will come, and that 'tis every Moment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching <hi>nearer</hi> to us; yet 'tis uncertain how near it may be. Many are apt to put far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the evil Day, when they think of Death, they ſtill think of it <hi>as at ſome Years diſtance</hi>: But alas, Such Thoughts are groundleſs. As 'tis commonly ſaid, <hi>Old Man muſt die</hi>; ſo 'tis as true, <hi>Young Man may die.</hi> The Young and Stout and Strong, are often ſuddenly cut down by the <hi>Stroke of Death.</hi> Art thou Young and Strong? Poſſibly Death may not come to thee for theſe ſeveral Years; yet on the other hand, thou doſt not know that thou haſt a Day longer to live. The Rich <hi>Senſualiſt</hi> in the Goſpel, reckon'd upon living <hi>many Years, to eat drink and be merry;</hi> but God ſaid to him, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee,</hi> Luk. 12.19, 20. He was a <hi>Fool,</hi> for flattering himſelf with thoughts of <hi>long Life,</hi> when he knew not <hi>how near</hi> Death was to him. It's probable, there are many ſuch Fools in the World. Oh, What Sciences do they form in their own Minds? They reckon upon long Life, they plot and contrive to buy and ſell and get Gain; to get ſuch and ſuch deſirable Enjoyments, to obtain much worldly Grandeur and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but Death comes and nips them in the Bud, cuts them off before ever they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd what they thus vainly promis'd to themſelves. Therefore let us meditate much on the <hi>certainty of Death,</hi> and the <hi>uncertainty when</hi> 'twill come: This tends to quicken us
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001936_0079_0FBA34364E989A50"/>
to the Work of the Day in the Day. If a Perſon would ſeriouſly think thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I don't know but this Day may be my last Day, I don't know that I ſhall have any more Time to prepare for an endleſs Eternity in; I don't know but God may require my Soul of me, and doom me to an Eternal State before I'm a Day older.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, if he would frequently thus think with himſelf, doubtleſs he would not omit Duty and commit Sin, ſo readily as he often does. To think when we go to Bed, <hi>I don't know that I ſhall live till Morning</hi>; and when we riſe in the Morning, <hi>I don't know that I ſhall live till Evening</hi>: Surely thus to think, tends to make Perſons ſerious, and to make them mind their Duty. Deut. 32.29. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood this, that they would conſider their latter end.</hi> 'Tis a great Point of Wiſdom, and tends to make Perſons yet <hi>more Wiſe,</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider <hi>their latter End</hi>; ſeriouſly to conſider Death, and what's like to follow after it. Pſal. 90.12. <hi>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> If we would but ſeriouſly conſider, that much of our <hi>precious Time</hi> is gone already, and we know not how little remains; this ſurely would make us do better than we often do.

a juſt Man upon Earth, that doth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not,</hi> Eccl. 7.20. Yet there are ſome Perſons, more eminently, abundantly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably Wicked than others: they allow themſelves in very heinous, crying, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Abominations, working wickedneſs with greedineſs. Such vile Tranſgreſſors, were theſe <hi>Young Men</hi> ſpoken of in our Text. Theſe <hi>Young Men</hi> were not profeſſed Infidels and Heathen; no, they were <hi>Iſraelites, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God's Covenant,</hi> enjoy'd His Revealed Will, His Holy Oracles; they were ſome of His Profeſſing People, they had receiv'd <hi>Circumciſion</hi> the <hi>Soul of God's Holy Covenant.</hi> Nay more than this, they were Children of a <hi>godly Father,</hi> of <hi>Eli.</hi> They were <hi>Eli's Sons.</hi> ver. 12. <hi>Eli</hi> was a Prieſt of God, the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> at this time: he alſo was <hi>Judge of Iſrael.</hi> chap. 4. ver. 18. By the account we have of <hi>Eli</hi> in Scripture, he ſeems to have been a very godly Man, tho' criminally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to his Sons, very faulty in not duly witneſſing againſt their vile Abominations; for which neglect of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God threatned ſuch Judgments to him, and his Family, as ſhould make both the Ears of them that heard them to <hi>tangle,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.11. <hi>Eli</hi> being a godly Man, a Miniſter, a Prieſt, it's very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he gave his Sons a pious Education, godly Inſtructions and Exhortations. We find that he once <hi>reprov'd</hi> them, tho' not with that ſharpneſs and ſeverity which their Crimes deſerv'd, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23, 24. Therefore tho' he did not reſtrain and puniſh them as he ſhould have done; yet it ſeems more
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001936_0087_0FBA344C146851C8"/>
than probable, that he gave them very godly Counſels, Inſtructions, Admonitions. But notwithſtanding theſe Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> had ſo good a Father, were Children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, were Circumcis'd, were doubtleſs pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſtructed; yea, tho' they were <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Prieſts by <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Office</hi>; yet they were notoriouſly and abominably wicked. 'Tis here ſaid, ver. 12. They were <hi>Sons of Belial</hi> (ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the moſt ſcandalous Sinners, ſuch us would <hi>not bear the Yoke</hi> of Government and good Order) <hi>that they knew not the Lord.</hi> That is, they wickedly and ſcandalouſly diſobey'd Him, liv'd as tho' they knew nothing of His Commands; or were not oblig'd to regard them. Theſe Young Prieſts not only took their <hi>own ſhare</hi> of the Sacrifices, but they would have it <hi>unſeaſonably</hi> too; even <hi>before</hi> Gods part was Offered and Burnt to Him, ver. 16. Yea, they alſo <hi>forcibly</hi> took from the Offerers, part of what belong'd to them, ver. 13, 14. Yea they were ſo abominably wicked, that they <hi>lay with the women that aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle,</hi> ver. 22. Horribly daring and Impudent they were, in their <hi>Fornications and Adulteries,</hi> thoſe curſed Practices. So ſcandalouſly wicked they were, as that 'tis ſaid in this <hi>Verſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our Text, <hi>Men abhorred the Offering of the Lord.</hi> Men abhorred to bring Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which muſt paſs thro' the hands of ſuch wicked abominable Miniſters, Prieſts, as theſe were. Our Text therefore ſays of theſe <hi>Young Men, their Sin was very great before the Lord.</hi> Their Sin was <hi>before the Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:001936_0088_0FBA37E8E2702D68"/>
it was under His Eye and in His Sight, as indeed the Sins of all Men are. <hi>For the Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15.3. Many Thiefts, Fornications, Adulteries, Murders, and other abominable Crimes, are committed <hi>Secretly</hi> as to Men; the Crimes are a long time, if not always conceal'd from the Publick notice of Men; but <hi>no Sins are Secret as to God.</hi> He knows what is done at Midnight in the darkeſt corner, as well as what is done at Noon Day on the Houſe top. But this phraſe, <hi>before the Lord,</hi> does here more probably ſignify, that theſe Young Men Sinn'd thus abominably <hi>at the Tabernacle,</hi> the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> the place of His ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and holy Worſhip; at the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, where the <hi>Ark</hi> that <hi>Symbol of God's ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence was.</hi> And ſo 'tis juſtly mention'd as a <hi>great aggravation</hi> of their impudent wickedneſs. That they ſhould be thus wicked <hi>at the very Door of Gods Houſe,</hi> where People came to Worſhip the Holy and Heart-ſearching God; this was high and impudent wickedneſs indeed: It's not eaſy for Words to paint out ſuch Crimes in their juſt Colours. It is Criminal at any time, to harbour and nouriſh wicked thoughts in our hearts; but it is an high aggravation of the Crime, to nouriſh ſuch thoughts in the Houſe of God, in the time and place of His Holy Worſhip: and more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtill, at ſuch a time and place, openly to perpetrate what ſuch indulged Luſts do move for.</p>

               <p>Our Text and Context, yield a plain proof of this ſorrowful Truth. Theſe Men were <hi>Young Man,</hi> tho' what their particular Age at this time was we dont exactly know.

Pious Parents, Children that have had eminent means us'd, and great pains taken with them, to make them truly and practically Religious; do yet prove ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly and abominably wicked.

               <p>ANSWER.</p>
               <p>I ſhall Indeavour to mention a few.</p>
               <p>Theſe things ſhow us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is not in the power of meer Inſtruments or Means tho' never ſo good, to work reſtraining, (much leſs, ſaving) Grace in the Hearts of any.</hi> 'Tis juſtly to be accounted a great favour, to enjoy the Means of Grace; there is no Salvation without the Means. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. Yet the beſt Means that can be uſed for the good of Souls, will prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; unleſs God adds his efficacious Bleſſing. If Young Perſons have never ſo good Inſtructions given them, never ſo good Examples ſet before them in the Family, or by the Neighbours; if they are never ſo well advantaged as to Publick Ordinances, yet nothing but Divine Almighty Grace can reſtrain them from Sinning, or make them truly Holy. It was God that <hi>kept back A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech from ſinning,</hi> Gen. 20.6. Whoever <hi>plants or waters,</hi> yet none but <hi>God</hi> can <hi>give the Increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6, 7 If <hi>Ministerial weapons</hi> (or Indeavours) are us'd never ſo faithfully; yet 'tis only <hi>thro' God</hi> (by His efficacious bleſſing on them) that they are Inſtrumental to <hi>pull down the ſtrong holds</hi> of Sin and Satan, <hi>to cast down Imaginations — and to bring into Captivity every thought to the

It is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> That <hi>the Lord opened her heart, that ſhe hearkened to the things that were ſpoken by Paul,</hi> Act. 16.4. Tho' <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuch an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Apoſtle,</hi> ſuch an Eminent Ambaſſador of Chriſt (<hi>labouring more abundantly than others,</hi> Cor. 15.10.) yet he might have Preach'd long enough and <hi>Lydia</hi> got no good by it, if God (who has all hearts in his hand, and can turn them as the Rivers of water) had not <hi>opened her heart</hi> to receive the Truths Preached. Let us learn then, to prize and value Means and diligently to attend on them ('tis our duty ſo to do) but let us not truſt in them, but truſt in God alone for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Parents, beſides diligently giving the beſt Inſtructions to their Children; ſhould earneſtly and conſtantly Pray, that God would give reſtraining, yea Saving Grace unto them. So, Miniſters ſhould not only declare Gods Mind as plainly as ever they can to their People; but they alſo ſhould earneſtly Pray to God for all that Succeſs they deſire. The beſt Means will do no good without Gods bleſſing.</p>

So, Lev. 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in my wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour; and ſhalt not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> None knows, how far God may bleſs Indeavours for Saving good to great Tranſgreſſors. <hi>Oneſimus</hi> (the Servant of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon) play'd the Thief,</hi> Stole from his Maſter, ran away, was apprehended and put in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and in Priſon was <hi>Converted</hi> by Gods bleſſing on the Indeavours of the <hi>Apoſtle Paul,</hi> who was a Priſoner in the ſame Place.

So we ſhould <hi>Pray</hi> to God for them, that He would indeed take away their heart of Stone and give them an heart of Fleſh; that He would make them true Penitents. For <hi>in every

thing, by Prayer and Supplication we ſhould make known our requeſts to God,</hi> Phil. 4.6. Poſſibly ſome, when they hear of the great Crimes of others, will readily run out againſt them, ſhow their ill will againſt them, but never Pray to God for them; but ſuch, dont do as they ought.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We ſhould be thankful for reſtraining Grace to us and ours, and be more Watchful and Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the future.</hi> Have others fallen into great and crying Abominations, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſhame, blame and puniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; and laying themſelves open to the ſore diſpleaſure of God? And have not we and ours been as bad as they? What's the ground of this difference? If we had had the like Opportunities and Temptations with others, and been left to our ſelves, we ſhould have ſhown our ſelves as bad as any of them all. For the Hearts of all the fallen Children of Men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally alike Sinful, <hi>deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked.</hi> Jer. 17.9. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. Such Hearts ours are by Nature. And 'tis the undeſerved Grace of God, that keeps us and ours from Sinning, ſo far as we are Reſtrained. The vile ſcandalous Crimes of others, do as it were ſhow what is Originally in our Hearts; therefore we ſhould be <hi>Thankful,</hi> if we and ours have not broken forth into the like Scandals as they are guilty of. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ?</hi> When you that are Parents and Maſters,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001936_0098_0FBA37FD1D360AE8"/>
juſtly condemn the vile Crimes that any Young Perſons are guilty of; conſider, 'tis owing to the meer undeſerved Grace of God, that you, your Children and Servants, have not fallen into the like or worſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. If you and yours with others, ſhould be in a <hi>Boat when it overſets</hi> (or in ſome other great danger) and while <hi>they</hi> periſh, <hi>you and yours eſcape</hi>; would you not be <hi>Thankful</hi> for ſuch <hi>ſingular Preſervation?</hi> Surely you ſhould. So when you and yours are kept from thoſe Scandalous Crimes, which many others fall into; you ſhould be Thankful for ſuch diſtinguiſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Grace vouchſafed to you. Again, the Falls of others ſhould quicken us to more <hi>Watchfullneſs and Prayerfulneſs,</hi> leſt we fall as they have done. When the Apoſtle had mention'd <hi>ſundry</hi> groſs Sins in others, the <hi>Uſe</hi> or <hi>Application</hi> he makes is, <hi>Let him that thinking he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12. Truly, ſuch things ſhould make us <hi>take heed,</hi> watch and be careful that we dont offend like them. With reference to the Sins of (and conſequent Judgments on) others, the Apoſtle ſays, Rom. 11.20. <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear.</hi> Oh, be not high-minded, dont boaſt nor triumph over thoſe that fall, done truſt in thine own ſtrength; but <hi>Fear, Watch, Pray,</hi> leſt thou fall as <hi>they</hi> have done. <hi>Conſider thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted,</hi> Gal. 6.1. <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> Mat. 26.41.</p>

All the Good and Benefit which Creatures receive, whether Angels, Men, or inferior Beings; they all receive it from God.

'Tis of Gods own Heart that he beſtows them, the ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is <hi>primarily and originally</hi> from himſelf; 'tis not from any Worth, Merit, or good Deſerving in them. Indeed God may be ſaid to be under Bonds and Engagements to beſtow Benefits, and very great ones too, on ſome ſorts of Perſons, even the Bonds of his own <hi>Word, Promiſe, Oath</hi>; but 'twas of his own moſt free, ſovereign Bounty and Goodneſs, that he laid himſelf under ſuch Bonds. So that all the Benefits Men ever receive, flow <hi>originally from the free Bounty and Goodneſs of God.</hi> This Truth may in ſome Meaſure be cleared and demonſtrated, by conſidering theſe following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>'Twas of Gods Soveraign Goodneſs, that He purpos'd to make Men, to beſtow Benefits on them, and that He did give being to them.</hi> It is the Lord that hath made us, and not we our ſelves. <hi>He has of one Blood made all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men to dwell on the face of the Earth,</hi> Act. 17.26. Tho' Divine Wiſdom directed in, and Divine Power effected, the Creation of the World; yet Divine <hi>Goodneſs</hi> was the <hi>firſt mover</hi> in the matter. God did not make the <hi>World</hi> from any <hi>neceſſity of Nature,</hi> nor
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:001936_0115_0FBA31C652F92998"/>
from any <hi>need</hi> He had of Creatures (for He's Infinitely, Unchangeably Self-ſufficient and All-ſufficient) but from a <hi>voluntary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> to <hi>exert</hi> and <hi>diſplay</hi> His Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and communicate of His Goodneſs. <hi>For his Pleaſure all things are and were created,</hi> Rev. 4.11. Therefore <hi>Thanks</hi> are <hi>rendred</hi> to God, for His <hi>Mercy,</hi> (His <hi>Goodneſs</hi>) in the Work of <hi>Creation,</hi> in making the <hi>Heavens, Earth, &amp;c,</hi> Pſal. 136.1.5, — 9. Now God being an <hi>Infinitely</hi> wiſe Agent, had laid the Plan or Scheme of His Work, before he ſet upon doing it: all his Works <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> in <hi>Creating</hi> and <hi>Governing</hi> the World, are but the <hi>Execution</hi> of His Antecedent Eternal <hi>Purpoſes.</hi> For, <hi>known unto him are all his Works from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Act. 15.18. <hi>He works all things according to the Counſel of his own will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. He's of one Mind and none can turn him: his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch therefore as all his <hi>Works</hi> referring to his <hi>Creatures,</hi> are but the Executions of his Antecedent Eternal <hi>Purpoſes,</hi> it thence follows, that his making of Men, and his beſtowing Benefits on them; are but the product or execution of his Eternal Counſels. And ſince <hi>before</hi> Men had a being, God <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd</hi> to give them being and to beſtow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on them; it muſt needs be, that thoſe <hi>purpoſes</hi> did flow from his moſt Free Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign bounty. Thoſe purpoſes of Goodneſs, could not poſſibly have any other Spring or Fountain. For Men not being yet made, could not poſſibly act, and ſo, could not
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001936_0116_0FBA31C96F6CEE20"/>
poſſibly deſerve either good or evil. Gods purpoſes, did preceed Mens beings and actions, as the Apoſtle tells us in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to Election might stand, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 9.11. All thoſe benefits Men ever receive, are the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>product</hi> of thoſe Eternal Purpoſes which God purpoſed in Himſelf, before Men ever had any being; therefore they muſt neceſſarily flow <hi>Originally</hi> from the Soveraign Bounty and Goodneſs of God. It's of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Divine Bounty and Goodneſs,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That God has given His Son Chriſt Jeſus, to Die for the Salvation of Sinful Men.</hi> All Men by Sinning againſt God, by breaking his holy Law; became juſtly obnoxious to Everlaſting Vengence, Wrath and Miſery. God might (if he had ſeen meet) have <hi>greatly</hi> Glorified his Vindictive Juſtice to all Eternity, in making all ſinful Men (as well as all ſinful Angels) inconcievably and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly miſerable. But inſtead of this, he gave his Only Begotten Eternal Son, to Die a ſhameful and an accurſed Death in the room and ſtead of ſinful Men, to purchaſe Pardon, Grace and Eternal Bleſſedneſs for them. And it could not <hi>poſſibly</hi> be any thing elſe, but moſt Free, Soveraign Bounty and Goodneſs in God, that put him upon ſuch a Method as this. That he ſhould in ſuch an expenſive way as this (even at the expence of the Blood of his Only Begotten Eternal
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001936_0117_0FBA31CACCB21388"/>
Son) bring thoſe who deſerved endleſs Plagues and Torments in Hell, to injoy end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs inconceiveable Glories in Heaven, could not poſſibly proceed from any thing but moſt Free Soveraign Grace and Goodneſs. <hi>God ſo loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners Christ died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>He is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us — by Grace are ye ſaved,</hi> Eph. 2.4, 8. It's of God's Soveraign Goodneſs,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That He has put ſuch a connexion as He has, between Mens Duties, and the benefits which will thence accrue to them.</hi> Inaſmuch as God is the Soveraign Maker of all Men, does hold their Souls in Life, and preſerve their Spirits and all their powers of Operation; inaſmuch as they thus intirely depend on the Soveraign pleaſure of God, it neceſſarily follows, that 'tis their indiſpenſable duty to imploy themſelves and all their Powers for God, conformably to the diſcoveries of his preceptive Will unto them. They're indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably obliged to this, from the Relation there is between them and their Creator, and from the dependence they have on him for their Being and Operation; whether he had promis'd any Reward to their Obedience or not. 'Twas therefore an effect of Soveraign Bounty, rather than of <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ſtrict</hi> Juſtice, that God promis'd an endleſs happy Life to innocent Man (as is plainly implied in the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001936_0118_0FBA31CC61C91410"/>
firſt Threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.) if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued perfectly obedient. For if innocent Man had long continued perfectly Obedient to his Maſters Will; this would have been no more than what he was indiſpenſably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to, from his relation to God as his bountiful Creator and Preſerver: nor could God have thence been oblig'd to continue him longer in being, or beſtow further Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on him, unleſs by his own free ſoveraign promiſe he had ſo oblig'd Himſelf. Surely then, ſince Man is faln, it muſt needs be of Gods Free, Soveraign Grace and Bounty, that in and thro' the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, he puts a connexion between Man's Duty and the Benefits which will thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to Him. If we judge rightly, we muſt needs own, 'tis Soveraign Goodneſs in God that he'll ſtoop to treat with Rebels, through a Mediator of his own appointing; and that when he might glorify himſelf in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Deſtruction, he promiſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to favour and make 'em Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, if they'll return and ſubmit to the moſt reaſonable and gracious Terms which he offers to them. Yet he does ſo. For <hi>thro' Chriſt he is reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> He does not bid any to ſeek him in vain; but declares, <hi>there's Forgiveneſs with him that he may be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. He's a <hi>rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>Whatſoever good thing any Man doth, the ſame ſhall be receive of the Lord whether he be bond or free,</hi> Eph. 6.8. It's of God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Bounty and Goodneſs,</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="113" facs="unknown:001936_0119_0FBA31CDD4683288"/>4. <hi>That he beſtows many Outward Benefits, on thoſe who continue obſtinately wicked and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him.</hi> God left not himſelf without Witneſs to the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, <hi>but gave them Rain from Heaven and Fruitful Seaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs,</hi> Act. 14.17. The Wicked are often fat and flouriſhing, ſwiming in ſtreams of Pleaſure, they are not in trouble like other Men, neither plagued like other Men; <hi>their eyes ſtand out with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have more than heart can wiſh: the ungodly often proſper in the World, and increaſe in riches,</hi> Pſal. 73.5,—13. How many <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Monarchs are there, cloth'd with Royal Robes, crown'd with Diadems, poſſeſs'd of vaſt Power and Wealth, injoying all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that outward things can give them; who yet are unmindful of, and rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, God their Soveraign Maker and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor? God often extends <hi>riches of his Goodneſs</hi> and forbearance to ſome, who do nothing elſe but <hi>treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath</hi> (by their abominable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Wickedneſs,) <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. Many who deſerve to burn in Hell forever for their Wickedneſs, and will get thither at laſt; yet often enjoy numberleſs and great Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward benefits here in this World; and that for many Years together. Surely, every one who believes the Bible, muſt think; that this flows from the meer, ſoveraign, undeſerved bounty and kindneſs of God. For tho' thro' their own folly and ſin, ſuch Proſperity often leads to, and fattens 'em for, Deſtruction; yet
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:001936_0120_0FBA31CF4AA455B0"/>
this does not hinder, but that the <hi>beſtowment</hi> of ſuch Proſperity in it ſelf conſidered, is a fruit of Soveraign Divine Goodneſs. The <hi>Light of the Sun</hi> is a great <hi>Bleſſing</hi> (Mat. 5.45.) tho' many <hi>abuſe</hi> it to the <hi>practiſing of Wickedneſs,</hi> Mic. 2.1. It's of God's Sovereign Bounty and Goodneſs,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>That He often makes uſe of Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to convey Benefits to Men.</hi> Some are apt to take ſo much Notice of Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which more immediately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly hand forth benefits to them; as too much to neglect the Original Fountain of them. But God is no leſs the Giver and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Benefits, becauſe he uſeth Means and Inſtruments in conveying of any of them. God <hi>fed Jacob</hi> all his Life long, tho' his <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> ſupplyed him one while, and his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> furniſh'd his Table afterwards. God was as really the <hi>Feeder</hi> of <hi>Elijah,</hi> when the <hi>Ravens</hi> brought him <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi>; as he was of Iſrael in the Wilderneſs when he daily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with <hi>Manna.</hi> All Second Cauſes, are under the Influence and Government of the Firſt Cauſe. God <hi>hears</hi> the <hi>Heavens,</hi> they <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> that ſo <hi>Corn, Wine, Oyl</hi> may be produced for God's People, <hi>Hoſ</hi> 2.22, 23. All <hi>Moral Agents</hi> whether good or bad, are under the Government of the Firſt Supream Cauſe, even God: he can make them Inſtrumental (if he will) of conveying benefits. God made <hi>his People</hi> to be <hi>pitied,</hi> even of their wicked <hi>Enemies who carried them Captive,</hi> Pſal. 106.46. The <hi>barbarous</hi> People of <hi>Malta,</hi> ſhewed

Sometimes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good comes to particular Perſons, yea to an whole People, in anſwer to the Prayers of ſome godly ones. The Prayers of the Righteous avail much. But 'tis of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Grace that God helps ſuch to <hi>Pray,</hi> that by his Promiſes he has incourag'd ſuch to <hi>Pray,</hi> and that he gives an Anſwer to their Prayers. So that all Benefits are as really, truly and originally from God; as if no Means or Inſtruments were made uſe of to convey them. Means could never be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of any good to us, if God did not make them ſo. Whoever Plants or Waters, none but God can give the Increaſe. Would not Men be more thankful to God for every Meals Meat (as well as for other benefits) if they ſaw <hi>Gods Hand</hi> as viſibly reaching it to them; as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſaw the <hi>Hand</hi> when it <hi>wrote on the Wall?</hi> And yet every Benefit really comes from God, whatever are the Means or Inſtruments of conveying it; nay 'tis of his meer undeſerved bounty, that he does Honour any Means with the Service or Inſtrumentality of conveying any of his Benefits. So 'tis of Gods Soveraign bounty.</p>

'Tis the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, the Fountain of all Good, that often beſtows on Unregenerate Men, thoſe common gifts and reſtraints of Grace; which frequently prove conducive to many outward temporary Benefits, both to themſelves and others. But further, 'tis moſt free and ſoveraign, as well as moſt powerful Grace, that enables any heartily to receive Chriſt as offered in the Goſpel, and to walk in him till they come to Glory. It's God's Prerogative to take away the Heart of Stone and give an Heart of Fleſh: to create a new Heart and a right Spirit in any. <hi>Of his own will be begets</hi> them by his Word of Truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. He calls them <hi>according to his purpoſe,</hi> (Rom. 8.28.) for no Man can come to Chriſt, except the Father draws him, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.44. It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy. As the Wind blows where it will, without Mans appointing or power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit. And as 'tis of Gods Soveraign Grace, that he firſt works a ſaving change in the Soul; ſo 'tis, that he carries on the work when thus begun. <hi>He works both to will and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that 'tis indeed moſt free, ſoveraign Grace, that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Perſons to do thoſe things, that have a firm connexion with Eternal Happineſs. This Grace is moſt free, and undeſerved by thoſethat receive it: for tho' tis purchas'd, dearly bought and paid for by Jeſus Chriſt for them; yet 'twas of free Grace that God appointed this Method for purchaſing it, and that thereupon he does beſtow it.

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>That God makes the Afflictions of the Saints, Inſtrumental of great advantage to them.</hi> God has promis'd, <hi>That all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their good,</hi> Rom. 8.28.

Bounty and Goodneſs, that he beſtows on the Children of Men, all the benefits or good things they at any time receive.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>USE</hi> of theſe things may be in the following Inferences, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We ought to contemplate on and admire at, the free ſoveraign bounty of God.</hi> There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more noble Subject of our moſt frequent and ſerious Contemplation. When here and there a few among Mortals, exceed their Neighbours in Ability, Vertue, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Uſefulneſs; they're often much ſpoken of and commended by thoſe, whoſe good Opinion is of any worth; I ſay, 'tis often tho' not always thus. But all the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Goodneſs in any Creatures, is not ſo much compar'd to the Goodneſs manifeſted by God; as the glittering of a glow-worm, compar'd to the diffuſive extenſive Light of the Sun. Surely our Souls ſhould ſtand, look, gaze and wonder at the free extenſive, tho' Incomprehenſible Goodneſs of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jehovah. Who can tell the Number, or the ten thouſandth part, of thoſe Benefits which he freely beſtows? Surely, no Mans Arithmetick can reach to this. His won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of Goodneſs can't be reckon'd up in order, they're more than can be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.5. But tho' we can't mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the heigth or depth, length or breadth of thoſe ſtreams iſſuing from Soveraign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs, and to the moſt unworthy too; yet we ſhould greatly contemplate on
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001936_0126_0FBA31DC344E4A10"/>
them, and admire the Immenſe Fountain and Original from whence they flow. This work, the bright Spirits above imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in; the more we abound in it the more we ſhall be like them, and the fitter for their Company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We ſhould never murmur, though poſſibly we may want ſome Comforts which we are deſirous of.</hi> God is the Author, yea, the free, ſovereign Giver of all Benefits; And do we indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any good thing at his hand? No truly, we are ſo far from that, that by our Sins we juſtly deſerve his <hi>inſupportable Wrath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> When Afflictions are moſt and heavieſt upon us, even then 'tis much better with us than we deſerve. When God takes away our Health, our Eaſe, our deareſt Friends and Relatives, or any other Comforts; he does but recall what he freely lent us <hi>during his Pleaſure,</hi> ſo he can do us no wrong herein; and therefore we never have any cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine or murmur. Nay, we are ſo far from having any real cauſe of Murmuring, that when we meet with the moſt grievous Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyings and Loſſes, there are yet freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to us, ſo many and great Benefits, as loudly call for our <hi>Praiſing and Adoring</hi> the ſovereign Author of them. <hi>It is of the Lords Mercy we are not conſumed.</hi> Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We ſhould be conſtantly Thankful to God, for the diffuſive Streams of his free Bounty to us.</hi> We can't reckon up the Number or deſcribe the Greatneſs of theſe Benefits, God freely
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001936_0127_0FBA31DDCB4B6F08"/>
beſtows on each of us every Day. Every Breath we draw, is a renew'd Inſtance of his amazing Power, Patience, and undeſerved Goodneſs. If it be not our own Fault, we may daily truſt in God for, and delight our ſelves with the Thoughts of, thoſe matchleſs, endleſs Joys, which his faithful Promiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures to thoſe that rightly ſeek after them. Then ſure I am, we ſhould be daily and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Thankful to that God, who thus freely ſhowers down his Benefits on the Unworthy. <hi>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.18. <hi>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> Eph. 5.20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, &amp; all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, bleſs his holy name: Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits,</hi> Pſal. 103.1, 2. What can be more Vile, Criminal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably Sordid, than for ſuch as we are, to be unthankful to that God, who freely and conſtantly beſtows great and numberleſs Benefits on us!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>We ſhould never envy to others the good Things they enjoy.</hi> Whence come thoſe good Thing? Why from God the Fountain of all good, and he may ſurely do what he will with his own. He is the ſovereign Potter, Creatures are the Clay; he may faſhion this or that Lump into what Figure he pleaſeth, and can be accountable to none for doing ſo. If others have more Health, Eaſe, Honour, Power, Wealth, greater inward Gifts and Abilities or Endowments, more deſirable
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001936_0128_0FBA31DF09440E18"/>
Friends and Relatives, greater Meaſures of Sanctifying Grace and Divine Conſolations than we have; yet we ſhould <hi>by no means Grudge or Envy them.</hi> Our Eye ſhould not be evil becauſe God is good. The loweſt Shrub ſhould not envy the talleſt Cedar; nor the ſmalleſt Stars thoſe of the firſt Magnitude, for all the Stars have that Meaſure of Light, and keep the Orb and Sphere their wiſe, bountiful Maker aſſign'd them. Men in the loweſt Form ſhould not envy thoſe, whom their <hi>ſovereign Maker and Benefactor</hi> makes Superior to them, in one regard or other. Thoſe who receive feweſt Talents, have unſpeakable cauſe of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> but none of <hi>Envy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Thoſe who excel others, ſhould never be Proud of it.</hi> Who maketh thee to differ? If we have <hi>more Health, Wealth, Honour, Power</hi> than others; yet here's no juſt Foundation for Self-conceit. Sovereign Divine Bounty <hi>makes the Difference.</hi> God might have made us the loweſt &amp; meaneſt, and thoſe who now are <hi>ſo,</hi> he might have advanced much higher than we are; and yet done us <hi>not the leaſt Wrong</hi> therein. If we have <hi>greater Natural Abilities</hi> than others, God freely gave them, without any Means of our uſing. In this Caſe, there is no Reaſon for the <hi>Inferior</hi> to be deſpiſed, nor the <hi>Superior</hi> to be Self-conceited. If we have <hi>greater Acquir'd Endowments of Mind</hi> than others, yet God freely gave <hi>Opportunity</hi> for Endeavours to get them, and he alſo gave Succeſs to ſuch Endeavours; ſo that ſtill here's no cauſe for <hi>Pride,</hi> though much for
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001936_0129_0FBA31E51FC4DFA0"/>
Thankfulneſs. Nay, If we are ſincerely Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Godly, and have done much <hi>greater Service,</hi> and many more good Deeds than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet here's nothing to be <hi>Proud</hi> of. God freely gave the Opportunities for doing good, Qualifications for it, Inclinations to it, Aſſiſtances in it, and all the Succeſs that did attend our Endeavours. Indeed in a ſtrict Senſe, the more Holy any are, the more they do for God; ſo much the more they are Indebted to him. Though by his <hi>free and gracious Promiſes,</hi> he has oblig'd himſelf to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their <hi>ſincere Performances,</hi> yet 'tis of his ſovereign Goodneſs that he has <hi>given</hi> theſe Encouragements, that he has given them <hi>Hearts</hi> to take and improve the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to abound in doing what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. As we love God, becauſe he firſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us; ſo if we do more for God than others, 'tis becauſe he firſt did more for us, <hi>working in us to will and to do of his own good pleaſure</hi>: For without him we could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If we have ſincerely Serv'd God in any Matter, we may juſtly ſay as <hi>David</hi> in that Caſe of contributing towards building the Temple: 1 Chron. 29.14. <hi>Who am I, and what is my People, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort? For all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi> That God ſhould by his <hi>gracious Promiſes</hi> give Encouragement to Duty, give Opportunity, Inclination, Aſſiſtance to <hi>do</hi> Duty, and after all give a <hi>gracious Reward</hi> too (as he will in the other World) here's Grace upon Grace indeed: Grace from the Foundation to the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001936_0130_0FBA31E74885BF58"/>
Top-ſtone. And ſince 'tis ſuch ſovereign Grace, ſurely thoſe favour'd with it, have no cauſe for Pride, Boaſting or Self-conceit; though unſpeakable cauſe for the moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gratitude.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Though we are never ſo unworthy in our ſelves, yet we ſhould truſt in God for the beſt of Bleſſings and Benefits.</hi> It is of Gods own Heart, of his free, ſovereign Bounty, that he beſtows on Men all the Benefits they ever receive; and ſince he gives ſo freely, our <hi>Unworthineſs</hi> ſhould not diſcourage us from ſeeking to him, and truſting in him for the beſt of Bleſſings which we need. Indeed God does, and ever will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maintain his own <hi>ſovereign Lordſhip and Dominion over his Creatures,</hi> and will give forth his own Favours in his own Way; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not expect Pardon of Sin, Peace with God, a Title to future Happineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we heartily Repent of Sin, hate and turn from it, and receive Chriſt as Prince and Saviour. 'Tis <hi>grand Preſumption</hi> for any to expect Peace with God, and Happineſs in his Favour, and yet continue loving and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing known Wickedneſs, known Rebellion againſt him. Yet on the other hand, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our <hi>many and great Tranſgreſſions,</hi> by which we are moſt unworthy, undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Gods Favour; yet if we heartily Repent of our Sins, and rely on Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as offered through Chriſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we ſhall then be freely Welcome to it. If we thus do, <hi>our unworthineſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favour,</hi> ſhall be no Bar to our obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001936_0131_0FBA31E8CEB58890"/>
it. For Gods Offers of ſaving Mercy, are moſt free, gracious, ſovereign; and his Promiſes which contain them are infallibly true. Therefore, together with utmoſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sins, we ſhould all of us be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd ſpeedily, fully, firmly to truſt in the Sovereign Grace of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, for all that Pardon, Grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which we need. God is ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Fountain of Good, and ſo delights in Mercy; that we can't poſſibly pleaſe him more, than by thus <hi>truſting</hi> in him for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed benefits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy, Abraham</hi> was <hi>ſtrong in Faith giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4.20. His <hi>Strong Faith,</hi> hope and truſt in the Divine promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, did pleaſe and <hi>glorify God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>We ſhould freely and readily do as much Good as ever we can.</hi> The more we do ſo, ſo much the more like we are to God. Chriſtians are bidden to be <hi>Followers</hi> (it ſignifies, <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators) of God as dear Children,</hi> Eph. 5.1. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, they ſhould endeavour to be as diffuſive and extenſive as ever they can in <hi>doing of Good.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus ſaid, Luk. 6.36. <hi>Be ye therefore merciful as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo is merciful.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus <hi>went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing good,</hi> Act. 10.38. And we ſhould <hi>walk as he alſo walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. We ſhould be as <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>forgive</hi> thoſe that have wrong'd us, as we are <hi>deſirous</hi> that God ſhould <hi>forgive</hi> us. <hi>Forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.32.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:001936_0132_0FBA31EA48537070"/>
Yea, <hi>as we have opportunity we ſhould do good to all men, eſpecially to thoſe of the houſhold of Faith,</hi> Gal. 6.10.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Thoſe muſt needs be happy, who have God for their God and Portion.</hi> This is the caſe, of all ſincere Believers in Chriſt Jeſus. They have the Unchangeable, Inexhauſtable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Good for their Portion; there is in God, infinitely more than enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all their wants, and that to all Eternity. Nor is this Good God more able than he is willing, to beſtow matchleſs endleſs Felicity, on all his ſincere Saints. Therefore we may well conclude with that, Pſal. 146.5. <hi>Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help; and whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt Anſwer to this Queſtion, is <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; it does not mean that they ſhould or can, purchaſe, merit or deſerve any part of their Salvation. Sinners have merited Damnation, by breaking Gods Law; but
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:001936_0136_0FBA31F5B670D038"/>
they cannot merit Salvation, by any or by all their doings and ſufferings. Indeed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt has merited Salvation, for all thoſe who ſhall obtain it; yet thoſe who receive it, do not deſerve it. 'Tis Gods free Gift to them, Luk, 12.32. <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom. The Gift of God is Eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 6.23. This Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is purchaſed <hi>for,</hi> but not <hi>by,</hi> thoſe who obtain it. As it comes from God, from Chriſt to them, 'tis a <hi>Gift,</hi> 'tis the fruit of meer, free, ſovereign Love, Grace and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. There are ſome Qualifications neceſſary to be found in Perſons, in order to their compleat Salvation; as Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Holineſs, without theſe no Man ſhall ſee the Lord. Yet theſe Inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, do not merit or deſerve Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they are rather <hi>parts</hi> of the Sinners Salvation, and preparatory to the perfection of it. And even theſe qualifications, are alſo the <hi>Gifts</hi> of God. So is <hi>Repentance</hi> (Act. 5.31.) and <hi>Faith,</hi> (Eph. 2.8.) it is of Chriſts fulneſs, that Perſons receive Grace for Grace. He is the Spring and Fountain of their Grace and Holineſs: he works in them both to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure. So that the Sinner's perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Salvation, is Gods Gift; all thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in the Soul which are neceſſary hereunto, are alſo Gods Gifts: therefore the Sinner cannot purchaſe, merit or deſerve Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This is the <hi>Negative</hi> Anſwer.</p>

                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:001936_0137_0FBA31F7A2391008"/>The Second Anſwer is <hi>Affirmative,</hi> A Chriſtians <hi>working out his own Salvation,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>his walking in thoſe ways, doing thoſe things which lead infallibly to Eternal Salvation.</hi> When a Perſon lives in the Exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of Faith in Chriſt, and yields ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience to the Goſpel; he may then be ſaid to work out his own Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he takes the only courſe, walks in the only way that leads to Salvation. For thoſe who <hi>obey not the Goſpel,</hi> ſhall not be Saved, but <hi>be puniſhed with Everlasting Deſtruction,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.9. 'Tis not enough for Men to ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord</hi>; but they muſt <hi>do the will of God,</hi> elſe they ſhall not enter into the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. In ſhort and in general, a Perſon may be ſaid to work out his own Salvation, when he lives as the Goſpel directs, when he does what Gods Word requires of him. But then, this <hi>Obedience</hi> muſt have theſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, it muſt be <hi>Sincere, Univerſal, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It muſt be Sincere.</hi> There's no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Faith in Chriſt. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark. 16.16. Now <hi>true Faith,</hi> it <hi>purifies the Heart</hi> (Acts 15.9.) and <hi>works by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. It ſhows it ſelf in Works of Obedience. <hi>By Faith Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham — obeyed,</hi> Heb. 11.8. <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> Jam. 2.26. Yea, true Faith puts the Perſon upon yielding <hi>ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to God: He not only does the Things which God commands, but he does them <hi>becauſe God commands them,</hi> out of Love to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:001936_0138_0FBA31F8B3250480"/>
God, with a deſire to <hi>Pleaſe and Glorify him.</hi> The Hypocrite does many Things for the Matter of them, which God commands; yet his doing them can ſcarce be call'd <hi>Obedience,</hi> becauſe he is not heartily mov'd thereto by Gods <hi>Authority,</hi> and with a deſign to pleaſe him; but rather with a deſign that he himſelf may be applauded by Men. Thus all things which the Phariſees did, they did <hi>to be ſeen of Men,</hi> Mat. 23.5. But the true Saint acting as ſuch, is mov'd from a <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Obedience to God,</hi> aiming at his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He deſires to <hi>glorify God with Body and Spirit; whether he eats, drinks, or whatever he does,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. &amp; 10.31. He deſires that <hi>Christ may be magnified in his Body, whether it be by Life or Death,</hi> Phil. 1.20. Perfect, ſinleſs Obedience, the Saints cannot arrive to in this World; but ſincere Obedience they may and do arrive at.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It muſt be Univerſal.</hi> Hypocrites will pick and chuſe among Gods Precepts; they'll do the external, material Part of what's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by ſome of them, but they wholly diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard others. But the true Believer in a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temper, has Conſcientious Regard to all Gods Commandements. <hi>David</hi> had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them all,</hi> and ſaid to God, <hi>I eſteem all by Precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119.6.128. Our Lord Jeſus deſcribes his Diſciples, his Friends that are Journeying in their Way to Salvation: Joh. 15.14. <hi>Then are ye my Friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> Chriſt's

                  <p>Here alſo, the <hi>firſt Anſwer</hi> muſt be <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> It does not mean that they ſhould nouriſh in themſelves a Principle of <hi>ſlaviſh Fear.</hi> It does not mean that they ſhould give way to overwhelming Melancholly, to ſinking Doubts, Fears, Diſpondencies; that

I ſay, it does not mean that they ſhould thus live. For <hi>the ways of Wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. And Chriſtians are Required to lead Lives of Gladneſs, Joyfulneſs and Thankſgiving. They ſhould <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God,</hi> Phil. 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always; and again I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould lead gladſome, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, chearful Lives.</p>

The Precept is much of the ſame Import with thoſe, Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Heb. 12.15. <hi>Looking diligently, leſt any Man fail of the Grace of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Work out your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> 'tis as if he had ſaid,</p>

See to it, that your Hearts are right with God, ſtedfaſt in his Covenant; and that your Converſation be anſwerable. You have many Enemies that would obſtruct your Salvation, and hinder you from walking in the way that leads to it; therefore have your Eyes open, be on your Watch and Guard, that you may ſee your dangers and eſcape them, and ſee your Enemies and conquer them. Walk circumſpectly, not as Fools but as Wiſe redeeming the time. Be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of your ſelves, be cautious and watchful, leſt you indulge any Sin, leſt you provoke God.

                  <p>This ſeems to be the plain import of that <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> with which Chriſtians ſhould work out their Salvation. They can't be too Careful, Cautious, Prayerful, Watchful, Diligent that they may get ſafe to Heaven at laſt. Therefore we proceed to,</p>

Many are but almoſt, not altogether, perſwaded to be Chriſtians, ſuch will ſurely periſh if they continue ſo. Many make an open full Profeſſion of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet periſh at laſt. When God brought Iſrael out of Egypt, and propos'd his Law and Covenant to them; what ſaid they to it? Why they readily promiſed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſaying, <hi>All that the Lard hath ſaid, will we do, and be obedient. All the People anſwered with one voice and ſaid, all the words which the Lord hath ſaid will we do,</hi> Exod, 24.3, 7. We cannot deſire Men to ſay more than this. Who could bid fairer for the Earthly Canaan, or the Heavenly one either, by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, than theſe did? Yet after this fair ſhow, Multitudes of them periſhed by their Wickedneſs, their Unbelief and Diſobedience. <hi>They could not enter in becauſe of unbelief,</hi> Heb. 3.19. The <hi>Stony ground hearers,</hi> they imbraced the Goſpel, yea they did it <hi>with Joy</hi> too; they made a fair ſhow of Religion, yet they had <hi>no Root in themſelves</hi>; the hot Sun of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> withered and deſtroyed the fair ſhows they had made, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>chap. Judas</hi> was one of our Lords Twelve Diſciples, and for ought we know, was in general blameleſs in his outward behaviour, 'till he diſcovered himſelf to be the Son of Perdition by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord of Glory. Some have Preached

and Prophecied in Chriſts Name, and in his Name have caſt out Devils, and done many wonderful works; and yet were Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical in all, and ſhall at laſt be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the workers of Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. And does not conſtant Experience ſhow, that many (who to Mans Judgment) made a good beginning, were Sober, Vertuous, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; have afterwards fallen into ſcandalous courſes of wickedneſs, and lived and dyed in them? Many (to the eye of Men) have bid fair for Heaven, and yet turned into Hell at laſt. Therefore O Chriſtian, <hi>Fear and Tremble,</hi> uſe utmoſt care and diligence leſt thou prove ſuch an one. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was careful and watchful, leſt after he had Preached to others; he himſelf ſhould prove a <hi>Caſt-away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. Surely there ſhould be as great care in us. How woful, doleful, dreadful would it be; if after we have made fair ſhows of Religion, and fed our ſelves with hopes of Heaven a great while, we ſhould be tumbled down into the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell? Doubtleſs there are many now in Hell, who for a while made as fair a ſhow for Heaven as to outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as any of us do. This ſhould make us look about our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Many of Gods ſincere Children, have thro' Unwatchfulneſs fallen into great Sins.</hi> When they have been off their Watch and Guard, their Spiritual Enemies (Temptations and Corruptions) have given them very ſore Falls. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Righteous Soul was vexed with the <hi>filthy

Converſation</hi> of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8.

After this, Holy <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Meekeſt</hi> Man in the World, <hi>ſpake unadviſedly with his Lips,</hi> provoked God, and excluded himſelf from entering into the <hi>earthly Canaan.

Surely we ſhould look on them as <hi>awful, ſolemn Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to us: They are written for our Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, <hi>that he who thinketh he ſtandeth, may take heed lest he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11, 12. Have ſuch eminent Saints, after long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Grace, after many <hi>particular Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over their Spiritual Enemies,</hi> and after having done <hi>eminent Services for God</hi>; yet fallen into ſuch Sins as the Scripture aſſures us they have? Then what will become of us? Are we ſure, that we ſhall never fall as they have done? No, we are not ſure of any ſuch thing. If we do know that we are ſincere Believers, then we may know that we ſhall not finally fall away; but ſhall be

But we dont certainly know, that we ſhall be kept from ſore falls, even into ſcandalous Sins. Therefore the falls of the Godly, ſhould greatly quicken us to be very careful, watchful, diligent in walking in the way that leads to Salvation. The falls, wounds, groans of others; ſhould be as a continual Alarm in our Ears, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us continually on our watch and guard.</p>

O Man, if thou art a true Saint, and in a right Temper; then ſurely nothing will be ſo dear to thee, as the Glory and Honour of God, of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Chriſt has lov'd thee, given himſelf

Canſt thou wound his Name and Intereſt? How canſt thou bear the Thoughts of this? Well, if thou wouldſt not diſpleaſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour thy tender hearted, heavenly Father, thy precious and dear Redeemer; then be not ſlothful, but moſt careful and diligent in working out thine own Salvation. Again, if thou ſhouldſt be careleſs, and fall into great Sins, this would greatly grieve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God; the contrary whereto is expreſly commanded; Eph. 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit, whereby you are ſealed to the Day of Redemption.</hi> O Believer in Chriſt, wouldſt thou not grieve that Holy Spirit, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd thy dark Mind, ſoften'd thy hard Heart, made thee a new Creature and a Child of God?

is a great aggravation of Sin, and ſhould be <hi>remembred</hi> by Chriſtians as ſuch. Eccl. 5.4. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleaſure in fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſtians ſhould remember that their Sins have been committed againſt much knowledge, and that's a great aggravation of them.</hi> He that knows his Maſters Will and does it not, ſhall be beaten with <hi>many ſtripes</hi>; when he that falls ſhort thro' <hi>Ignorance,</hi> ſhall eſcape with <hi>few,</hi> Luk. 12.47, 48. Tho' all Chriſtians are not equal in knowledge, ſome know more than others, ſome are Babes and ſome grown Men; and tho' ſuch as know moſt, yet <hi>know but in part,</hi> (1 Cor. 13.9) are ſhort ſighted in the things of God; hence <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors; Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults,</hi> Pſal. 19.12. The wiſeſt and moſt knowing Chriſtians, are guilty of ſins of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance every day; I ſay, tho' things are thus, yet, <hi>as God ſhewed his word to Jacob, his ſtatutes and judgments to Iſrael, and dealt not ſo with every Nation,</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 20. So he gives to all Chriſtians generally, eſpecially where the Reformation moſt prevails; greater means of light and knowledge than he does to other Nations. As for thoſe who are well acquainted with the Bible, to be ſure their knowledge in the main ſubſtantial parts of Chriſtianity, in the main of their duty, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Chriſt, and towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

muſt needs be ſo great, that their Sins, groſs Sins eſpecially, cannot but be much aggravated by being againſt knowledge. Nay poſſibly Chriſtians ſometimes ſin, not only in general againſt knowledge, but alſo againſt the particular ſtrivings of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the Motions of Gods Spirit in them: This is ſtill a <hi>greater</hi> aggravation of ſin, and yet how often have we been thus guilty? If we ſearch diligently into our paſt Lives, it may be we may all find that we have been frequently thus guilty. Did we never find ſtrivings between Luſt and Grace in our own Souls, and at laſt yield to our Luſts, to the grieving the Holy Spirit of God? We ſhould ſurely remember ſuch grievous aggravations of ſin as theſe are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Its a great aggravation of Sin, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God after the beſtowment of many, great and ſingular Mercies.</hi> This Aggravation ſeems to be implied in our Text, thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokedſt the Lord thy God to wrath <hi>in the Wilderneſs.</hi> As if he had ſaid to them,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>God brought thee out of cruel Egyptian Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Bondage, with an high and mighty hand; he deſtroyed thine enemies in the red Sea, thro' which thou didſt ſafely paſs; he brought thee into the Wilderneſs, there took care of thee, gave thee Water out of the Rock, fed thee daily with Manna, Bread from Heaven; he did many, great and wonderful things for thee. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested much ſparing Goodneſs and Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, he reſtrain'd and bridled in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:001936_0164_0FBA323281AE9678"/>
when it was juſt ready to deſtroy thee; thus he dealt with thee in the Wilderneſs, yet then and there thou provokedſt him to wrath, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ſingular diſcoveries of his Goodneſs to thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when <hi>Nathan</hi> comes to ſet forth the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s Sin, his <hi>Adultery and Murder,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, I anointed thee King over Iſrael, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thee out of the hand of Saul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight</hi>? 2 Sam. 12.7, 9. The <hi>Mercies</hi> as well as <hi>Commands</hi> of God, ſhould bind us to his Service. Its a <hi>great Aggravation of Sin,</hi> that 'tis committed againſt a God that has beſtow'd <hi>many and great Mercys</hi> on us. And in this Regard, none of us can Sin but with <hi>great Aggravation. The wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. And we are all Sinners, ſo by Nature, were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Iniquity and conceiv'd in Sin; and therefore deſerv'd Hell even before we were born. Therefore <hi>we are leſs than the least of Gods Mercies,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>It is of the Lords Mercy we are not conſumed,</hi> Lam. 3.22. Yet God has ſpared us hitherto; he has kept us out of Hell, which is better than we deſerve. But beſides the continuation of our Lives, keeping us out of Hell, yea lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us room to hope for Heaven; I ſay, beſides all theſe things, poſſibly all of us at one time or other have had very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and ſingular Deliverances, <hi>from hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Sickneſs,</hi> or <hi>from ſome eminent Dangers</hi>:
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:001936_0165_0FBA3233EADFDC50"/>
It may be ſome <hi>peculiar Mercies</hi> at one time or other, have been beſtow'd upon us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our <hi>own Perſons,</hi> or in our <hi>dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives.</hi> Now all ſuch ſingular Favours, are ſingular Ties, Bonds and Obligations to ſerve God; and ſo they heighten the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of Sins committed againſt that God, who has beſtow'd ſuch ſingular Favours. But thoſe of us who are Chriſtians indeed, the Workmanſhip of God, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works; the Spiritual Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies beſtow'd on us, are unſpeakably great. God has given us a new Nature, united us to his Son, juſtified our Perſons, in part ſanctified our Souls, made us Heirs of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, if we are indeed true Believers, the Spiritual Benefits beſtow'd on us are ſo many, ſo great, bought with ſuch an invaluable Price, beſtow'd in ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Manner, as that Eternity won't be too long a Space, wherein to admire and adore Divine Grace for them. Surely then, if willingly and knowingly we commit any one Sin againſt God, after the Beſtowment of ſuch invaluable Mercies, 'twill be an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated Crime indeed. As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, Neh. 6.11. <hi>Should ſuch a Man as I flee</hi>? No ſure, 'twould be a great Shame. So all true Chriſtians might ſay, Shall ſuch as we are Sin againſt God? What, ſuch as we are, who have received numberleſs and matchleſs Benefits from God; ſhall ſuch as we Sin againſt him? No ſure, for this would be unſpeakably Diſobedient, Ungrateful, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly Sordid and Abominable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="unknown:001936_0166_0FBA323789621598"/>Thus in General, Chriſtians ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Sins as <hi>against God</hi>; as <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aggravated</hi> in being againſt their <hi>Covenant God, against much Light,</hi> and <hi>after the Beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many Mercies.</hi> And beſides this in General,</p>
               <p>They ſhould endeavour Particularly to remember the more Particular Out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Sin, which they have been charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with. In this Chapter, <hi>Moſes</hi> puts the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> In mind of their more particular Tranſgreſſions, at <hi>Horeb,</hi> at <hi>Tabera,</hi> at <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Kibroth-hattaavah,</hi> v. 8, 22. <hi>Moſes</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remembers, his own <hi>ſpeaking unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Lips. David</hi> remembers his <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murder</hi>; his Sin was <hi>ever before him. Paul</hi> remembers what a <hi>bitter, cruel Perſecutor</hi> he had been, and often mentions it with Self-condemning for it. If we have not been guilty of the moſt daring groſs and open Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, of ſcandalous <hi>Inceſt</hi> like <hi>Lot,</hi> or <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs</hi> like <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Adultery &amp; Murder</hi> like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; yet poſſibly at one time or other we have been ſhamefully <hi>Diſobedient to our Parents</hi> or other Superiors, or have <hi>ſpoken Falſely,</hi> have <hi>broken ſome juſt and lawful Promiſe,</hi> ſpoken <hi>very Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately</hi> (without Grounds) to, or of others; or have manifeſted ſome <hi>baſe Revenge</hi>; or been <hi>groſly Dull and Stupid in the Frame of our Hearts towards God.</hi> Without Doubt, all of us upon ſtrict Search, may find <hi>many remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable particular Sins,</hi> which our Conſciences cannot but ſeverely condemn and check us

for. It may be ſome of us that now are new Creatures, did a long time vigorouſly and perverſely oppoſe the free Offers of Chriſt, and Motions of the Spirit of God in our Souls, before we heartily ſubmitted to Chriſt as Prophet, Prieſt and King. Oh how Vile was ſuch our withſtanding the Calls of the Goſpel, the Motions of the good Spirit of God! Surely, ſuch our Sins ſhould be particularly remembred by us. God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to <hi>forget the Sins of his Children,</hi> true Believers; that is, as to the Guilt of them, he Pardons them. True Believers ſhall as certainly eſcape <hi>Eternal Condemnation and Miſery,</hi> as if God had <hi>really forgotten they were Sinners</hi> (tho' this he can never do) or as if they had <hi>never Sinned.</hi> But tho' God does in this Senſe <hi>forget our Sins,</hi> yet we in a true and proper Senſe, ſhould not <hi>forget</hi> but <hi>remember</hi> them. Nay, we ſhould in general, remember the Infirmities, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, Short-comings attending our beſt Duties, thoſe performed with the <hi>greatest Sincerity and Fervency.</hi> When we have done our beſt we are but <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> Luk. 17.10. <hi>There is not a just Man upon Earth, that doth good and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccl. 7.20. When juſt Men do Good, perform Duty ſincerely; yet there's Sin mix'd with, and cleaving to their Performances; none of them are exactly Perfect. This alſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould keep in Remembrance.</p>

                  <hi>QUESTION.</hi> What's the Uſe Chriſtians ſhould make, of the Remembrance of their paſt Sins? <hi>Or,</hi> What are the Duties it ſhould ſtir them up unto?</head>
               <p>For Anſwer,</p>
               <p>There are many Duties it ſhould ſtir them up unto; ſome may be now particularly mention'd. The Remembrance of their paſt Sins,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Should make them very Humble and ſelf-abaſed.</hi> Ezek. 36.31, 32. <hi>Then ſhall ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your Iniquities and for your Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. — Be aſhamed and confounded for your own ways, O Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Great ſhame, confuſion of face, ſelf-judging, ſelf-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelf-loathing, ſelf-abaſing and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, very well becames us, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our Sins. Might we not well ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ah vile Worm; Ah ungrateful Wretch that I am; that I ſhould forget my Maker, provoke my Preſerver, rudely affront my only and glorious Benefactor, baſely neglect my Redeemer; that I ſhould ſo wickedly Diſobey my God, who has laid me under numberleſs and ſtrong Obligations, to conſecrate my ſelf wholly, only and continually unto him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="unknown:001936_0169_0FBA323E5E7DFC08"/>Alas, it's utterly impoſſible fully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or deſcribe, that ſelf-emptying, ſelf-loathing frame of Soul for Sin, that always becomes a true Chriſtian. There's no Grace more Ornamental to a Saint, than <hi>Humility</hi>; and nothing tends more directly to bring this into Exerciſe, than the remembrace of our Sins. Can we have high thoughts of our ſelves? Nay, how can we have any other, but low, mean, ſelf-abaſing thoughts; when we conſider how diſingenious, baſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, and diſobedient we have been to our moſt merciful and gracious God? May we not well ſay with him, Pſal. 73.22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> Prov. 30.2. <hi>Surely, I am more brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh than any man, I have not the underſtanding of a man.</hi> Iſai. 6.5. —<hi>Wo is me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips.</hi> A due remembrance, a deep ſenſe of Sin, would make us more humble; indeed more low, mean and baſe in our own minds and thoughts, than could poſſibly be expreſs'd by our words. The Remembrance of paſt Sins,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Should make Chriſtians very thankful for all their Mercies, as free Gifts of God. Moſes</hi> in our Text and Context puts Iſrael in mind of their Sins, that they might not think God beſtow'd <hi>Canaan</hi> on them for the ſake of their own Righteouſneſs, as tho' they had deſerv'd it. Have we Life, Liberty, Health. Strength, Food, Raiment, Friends, Relations, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any Outward Comfort or true Inward
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:001936_0170_0FBA323FCCBA4D00"/>
Peace? Have we all or any of theſe things? Why theſe are all the free Gifts of God, we never deſerv'd the leaſt part of any one of them. We were no ſooner Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than we were <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. We have deſerv'd Death, Hell, Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thouſands of times over by our Sins. It's of the Lords Mercy we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed for our Iniquities: whatſoever we have on this ſide Eternal Burnings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchible Flames, is meer undeſerved Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, its the free Gift of God. And we ſhould really think and eſteem it ſo, if we had but a due remembrance of our Sins. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have by our Sins times without number deſerved Eternal Miſery, and are yet ſurrounded with innumerable Mercies, all of which are the free underſerved Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God; O how thankful ſhould we be? Surely it becomes us to ſay, <hi>What ſhall we render to the Lord for all his Benefits,</hi> for all his underſerved Benefits towards us? There are two ſorts of things which we <hi>cannot number</hi> they are ſo many, and thoſe are, <hi>our Sins</hi> againſt God, and <hi>his Benefits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on us; this is wonderful indeed. Surely we ſhould be deeply <hi>humble</hi> for the former; and as <hi>thankful</hi> for the latter. None are more thankful for their Mercies, than thoſe who are moſt deeply humble and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent at the remembrance of their Sins. Remembrance of paſt Sins,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Should make Chriſtians thankful to God for Reſtraining Grace.</hi> Have we been guilty ſo
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:001936_0171_0FBA3242D8D66DD0"/>
much as any one ſingle time, of diſobeying our Parents or other lawful Superiors, of profaning Gods Holy Name, of groundleſs Quarrelling, of Intemperance, Uncleanneſs, Lying, Paſſionate ſpeaking and reviling? Do we remember that ſo much as at any one ſingle time, we have been guilty of any one of theſe, or any ſuch like Crimes? Then how comes it about, that we have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly lived in them? We have a root of bitterneſs, a ſinful corrupt Nature ſtill dwelling in us, our particular acts of Sin did flow from this corrupt Nature. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c.</hi> Well, how comes it to paſs, that this bitter corrupt Fountain did not always even continually, ſend forth ſuch curſed Streams? How comes it about, that we have not in the whole courſe of our Lives, lived in the moſt flagitious Crimes, and moſt ſcandalous Immoralities; for our corrupt Nature has in it, the root and ſeed of all manner of Abominations? Why 'tis the Grace of God that has kept us from Sinning, and nothing elſe has reſtrain'd us when we had an opportunity of Sinning. I dont mean, true ſanctifying ſaving Grace: many are reſtrain'd from theſe and thoſe out-breakings of Sin, which have no ſaving Grace in them. Well, ſo far as we have been reſtrain'd from Sinning, it is God that has reſtrain'd us. He that kept back <hi>Abimelech</hi> from <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing of Abrahams Wife</hi>; and <hi>David</hi> from <hi>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Blood of Nabal</hi>; has kept us back from all thoſe Sins we have not committed,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:001936_0172_0FBA32475216A938"/>
tho' we had an opportunity of committing them. When we remember how ſhamefully our Corruption has broken forth, we ſhould be thankful for that Grace, which has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd it from breaking forth much more than it has. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> ſaid, Luk. 18.11. <hi>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> Tho' we ſhould not (like this Phariſee) proudly truſt in our ſelves as righteous, if we have been outwardly more blameleſs than others; yet if we can as to matter of fact truly ſay with him. <hi>We have not been ſo wicked as others,</hi> then we ſhould be <hi>humbly thankful for it.</hi> As we ſhould with brokenneſs of Heart and deepeſt ſelf-abaſement of Soul, remember and repent of our paſt Sins; ſo with true thankfulneſs of Heart, we ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the reſtraints of Divine Grace, that have kept us from the more abundant out-breakings of our Corruption. It's matter of great thankfulneſs to God, that we are not all of us Murderers, Adulterers, Blaſphemers; that we are not the moſt abominable Villains that ever liv'd on Gods Earth, for we ſhould have been internally and externally as vile and wicked, as ever we had any poſſible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being, if Grace had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and reſtrained us. I have often thought, it's a great favour, an inſtance of the merciful Divine Protection, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can in the Morning go out about their Affairs, and come ſafe home at Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>broken Bones</hi> or any <hi>diſtreſſing Accidents.</hi> But I have often thought alſo, that it's ſtill
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:001936_0173_0FBA324905A1BA08"/>
a much greater Mercy, when they can thus go out in the Morning and come home at Night; without having committed Adultery, Murder, Theft, or ſome daring and heinous Crime or other, ſince they have continually a corrupt Nature (the ſeed and root of all manner of wickedneſs) in them. When we remember, and moſt heartily abhor and mourn for our paſt Sins; let us alſo be thankful to God, that he has reſtrain'd and kept us back from Sin ſo much as he has done. The Remembrance of paſt Sins,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Should keep Chriſtians from murmuring at their Afflictions.</hi> It's a thing too frequent, even in Gods own Children, to fret, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, repine at afflictive Diſpenſations of Providence. <hi>Jacob</hi> once complained of his Afflictions; ſaying, <hi>All theſe things are againſt me,</hi> Gen. 42.36. The <hi>Church</hi> complained and and ſaid, Lam. 1.12. — <hi>Behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow.</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons brought both <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to <hi>curſe the Day of their Birth.</hi> How commonly will Chriſtians tell of their <hi>Sickneſs, Poverty, Loſſes, Croſſes, Diſappointments,</hi> bitterly complaining of their Trials, ſhowing great Diſcontent and Diſquietneſs of Mind thereat? This is a great Fault; it's a greater Sin than many are aware of, for Perſons to fault and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the ſpotleſs Diſpenſations of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Divine Providence. Well, one thing that occaſions this Diſcontent and Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, the forgetting our own Sins. If we duely remembred our paſt Sins, our multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,

aggravated Crimes; our repeated Tranſgreſſions; were we heartily affected with a Senſe of our daily, unavoidable Infirmities, were we duely ſenſible, that the leaſt of all theſe deſerves Eternal Miſery; I ſay, did we duely remember, conſider, and affect our Hearts with theſe things, we ſhould not then be ſo ready to Murmur and repine at Afflictions as we often are. All the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Sorrows, Difficulties we meet with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Body or Soul, while here in this World; they are but meer <hi>Flea-bites, Shadows, Nothing,</hi> if compar'd to what our Sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Where Sins lye heavy upon the Mind, Affliction lyes the lighter. <hi>Shall a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins</hi>? Lam. 3.39.

Danger from wicked Enemies, v. 1. <hi>O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust, ſave me from all them that perſecute me, and deliver me.</hi> This Verſe intimates both the <hi>Danger</hi> he was in, and the <hi>Method</hi> he took for Relief. As to the latter, namely, his <hi>trusting in God,</hi> he was encouraged to it from the Conſideration of Gods being the Supream Governour of all Things, the Righteous Judge of all Men. He'll ſurely take his Time to appear emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently for the Righteous, and againſt the Wicked. v. 10. <hi>My defence is of God, who ſaveth the upright in Heart.</hi> v. 11. <hi>God judgeth the Righteous</hi> (that is, will appear to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, help and relieve them) <hi>and God is angry with the wicked every day.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows our Text, <hi>If he turn not he will whet his Sword.</hi> That is, if the Wicked does not turn from his wicked Ways, but goes on in his Sin (which is further deſcribed <hi>v.</hi> 14.) then <hi>God will whet his Sword, he hath bent his Bow and made it ready.</hi> Theſe Expreſſions concerning God, repreſent him as an <hi>Enemy, armed, prepared with a Bow bent and Sword ſharpened,</hi> to execute Vengeance on the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, v. 13. <hi>He hath prepared for him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Death.</hi> God had <hi>deadly Vengeance, mortal Vengeance</hi> in Store, for thoſe who won't turn from, and forſake their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ways.

It ſhall certainly be ſo, <hi>for

God himſelf</hi> will <hi>whet his Sword, bend his Bow,</hi> &amp;c. God himſelf will execute Vengeance on the Wicked: Though he often employs Inſtruments in this Work, yet he never puts it intirely out of his own Hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. He'll do it himſelf, and ſee it throughly done. He aſſumes to himſelf this work, of executing Vengeance on the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Deut. 33.35, 41. <hi>To me belongeth Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Recompence. — If I whet my glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sword, and mine hand take hold on Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and I will reward them that hate me.</hi> Thoſe who walk in ways of known Sin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God, are Enemies to God, Haters of him, and he himſelf (if they turn not) will render Vengeance to them. So that their ways of Sin, are to <hi>their own Hurt, Wrong and Damage</hi>: (For God ſays, Prov. 8.36. <hi>He that ſinneth against me, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own ſoul; all they that hate me love death.</hi>) God will bring deadly Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, on them, if they turn not.</p>

puniſh them according to their ways, their deſervings. He will thus puniſh them, partly in this World, but more fully and eternally in the next. As for <hi>ways of Sin,</hi> (if we would know what they are) they <hi>are ways of Diſobedience to God.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever committeth ſin tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law; for ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> Ways of Diſobedience to God, of trangreſſing his Precepts, of breaking his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are ways of Sin; and thoſe who allow themſelves in ſo doing, muſt needs be in <hi>great Danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>great is the Danger</hi> of thoſe who walk on in ways of Sin, will appear if we conſider theſe following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God perfestly and exactly knows all their Wickedneſs.</hi> Perſons may poſſibly keep many of their Crimes ſecret from Men; they often ſtrive to do ſo. Job 24.15. <hi>The Eye alſo of the Adulterer waiteth for the Twilight, ſaying, no Eye ſhall ſee me; and diſguiſeth his Face.</hi> But no Crime can poſſibly be kept ſecret from God; he perfectly and truely knows all the Thoughts, Words, Ways of all the Children of Men: He knows all the ſecret Springs and Motives of their Actions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>their Pretences</hi> are. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> Prov. 15.3. <hi>There is no creature that is not manifest in his ſight; all things are open and naked to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 14.23. God perfectly knows all
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:001936_0184_0FBA325D12166EA0"/>
the Sins of <hi>every Perſon,</hi> the Time when, the Place where they were committed; and all Aggravations and Circumſtances attending them. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him? ſaith the Lord. Do not I fill Heaven and Earth? ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God exactly remembers all their Sins.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ill Actions of Perſons are much talk'd of when newly committed, but in a while there's a great ſilence about them, they're much forgotten. Nay, Perſons frequently forget many of their own Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bad as well as good. But God perfectly and exactly remembers all the Sins of all Perſons. Indeed when he Pardons the Sins of true Penitents, he is ſaid <hi>not to remember them any more,</hi> Jer. 31.34. This ſignifies, that he'll never inflict the puniſhment deſerv'd by their Sins. But Gods Knowledge being Infinite and Perfect, in ſtrict and proper ſpeaking, he cannot really forget or let ſlip out of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory or Knowledge, any thing that ever he has known. Therefore as he perfectly <hi>knows</hi> all the Sins of the wicked; ſo he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and exactly <hi>remembers</hi> them all, and that <hi>continually. Job</hi> ſaid to God, Job 14.16, 17. <hi>For now thou numbreſt my ſteps, doſt thou not watch over my Sin? My tranſgreſſion is ſealed up in a bag, and thou ſoweſt up mine iniquity.</hi> God ſays concerning the wickedneſs of his People, Deut. 32.34. <hi>Is not this laid up in ſtore with me, and ſealed up among my treaſures?</hi> Men often ſtore and treaſure up things in
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:001936_0185_0FBA325E88DCB8F8"/>
                  <hi>Bags,</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> them; that they may <hi>keep them ſafely</hi> and have <hi>them forth coming</hi> upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: in alluſion hereto, God is ſaid to <hi>Seal up the Sins of the wicked.</hi> It notes his full, exact knowledge and remembrance of them. Oh Sinner, God remembers all thy paſt tranſgreſſions, every one of them, with all their aggravations; all the vanities and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of thy <hi>Childhood, Youth</hi> and <hi>Riper Age.</hi> It may be many Years ago, thou haſt been guilty of <hi>Drunken Bouts, Unclean Practices,</hi> of vile <hi>Curſing and Swearing,</hi> of <hi>Profaning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> of <hi>Cheating Tricks,</hi> of <hi>mad abominable Frolicks, &amp;c.</hi> Well, God exactly remembers all theſe, whether thou doſt or no: they're as freſh and plain in God's View and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as if committed <hi>but this very Moment</hi>; and if thou haſt not heartily repented, then the guilt of theſe and all other thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, remains in full force upon thee. Hence Sinners are ſaid, <hi>to treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of Gods righteous judgment,</hi> Rom. 2.5. As they add Sin to Sin, ſo they <hi>treaſure up</hi> yet greater and greater <hi>meaſures of Wrath</hi> and Vengeance; which ſhall ſurely be poured out upon them, if Repentance prevent not. <hi>Time,</hi> may poſſibly wear out thy remembrance of thy Sins, but it can never wear out God's remembrance of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God hates all Sin.</hi> He is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold evil: he cannot look upon ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. This alludes to the practice of Men, when they <hi>ſhut their Eyes</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:001936_0186_0FBA32625CA0B470"/>
or <hi>turn away their Faces,</hi> as not being able to bear or endure the ſight of theſe or thoſe Objects, which are loathſom, hateful and abominable to them. Men can't endure to ſee theſe or thoſe things, which they hate and loath. So, God is ſaid to be of ſuch holy and pure Eyes, that he can't bear the ſight of Sin. The Expreſſion notes, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable hatred, loathing and abhorrence of it. He declares, that 'tis <hi>the abominable thing which he hates,</hi> Jer. 44.4. No Objects we can think of, can be ſo hateful and loathſome to us, as all Sin is to God. Nothing can be ſo diſpleaſing and provoking to us, as all Sin is to God. It is becauſe God's <hi>Holineſs</hi> hates Sin; that his <hi>Power</hi> has made an Hell to puniſh it. Indeed Sin is the only thing that's loathſome, hateful and provoking to God; and all Sin is inconceivably abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>God has threatned to puniſh Sin, and he is faithful it his Word.</hi> While Man was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, God threatned Death in caſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. And the Scripture plainly declares, <hi>the Soul that ſins ſhall Die,</hi> Ezek. 18.4. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Every Sin is Treaſon and Rebellion againſt God, and deſerves Death; even E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death and Miſery. And if Sin be not ſo Repented of, as to be Pardoned thro' the Blood of Chriſt, Eternal Death and Miſery ſhall certainly be inflicted for it: for <hi>God is faithful to his Word. He cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould repent. Hath
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:001936_0187_0FBA3263EAB5E238"/>
be ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Numb. 23.19. <hi>It is impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> Heb. 6.18. God is Unchangibly true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore his <hi>threatenings</hi> (if Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prevent not) as well as his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> ſhall certainly be accompliſhed. This God of Unchangible Truth has ſaid, <hi>Wo to the wicked, it ſhall go ill with him,</hi> Iſai. 3.11. Thoſe who <hi>obey not the Goſpel, ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>God has power ſufficient to puniſh Sin, to fulfil all his Threatnings againſt it.</hi> Among Men, Judges ſometimes <hi>want Power</hi> to inflict deſerved Puniſhments on Offenders; God can never want Power ſo to do, for he is <hi>the Lord God Omnipotent. Criminals</hi> ſometimes make their <hi>Eſcape</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Juſtice, Abſcond, Break Driſon, &amp;c.</hi> But none can make their Eſcape from God. If they make their Neſt among the Stars, he can bring them down. God has already ſhown, great Juſtice and Power in puniſhing of Sin. The ſtrong, the mighty Angels that Rebell'd; he has laid in Chains, reſerving them to that terrible Judgment which they tremble at the thoughts of. God <hi>Drowned the Old World</hi> for their <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi>: deſtroy'd <hi>Sodom &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah,</hi> with <hi>Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven</hi> for their Wickedneſs. All the Miſeries, Plagues, Puniſhments, Deaths that were ever inflicted on the Children of Men; were the fruits of Sin. That God who has done theſe things, is the ſame God ſtill, he's Unchangible: he
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:001936_0188_0FBA3267D2DFE0F0"/>
can puniſh Sin more <hi>terribly</hi> than we can conceive of. <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy? Are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. O Sinner, wilt thou provoke the Lord by walking in any way of known Sin? Thou Fool, thou Mad Man, God can tear thee in pieces ſo that none can deliver thee. God governs the World, he does what he will <hi>in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth.</hi> Thy time, thy breath, all thy ways and concerns are in his Hand; he can do what he will with thee. God can if he pleaſes, ſoon ſtrip thee of all thy outward Comforts and Injoyments, of thy <hi>Eſtate, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, Friends</hi>: he can take away thy Health, fill thee with <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Pain.</hi> He can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken thy ſtupid Soul, ſet thy Sins in order before thee, and make thy Conſcience a gnawing tormenting Worm within thee; he can make thee a terror to thy ſelf, and to all round about thee: he can <hi>deſtroy both thy Soul and Body in Hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. Thou art abſolutely and intirely in the hand of that God, whom thou provokeſt with thy wickedneſs; he can end thy Life and ſend thee to Hell in a Moment, if he pleaſeth. Nothing can be ſo preſumptuouſly mad and fooliſh, ſo eminently hazardous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; as for Perſons to Sin againſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, this Holy Almighty Jehovah.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>God will ſhow no Mercy to thoſe, who are finally obſtinate in Sin.</hi> God now calls them to turn and live, he waits to be Gracious; but if they will not hearken, will not turn,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:001936_0189_0FBA3269B54B8E00"/>
then (as our Text and the following Verſe intimate) God has nothing but a <hi>ſharpened Sword,</hi> a <hi>bent Bow, Arrows and Inſtruments of Death prepared for them.</hi> Thoſe who being <hi>often reproved, harden their necks, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed; and that without remedy,</hi> Prov. 19.1. Thoſe who finally and obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to turn to God, ſhall have Divine wrath and fury poured out upon them, but they ſhall have no Mercy. <hi>He that made them will not have mercy on them: and he that formed them will ſhow them no favour,</hi> Iſai. 27.11. There's a time coming, when all their Prayers, Cries, Tears will prevail nothing with God. He often call'd on them and they would not hear, they obſtinately refus'd till the day of his Patience was over; therefore when they cry under the heavy preſſures of his Wrath, he will not hear them.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wonderful is the Patience of God to Poor Sinners.</hi> Inaſmuch as Sin is unutterably hateful, abominable, provoking to God, and all Sinners are intirely in his Hand that he could cruſh them in a moment if he would; I ſay, inaſmuch as it is thus, its indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and wonderful that God ſhould ſpare Sinners, and bear with them as he often does. God could glorify himſelf in their ſpeedy utter deſtruction if he would, 'tis as eaſy with him to turn them into Hell if he pleas'd, as for us to cruſh a Moth under our Fingers; and yet he often ſpares them long. It may be ſome <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> Perſons, ſome <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faners</hi> of Gods <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Sabbath</hi>; ſome <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Fornicators, Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Murderers, &amp;c.</hi> and it may be others free from ſuch groſs viſible Scandals, who yet live <hi>Impenitent</hi> and <hi>Unbelieving,</hi> are yet ſuffer'd to live till they're <hi>Twenty, Thirty, Fifty, Sixty</hi> Years Old or more: tho' they're all this while ſinning againſt God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking him every day, yet he ſpares them and calls upon them to turn and live.

But yet ſuch are the wonders of Gods Love, Mercy and Grace; that if we heartily Repent of Sin, and Believe in Chriſt Jeſus, we ſhall then be Pardoned and Saved. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. <hi>He that covereth his Sin, ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh, ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heartily repent and turn from all our Sins, and truſt in Chriſt, ſubmitting to him as the only Prophet, Prieſt and King of our Souls.

Thoſe things which tend to <hi>draw</hi> us into Sin and hurt our Souls, and have no tendency to benefit our Souls; ſhould be carefully avoided. Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs going to <hi>Taverns</hi> and ſpending time there, brings no glory to God nor good to Souls, but the contrary. <hi>Health-Drinking,</hi> what glory did it ever bring to God or good to Souls? it has often been an <hi>occaſion</hi> of much Sin, &amp; therefore of much Diſhonour to God and hurt to Souls. A needleſs <hi>frequenting of ill Company,</hi> leads to abundance of Sin, Miſchief and Miſery: <hi>A Companion of Fools ſhall he deſtroyed.</hi> Surely, the thoughts of Gods <hi>Sharpened Sword and Bent Bow,</hi> of that <hi>Vengeance</hi> he is <hi>preparing</hi> for Sinners; ſhould make us very watchful, careful, prayerful to avoid Sin, yea (and ſo far as we can) the <hi>occaſions</hi> of Sinning, thoſe things which lead and tend to the hurting of our Souls.

                  <hi>DOCTRINE, I.</hi> The Son of Man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with His Angels, to Judge the World.</head>
               <p>For the clearing of this Truth, we may conſider the following Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is both God and Man in One Perſon.</hi> He is the <hi>Only begotten Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3.16. His Eternal Son, of the ſame Eſſence and Subſtance with God the Father and God the Holy Ghoſt; for <hi>theſe Three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7. They are but One Divine Being, Subſtance or Eſſence. Chriſt therefore is a <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> really and truly God <hi>by Nature,</hi> from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. He is <hi>God over all, bleſſed forever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. Chriſt alſo has an <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> united to His <hi>Divine Nature</hi>; ſo that he has T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> diſtinct Natures (Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) in One Divine Perſon. This Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. Nature, the Son of God did <hi>in time</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:001936_0203_0FBA2E0EF5DF5608"/>
(not from Eternity) take into Perſonal U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us,</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>Jeſus Christ our Lord, which was made of the ſeed of David ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 1.3. <hi>God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. So that Chriſt is both <hi>God and Man,</hi> he has a <hi>Divine Nature</hi> which he had from all Eternity; and an <hi>Humane Nature</hi> which he took to himſelf in time; now it is with reſpect to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> that in our Text (as well as in many other places) he is called <hi>the Son of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall Judge the World.</hi> All the World of Mankind, all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Perſons that ever were in the World, or ever ſhall be in it, ſhall be called into Judgment, and Doom'd to a ſtate of endleſs <hi>Miſery or Glory,</hi> according to what their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour was while they liv'd <hi>here upon Earth.</hi> And the Perſon that ſhall be the Supream, Univerſal Judge of all, that ſhall hear all Cauſes, and determine whether they're good or bad, and <hi>pronounce</hi> Sentence on each Perſon accordingly; I ſay, the Perſon that ſhall thus Judge the World, is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>God— hath appointed a day, in which he will Judge the World in righteouſneſs, by the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead,</hi> Act 17.30, 31. It was Chriſt whom God raiſed from the Dead; and the Apoſtles were commanded to teſtify, <hi>That it is he which was Ordained of God, to be the Judge
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:001936_0204_0FBA2E1013F7E488"/>
of quick and dead,</hi> Act. 10.39, —42. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1. By the <hi>Quick,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe that ſhall be found <hi>Living</hi> on Earth, when Chriſt comes to Judgment (<hi>we ſhall not all Sleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.51. <hi>We which are alive and remain,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17.) and by the <hi>Dead,</hi> ſuch as ſhall be <hi>rais'd</hi> from the Dead at Chriſts Coming; all ſhall be Judged <hi>by Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 2.16. <hi>God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It's evident therefore, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who is both God and Man, ſhall Judge the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When Chriſt comes to do this, it will be in the Glory of his Father with his Angels. Come,</hi> from whence will Chriſt <hi>come</hi> to Judge the World? <hi>Anſ.</hi> He will come <hi>from Heaven</hi> to do it. About <hi>Forty Days</hi> after our Saviour was rais'd from the Dead, in a Cloud he was taken up, and he aſcended into Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3, 9, 10. Chriſt is now in Heaven <hi>at Gods Right Hand,</hi> Rom. 8.34. And the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens muſt <hi>receive</hi> (retain) <hi>him till the times of the reſtitution of all things,</hi> Act. 3.21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt ſets himſelf to Judge the World, he will <hi>come,</hi> and 'twill be <hi>from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (where he now is) that he will come. 2 Theſ. 1.7. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven.</hi> This is called his <hi>Appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1. His <hi>appearing the ſecond time without ſin unto Salvation,</hi> Heb. 9.28. He has already appear'd <hi>once</hi> in this World, in a mean humbled ſtate, in the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:001936_0205_0FBA2E1197BB8408"/>
to Die a Sacrifice for the Sins of his People to procure the Pardon of them; but his <hi>Second</hi> appearing when he comes to Judge the World, and compleat and perfect the Salvation of his People, will be very bright and ſplendid, full of Majeſty and Glory. For he ſhall come,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Glory of his Father.</hi> Tho' Chriſt will deſcend from Heaven in his Humane Nature, when he comes to Judgment; yet he'll come incircled with Divine Glory. It will then be inconteſtibly evident to all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all Men, that Chriſt's <hi>Perſon is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> and that he's clothed with the Majeſty and Glory <hi>proper and peculiar</hi> to ſuch an One. Chriſt as a Divine Perſon, had Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before Creatures ever had a being. Our Saviour a little before his Death, made that Prayer to God, Joh. 17.5. <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> Whether the <hi>Glory</hi> in which Chriſt will come to Judge the World, is in our Text call'd the <hi>Glory of the Father,</hi> becauſe the Father by an Eternal and Ineffable Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration communicates the Divine Nature and Glory to the Son; or whether, becauſe Chriſt as Mediator is commiſſioned by the Father to Judge the World; I ſay, whether it be in the one or other, of theſe reſpects, we need not diſpute, tho' I ſee no cauſe to reject ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. God has <hi>exalted</hi> the Mediator, given
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:001936_0206_0FBA2E1506B40C98"/>
him <hi>Dignity and Glory</hi> in appointing him to Judge the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9,— 11. The <hi>Glory</hi> in which Chriſt comes to Judge the World, is in our Text call'd <hi>the Glory of his Father.</hi> 'Tis call'd Chriſt's <hi>own Glory.</hi> Mat. 25.31. <hi>When the ſon of Man ſhall come in his Glory.</hi> So we read, Luk. 9.26: <hi>He ſhall come in his own Glory, and in his Fathers and of his holy Angels.</hi> He ſhall come in a <hi>Glory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his <hi>own Divine Perſon,</hi> and becoming the <hi>Son</hi> of his <hi>Eternal Glorious Father.</hi> This Glory in which Chriſt ſhall appear at laſt, will be more Bright, Splendid, Majeſtick and Magnificent than ever was ſeen before. Chriſt's <hi>Glory</hi> ſhall be <hi>revealed,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. 'Tis called <hi>great Glory,</hi> Mat. 24.30. <hi>The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of the Great God, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Tit. 2.13. Indeed Chriſt will then come <hi>with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the Trump of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.16. He ſhall come <hi>in Flaming Fire,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8. He ſhall come,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With his Angels.</hi> Chriſt as God, is the Creator of all things. <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> Joh. 1.3. Chriſt alſo as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, has all things put under his Feet; he is Head over all things,</hi> Eph. 1.22. So that Chriſt both as <hi>Creator,</hi> and as an <hi>exalted Mediator,</hi> is <hi>Lord of Angels</hi>; they are <hi>His</hi> Angels: They are the <hi>Good</hi> and not the <hi>Fallen</hi> Angels, that are eſpecially intended in our Text. All the good Angels ſhall be of Chriſt's Retinue, and help to ſet forth the <hi>Splendor of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:001936_0207_0FBA2E1DA3B0D740"/>
when he deſcends from Heaven to Judge the World. He ſhall be Reveal'd from Heaven with <hi>his mighty Angels,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7. <hi>All the holy Angels</hi> ſhall come with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31. <hi>All</hi> the Angels, the whole Number of the Heavenly Hoſt, thoſe bright Attendants in the <hi>Supream Court,</hi> ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Glorious JESUS at the Laſt Day. The Angels on <hi>particular Occaſions,</hi> have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appeared ſo Bright, Dazling and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as to affright mortal Spectators. The <hi>Roman Souldiers</hi> that were ſet to keep and watch the Sepulchre of our Saviour, were greatly Amaz'd and Terrify'd at the Sight of an Angel. <hi>His countenance was like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, and his raiment white as Snow. And for fear of him, the Keepers did ſhake, and became as dead Men,</hi> Mat. 28.3, 4. And if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels appeared thus Glorious on particular Occaſions, doubtleſs when they ſhall all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our Lord (and theirs) on the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Day, they'l appear cloath'd with their brighteſt Robes of Light and Splendor, and therein help to ſet forth the unparallel Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that moſt Auguſt and Grand Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The holy and mighty Angels, who ſhall then attend our Glorious Judge, <hi>ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to another,</hi> Mat. 24.31. And they ſhall gather the <hi>Tares,</hi> the Wicked, <hi>all things that offend, and them which do Iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a Furnace of Fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 13.40, — 42. Thus I have prov'd, that the Son of Man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:001936_0208_0FBA2E1F2B2AB090"/>
come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angers, to Judge the World.</p>

                  <hi>DOCTRINE, II.</hi> He will then Reward every Man according to his Works.</head>
               <p>Our Text expreſly declares this to us; and for the illuſtrating and further clearing of it, we may conſider the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All the Dead ſhall be raiſed.</hi> When Perſons die, their Rational Souls <hi>parting from their Bodies</hi> (which Separation is Death) their Bodies then are uſually buried in the Earth, where they Rot and return to Duſt. Gen. 3.19. <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhall thou return.</hi> When a Perſon dies, <hi>then ſhall the duſt return to the Earth as it was, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit return unto God who gave it,</hi> Eccl. 12.7. But though the dead Bodies of Men ſhall Rot, return to their Duſt; or though being drowned in the Sea, ſhall be eaten by Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; yet all theſe dead Bodies, both of the Godly and Ungodly, ſhall be raiſed again, they ſhall live again, ſhall be re-united to thoſe Souls which formerly dwelt in them, and ſhall abide united to them for ever. This <hi>Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> is known only by Divine Revelation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour refers us to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as the only <hi>proper Proof</hi> of it: For he ſaid to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who <hi>denyed the Reſurrection,</hi> Mat.
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:001936_0209_0FBA2E209E029630"/>
22.29. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.</hi> God who is infinitely Wiſe, Powerful and Faithful, has declared in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that the Dead ſhall be raiſed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have the higheſt Ground and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon firmly to believe that it ſhall be ſo. Tho' if Men would give way to their ſhort-ſighted, carnal Reaſon, they might make Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Reſurrection, or fruitleſs Queries about the Way, Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it; yet 'twould be fooliſh ſo to do. Acts 26.8. <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead</hi>? It's incredible indeed that <hi>Men</hi> (by any meer Power of their own) ſhould raiſe the Dead; but not incredible that GOD ſhould do ſo. 1 Cor. 15.35, 36. <hi>But ſome Man will ſay, how are the dead raiſed up, and with what Body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened, except it die.</hi> According to Scripture Language, that Man is a <hi>Fool</hi> who denies the Reſurrection, or makes any doubting, needleſs Queries about the Way, Manner, Circumſtances of it. What God has plainly declar'd, we ſhould firmly believe. Now he has plainly declar'd, Joh. 5.28, 29. <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in their Graves ſhall hear his voice; and ſhall come forth, they that have done good to the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done evil to the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> Acts 24.15. — <hi>There ſhall be a Reſurrection of the dead, both of the Juſt and unjuſt.</hi> Rev. 20.13. <hi>And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the dead which were
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:001936_0210_0FBA2E239541AE50"/>
in them: And they were judged every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Works.</hi> Thus 'tis evident! that all the Dead ſhall be raiſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>All Perſons ſhall be Cited and Convened, before the Throne or Judgment Seat of Chriſt.</hi> When Chriſt comes from Heaven at the Laſt Day, to be ſure he will deſcend into this World as low as the <hi>Air,</hi> for <hi>there</hi> the Saints ſhall meet him. <hi>We — ſhall be caught up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17. And when the Lord Jeſus thus comes to Judgment, he'll ſit on a <hi>Glorious Throne,</hi> Tribunal, or Judgment-Seat; and all Perſons that ever lived in the World, ſhall be gathered together before him. Mat. 25.31.—33. <hi>He ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all Nations; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats; and he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body,</hi> (that is, while he liv'd here in this World) <hi>according to what he hath done whether it be good or bad.</hi> Rev. 20.12. <hi>I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened which is the Book of Life: and the dead were Judged out of thoſe things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Books, according to their works.</hi> And not only the <hi>Dead,</hi> that is, ſuch as ſhall then be rais'd from the Dead; but thoſe alſo found <hi>Living</hi> when Chriſt comes, ſhall be Judged.
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:001936_0211_0FBA2E2A5B29FAC0"/>
For (as was hinted before) he ſhall Judge the <hi>Quick and the Dead,</hi> at his Appearing and his Kingdom, 2 Tim 4.1. <hi>Every one of us muſt give an account of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14.12. All that ever liv'd in the World, muſt make their <hi>Perſonal Appearance</hi> before Chriſt's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat; and muſt give an account of <hi>themſelves,</hi> of their own Carriage and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: none ſhall be allow'd to appear by <hi>Proxy,</hi> or to have an <hi>Attorney</hi> to appear in his room and anſwer in his ſtead; but <hi>every one</hi> muſt appear <hi>Perſonally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord Jeſus will then render the Godly, Inconceivably and Eternally happy and bleſſed.</hi> There are but two ſorts of Perſons in this World, the <hi>Godly and the Wicked</hi>; and there will be but theſe two ſorts in the Judgment Day. The <hi>Godly</hi> are call'd <hi>Sheep,</hi> and ſhall be at Chriſt's <hi>Right Hand,</hi> and he'll ſay to them, as Mat. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World.</hi> Chriſt will then own them, call them <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and make them <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> in poſſeſſing them of an Eternal Glorious Kingdom. Godly Perſons, Sincere Believers, are in general deſcribed from their <hi>doing Good,</hi> and ſhall at laſt come out of their Graves to the <hi>Reſurrection of Life,</hi> Joh. 5.28, 29. And in the Judgment Day, they ſhall receive a Reward of Grace for all the good they ever did. Indeed the endleſs future Glory and Happineſs they ſhall have, is no part of it really meritted, purchaſed, deſerved by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but it <hi>is the Gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:001936_0212_0FBA2E2D963950D8"/>
                  <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. It's a <hi>free Gift</hi> of God as it comes to them; yet it's call'd a <hi>Reward</hi> too, inaſmuch as God has freely promis'd it to thoſe who ſeek and ſerve him; having put a firm connexion between their preſent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and their future Welfare. It is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward;</hi> God is a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of them that diligently ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6, 25. The Lord Jeſus will graciouſly Reward all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Duties of the Saints performed in this World. He'll ſay, <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things: enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> Mat. 25.21. He'll then mention, commend, and graciouſly reward, their <hi>Alms-Deeds,</hi> their <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs.</hi> He'll ſay, <hi>Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,—for I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred and ye gave me Meat: I was thirſty and ye gave me Drink: I was a ſtranger and ye took me in; naked and ye Clothed me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25.34,— 40. Their giving a <hi>Cup of Cold Water</hi> (which is but a ſmall and cheap token of kindneſs) to a Diſciple, ſhall <hi>not loſe its Reward,</hi> Mat. 10.42. Their ſincere <hi>Prayers</hi> alſo ſhall be Rewarded. Mat. 6.6. <hi>Enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, Pray to thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret; and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> So their <hi>Faith</hi> which they now exerciſe in this World, <hi>ſhall be found to Praiſe, Honour and Glory at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. Indeed,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:001936_0213_0FBA2E2EF9677EE0"/>
none of their work and <hi>Labour in the Lord</hi> (and for the Lord) <hi>ſhall be in vaiu,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>For God is not unrighteous to forget their work and labour of love, which they have ſhewed towards his Name,</hi> Heb. 6.10. Yea, <hi>whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord whether he be bond or free,</hi> Eph. 6.8. All the <hi>good Actions</hi> of the Saints whether <hi>open or ſecret,</hi> ſhall then be graciouſly Rewarded. <hi>For God will bring every work into Judgment with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.14. All who in this World, ſincerely Repent of Sin, Believe in Chriſt and Obey him; ſhall by him in the Judgment Day be openly Owned, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and graciouſly Rewarded. And this, ſo far as it concerns the <hi>Godly,</hi> is what our Text calls, <hi>a Rewarding every man according to his Works.</hi> When Chriſt comes to Judge the World (the Apoſtle tells us) he will <hi>render to every man according to his Deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well doing, do ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immortality, Eternal Life. — Glory, Honour and Peace to every Man that worketh good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile.</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7, 10. And this good, great and gracious Reward which ſhall be beſtow'd on the Godly; will be an <hi>Eternal</hi> one, an Happineſs that ſhall never ceaſe nor have an end. It is <hi>Everlaſting Life,</hi> Mat. 25.46. <hi>A Crown of Glory that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. And as a good and gracious Reward, ſhall in the Judgment Day be given to thoſe, who in this World were <hi>Doers of Good</hi>: So,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:001936_0214_0FBA2E3089C12588"/>4. <hi>The Lord Jeſus will then render the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Inconceivably and Eternally Miſerable.</hi> Iſai. 3.11. <hi>Wo unto the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with him; for the Reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> The Sins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> which the Ungodly were chargeable with, ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and puniſhed in the Judgment Day. Mat. 25.41, 42. <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no Meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me no Drink.</hi> Many are apt to make light of Sins of <hi>Omiſſion.</hi> How common is it for many to omit and neglect Secret Prayer, Family Prayer, Reading Gods Word, hearing it Preached, attending on Gods Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, though the Ungodly make never ſo light of their Neglects of Duty, their Sins of Omiſſion; yet theſe their vile Omiſſions, ſhall be openly publiſhed and puniſhed in the Judgment Day. And ſo ſhall their Sins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> too; <hi>for God will bring every work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil,</hi> Eccl. 12.14. All the ill Actions of the Wicked, whether <hi>open or ſecret,</hi> ſhall then be publiſhed and puniſhed. God will then <hi>bring to light the hidden things of Darkneſs, and make manifest the counſels of the Heart,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. He'll Judge the <hi>Secrets of Men</hi> by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. Many Abominations are committed in Secret, <hi>ſecret Thiefts, ſecret Fornications and Adulteries, ſecret Drunkeneſs and Intemperance, ſecret Minders,</hi> &amp;c. Well, but

theſe hidden things of Darkneſs, theſe curſed, ſecret Crimes ſhall then be openly publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the World, and puniſhed alſo.

one of them ſhall eſcape.

Not only ſome, but <hi>all</hi> the hard Speeches, and <hi>all</hi> the Ungodly Deeds of the Wicked, ſhall be brought into Judgment, openly publiſh'd before the whole World of Angels and Men, juſtly condemn'd and puniſhed. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſhall then be Sentenc'd, to <hi>Everlaſting Fire</hi> prepared for the Devil and his Angels: they ſhall go away into <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment,</hi> Mat. 25.41, 46. They ſhall be with the <hi>Worm that never dies,</hi> be <hi>cut aſunder,</hi> be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>outer darkneſs</hi>; have <hi>weeping, wailing</hi> and <hi>gnaſhing of teeth</hi>: they ſhall be puniſhed with <hi>Everlaſting Deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and the glory of his power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.9. This will be the Portion of the Wicked, this is what the Ungodly are haſtening unto. But, do Sinners conſider this? Can they dwell with devouring Fire, with the never dying Worm, with Everlaſting Burnings? When they neglect God, and Chriſt and their Souls, and live Wickedly, they are but treaſuring up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath; they are increaſing their Guilt and Miſery. But alas, ſtupid Sinners walking in the broad way; are little or nothing concerned about their end, and the Eternity they're going to. And
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:001936_0217_0FBA2E37090236A0"/>
as all Ungodly ſhall be <hi>rewarded according to their Works,</hi> and made Inconceivably and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally miſerable; ſo, the <hi>more wicked</hi> any have been on Earth, the <hi>more miſerable</hi> they ſhall be in Hell, in the <hi>Lake that burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi> It ſhall be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> in the Day of Judgment, than for thoſe obſtinately Impenitent under the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.22, 23.

Tho' <hi>all</hi> the Saints ſhall be Inconceivably happy and glorious; yet doubtleſs there will be <hi>degrees</hi> of glory; <hi>One Star differing from another Star in glory, ſo alſo is the Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.41, 42.

They're under the guilt of Sin, the wrath and curſe of God: they are but <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up of wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the Revelation of Gods righteous Judgment,</hi> Rom. 2.5. Now they ſerve Sin and Satan, neglect God, Indulge themſelves often in thoſe <hi>curſed Crimes,</hi> which they would by no means have known ſo much as to a few of their next Neighbours; but very quickly even in the Judgment day, all their Sins open and ſecret, of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, ſhall be publiſh'd and laid open <hi>before the World</hi>: and for ſuch their Sins, the wicked ſhall then be ſentenc'd to Eternal Puniſhments in Hell.

That Men do ſometimes <hi>deſpiſe God,</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppos'd in our Text, as well as aſſerted in other Places of Scripture. In the 1. <hi>v.</hi> of this Chapter the Inſpired Apoſtle exhorts the Chriſtian <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to <hi>abound</hi> in ſuch a <hi>walk,</hi> or holy <hi>practice,</hi> as he had taught them in Preaching the Goſpel; even ſuch a walk as would <hi>pleaſe God.</hi> After this general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, he more particularly cautions and warns them <hi>againſt Uncleanneſs</hi>; and then adds in our Text, <hi>He that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man, but God.</hi> It is as if he had ſaid to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I and others who have faithfully Preached the Goſpel to you, are but Miniſters, Meſſengers of God, Ambaſſadors of Christ; 'tis Gods truth, His mind and will (<hi>not cuningly deviſed fables, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.16.</hi> nor <hi>commandments of Men,</hi> Mat. <hi>15.9.)</hi> that we declar'd to you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who don't live agreably to this Goſpel Preached to them, they deſpiſe not Men, but God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not Man but God,</hi> the meaning is, he deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>not only Man</hi> who declares this <hi>Divine Meſſage,</hi> but alſo <hi>God</hi> who <hi>ſends</hi> the Meſſage; or the <hi>aggravation</hi> of this <hi>deſpiſing</hi> is, that 'tis not ſo much againſt the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> (a frail mortal Man) as againſt <hi>God</hi> that ſends both <hi>Meſſage</hi> and <hi>Meſſenger.</hi> So, when Iſrael <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Moſes</hi> ſaid to them, <hi>What are we?

When great and weighty Truths and Duties are Preached, if Men diſregard them becauſe of ſome diſlike they have to the Preacher; this ſhows great and prevailing Corruption in their Minds.

                  <p>Don't take upon truſt all that Miniſters Preach, don't believe it as a Divine Truth meerly becauſe they deliver it, but try it by the word of God: 1 Theſ. 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> When the Apoſtle had been Preaching to the <hi>Bereans,</hi> he <hi>commends</hi> them, <hi>That they received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily whether thoſe things were ſo,</hi> Act. 17.10, 11. They readily and gladly heard the word Preach'd, and as diligently ſearch'd the Scriptures, to ſee whether what was Preach'd agre'd thereto. This was noble indeed. If Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Preach contrary to the Scriptures, you have a divine Warrant to reject it. Iſai. 8.20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this word; it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> But if Miniſters Preach agreeably to the Scriptures, then reject it at your Peril.

When Miniſters Preach agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Scriptures, they may truly ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi>; and thoſe who reject it, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Lords Meſſage to them. When Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters call on you to <hi>Repent of Sin, heartily to Believe in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or to do this or that Duty requir'd by Scripture; then remember, the <hi>Great GOD</hi> by His Meſſengers calls on

Therefore the Mercy of God through Chriſt, <hi>revealed</hi> in the Promiſes, is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, the Ground and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Perſons have to hope and truſt in him. Rom. 10.14, 17. — <hi>How ſhall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him of whom they have not heard?

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That they actually truſt in God, upon the Encouragement of his Promiſes.</hi> Though ſuch as cover their Sins, ſhall not proſper; yet thoſe who confeſs and forſake them, ſhall have Mercy. There's an <hi>Abundance</hi> of Pardoning Mercy with God, for <hi>penitent, returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Iſai. 55.7. Therefore Perſons cannot be ſaid, rightly to <hi>ſtay on God,</hi> or <hi>lean on the Lord</hi> (as the Phraſe is, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11.) unleſs they heartily Repent of their Sins, grieve and mourn for them, hate and turn from them; and heartily truſt in God's Mercy through Chriſt, as Revealed in the Promiſes.

that believeth not, is condemned already, — the Wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3.18, 36. The Wages of Sin is Death: The Law of God condemns impenitent Sinners. Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> But when a Perſon heartily Repents of his Sins, and truſteth in the Mercy of God through Chriſt for Pardon; then the Great GOD, his Maker, Lawgiver and Judge, is Reconciled to him, and at Peace with him. <hi>Being justified by Faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. ——There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 5.1. &amp; 8.1. If any one's Sins have been never ſo many or great, yet if he heartily Repents and turns from them, and believes in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; then God Pardons all his Iniquities, and is at Peace with his Soul. 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> Acts 10.43. — <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>

Troubles and Afflictions on them. Becauſe <hi>David</hi> by his hainous Crimes, had given great Occaſion to the Enemy to blaſpheme; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God took away his Child by Death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.4. But though God may be thus highly provoked with the Offences of his adopted Children; yet he'll ſo Renew them by the Exerciſe of Repentance, as that they ſhall not be utterly Rejected by him, nor Conquered by their Spiritual Enemies. He will <hi>reſtore their Souls, and lead them in paths of Righteouſneſs for his Name ſake,</hi> Pſal. 23.3. The Foundation of God ſtands ſure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his. God has both <hi>threaten'd</hi> and <hi>promis'd</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spiritual Seed of <hi>David,</hi> of Chriſt, Pſal. 89.30,— 33. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then will I viſit their Tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their Iniquity with Stripes. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, my loving kindneſs I will not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> When God has once accepted a penitent, believing Sinner, and pardoned him for Chriſt's ſake; though after this he may poſſibly chaſtiſe him very ſorely for great Offences, yet he'll never utterly caſt him off, nor ſuffer him finally to periſh; but by his Grace he will Humble him, Reſtore him, and Save him for ever. He will bring him to Heaven, though it be by Weeping Croſs; he'll ſave him, though it be as by Fire. For <hi>whom he juſtified, them he alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi> Rom. 8.30.</p>

Thus God ſaid to the Jewiſh Captives at <hi>Babylon</hi>; Jer. 29.7. <hi>Seek the peace of the City whether I have cauſed you to be carryed away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof ye ſhall have peace.</hi> So, Pſal. 122.6. <hi>Seek the peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that love thee.</hi> Well, God will give to ſuch as have their Minds ſtayed on him, all that outward Proſperity which he ſees beſt for them. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. It's true, God won't give to the Saints an uninterrupted Courſe of preſent, outward Proſperity; they have no Ground to expect that he will, but abundant Ground to expect the contrary: Yet he'll give them all that outward Proſperity, which in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom and Love he ſees beſt for them, or which he ſees will be moſt for his Glory, and their Spiritual, Eternal Good. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but that God ſhould deal thus with them. He that has ſo lov'd them, as to give his only begotten, Eternal Son to die for their Salvation, cannot but beſtow on them what he ſees beſt for them.

work together for good, to them that love God, and are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Thoſe whom God has effectually called home to Chriſt, and enabled to <hi>ſtay their Minds</hi> on him, and truſt in him; as for ſuch, he'll make all things work together for their greateſt Good, and everlaſting Welfare.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God often gives them great inward Peace and Joy in their own Souls.</hi> Peace with God is one thing, Peace and Quiet in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is another. A Perſon may poſſibly be a true, penitent Believer, and be Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Reconciled to God, and at Peace with him; and yet not know, or be fully aſſured in his own Mind, that he is in ſo ſafe a State. Even <hi>Zion</hi> her ſelf is ſometimes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me,</hi> Iſai. 49.14. Thoſe that <hi>fear the Lord, and obey the voice of his Servants,</hi> yet ſometimes <hi>walk in the Dark, and have no Light,</hi> Iſai. 50.10. That <hi>ſincere Saints</hi> are ſometimes under Clouds, Doubts, Fears, Jealouſys about their own <hi>Spiritual Safety,</hi> is a thing too plain to be diſputed or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Notwithſtanding all this, yet a ſteady Courſe of <hi>having the Mind ſtayed on God, and trusting in him,</hi> tends directly to the <hi>inward Peace,</hi> Joy and Satisfaction of the Soul. <hi>The ways of wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall

offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119.165. So the Apoſtle ſays, Rom. 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope, fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> Believing in Chriſt, lays a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>fullneſs of Joy and Peace</hi>: And tho' ſome who have true Faith, are not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fill'd with ſuch Joy and Peace; yet this proceeds from the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of their Faith. For if they did ſuitably and firmly Realize the Truths of God, and <hi>ſtedfastly truſt in him through Chriſt,</hi> for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his <hi>gracious and faithful Promiſes</hi>; then <hi>on good Grounds</hi> they might infer, that God is at Peace with them, and ſo they might well rejoyce in him as their Portion, and exceeding great Reward. Therefore, as they are bid to <hi>truſt in the Lord for ever</hi>; (Iſai. 26.4.) ſo they are bid to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord always,</hi> Phil. 3.1. So, Phil. 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always; and again I ſay rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Realizing the Revealed Truths of God, and a firm truſting in him through Chriſt for promiſed Bleſſings; gives good Ground for <hi>inward Peace,</hi> and <hi>true Spiritual Joy and Comfort,</hi> even in the midſt of <hi>outward Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Troubles</hi> and <hi>Afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This may appear if we conſider the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Particulars,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Men are made for Eternity.</hi> Indeed their Time and Life in this World, are <hi>very ſhort</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi>; but there is an endleſs State of <hi>Miſery</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> after this preſent Life is ended.

And when all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons both Good and Bad, ſhall be thus Judged, then the <hi>Wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, and the Righteous into Life eternal,</hi> Mat. 25.46. So that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, individual perſon, that ever has lived, or ever ſhall live in the World, ſhall be Eternally and Inconceivably Happy or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in the future State and World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That's really beſt for Perſons, which moſt promotes their Spiritual and Everlasting Welfare.</hi> If Men had no other State and Being but in this preſent Life and World, like the Beaſts that periſh; then preſent, outward Eaſe and Proſperity, might be reckoned their <hi>Chief Good and Happineſs</hi>; and the contrary hereto their <hi>Greateſt Miſery.</hi> But ſince they are made for an Eternal State, that muſt needs be moſt for their Good, which moſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes their Eternal Good and Welfare, how croſs ſoever it may ſeem to their preſent

Eaſe or Inclination. When perſons are <hi>Sick</hi> or <hi>Wounded,</hi> that <hi>Phyſick,</hi> thoſe <hi>Applications</hi> which cauſe <hi>more preſent Uneaſineſs,</hi> are yet reckoned good and advantagious, if they are uſeful to <hi>procure Health</hi> and <hi>Soundneſs of Body.</hi> Though in it ſelf conſidered, it's <hi>irkſome</hi> and <hi>troubleſome,</hi> to have deep <hi>Inciſions</hi> made in the Fleſh, or to have a <hi>Leg</hi> or <hi>Arm</hi> cut off from the Body; yet theſe Methods are reckoned good, when they are needful to preſerve Life. So, though <hi>Sickneſs, Pain, Poverty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Perſecution,</hi> and the like, in themſelves conſidered, are very undeſirable, uneaſy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable and diſtreſſing; yet if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtrumental to promote our <hi>Spiritual and Eternal Welfare;</hi> ſo far they are to be look'd on as <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Beneficial.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly to the ſame purpoſe, Heb. 12.11. Now no chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but grievous; nevertheleſs, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3. God has promiſed, that all the Afflictions of the Saints ſhall he for their Good and Benefit.</hi> He has plainly declar'd, Rom. 8.28. <hi>All things ſhall work together for good, to them that love God.</hi> But how can this be? What Good can they have by <hi>Pain, Poverty, Contempt,</hi> and other heavy Afflictions? How can ſuch things as theſe be ſaid to be for their Good? Why, theſe things may be ſaid to be for their Good, ſo far as they are inſtrumental to make them more fit and meet for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We Read of a <hi>Meetneſs</hi> (or Fitneſs;) <hi>for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> Col. 1.12.
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:001936_0257_0FBA2EBBCED6E788"/>
And what is it makes Perſons fit or meet for Heaven, for the Enjoyment of God and Chriſt in the future State? Why the more <hi>Holy</hi> they are, ſo much the more fit for the Heavenly State. <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord: But the pure in Heart ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Mat. 5.8. Thoſe that have <hi>clean Hands</hi> and a <hi>pure Heart,</hi> are moſt fit to <hi>ſtand in God's holy Place,</hi> Pſal. 24.3, 4. Well, the Afflictions of the Saints ſhall be made inſtrumental to promote <hi>their Holineſs.</hi> When the Apoſtle gives the Reaſon why God afflicts the Saints, he ſays, <hi>it is for our profit, that we might be partakers of his Holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10. The Fruit is, <hi>to purge away Iniquity, and take away Sin,</hi> Iſai. 27.9. We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways profited by our Afflictions, of what Nature or Degree ſoever they are; if thereby we are made more <hi>Holy, Humble, Prayerful, Patient, Thankful,</hi> more <hi>purg'd from Sin,</hi> and <hi>wean'd from the World.</hi> If our <hi>Pride, Envy, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuouſneſs, Revenge,</hi> or any other Luſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, is more <hi>ſubdued</hi> and <hi>mortifyed</hi> by this or the other Affliction; then we are profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and benefited by it. Sometimes Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſent to humble and chaſten for <hi>paſt Sins,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>prevent</hi> thoſe Sins there is great Danger of. Thus, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan</hi> ſent to buffet him, <hi>lest</hi> he ſhould be exalted above Meaſure, a <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. It was to <hi>prevent</hi> that Pride and Self-conceit which God ſaw he was in Danger of. Poſſibly the Saints meet with Loſſes and Diſappointments in Buſineſs. they can but juſt rub along in the
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:001936_0258_0FBA2EC11EAE3F80"/>
Word; or they loſe <hi>Children</hi> or other <hi>dear Relatives</hi>; and poſſibly God may order theſe things, to <hi>prevent</hi> the Sins he ſees them in Danger of; ſuch as <hi>Pride, Worldly-Mindedneſs, Inordinate Love to Creatures.</hi> Yea, at the ſame time he may deſign both to abaſe and humble them for paſt Sins, and alſo to prevent thoſe further Miſcarriages they are in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of. He chaſtens them, that they <hi>may not be condemned with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. God declares his End in afflicting them, 'tis to make them <hi>more Holy</hi>; and therefore, tho' he may do it in <hi>juſt Anger against their Sins,</hi> yet 'tis in <hi>tender Love to their Souls. Their light Afflictions which are but for a moment, ſhall work for them a far more exceeding and an eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. The holy Pſalmiſt found, that his Afflictions had been for his Spiritual Good and Advantage; Pſal. 119.67, 71, 75. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept thy Word. —It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes. — I know, O Lord, that all thy Judgments are right; and that thou in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs hast afflicted me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God will certainly fulfil all his Promiſes.</hi> God is infinitely Wiſe and Knowing, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Strong and Mighty, infinitely True and Faithful; and therefore all his Promiſes ſhall moſt certainly be accompliſhed. <hi>He cannot lye,</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>It is impoſſible for God to lye,</hi> Heb. 6.18. God <hi>knows</hi> how to fulfil his Promiſes, for his <hi>Underſtanding is infinite.</hi> He's <hi>able</hi> to fulfil them all, for he's the <hi>Lord

God Omnipotent,</hi> (Rev. 19.6.) and can do <hi>exceeding abundantly, above all that we aſk or think,</hi> Eph. 3.20. Many things may poſſibly <hi>diſable</hi> Men from fulfilling their Promiſes, but nothing can <hi>hinder GOD</hi> from fulfilling his. God has Power ſufficient to <hi>break through, break over,</hi> and <hi>utterly to remove</hi> all Difficulties that lye in his way. That which is impoſſible with Men, is yet poſſible and eaſy with God. He can baring Good out of Evil, Light out of Darkneſs, and call things that are not as though they were. Gods Providence <hi>actually governs the World</hi>; he does <hi>according to his Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi> As he is the <hi>Giver of every good Gift,</hi> beſtows all the Benefits any receive; ſo he alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth all the <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> which any meet with. The Saints meet with no <hi>Tryals</hi> but what is of Gods ſending; 'tis the <hi>Chaſtiſement of the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.5. The Lord <hi>creates Darkneſs and Evil,</hi> Iſai. 45.7. And he never brings Tryals on the Saints, but he ſees the ſame are <hi>proper for them.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6. <hi>If need be ye are in Heavineſs, through manifold Temptations.</hi> God never ſends Afflictions on the Saints, but when he ſees them ſome way or other <hi>needful</hi> to promote <hi>their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eternal Good.</hi> So that God orders all their Afflictions as to the <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Sort,</hi> as to the <hi>Meaſure, Degree, Duration,</hi> and all the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of them; and has <hi>promiſed,</hi> that <hi>all things ſhall work together for their Good</hi>; and is true and faithful to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="unknown:001936_0260_0FBA2ECAD1C4E788"/>Now, theſe things laid together and duely conſidered, plainly ſhow, that when the Saints <hi>realize the Truths of God,</hi> and <hi>firmly trust in him through Chriſt for promiſed Bleſſings</hi>; this gives them good Ground for inward Peace, Joy, Serenity of Mind, even in the midſt of alt the Uncertainties, Dangers, Troubles, Afflictions they are liable to in this <hi>preſent evil World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they may know, that things don't come to paſs by Chance or Accident as to God, but are all ordered by his wiſe, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, unerring Providence; even by the Hand of that God, who has promiſed, that <hi>all things ſhall work together for their Good.</hi> They may know, that their <hi>Life,</hi> their <hi>Time,</hi> all their <hi>Affairs</hi> and <hi>Circumstances,</hi> are intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Diſpoſe of that faithful, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God, who has promiſed, <hi>that he will never leave them nor forſake them,</hi> that he will <hi>give them Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withold from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in their firm Relying on God for the Accompliſhment of his Promiſes, they may <hi>glory in Tribulation, rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God.</hi> They <hi>may boldly ſay, The Lord is mine Helper, I will not fear what Man ſhall do unto me,</hi> Heb. 13.5, 6. If all outward Means of Help and Relief fail them, they <hi>may yet rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of their Salvation,</hi> Heb. 3.17, 18. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil Tidings, his Heart is fixed truſting in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 112.7. In the midſt of outward, threatening Dangers and Confuſions, they may yet have inward

The lively Exerciſe of Faith, does as it were feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unite the Soul to God in Chriſt, as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Fountain of <hi>Light, Life, Love, Grace,</hi> and all Good; and how <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> muſt this needs be? The lively Exerciſe of Faith may ſhow the Saint, that <hi>all things are his, whether Life, Death, things preſent, or things to come; &amp; he is Chriſt's, &amp; Chriſt is God's,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 23. But Unbelief, ſo far as that prevails, it <hi>ſeparates</hi> the Soul from God the Fountain of all Good. Heb 3.12. <hi>Take heed leſt there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi> An <hi>unbelieving Heart,</hi> is an <hi>evil Heart.</hi> Why ſo? Why, becauſe it <hi>departs from the living God</hi>: That muſt needs be very Evil, which <hi>departs</hi> from the Fountain of all Good and Grace. Therefore the Saints ſhould <hi>take heed</hi> at ſuch an Heart, to avoid it: Be not faithleſs but believing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We ſhould all of us believe and truſt in God, in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It's <hi>our Duty, our Intereſt</hi> to do ſo. 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> ſhould forthwith Repent of all their Sins, and truſt in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for Salvation; they Provoke God and Ruin their own Souls, if they neglect it. Oh <hi>Dreadful</hi> Evils! 1 Joh. 5.10. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son.</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> On the other hand, Sinners cannot poſſibly pleaſe God, or

profit themſelves, in any thing, like penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſting in his Mercy in Chriſt for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Pſal. 147.11. <hi>The Lord takes pleaſure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his Mercy.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have Everlaſting Life.</hi> The Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhould be in the conſtant Exerciſe of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith; firmly Realizing Gods Revealed Truths, and firmly Truſting in him for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Bleſſings. Iſai. 26.4. <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting strength.</hi> Such Faith Glorifies God. <hi>Abraham was strong in Faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom 4.20. It is <hi>profitable</hi> to us. Jer. 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that trusteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi> There is <hi>joy and peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13. We ſhould therefore check and rebuke our doubting, unbelieving Hearts; and ſhould ſtir up our ſelves to take hold on God. Pſal. 42.11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? And why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God.</hi> Pſal. 27.14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine Heart; wait I ſay on the Lord.</hi> Lam. 3.25, 26. <hi>The Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the ſoul that ſeeketh him. It is good that a Man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord.</hi>
