            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE spirit of jacobinism, if not entirely a new spirit, has at least been cloathed with a more gigantic body and armed with more powerful weapons than it ever before possessed. It is perhaps not too much to say, that it threatens more extensive and complicated mischiefs to the world than have hitherto flowed from the three great scourges of mankind, WAR, PESTILENCE and FAMINE. To what point it will ultimately lead society, it is impossible for human fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight to pronounce; but there is just ground to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that its progress may be marked with calamities of which the dreadful incidents of the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afford a very faint image. Incessantly busied in undermining all the props of public security and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happiness, it seems to threaten the political and moral world with a complete overthrow.</p>
            <p>A principal engine, by which this spirit endeavours to accomplish its purposes is that of calumny. It is essential to its success that the influence of men of upright principles, disposed and able to resist its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, shall be at all events destroyed. Not content with traducing their best efforts for the public good, with misrepresenting their purest motives, with infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring criminality from actions innocent or laudable, the most direct falshoods are invented and propagated, with undaunted effrontery and unrelenting perseverance. Lies often detected and refuted are still revived and repeated, in the hope that the refutation may have been
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032222_0004_0FF198902D6304C0"/>
forgotten or that the frequency and boldness of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation may supply the place of truth and proof. The most profligate men are encouraged, probably bribed, certainly with patronage if not with money, to become informers and accusers. And when tales, which their characters alone ought to discredit, are refuted by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and facts which oblige the patrons of them to abandon their support, they still continue in corroding whispers to wear away the reputations which they could not directly subvert. If, luckily for the conspirators against honest fame, any little foible or folly can be traced out in one, whom they desire to persecute, it becomes at once in their hands a two-edged sword, by which to wound the public character and stab the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate felicity of the person. With such men, nothing is sacred. Even the peace of an unoffending and amiable wife is a welcome repast to their insatiate fury against the husband.</p>
            <p>In the gratification of this baleful spirit, we not only hear the jacobin news-papers continually ring with odious insinuations and charges against many of our most virtuous citizens; but, not satisfied with this, a measure new in this country has been lately adopted to give greater efficacy to the system of defamation—periodical pamphlets issue from the same presses, full freighted with misrepresentation and falshood, carefully calculated to hold up the opponents of the FACTION to the jealousy and distrust of the present generation and if possible, to transmit their names with dishonor to posterity. Even the great and multiplied services, the tried and rarely equalled virtues of a WASHINGTON, can secure no exemption.</p>
            <p>How then can I, with pretensions every way inferior expect to escape? And if truly this be, as every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance indicates, a conspiracy of vice against virtue, ought I not rather to be flattered, that I have been so long and so peculiarly an object of persecution? Ought
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032222_0005_0FF19891DB810BD0"/>
I to regret, if there be any thing about me, so formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to the Faction as to have made me worthy to be distinguished by the plenitude of its rancour and venom?</p>
            <p>It is certain that I have had a pretty copious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its malignity. For the honor of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is to be hoped that the examples are not numerous of men so greatly calumniated and persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I have been, with so little cause.</p>
            <p>I dare appeal to my immediate fellow citizens of whatever political party for the truth of the assertions that no man ever carried into public life a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemished pecuniary reputation, than that with which I undertook the office of Secretary of the Treasury; a character marked by a indifference to the acquisition of property rather than by an avidity for it.</p>
            <p>With such a character, however natural it was to expect criticism and opposition, as to the political principles which I might manifest or be supposed to entertain, as to the wisdom or expediency of the plans, which I might propose, or as to the skill, care or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with which the business of my department might be executed, it was not natural to expect nor did I expect that my fidelity or integrity in a pecuniary sense would ever be called in question.</p>
            <p>But on this head a mortifying disappointment has been experienced. Without the slightest foundation, I have been repeatedly held up to the suspicions of the world as a man directed in his administration by the most sordid views; who did not scruple to sacrifice the public to his private interest, his duty and honor to the sinister accumulation of wealth.</p>
            <p>Merely because I <hi>retained</hi> an opinion once common to me and the most influencial of those who opposed me, <hi>That the public debt ought to be provided for on the basis of the contract upon which it was created,</hi> I have been wickedly accused with wantonly increasing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032222_0006_0FF19894D14C4C88"/>
burthen many millions, in order to promote a stock-jobbing interest of myself and friends.</p>
            <p>Merely because a member of the House of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives entertained a different idea from me, as to the legal effect of appropriation laws, and did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand accounts, I was exposed to the imputation of having committed a deliberate and criminal violation of the laws and to the suspicion of being a defaulter for millions; so as to have been driven to the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful necessity of calling for a formal and solemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>The inquiry took place. It was conducted by a committee of fifteen members of the House of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives—a majority of them either my decided po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical enemies or inclined against me, some of them the most active and intelligent of my opponents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a single man, who being known to be friendly to me, possessed also such knowledge and experience of public affairs as would enable him to counteract inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intrigues. Mr. Giles of Virginia who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced the attack was of the committee.</p>
            <p>The officers and books of the treasury were examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The transactions between the several banks and the treasury were scrutinized. Even my <hi>private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts</hi> with those institutions were laid open to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee; and every possible facility given to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. The result was a complete demonstration that the suspicions which had been entertained were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>Those which had taken the fastest hold were, that the public monies had been made subservient to loans, discounts and accommodations to myself and friends. The committee in reference to this point reported thus: "It appears from the affidavits of the Cashier and several officers of the bank of the United States and several of the directors, the Cashier, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the bank of New-York, that the Secretary
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032222_0007_0FF1989A8F35BCE0"/>
of the Treasury never has either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly,</hi> for himself or any other person, procured any discount or credit from either of the said banks upon the basis of any public monies which at any time have been deposited therein under his direction: And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee are <hi>satisfied,</hi> that <hi>no monies</hi> of the United States, whether <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> they have passed to the credit of the Treasurer have ever been <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> used for or applied to <hi>any purposes</hi> but those of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except so far as all monies deposited in a bank are concerned in the <hi>general operations</hi> thereof."</p>
            <p>The report, which I have always understood was unanimous, contains in other respects, with consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able detail the materials of a complete exculpation. My enemies, finding no handle for their malice, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the pursuit.</p>
            <p>Yet unwilling to leave any ambiguity upon the point, when I determined to resign my office, I gave early previous notice of it to the House of Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, for the declared purpose of affording an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for legislative crimination, if any ground for it had been discovered. Not the least step towards it was taken. From which I have a right to infer the universal conviction of the House, that no cause ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isted, and to consider the result as a complete vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>On another occasion, a worthless man of the name of Fraunces found encouragement to bring forward to the House of Representatives a formal charge against me of unfaithful conduct in office. A Committee of the House was appointed to inquire, consisting in this case also, partly of some of my most intelligent and active enemies.—The issue was an unanimous excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of me as will appear by the following extract from the Journals of the House of Representatives of the 19th of February 1794.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:032222_0008_0FF1989C1F8F5880"/>The House resumed the consideration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Committee, to whom was referred the memorial of Andrew G. Fraunces: whereupon, <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the reasons assigned by the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the treasury, for refusing payment of the warrants referred to in the memorial, are fully sufficient to justify his conduct; and that in the whole course of this transaction, the secretary and other officers of the treasury, have acted a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious part towards the public.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the charge exhibited in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, against the secretary of the treasury, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the purchase of the pension of Baron de Glaubeck is wholly illiberal and groundless<note n="*" place="bottom">Would it be believed after all this, that Mr. Jefferson Vice President of the United States would write to this Fraunces friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly letters? Yet such is the fact as will be seen in the Appendix, Nos. XLIV &amp; XLV.</note>.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Was it not to have been expected that these repeated demonstrations of the injustice of the accusations ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded against me would have abashed the enterprise of my calumniators? However natural such an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may seem, it would betray an ignorance of the true character of the Jacobin system. It is a maxim deeply ingrasted in that dark system, that no character, however upright, is a match for constantly reiterated attacks, however false. It is well understood by its disciples, that every calumny makes some proselites and even retains some; since justification seldom cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates as rapidly and as widely as slander. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those who from doubt proceed to suspicion and thence to belief of imputed guilt is continually augmenting; and the public mind fatigued at length with resistance to the calumnies which eternally affail it, is apt in the end to sit down with the opinion that a person so often accused cannot be entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032222_0009_0FF1989DE279ED80"/>Relying upon this weakness of human nature, the Jacobin Scandal-Club though often defeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly return to the charge. Old calumnies are served up a-fresh and every pretext is seized to add to the catalogue—The person whom they seek to blacken, by dint of repeated strokes of their brush, becomes a demon in their own eyes, though he might be pure and bright as an angel but for the daubing of those wizard painters.</p>
            <p>Of all the vile attempts which have been made to injure my character that which has been lately revived in No. V and VI, of the history of the United States for 1796 is the most vile. This it will be impossible for any <hi>intelligent,</hi> I will not say <hi>candid,</hi> man to doubt, when he shall have accompanied me through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
            <p>I owe perhaps to my friends an apology for conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to give a public explanation. A just pride with reluctance stoops to a formal vindication against so despicable a contrivance and is inclined rather to oppose to it the uniform evidence of an upright cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. This would be my conduct on the present occasion, did not the tale seem to derive a sanction from the names of three men of some weight and consequence in the society: a circumstance, which I trust will excuse me for paying attention to a slander that without this prop, would defeat itself by intrinsic circumstances of absurdity and malice.</p>
            <p>The charge against me is a connection with one James Reynolds for purposes of improper pecuniary speculation. My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife, for a considerable time with his privity and connivance, if not originally brought on by a combination between the husband and wife with the design to extort money from me.</p>
            <p>This confession is not made without a blush. I cannot be the apologist of any vice because the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032222_0010_0FF198A1C870B4A0"/>
ardour of passion may have made it mine. I can never cease to condemn myself for the pang, which it may inflict in a bosom eminently intitled to all my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, fidelity and love. But that bosom will approve, that even at so great an expence, I should effectually wipe away a more serious stain from a name, which it cherishes with no less elevation than tenderness. The public too will I trust excuse the confession. The necessity of it to my defence against a more heinous charge could alone have extorted from me so painful an indecorum.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to an exhibition of the positive proof which repels the charge, I shall analize the documents from which it is deduced, and I am mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken if with discerning and candid minds more would be necessary. But I desire to obviate the suspicions of the most suspicious.</p>
            <p>The first reflection which occurs on a perusal of the documents is that it is morally impossible I should have been foolish as well as depraved enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy so vile an instrument as <hi>Reynolds</hi> for such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant ends,</hi> as are indicated by different parts of the story itself—My enemies to be sure have kindly pourtrayed me as another <hi>Chartres</hi> on the score of moral principle. But they have been ever bountiful in ascribing to me talents. It has suited their purpose to exaggerate such as I may possess, and to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them an influence to which they are not intitled. But the present accusation imputes to me as much folly as wickedness—All the documents shew, and it is otherwise matter of notoriety, that Reynolds was an obscure, unimportant and profligate man. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more weak, because nothing could be more unsafe than to make use of such an instrument; to use him too without any intermediate agent more worthy of confidence who might keep me out of sight, to write him numerous letters recording the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032222_0011_0FF198A76C535DC8"/>
objects of the improper connection (for this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and that the letters were afterwards burnt at my request) to unbosom myself to him with a prodigality of confidence, by very unnecessarily telling him, as he alleges, of a connection in speculation between myself and Mr. Duer. It is very extraordinary, if the head of the money department of a country, being unprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled enough to sacrifice his trust and his integrity, could not have contrived objects of profit sufficiently large to have engaged the co-operation of men of far greater importance than Reynolds, and with whom there could have been due safety, and should have been driven to the necessity of unkennelling such a reptile to be the instrument of his cupidity.</p>
            <p>But, moreover, the scale of the concern with Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, such as it is presented, is contemptibly narrow for a rapacious speculating secretary of the treasury. <hi>Clingman, Reynolds</hi> and his wife were manifestly in very close confidence with each other. It seems there was a free communication of secrets. Yet in clubbing their different items of information as to the supplies of money which Reynolds received from me, what do they amount to? <hi>Clingman</hi> states, that Mrs. Reynolds told him, that at a certain time her husband had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from me upwards of eleven hundred dollars. A note is produced which shews that at one time fifty dollars were sent to him, and another note is produced, by which and the information of Reynolds himself through Clingman, it appears that at another time 300 dollars were asked and refused—Another sum of 200 dollars is spoken of by <hi>Clingman</hi> as having been furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Reynolds at some other time. What a scale of speculation is this for the head of a public treasury, for one who in the very publication that brings forward the charge is represented as having procured to be fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at forty millions a debt which ought to have been discharged at ten or fifteen millions for the criminal
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032222_0012_0FF198A90123C750"/>
purpose of enriching himself and his friends? He must have been a clumsy knave, if he did not secure enough of this excess of twenty five or thirty millions, to have taken away all inducement to risk his character in such bad hands and in so huckstering a way—or to have enabled him, if he did employ such an agent, to do it with more means and to better purpose. It is curious, that this rapacious secretary should at one time have furnished his speculating agent with the paltry sum of fifty dollars, at another, have refused him the inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable sum of 300 dollars, declaring upon his honor that it was not in his power to furnish it. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was true or not; if the last the refusal ill comports with the idea of a speculating connection—if the first, it is very singular that the head of the treasury engaged without scruple in schemes of profit should have been destitute of so small a sum—But if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this officer to be living upon an inadequate salary, without any collateral pursuits of gain, the appearances then are simple and intelligible enough, applying to them the true key.</p>
            <p>It appears that <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Clingman</hi> were detected by the then comptroller of the treasury, in the odious crime of suborning a witness to commit perjury, for the purpose of obtaining letters of administration on the estate of a person who was living in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a small sum of money due to him from the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury—It is certainly extraordinary that the confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial agent of the head of that department should have been in circumstances to induce a resort to so miserable an expedient. It is odd, if there was a speculating connection, that it was not more profitable both to the secretary and to his agent than are indicated by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances disclosed.</p>
            <p>It is also a remarkable and very instructive fact, that notwithstanding the great confidence and intimacy, which subsisted between <hi>Clingman, Reynolds</hi> and his wife,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032222_0013_0FF198AA94E78830"/>
and which continued till after the period of the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two former from the prosecution against them, neither of them has ever specified the objects of the pretended connection in speculation between Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds and me. The pretext that the letters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the evidence were destroyed is no answer. They could not have been forgotten and might have been disclosed from memory. The total omission of this could only have proceeded from the consideration that detail might have led to detection. The destruction of letters besides is a fiction, which is refuted not only by the general improbability, that I should put myself upon paper with so despicable a person on a subject which might expose me to infamy, but by the evidence of extreme caution on my part in this particular, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting from the laconic an disguised form of the notes which are produced—They prove incontestibly that there was an unwillingness to trust Reynolds with my hand writing. The true reason was, that I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he might make use of it to impress upon others the belief of some pecuniary connection with me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides implicating my character might render it the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of a false credit, or turn it to some other sinister use—Hence the disguise; for my conduct in admitting at once and without hesitation that the notes were from me proves that it was never my intention by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient of disguising my hand to shelter myself from any serious inquiry.</p>
            <p>The accusation against me was never heard of 'till Clingman and Reynolds were under prosecution by the treasury for an infamous crime—It will be seen by the document No. I (a) that during the endeavours of <hi>Clingman</hi> to obtain relief, through the interposition of Mr. Mughlenberg, he made to the latter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of my pretended criminality. It will be further seen by document No. 2 that Reynolds had while in prison conveyed to the ears of Messrs. Monroe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032222_0014_0FF198AC337C4858"/> 
and Venable that he could give intelligence of my being concerned in speculation, and that he also supposed that he was kept in prison by a design on my part to oppress him and drive him away. And by his letter to <hi>Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of the 13 of December, after he was released from prison, it also appears that he was actuated by a spirit of revenge against me; for he declares that he will have <hi>satisfaction</hi> from me <hi>at all events;</hi> adding, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to <hi>Clingman,</hi> "And <hi>you only I trust."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three important inferences flow from these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances—one that the accusation against me was an auxiliary to the efforts of <hi>Clingman</hi> and <hi>Reynolds</hi> to get released from a disgraceful prosecution—another that there was a vindictive spirit against me at least on the part of Reynolds—the third, that he confided in <hi>Clingman</hi> as a coadjutor in the plan of vengeance. These circumstances, according to every estimate of the credit due to accusers, ought to destroy their tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony. To what credit are persons intitled, who in telling a story are governed by the double motive of escaping from disgrace and punishment and of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying revenge?—As to Mrs. Reynolds, if she was not an accomplice, as it is too probable she was, her situation would naturally subject her to the will of her husband. But enough besides will appear in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel to shew that her testimony merits no attention.</p>
            <p>The letter which has been just cited deserves a more particular attention—As it was produced by Clingman, there is a chasm of three lines, which lines are manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly essential to explain the sense. It may be inferred from the context, that these deficient lines would unfold the cause of the resentment which is expressed. 'T was from them that might have been learnt the true nature of the transaction. The expunging of them is a violent presumption that they would have contradicted the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for which the letter was produced—A witness of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering such a mutilated piece descredits himself. The
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032222_0015_0FF198ADF2AE4610"/>
mutilation is alone satisfactory proof of contrivance and imposition. The manner of accounting for it is frivol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>The words of the letter are strong—satisfaction is to be had <hi>at all events, per fas et nefas,</hi> and <hi>Clingman</hi> is the chosen confidential agent of the laudable plan of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. It must be confessed he was not wanting in his part.</p>
            <p>Reynolds, as will be seen by No. II (a) alleges that a merchant came to him and offered as a volunteer to be his bail, who he suspected had been instigated to it by me, and after being decoyed to the place the merchant wished to carry him to, he refused being his bail, unless he would deposit a sum of money to some considerable amount which he could not do and was in consequence committed to prison. Clingman (No. IV a) tells the same story in substance though with some difference in form leaving to be implied what Reynolds expresses and naming <hi>Henry Seckel</hi> as the merchant. The deposition of this respectable citizen (No. XXIII) gives the lie to both, and shews that he was in fact the agent of <hi>Clingman,</hi> from motives of good will to him, as his former book-keeper, that he never had any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with me concerning either of them till after they were both in custody, that when he came as a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger to me from one of them, I not only declined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing in their behalf, but informed Mr. Seckel that they had been guilty of a crime and advised him to have nothing to do with them.</p>
            <p>This single fact goes far to invalidate the whole story. It shews painly the disregard of truth and the malice by which the parties were actuated. Other important inferences are to be drawn from the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. Had I been conscious that I had any thing to fear from <hi>Reynolds</hi> of the nature which has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, should I have warned Mr. <hi>Seckel</hi> against hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to do with them? Should I not rather
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032222_0016_0FF198B102942FD0"/>
have encouraged him to have come to their assistance? Should I not have been eager to promote their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? But this is not the only instance, in which I acted a contrary part. <hi>Clingman</hi> testifies in No. V. that I would not permit <hi>Fraunces</hi> a clerk in my office to become their bail, but signified to him that if he did it, he must quit the department.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clingman</hi> states in No. IV. (a) that my note in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Reynolds' application for a loan towards a subscription to the <hi>Lancaster Turnpike</hi> was in his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session from about the time it was written (June 1792.) This circumstance, apparently trivial, is very expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory. To what end had <hi>Clingman</hi> the custody of this note all that time if it was not part of a project to lay the foundation for some false accusation?</p>
            <p>It appears from No. V. that <hi>Fraunces</hi> had said, or was stated to have said, something to my prejudice. If my memory serves me aright, it was that he had been my agent in some speculations. When <hi>Fraunces</hi> was interrogated concerning it, he absolutely denied that he had said any thing of the kind. The charge which this same <hi>Fraunces</hi> afterwards preferred against me to the House of Representatives, and the fate of it, have been already mentioned. It is illustrative of the nature of the combination which was formed against me.</p>
            <p>There are other features in the documents which are relied upon to constitute the charge against me, that are of a nature to corroborate the inference to be drawn from the particulars which have been noticed. But there is no need to be over minute. I am much mistaken if the view which has been taken of the subject is not sufficient, without any thing further, to establish my innocence with every discerning and fair mind.</p>
            <p>I proceed in the next place to offer a frank and plain solution of the enigma, by giving a history of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and progress of my connection with Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032222_0017_0FF198B750354AC0"/>
of its discovery, real and pretended by the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and of the disagreeable embarrassments to which it exposed me. This history will be supported by the letters of Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, which leave no room for doubt of the principal facts, and at the same time explain with precision the objects of the little notes from me which have been published, shewing clearly that such of them as have related to money had no reference to any concern in speculation. As the situation which will be disclosed, will fully explain every ambiguous appearance, and meet satisfactorily the written documents, nothing more can be requisite to my justification. For frail indeed will be the tenure by which the most blameless man will hold his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the assertions of three of the most abandoned characters in the community, two of them stigmatized by the discrediting crime which has been mentioned, are sufficient to blast it—The business of accusation would soon become in such a case, a regular trade, and men's reputations would be bought and sold like any marketable commodity.</p>
            <p>Some time in the summer of the year 1791 a woman called at my house in the city of Philadelphia and asked to speak with me in private. I attended her into a room apart from the family. With a seeming air of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction she informed that she was a daughter of a Mr. Lewis, sister to a Mr. G. Livingston of the State of New-York, and wife to a Mr. Reynolds whose father was in the Commissary Department during the war with Great Britain, that her husband, who for a long time had treated her very cruelly, had lately left her, to live with another woman, and in so destitute a condition, that though desirous of returning to her friends she had not the means—that knowing I was a citizen of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York, she had taken the liberty to apply to my humanity for assistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032222_0018_0FF198B8EA4866E0"/>I replied, that her situation was a very interesting one—that I was disposed to afford her assistance to convey her to her friends, but this at the moment not being convenient to me (which was the fact) I must request the place of her residence, to which I should bring or send a small supply of money. She told me the street and the number of the house where she lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the evening I put a bank-bill in my pocket and went to the house. I inquired for Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds and was shewn up stairs, at the head of which she met me and conducted me into a bed room. I took the bill out of my pocket and gave it to her.—Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable.</p>
            <p>After this, I had frequent meetings with her, most of them at my own house; Mrs. Hamilton with her children being absent on a visit to her father. In the course of a short time, she mentioned to me that her husband had solicited a reconciliation, and affected to consult me about it. I advised to it, and was soon after informed by her that it had taken place. She told me besides that her husband had been engaged in specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and she believed could give information respecting the conduct of some persons in the department which would be useful. I sent for Reynolds who came to me accordingly.</p>
            <p>In the course of our interview, he confessed that he had obtained a list of claims from a person in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment which he had made use of in his speculations. I invited him, by the expectation of my friendship and good offices, to disclose the person. After some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of scruple, he pretended to yield, and ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the infidelity to Mr. Duer from whom he said he had obtained the list in New-York, while he (Duer) was in the department.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:032222_0019_0FF198BA8FEFB640"/>As Mr. Duer had resigned his office some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the seat of government was removed to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; this discovery, if it had been true, was not very important—yet it was the interest of my passions to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to set value upon it, and to continue the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friendship and good offices. Mr. Reynolds told me he was going to Virginia, and on his return would point out something in which I could serve him. I do not know but he said something about employment in a public office.</p>
            <p>On his return he asked employment as a clerk in the treasury department. The knowledge I had acquired of him was decisive against such a request. I parried it by telling him, what was true, that there was no vacancy in my immediate office, and that the appointment of clerks in the other branches of the department was left to the chiefs of the respective branches. Reynolds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, as <hi>Clingman</hi> relates No. IV (a) as a topic of complaint against me that I had promised him <hi>employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and had <hi>disappointed</hi> him. The situation with the wife would naturally incline me to conciliate this man. It is possible I may have used vague expressions which raised expectation; but the more I learned of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the more inadmissible his employment in a public office became. Some material reflections will occur here to a discerning mind. Could I have preferred my private gratification to the public interest, should I not have found the employment he desired for a man, whom it was so convenient to me, on my own statement, to lay under obligations. Had I had any such connection with him, as he has since pretended, is it likely that he would have wanted other employment? Or is it likely that wanting it, I should have hazarded his resentment by a persevering refusal? This little circumstance shews at once the delicacy of my conduct, in its public relations, and the impossibility of my having had the connection pretended with Reynolds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032222_0020_0FF198BC91EDEF70"/>The intercourse with Mrs. Reynolds, in the mean time, continued; and, though various reflections, (in which a further knowledge of Reynolds' character and the suspicion of some concert between the husband and wife bore a part) induced me to wish a cessation of it; yet her conduct, made it extremely difficult to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle myself. All the appearances of violent attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of agonising distress at the idea of a relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment, were played off with a most imposing art. This, though it did not make me entirely the dupe of the plot, yet kept me in a state of irresolution. My sensibility, perhaps my vanity, admitted the possibility of a real fondness; and led me to adopt the plan of a gradual discontinuance rather than of a sudden inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as least calculated to give pain, if a real par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality existed.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Reynolds, on the other hand, employed every effort to keep up my attention and visits—Her pen was freely employed, and her letters were filled with those tender and pathetic effusions which would have been natural to a woman truly fond and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
            <p>One day, I received a letter from her, which is in the appendix (No. I. b) intimating a discovery by her husband. It was matter of doubt with me whether there had been really a discovery by accident, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the time for the catastrophe of the plot was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
            <p>The same day, being the 15th of December 1791, I received from Mr. Reynolds the letter (No. II. b) by which he informs me of the detection of his wife in the act of writing a letter to me, and that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from her a discovery of her connection with me, suggesting that it was the consequence of an undue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage taken of her distress.</p>
            <p>In answer to this I sent him a note, or message de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him to call upon me at my office, which I think he did the same day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:032222_0021_0FF198C1217AA9D8"/>He in substance repeated the topics contained in his letter, and concluded as he had done there, that he was resolved to have satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I replied that he knew best what evidence he had of the alleged connection between me and his wife, that I neither admitted nor denied it—that if he knew of any injury I had done him, intitling him to satisfaction, it lay with him to name it.</p>
            <p>He travelled over the same ground as before, and again concluded with the same vague claim of satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but without specifying the kind, which would content him—It was easy to understand that he wanted money, and to prevent an explosion, I resolved to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him. But willing to manage his delicacy, if he had any, I reminded him that I had at our first inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view made him a promise of service, that I was dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do it as far as might be proper, and in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and requested him to consider in what manner I could do it, and to write to me—He withdrew with a promise of compliance.</p>
            <p>Two days after, the 17th of December, he wrote me the letter (No. III. b) The evident drift of this letter is to exaggerate the injury done by me, to make a display of sensibility and to magnify the atonement, which was to be required. It however comes to no conclusion, but proposes a meeting at the <hi>George Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> or at some other place more agreeable to me, which I should name.</p>
            <p>On receipt of this letter, I called upon Reynolds, and assuming a decisive tone, told him, that I was tired of his indecision, and insisted upon his declaring to me explicitly what it was he aimed at—He again promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to explain by letter.</p>
            <p>On the 19th, I received the promised letter (No.IV.b) the essence of which is that he was willing to take a thousand dollars as the plaister for his wounded honor.</p>
            <p>I determined to give it to him, and did so in two pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032222_0022_0FF1988017296D98"/>
as per receipts (No. V and VI) dated the 22nd of December and 3d of January. It is a little remarkable, that an avaricious speculating secretary of the treasury should have been so straitened for money as to be obliged to satisfy an engagement of this sort by two different payments!</p>
            <p>On the 17th of January, I received the letter No. V. by which Reynolds invites me to <hi>renew my visits to his wife.</hi> He had before requested that I would see her no more. The motive to this step appears in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the letter, <hi>"I rely</hi> upon your befriending me, <hi>if there should any thing offer that should be to my advantage,</hi> as you <hi>express a wish to befriend me."</hi> Is the pre-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a speculating connection reconcilcable with this mode of expression?</p>
            <p>If I recollect rightly, I did not immediately accept the invitation, nor 'till after I had received several very importunate letters from Mrs. Reynolds—See her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters No. VIII, (b) IX, X.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of March following, I received a letter from <hi>Reynolds,</hi> No. XI, and on the same day one from his wife, No. XII. These letters will further illustrate the obliging co-operation of the husband with his wife to aliment and keep alive my connection with her.</p>
            <p>The letters from Reynolds, No. XIII to XVI, are an additional comment upon the same plan. It was a persevering scheme to spare no pains to levy contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon my passions on the one hand, and upon my apprehensions of discovery on the other. It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to No. XIV that my note, in these words, was an answer: "To-morrow what is requested will be done. 'Twill hardly be possible <hi>to-day.".</hi> The letter presses for the loan which is asked for <hi>to-day.</hi> A scarcity of cash, which was not very uncommon, is believed to have modelled the reply.</p>
            <p>The letter No. XVII is a master-piece. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band there forbids my future visits to his wife, chiefly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032222_0023_0FF198C78AFE4CF0"/>
because I was careful to avoid publicity. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably necessary to the project of some deeper treason against me that I should be seen at the house. Hence was it contrived, with all the caution on my part to avoid it, that <hi>Clingman</hi> should occasionally see me.</p>
            <p>The interdiction was every way welcome, and was I believe, strictly observed. On the second of June following, I received the letter No. XVIII, from Mrs. Reynolds, which proves that it was not her plan yet to let me off—It was probably the prelude to the letter from Reynolds, No. XIX, soliciting a <hi>loan</hi> of 300 dollars towards a subscription to the Lancaster Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike. <hi>Clingman's</hi> statement, No. IV, admits, on the information of Reynolds, that to this letter the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing note from me was an answer—<hi>"It is utterly out of my power I assure you 'pon my honour to comply with your request. Your note is returned."</hi> The letter itself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates, that here was no concern in speculation on my part—that the money is asked as a <hi>favour</hi> and as a <hi>loan,</hi> to be reimbursed simply and without profit <hi>in less than a fortnight.</hi> My answer shews that even the loan was refused.</p>
            <p>The letter No. XX, from <hi>Reynolds,</hi> explains the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my note in these words, <hi>"Inclosed are 50 dollars, they could not be sent sooner,"</hi> proving that this sum also was begged for in a very apologetic stile as a mere loan.</p>
            <p>The letters of the 24th and 30th of August, No. XXI and XXII, furnish the key to the affair of the 200 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars mentioned by <hi>Clingman</hi> in No. IV, shewing that this sum likewise was asked by way of loan, towards fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing a small boarding-house which <hi>Reynolds</hi> and his wife were or pretended to be about to set up.</p>
            <p>These letters collectively, furnish a complete eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the nature of my transactions with <hi>Reynolds.</hi> They resolve them into an amorous connection with his wife, detected, or pretended to be detected by the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032222_0024_0FF198CE85266F88"/>
husband, imposing on me the necessity of a pecuniary composition with him, and leaving me afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a duress for fear of disclosure, which was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of levying upon me from time to time <hi>forced loans</hi>—They apply directly to this state of things, the notes which <hi>Reynolds</hi> was so careful to preserve, and which had been employed to excite suspicion.</p>
            <p>Four, and the principal of these notes have been not only generally, but particularly explained—I shall briefly notice the remaining two.</p>
            <p>"My dear Sir, I expected to have heard the day after I had the pleasure of seeing you." This frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if truly part of a letter to <hi>Reynolds,</hi> denotes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a disposition to be civil to a man, whom, as I said before, it was the interest of my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to conciliate. But I verily believe it was not part of a letter to him, because I do not believe that I ever addressed him in such a stile—It may very well have been part of a letter to some other person, procured by means of which I am ignorant, or it may have been the beginning of an intended letter, torn off, thrown into the chimney in my office, which was a common practice, and there or after it had been swept out picked up by Reynolds or some coadjutor of his. There appears to have been more than one clerk in the department some how connected with him.</p>
            <p>The endeavour shewn by the letter No. XVII, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to render my visits to Mrs. Reynolds more public, and the great care with which my little notes were preserved, justify the belief that at a period, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was attempted, the idea of implicating me in some accusation, with a view to the advantage of the accusers, was entertained. Hence the motive to pick up and preserve any fragment which might favour the idea of friendly or confidential correspondence.</p>
            <p>2dly. "The person Mr. Reynolds inquired for on Friday waited for him all the evening at his house from
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032222_0025_0FF198D01BFD8318"/>
a little after seven. Mr. R. may see him at any time to-day or to-morrow between the hours of two and three."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Reynolds more than once communicated to me, that Reynolds would occasionally relapse into discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at his situation—would treat her very ill—hint at the assassination of me—and more openly threaten, by way of revenge, to inform Mrs. Hamilton—all this naturally gave some uneasiness. I could not be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely certain whether it was artifice or reality—In the workings of human inconsistency, it was very possible, that the same man might be corrupt enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for his wife's chastity and yet have sensibility enough to be restless in the situation and to hate the cause of it.</p>
            <p>Reflections like these induced me for some time to use palliatives with the ill humours which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to me. Reynolds had called upon me in one of these dicontented moods real or pretended. I was unwilling to provoke him by the appearance of neglect—and having failed to be at home at the hour he had been permitted to call, I wrote her the above note to obviate an ill impression.</p>
            <p>The foregoing narrative and the remarks accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it have prepared the way for a perusal of the letters themselves. The more attention is used in this, the more entire will be the satisfaction which they will afford.</p>
            <p>It has been seen that an explanation on the subject was had contemporarily that is in December 1792, with three members of Congress—F. A. Muhlenberg, J. Monroe, and A. Venable. It is proper that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this transaction should be accurately understood.</p>
            <p>The manner in which Mr. Muhlenberg became engaged in the affair is fully set forth in the document (No. I. a). It is not equally clear how the two other
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032222_0026_0FF198D2ACC09AA0"/>
gentlemen came to embark in it. The phraseology, in reference to this point in the close of (No. I.) and beginning of (No. II.) is rather equivocal. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, if they please, can explain it.</p>
            <p>But on the morning of the 15th of December 1792, the above mentioned gentlemen presented themselves at my office. Mr. Muhlenberg was then speaker. He introduced the subject by observing to me, that they <hi>had discovered a very improper connection</hi> between me and a Mr. Reynolds: extremely hurt by this mode of introduction, I arrested the progress of the discourse by giving way to very strong expressions of indignation. The gentlemen explained, telling me in substance that I had misapprehended them—that they did not intend to take the fact for established—that their meaning was to apprise me that unsought by them, information had been given them of an improper pecuniary connection between Mr. Reynolds and myself; that they had thought it their duty to pursue it and had become pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of some documents of a suspicious complexion—that they had contemplated the laying the matter before the President, but before the did this, they thought it right to apprise me of the affair and to afford an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of explanation; declaring at the same time that their agency in the matter was influenced solely by a sense of public duty and by no motive of personal ill will. If my memory be correct, the notes from me in a disguised hand were now shewn to me which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moment's hesitation I acknowledged to be mine.</p>
            <p>I replied, that the affair was now put upon a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent footing—that I always stood ready to meet fair inquiry with frank communication—that it happened, in the present instance, to be in my power by written documents to remove all doubt as to the real nature of the business, and fully to convince, that nothing of the kind imputed to me did in fact exist. The same even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my house was by mutual consent appointed for an explanation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:032222_0027_0FF198D85FA91270"/>I immediately after saw Mr. Wolcott, and for the first time informed him of the affair and of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view just had; and delivering into his hands for peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal the documents of which I was possessed, I engaged him to be present at the intended explanation in the evening.</p>
            <p>In the evening the proposed meeting took place, and Mr. Wolcott according to my request attended. The information, which had been received to that time, from <hi>Clingman, Reynolds</hi> and his wife, was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me and the notes were I think again exhibited.</p>
            <p>I stated in explanation, the circumstances of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair with Mrs. Reynolds and the consequences of it and in confirmation produced the documents (No. I. b, to XXII.) One or more of the gentlemen (Mr. Wolcott's certificate No. XXIV, mentions one, Mr. Venable, but I think the same may be said of Mr. Muhlenberg) was struck with so much conviction, before I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten through the communication that they delicately urged me to discontinue it as unnecessary. I insisted upon going through the whole and did so. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult was a full and unequivocal acknowlegement on the part of the three gentlemen of perfect satisfaction with the explanation and expressions of regret at the trouble and embarrassment which had been occasioned to me. Mr. Muhlenberg and Mr. Venable, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manifested a degree of sensibility on the occasion. Mr. Monroe was more cold but intirely explicit.</p>
            <p>One of the gentlemen, I think, expressed a hope that I also was satisfied with their conduct in conducting the inquiry—I answered, that they knew I had been hurt at the opening of the affair—that this excepted, I was satisfied with their conduct and considered myself as having been treated with candor or with fairness and liberality, I do not now pretend to recollect the exact terms. I took the next morning a memorandum of the substance of what was said to me, which will be seen
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032222_0028_0FF198D9F1337968"/>
by a copy of it transmitted in a letter to each of the gentlemen No. XXV.</p>
            <p>I deny absolutely, as alleged by the editor of the publication in question, that I intreated a suspension of the communication to the President, or that from the beginning to the end of the inquiry, I asked any favour or indulgence whatever, and that I discovered any symptom different from that of a proud consciousness of innocence.</p>
            <p>Some days after the explanation I wrote to the three gentlemen the letter No. XXVI already published. That letter evinces the light in which I considered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as standing in their view.</p>
            <p>I received from Mr. Muhlenberg and Mr. Monroe in answer the letters No. XXVII and XXVIII.</p>
            <p>Thus the affair remained 'till the pamphlets No. V and VI of the history of the U. States for 1796 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; with the exception of some dark whispers which were communicated to me by a friend in Virginia, and to which I replied by a statement of what had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>When I saw No. V though it was evidence of a base infidelity somewhere, yet firmly believing that nothing more than a want of due care was chargeable upon either of the three gentlemen who had made the inquiry, I immediately wrote to each of them a letter of which No. XXV is a copy in full confidence that their answer would put the whole business at rest. I ventured to believe, from the appearances on their part at closing our former interview on the subject, that their answers would have been both cordial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that I was astonished when I came to read in the pamphlet No. VI the conclusion of the document No. V, containing the equivocal phrase <hi>"We left him under an impression our suspicions were removed,"</hi> which seemed to imply that this had been a mere piece
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032222_0029_0FF198DB8C9EF118"/>
of management, and that the impression given me had not been reciprocal. The appearance of duplicity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed me; but resolving to proceed with caution and moderation, I thought the first proper step was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the gentlemen whether the paper was genuine. A letter was written for this purpose the copy of which I have mislaid.</p>
            <p>I afterwards received from Messrs. Muhlenberg and Venable the letters No. XXIX, XXX, and XXXI.</p>
            <p>Receiving no answer from Mr. Monroe, and hearing of his arrival at New-York I called upon him. The issue of the interview was that an answer was to be given by him, in conjunction with Mr. Muhlenberg and Mr. Venable on his return to Philadelphia, he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as the agency had been joint it was most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the answer should be joint, and informing me that Mr. Venable had told him he would wait his return.</p>
            <p>I came to Philadelphia accordingly to bring the affair to a close; but on my arrival I found Mr. Venable had left the city for Virginia.</p>
            <p>Mr. Monroe reached Philadelphia according to his appointment. And the morning following wrote me the note No. XXXII. While this note was on its way to my lodgings I was on my way to his—I had a conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him from which we separated with a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the assurance in the note—In the course of the interviews with Mr. Monroe, the <hi>equivoque</hi> in docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment No. V, (a) and the paper of January 2d, 1793, under his signature were noticed.</p>
            <p>I received the day following the letter No. XXXIII, to which I returned the answer No. XXXIV,—accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the letter No. XXXV. which was succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the letters No. XXVI—XXXVII—XXXVIII—XXXIX—XL. In due time the sequel of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence will appear.</p>
            <p>Though extremely disagreeable to me, for very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious reasons, I at length determined in order that no
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032222_0030_0FF198DEF11BC318"/>
cloud whatever might be left on the affair, to publish the documents which had been communicated to Messrs. Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable, all which will be seen in the appendix from No. I, (b) to No. XXII, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively.</p>
            <p>The information from <hi>Clingman</hi> of the 2d January 1793, to which the signature of Mr. Monroe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, seems to require an observation or two in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to what is contained in my letter to him No. XXXIX.</p>
            <p>Clingman first suggests that he had been apprized of my vindication through Mr. Wolcott a day or two after it had been communicated. It did not occur to me to inquire of Mr. Wolcott on this point, and he being now absent from Philadelphia, I cannot do it at this moment. Though I can have no doubt of the friendly intention of Mr. Wolcott, if the suggestion of Clingman in this particular be taken as true; yet from the condition of secrecy which was annexed to my communication, there is the strongest reason to conclude it is not true—If not true, there is besides but one of two solutions, either that he obtained the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from one of the three gentlemen who made the inquiry, which would have been a very dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able act in the party, or that he conjectured what my defence was from what he before knew it truly could be—For there is the highest probability, that through Reynolds and his wife, and as an accomplice, he was privy to the whole affair. This last method of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for his knowledge would be conclusive on the sincerity and genuineness of the defence.</p>
            <p>But the turn which <hi>Clingman</hi> gives to the matter must necessarily fall to the ground. It is, that Mrs. Reynolds denied her amorous connection with me, and represented the suggestion of it as a mere contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance between <hi>her husband</hi> and <hi>myself</hi> to cover me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging that there had been a fabrication of letters and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032222_0031_0FF198E1DBE8F178"/>
receipts to countenance it—The plain answer is, that Mrs. Reynolds' own letters contradict absolutely this artful explanation of hers; if indeed she ever made it, of which <hi>Clingman's</hi> assertion is no evidence whatever. These letters are proved by the affidavit No. XLI, though it will easily be conceived that the proof of them was rendered no easy matter by a lapse of near five years—They shew explicitly the connection with her, the discovery of it by her husband and the pains she took to prolong it when I evidently wished to get rid of it—This cuts up, by the root, the pretence of a contrivance between the husband and myself to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate the evidences of it.</p>
            <p>The variety of shapes which this woman could as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume was endless. In a conversation between her and a gentleman whom I am not at liberty publicly to name, she made a voluntary confession of her belief and even knowledge, that I was innocent of all that had been laid to my charge by <hi>Reynolds</hi> or any other person of her acquaintance, spoke of me in exalted terms of esteem and respect, declared in the most solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner her extreme unhappiness lest I should suppose her accessary to the trouble which had been give me on that account, and expressed her fear that the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Reynolds on <hi>a particular score,</hi> might have urged him to improper lengths of revenge—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at the same time extremely agitated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. With the gentleman who gives this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have never been in any relation personal or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical that could be supposed to bias him—His name would evince that he is an impartial witness. And though I am not permitted to make a public use of it, I am permitted to refer any gentleman to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusal of his letter in the hands of William Bingham, Esquire; who is also so obliging as to permit me to deposit with him for similar inspection all the original papers which are contained in the appendix to this
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032222_0032_0FF198E7AAE34F20"/>
narrative. The letter from the gentleman above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to has been already shewn to <hi>Mr. Monroe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me now, in the last place, recur to some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which the hireling editors of the pamphlets No. V and VI has thought fit to indulge himself.</p>
            <p>The first of them is that the <hi>soft</hi> language of one of my notes addressed to a man in the habit of threatening me with disgrace, is incompatible with the idea of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. The threats alluded to must be those of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to hang the Secretary of the Treasury. How does it appear that Reynolds was in such a <hi>habit?</hi> No otherwise than by the declaration of <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> If the assertions of these men are to condemn me, there is an end of the question. There is no need, by elaborate deductions from <hi>parts</hi> of their assertions, to endeavour to establish what their assertions collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirm in express terms—If they are worthy of credit I am guilty; if they are not, all wire-drawn infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from parts of their story are mere artifice and nonsense. But no man, not as debauched as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, will believe them, independent of the positive disproof of their story in the written documents.</p>
            <p>As to the affair of threats (except those in Reynolds letters respecting the connection with his wife, which it will be perceived were very gentle for the occasion) not the least idea of the sort ever reached me 'till after the imprisonment of Reynolds. Mr. Wolcott's certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate shews my conduct in that case—notwithstanding the powerful motives I may be presumed to have had to desire the liberation of Reynolds, on account of my situation with his wife, I cautioned Mr. Wolcott not to facilitate his liberation, till the affair of the threat was satisfactorily cleared up. The solemn denial of it in Reynold's letter No. XLII was considered by Mr. Wolcott as sufficient. This is a further proof, that though in respect to my situation with his wife, I was somewhat in Reynolds's power, I was not disposed to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032222_0033_0FF198E953922D78"/>
make any improper concession to the apprehension of his resentment.</p>
            <p>As to the threats intimated in his letters, the nature of the cause will shew that the soft tone of my note was not only compatible with them, but a natural conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them.</p>
            <p>But it is observed that the dread of the disclosure of an amorous connection was not a sufficient cause for my humility, and that I had nothing to lose as to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for chastity concerning which the world had fixed a previous opinion.</p>
            <p>I shall not enter into the question what was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious opinion entertained of me in this particular—nor how well founded, if it was indeed such as it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to have been. It is sufficient to say that there is a wide difference between vague rumours and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions and the evidence of a positive fact—no man not indelicately unprincipled, with the state of manners in this country, would be willing to have a conjugal infidelity fixed upon him with positive certainty—He would know that it would justly injure him with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable and respectable portion of the society—and especially no man, tender of the happiness of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wife could without extreme pain look forward to the affliction which she might endure from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure, especially a <hi>public disclosure,</hi> of the fact. Those best acquainted with the interior of my domestic life will best appreciate the force of such a consideration upon me.</p>
            <p>The truth was, that in both relations and especially the last, I dreaded extremely a disclosure—and was willing to make large sacrifices to avoid it. It is true, that from the acquiescence of Reynolds, I had strong ties upon his secrecy, but how could I rely upon any tie upon so base a character. How could I know, but that from moment to moment he might, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032222_0034_0FF198EB206AA908"/>
of his own disgrace, become the <hi>mercenary</hi> of a party, with whom to blast my character in <hi>any way</hi> is a favourite object!</p>
            <p>Strong inferences are attempted to be drawn from the release of <hi>Clingman</hi> and <hi>Reynolds</hi> with the consent of the Treasury, from the want of communicativeness of Reynolds while in prison—from the subsequent disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reynolds and his wife, and from their not having been produced by me in order to be confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the time of the explanation.</p>
            <p>As to the first, it was emphatically the transaction of Mr. Wolcott the then Comptroller of the Treasury, and was bottomed upon a very adequate motive—and one as appears from the document No. I, (a) early contemplated in this light by that officer. It was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of more consequence to the public to detect and expel from the bosom of the Treasury Department an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Clerk to prevent future and extensive mischief, than to disgrace and punish two worthless individuals. Besides that a powerful influence foreign to me was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to procure indulgence to them—that of Mr. Muh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenberg and Col.Burr—that of Col. Wadsworth, which though insidiously placed to my account was to the best of my recollection utterly unknown to me at the time, and according to the confession of Mrs. Reynolds herself, was put in motion by her entreaty. Candid men will derive strong evidence of my innocence and delicacy, from the reflection, that under circumstances so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, the culprits were compelled to give a real and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial equivalent for the relief which they obtained from a department, <hi>over which I presided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The backwardness of Reynolds to enter into detail, while in jail, was an argument of nothing but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of his inability to communicate any particulars which could be supported, he found it more convenient to deal in generals, and to keep up appearances by giving promises for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:032222_0035_0FF198EE129B1790"/>As to the disappearance of the parties after the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, how am I answerable for it? It is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumable, that the instance discovered at the Treasury was not the only offence of the kind of which they were guilty? After one detection, is it not very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Reynolds fled to avoid detection in other cases? But exclusive of this, it is known and might easily be proved, that Reynolds was considerably in debt! What more natural for him than to fly from his creditors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been once exposed by confinement for such a crime? Moreover, atrocious as his conduct had been towards me, was it not natural for him to fear that my resentment might be excited at the discovery of it, and that it might have been deemed a sufficient reason for retracting the indulgence, which was shewn by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the prosecution and for recommencing it?</p>
            <p>One or all of these considerations will explain the disappearance of Reynolds without imputing it to me as a method of getting rid of a dangerous witness.</p>
            <p>That disappearance rendered it impracticable, if it had been desired to bring him forward to be confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As to <hi>Clingman</hi> it was not pretended that he knew any thing of what was charged upon me, otherwise than by the notes which he produced, and the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Reynolds and his wife. As to Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, she in fact appears by <hi>Clingman's</hi> last story to have remained, and to have been accessible through him, by the gentlemen who had undertaken the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If they supposed it necessary to the elucidation of the affair, why did not they bring her forward? There can be no doubt of the sufficiency of Clingman's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for this purpose, when it is understood that Mrs. Reynolds and he afterwards lived together as man and wife. But to what purpose the confronting? What would it have availed to the elucidation of truth, if Reynolds and his wife had impudently made allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I denied. Relative character and the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032222_0036_0FF198F3DB93B140"/>
written documents must still determine. These could decide without it, and they were relied upon. But could it be expected, that I should so debase myself as to think it necessary to my vindication to be confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a person such as Reynolds? Could I have borne to suffer my veracity to be exposed to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating competition?</p>
            <p>For what?—why, it is said, to tear up the last twig of jealousy—but when I knew that I possessed written documents which were decisive, how could I foresee that any twig of jealousy would remain? When the proofs I did produce to the gentlemen were admitted by them to be completely satisfactory, and by some of them to be more than sufficient, how could I dream of the expediency of producing more—how could I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that every twig of jealousy was not plucked up?</p>
            <p>If after the recent confessions of the gentlemen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it could be useful to fortify the proof of the full conviction, my explanation had wrought, I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the total silence concerning this charge, when at a subsequent period, in the year 1793, there was such an active legislative persecution of me. It might not even perhaps be difficult to establish, that it came under the eye of Mr. Giles, and that he discarded it as the plain case of a private amour unconnected with any thing that was the proper subject of a public attack.</p>
            <p>Thus has my desire to destroy this slander, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, led me to a more copious and particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of it, than I am sure was necessary. The bare perusal of the letters from Reynolds and his wife is sufficient to convince my greatest enemy that there is nothing worse in the affair than an irregular and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate amour. For this, I bow to the just censure which it merits. I have paid pretty severely for the folly and can never recollect it without disgust and self condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation—It might seem affectation to say more.</p>
            <p>To unfold more clearly the malicious intent, by
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032222_0037_0FF198F56FC59188"/>
which the present revival of the affair must have been influenced—I shall annex an affidavit of Mr. Webster tending to confirm my declaration of the utter falsehood of the assertion, that a menace of publishing the papers which have been published had arrested the progress of an attempt to hold me up as a candidate for the office of President. Does this editor imagine that he will escape the just odium which awaits him by the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble subterfuge of saying that he had the information from a respectable citizen of New-York? Till he names the author the inevitable inference must be that he has fabricated the tale.</p>

               <p>Jacob Clingman being a clerk in my employment, and becoming involved in a prosecution commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against James Reynolds, by the comptroller of the treasury, on a charge or information exhibited before Hillary Baker, <abbr>Esq.</abbr> one of the aldermen of this city, for subornation of perjury, whereby they had obtained money from the treasury of the United States, he (Clingman) applied to me for my aid, and friendship on behalf of himself and Reynolds, to get them released or discharged from the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I promised, so far as respected Clingman, but not being particularly acquainted with Reynolds, in a great measure declined, so far as respected him. In company with Col. Burr, I waited on Col. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton, for the purpose, and particularly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clingman, who had hitherto sustained a good character. Col. Hamilton signified a wish to do all that was consistent. Shortly after, I waited on the comptroller, for the same purpose, who seemed to have some difficulties on the subject; and from some information I had, in the mean time, received, I could not undertake to recommend Reynolds; as I verily believed him to be a rascal; which words I made use of, to the comptroller. On a second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with the comptroller, on the same subject, the latter urged the propriety of Clingman's deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering up a certain list of money due to individuals, which, Reynolds and Clingman were said to have in their possession, and of his informing him, of whom, or thro' whom, the same was obtained from the public offices: on doing which, Clingman's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest might, perhaps, be granted with greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. This, Clingman, I am informed, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:032222_0039_0FF198FD5AA68280"/>
with, and also refunded the money or certificates, which they had improperly obtained from the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury. After which, I understand the action against both was withdrawn, and Reynolds discharged from imprisonment, without any further interference of mine whatsoever. During the time, this business was thus depending, and which lasted upwards of three weeks, Clingman, unasked, frequently dropped hints to me, that Reynolds had it in his power, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially to injure the secretary of the treasury, and that Reynolds knew several very improper transac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his. I paid little or no attention to those hints, but when they were frequently repeated, and it was even added, that Reynolds said, he had it in his power to hang the secretary of the Treasury, that he was deeply concerned in speculation, that he had frequently advanced money to him (Reynolds) and other insinuations of an improper nature, it created considerable uneasiness on my mind, and I conceived it my duty to consult with some friends on the subject.—Mr. Monroe and Mr. Venable were informed of it yesterday morning.</p>

               <p>Being informed yesterday in the morning, that a person, of the name of Reynolds, from Virginia, Richmond, was confined in the jail, upon some criminal prosecution, relative to certificates, and that he had intimated, he could give some intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of speculations by Mr. Hamilton, which should be known, we immediately called on him, as well to be informed of the situation of the man, as of those other matters, in which the public might be interested. We found, it was not the person, we had been taught to believe, but a man of that name from New-York, and who had, for some time
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:032222_0040_0FF199004BE40970"/>
past resided in this city. Being there, however, we questioned him, respecting the other particular: he informed us, that he could give information of the misconduct, in that respect, of a person high in office, but must decline it for the present, and until relieved, which was promised him, that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that at ten to-day, he would give us a detail of whatever he knew on the subject. He affirmed, he had a person in high office, in his power, and has had, a long time past: That he had written to him in terms so abusive, that no person should have submitted to it, but that he dared not to resent it. That Mr. Wolcott was in the same department, and, he supposed, under his influence or controul. And, in fact, expressed himself in such a manner, as to leave no doubt, he meant Mr. Hamilton. That he expected to be released by Mr. Wolcott, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that person, altho' he believed that Mr. Wolcott, in instituting the prosecution, had no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper design. That he was satisfied the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was set on foot, only to keep him low, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him, and ultimately drive him away, in order to prevent his using the power he had over him;—that he had had, since his residence here, for eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, many private meetings with that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who had often promised to put him into em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but had disappointed him:—That, on hearing the prosecution was commenced against him, he applied to this person for counsel, who advised him to keep out of the way, for a few days:—That a merchant came to him, and offered, as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, to be his bail, who, he suspects, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated by this person, and after being decoyed to the place, the merchant wished to carry him, he refused being his bail, unless he would deposit a sum of money to some considerable amount, which he could not do, and was, in consequence, committed
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032222_0041_0FF1990215002110"/>
to prison:—As well as we remember, he gave, as a reason why he could not communicate to us, what he knew of the facts alluded to, that he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, it might prevent his discharge, but that he would certainly communicate the whole to us, at ten this morning; at which time, we were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had absconded, or concealed himself.</p>

               <p>Being desirous, on account of their equivocal complection, to examine into the suggestions which had been made us respecting the motive for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinement and proposed enlargement of James Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, from the jail of this city, and inclined to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, for the same reason, that, unless it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately done, the opportunity would be lost, as we were taught to suspect he would leave the place, immediately after his discharge, we called at his house last night for that purpose; we found Mrs. Reynolds alone. It was with difficulty, we obtained from her, any information on the subject, but at length she communicated to us the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
               <p>That since Col. Hamilton was secretary of the treasury, and at his request, she had burned a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number of letters from him to her husband, and in the absence of the latter, touching business between them, to prevent their being made public;—she also mentioned, that Mr. Clingman had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral anonymous notes addressed to her husband, which, she believed, were from Mr. Hamilton (which we have) with an endorsement "from secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Hamilton, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>" in Mr. Reynolds's hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032222_0042_0FF19906C697CE20"/> 
:—That Mr. Hamilton offered her his assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to go to her friends, which he advised:—That he also advised that her husband should leave the parts, not to be seen here again, and in which case, he would give something clever. That she was sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied, this wish for his departure did not proceed from friendship to him, but upon account of his threat, that he could tell something, that would make some of the heads of departments tremble.—That Mr. Wadsworth had been active in her behalf, first at her request; but, in her opinion, with the knowledge and communication of Mr. Hamilton, whose friend he professed to be; that he had been at her house yesterday and mentioned to her, that two gentlemen of Congress had been at the jail to confer with her husband; enquired if she knew what they went for; observed, he knew, Mr. Hamilton had enemies, who would try to prove some specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations on him, but, when enquired into, he would be found immaculate:—to which, she replied, she rather doubted it. We saw in her possession two notes; one in the name of Alexander Hamilton, of the sixth of December, and the other signed "S. W." purporting to have been written yesterday, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing a desire to relieve her.</p>
               <p>She denied any recent communication with Mr. Hamilton, or that she had received any money from him lately.</p>

               <p>Jacob Clingman has been engaged in some nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations with Mr. Reynolds, the person, who has lately been discharged from a prosecution instituted
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032222_0043_0FF1990B16DBCA98"/>
against him, by the comptroller of the treasury:—That his acquaintance commenced in September, 1791:—That a mutual confidence and intimacy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isted between them;—That in January or February last, he saw Col. Hamilton, at the house of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds;—immediately on his going into the house Col. Hamilton left it;—That in a few days after, he (Clingman) was at Mr. Reynold's house, with Mrs. Reynolds, her husband being then out, some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son knocked at the door; he arose and opened it, and saw that it was Col. Hamilton: Mrs. Reynolds went to the door; he delivered a paper to her, and said, he was ordered to give Mr. Reynolds that: He asked Mrs. Reynolds, who could order the sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retary of the treasury of the United States to give that; she replied, that she supposed, he did not want to be known:—This happened in the night. He asked her how long Mr. Reynolds had been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Col. Hamilton; she replied, some months;—That Col. Hamilton had assisted her husband; that some few days before that time, he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upwards of eleven hundred dollars of Col. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton. Some time after this, Clingman was at the house of Reynolds, and saw Col. Hamilton come in; he retired and left him there. A little after Duer's failure, Reynolds told Clingman in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that if Duer had held up three days longer, he should have made fifteen hundred pounds, by the assistance of Col. Hamilton: that Col. Hamilton had informed him that he was connected with Duer. Mr. Reynolds also said, that Col. Hamilton had made thirty thousand dollars by speculation; that Col. Hamilton had supplied him with money to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate. That, about June last, Reynolds told Clingman, that he had applied to Col. Hamilton, for money to subscribe to the turnpike road at Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster, and had received a note from him, in these words, <q>It is utterly out of my power, I assure you
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032222_0044_0FF1990CA693D6D8"/>
upon my honor, to comply with your request. Your note is returned.</q> Which original note, accompanying this, has been in Clingman's posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ever since. Mr. Reynolds has once or twice mentioned to Clingman, that he had it in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hang Col. Hamilton; that if he wanted money, he was obliged to let him have it:—That he (Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) has occasionally lent money to Reynolds, who always told him, that he could always get it from Col. Hamilton, to repay it.—That on one occasion Clingman lent him two hundred dollars, that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds promised to pay him thro' the means of Col. Hamilton, that he went with him, saw him go into Col. Hamilton's;—that after he came out, he paid him one hundred dollars, which, he said, was part of the sum he had got; and paid the balance in a few days; the latter sum paid, was said to have been received from Col. Hamilton, after his return from Jersey, having made a visit to the manufacturing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety there. After a warrant was issued against Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, upon a late prosecution, which was instituted against him, Clingman seeing Reynolds, asked him, why he did not apply to his friend Col. Hamilton, he said, he would go immediately, and went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;—he said afterwards, that Col. Hamilton advised him to keep out of the way, a few days, and the matter would be settled. That after this time, Henry Seckel went to Reynolds, and offered to be his bail, if he would go with him to Mr. Baker's office, where he had left the officer, who had the warrant in writing;—that he prevailed on Reynolds to go with him;—that after Reynolds was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to custody, Seckel refused to become his bail, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he would deposit, in his possession, property to the value of four hundred pounds;—upon which, Reynolds wrote to Col. Hamilton, and Mr. Seckel carried the note;—after two or three times going, he saw Col. Hamilton; Col. Hamilton said, he knew
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032222_0045_0FF1990FA22086C8"/>
Reynolds and his father;—that his father was a good whig in the late war; that was all he could say: That it was not in his power to assist him;—in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of which, Seckel refused to be his bail, and Reynolds was imprisoned. Mr. Reynolds also applied to a Mr. Francis, who is one of the clerks in the treasury department: he said, he could not do any thing, without the consent of Mr. Hamilton; that he would apply to him. He applied to Mr. Hamilton; who told him, that it would not be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; if he did, he must leave the department.</p>
               <p>After Reynolds was confined, Clingman asked Mrs. Reynolds, why she did not apply to Col. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton, to dismiss him, as the money was ready to be refunded, that had been received;—she replied, that she had applied to him, and he had sent her to Mr. Wolcott, but directed her, not to let Mr. Wolcott know, that he had sent her there; notwithstanding this injunction, she did let Mr. Wolcott know, by whom she had been sent; who appeared to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the information, but said, he would do what he could for her, and would consult Col. Hamilton on the occasion. Col. Hamilton advised her to get some person of respectability to intercede for her husband, and mentioned Mr. Muhlenburg.</p>
               <p>Reynolds continued to be kept in custody, for some time; during which time, Clingman had conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Mr. Wolcott, who said, if he would give up a list of claims which he had, he should be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:—After this, Mrs. Reynolds informed Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that Col. Hamilton had told her, that Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should write a letter to Mr. Wolcott, and a duplicate of the same to himself, promising to give up the list, and refund the money, which had been obtained on a certificate, which had been said to have been improperly obtained.</p>
               <p>Clingman asked Mrs. Reynolds, for the letters, that her husband had received from Col. Hamilton,
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032222_0046_0FF199129C406818"/>
from time to time, as he might probably use them to obtain her husband's liberty;—she replied, that Col. Hamilton had requested her to burn all the letters, that were in his hand writing, or that had his name to them; which she had done;—he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her to examine again, as she might not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the whole, and they would be useful;—She examined and found notes, which are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with submitted, and which, she said, were notes from Col. Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Reynolds told Clingman, that having heard, that her husband's father was, in the late war, a commissary under the direction of Col. Wadsworth, waited on him, to get him to intercede for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's discharge;—he told her, he would give her his assistance, and said, now you have made me your friend, you must apply to no person else.—That on Sunday evening Clingman went to the house of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, and found Col. Wadsworth there: he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to Col. Wadsworth by Mrs. Reynolds: Col. Wadsworth told him, he had seen Mr. Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott;—that Mr. Wolcott would do any thing for him (Clingman) and Reynold's family, that he could;—that he had called on Col. Hamilton but had not seen him;—that he might tell Mr. Muhlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, that a friend of his (Clingman's) had told him, that Col. Wadsworth was a countryman and schoolmate of Mr. Ingersoll, and that Col. Wads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth was also intimate with the governor, and that the governor would do almost any thing to oblige him;—that his name must not be mentioned to Mr. Muhlenburg, as telling him this; but that if Mr. Muhlenburg could be brought to speak to him first, on the subject, he would then do any thing in his power for them; and told him not to speak to him, if he should meet him in the street, and said, if his name was mentioned, that he would do nothing:—That on Wednesday, Clingman saw Col. Wads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:032222_0047_0FF19915A15EDCA8"/>
at Reynold's house; he did not find her at home, but left a note; but on going out, he met her, and said he had seen every body, and done ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing,</p>
               <p>Mrs. Reynolds told Clingman, that she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived money of Col. Hamilton, since her husband's confinement, enclosed in a note, which note she had burned,</p>
               <p>After Reynolds was discharged, which was eight or nine o'clock on Wednesday evening:—about twelve o'clock at night, Mr. Reynolds sent a letter to Col. Hamilton by a girl; which letter Clingman saw delivered to the girl;—Reynolds followerd the girl, and Clingman followed him;—he saw the girl go into Col. Hamilton's house;—Clingman then joined Reynolds, and they walked back and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the street, until the girl returned, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Reynolds, that he need not go out of town that night, but call on him, early in the morning. In the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, he saw Reynolds go to Col. Hamilton's house and go in: he has not seen him since, and supposes he has gone out of the state.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clingman further adds, that some time ago, he was informed by Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, that he had books containing the amount of the cash due to the Virginia line, at his own house at New-York, with liberty to copy, and was obtained thro' Mr. Duer.</p>
               <p>The above contains the truth to the best of my knowledge and recollection, and to which I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make oath.</p>

               <p>I now have taken till tuesday morning to Consider on What Steps will be Best for me to take. I should not have let the matter Rested till then, if it had not been for the newes of the death of my Sister. which it Semes as if all my troubles are Comming on me in one moment. if it had been any other person except your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. that treated me as you have done. I should not have taken the trouble to Call on them more than once. <hi>but your being in the Station of life</hi> you are, induses me to way every Surcomstance well Respecting the matter it will be imposible for me ever to think of liveing or Reconsiling myself to Stay with a woman that I no has plased her affections on you. and you know if you Reflect one moment. that you have been the sole Cause of it. I have all Reason in the world to believe its true. I am that man that will always have Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by some means or other when treated ill. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I am treated in the mannor, as you have done. you may rest ashured that the matter as yet is Not known. If think proper to Call at the sighn of the George tuesday morning at 8 oclock I will be there. for your house or office is no place to converse about these matters. if that is not agreeable to you. let me no what plase I shall see you at. at that time, for I am determened to know what corse I shall take, more miserable I cant be than I am at present. let the consiquence be as it will. for when I come into the house. I find the wife always weeping and praying that I wont leve her. And its all on your account. for if you had not seekd for her Ruin it would not have happined. Could you not have Relieved the distress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without. transgreesing in the mannor as you have done. Sertainly you did not show the man of honnor. in taking the advantage of the afflicted, when Calling
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:032222_0051_0FF1991D12FAC3C0"/>
on you as a father and protector in the time of diss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress. put that home to yourself and tell me what you would do in such a Case. or what amend Could be made to you or wether it would be possible to make any. you will answer no. it be imposible after being Robbed of all your happiness and your whole family made misseable. I know you are a man thats not void of feeling. I am not a man that wishes to do any thing Rashly. or plunge myself into Ruin. now if you think proper to se me at the plase I have mentioned. or any other. please to let me no before. for I wish to be by ourselfs where we Can converse together. for if you do not Call on me or let me no where I Can see. you at that time. I shant call on you after this.</p>

               <p>Having perused the fifth and sixth numbers of a late publication in this City entitled "The History of the United States for the year 1796" and having reviewed certain letters and documents which have remained in my possession since the year 1792, I do hereby at the request of Alexander Hamilton Esquire of New York Certify and declare,</p>
               <p>That in the Month of December 1792, I was desired, by Mr. Hamilton to be present at his house as the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of an interview which had been agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himself and James Monroe, Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg and Abraham Venable, Esquires, with which I accordingly complied.</p>
               <p>The object of the interview was to remove from the minds of those Gentlemen, certain suspicions which had been excited by suggestions of James Reynolds then in Prison and Jacob Clingman a Clerk to Mr. Muhlenberg, (against both of whom prosecutions had been instituted for frauds against the United States,) that Mr. Hamilton had been concerned in promoting or assisting speculations in the public funds, contrary to Law and his duty as Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
               <p>The conference was commenced on the part of Mr. Monroe by reading certain Notes from Mr. Hamilton and a Narrative of conversations which had been held with the said Reynolds and Clingman—After the grounds upon which the suspicions rested, had been

fully stated, Mr. Hamilton entered into an explanation and by a variety of written documents, which were read fully evinced, that there was nothing in the transactions to which Reynolds and Clingman had referred, which had any connection with, or relation to speculations in the Funds, claims upon the United States, or any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or Official transactions or duties whatever. This was rendered so completely evident, that Mr. Venable requested Mr. Hamilton to desist from exhibiting fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofs. As however an explanation had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by the Gentleman before named, Mr. Hamilton insisted upon being allowed to read such documents as he possessed, for the purpose of obviating every shadow of doubt respecting the propriety of his Official con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Hamilton's explanation terminated Messrs. Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable, severally acknowledged their entire satisfaction, that the affair had no relation to Official duties, and that it ought not to affect or impair the public confidence in Mr. Hamilton's character;—at the same time, they expressed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets at the trouble which the explanation had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. During a conversation in the streets of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia immediately after retiring from Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's house, Mr. Venable repeated to me, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation was entirely satisfactory, and expressed his concern, that he had been a party to whom it had been made. Though in the course of the conversation Mr. Venable expressed his discontent with public measures which had been recommended by Mr. Hamilton, yet he manifested a high respect for his Talents, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the integrity of his character.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Reynolds was in Prison, it was reported to me, that he had threatened to make disclosures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the character of some head of a Department. This report I communicated to Mr. Hamilton, who advised me to take no step towards a liberation of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,
<pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:032222_0068_0FF1997CC4D8F398"/>
while such a report existed and remained unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. This was antecedent to the interview between Mr. Hamilton and Messrs. Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable, or to any knowledge on my part of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances by which it was occasioned.</p>
               <p>The Offence for which Reynolds and Clingman were prosecuted by my direction, was for suborning a person to commit perjury for the purpose of obtaining Letters of Administration on the estate of a person who was living. After the prosecution was commenced, Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man confessed to me, that he and Reynolds were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of lists of the names and sums due to certain Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of the United States, which lists had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Treasury—Both Clingman and Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds obstinately refused for some time to deliver up the lists or to disclose the name of the person, through whose infidelity they had been obtained. At length on receiving a promise from me, that I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to effect their liberation from the consequences of the prosecution, they consented to surrender the lists, to restore the balance which has been fraudulently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and to reveal the name of the person, by whom the lists had been furnished.</p>
               <p>This was done conformably to the proposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a letter from Clingman dated December 4, 1792, of which a copy is hereunto annexed. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal letter and the lists which were surrendered now remain in my possession. Agreeably to my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I informed Jared Ingersol <abbr>Esqr.</abbr> Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Pennsylvania, that an important discovery had been made, and the condition by which it could be rendered useful to the public in preventing future frauds; in consequence of which, the prosecutions against Clingman and Reynolds were dismissed.</p>
               <p>In the publication referred to, it is suggested that the lists were furnished by Mr. Duer; this is an injurious mistake—nothing occurred at any time to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:032222_0069_0FF19936450D78E8"/>
which could give colour to a suspicion, that Mr. Duer, was in any manner directly or indirectly concerned with or privy to the transaction. The infidelity was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a clerk in the office of the Register—Mr. Duer resigned his office in March, 1790, while the Treasury was at New-York—the Clerk who furnished the lists was first employed in Philadelphia in January 1791. The Accounts from which the lists were taken, were all settled at the Treasury subsequent to the time last mentioned; on the discovery above stated the Clerk was dismissed, and has not since been employed in the public offices.</p>
               <p>The name of the Clerk who was dismissed has not been publicly mentioned, for a reason which appears in Clingman's letter; but if the disclosure is found neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the vindication of an innocent character, it shall be made.</p>

               <p>In a pamphlet lately published entitled "No. V of the History of the United States for 1796 &amp;c." are sundry papers respecting the affair of <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in which you once had an agency, accompanied with these among other comments. "They [certain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks on Mr. Monroe] are ungrateful, because he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played on an occasion, that will be mentioned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, the greatest lenity to Mr. Alexander Hamilton, the prime mover of the Federal party. When some of the papers which are now to be laid before the world were submitted to the Secretary; when he was informed that they were to be communicated to President Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington he entreated in the most anxious tone of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that the measure might be suspended. Mr. Monroe was one of the three gentlemen who agreed to this delay. They gave their consent to it on his express promise of a guarded behaviour in future, and because he attached to the suppression of these papers a mysterious degree of solicitude which they feeling no personal resentment against the individual, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to augment." Page 204 and 205. It is also suggested page 206 that I made "a volunteer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of <hi>seduction"</hi> and it must be understood from
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:032222_0071_0FF199392B720A30"/>
the context that this acknowledgment was made to the same three gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The peculiar nature of this transaction renders it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that you should not recollect it in all its parts and that your own declaration to me at the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts absolutely the construction which the editor of the Pamphlet puts upon the affair.</p>
               <p>I think myself entitled to ask from your candour and justice a declaration equivalent to that which was made me at the time in the presence of Mr. Wolcott by yourself and the two other gentlemen accompanied by a contradiction of the representations in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cited above—And I shall rely upon your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy that the manner of doing it will be such as one gentleman has a right to expect from another—espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as you must be sensible that the present appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the papers is contrary to the course which was understood between us to be proper and includes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable infidelity somewhere—I am far from attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to either of the three gentlemen; yet the suspicion naturally falls on some agent made use of by them.</p>

It is also my wish, that all such papers as are original, may be detained from the parties of whom they were had, to put it out of their power repeat the abuse of them in situations which may deprive me of the advantage of explanation. Considering of how abominable an attempt they have been the instruments, I trust you will feel no scruples about this detention.</p>

               <p>I have received your letter of the fifth instant by the hands of Mr. Wolcott.</p>
               <p>I had heard of the pamphlet you mention some days before, but had not read it. I am entirely ignorant of the Editor, and of the means by which he procured the papers alluded to.</p>
               <p>I have had nothing to do with the transaction since
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:032222_0075_0FF1993DD95C2C18"/>
the interview with you, I do not possess a copy of the papers at present, nor have I at any time had the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of any of them, I avoided taking a copy because I feared that the greatest care which I could exercise in keeping them safely, might be defeated by some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and that some person or other might improperly obtain an inspection of them. I have endeavoured to recollect what passed at the close of the interview which took place with respect to this transaction; it was said I believe by us in general terms, that we were satisfied with the explanation that had been given, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted the necessity we had been subjected to in being obliged to make the inquiry, as well as the trouble and anxiety it had occasioned you, and on your part you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in general terms that the business as presented to us bore such a doubtful aspect as to justify the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and that the manner had been satisfactory to you.</p>
               <p>I have now to express my surprise at the contents of a letter published yesterday in Fenno's paper, in which you endeavour to impute to party motives, the part which I have had in this business, and endeavour to connect me with the releasement of persons, <hi>committed as you say for heinous crimes.</hi> Clingman had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased before I heard of the business, and Reynolds on the very day I received the first intimation of it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements having been previously made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by those who had interested themselves to bring it about so that no application was made to me on that subject, either directly or indirectly the object being entirely accomplished by other means, and before I was informed of their confinement; If you will take the trouble to examine the transaction you will find this statement correct, and you cannot be insensible of the injury you do me when you say, this was an attempt to release themselves from imprisonment by favor of party spirit and that I was one of the persons resorted to on
<pb n="xxxix" facs="unknown:032222_0076_0FF19988C90B3368"/>
that ground. I appeal to your candour, and ask you if any part of my conduct in this whole business has justified such as imputation. This having been a joint business and Mr. Monroe living now in New-York, I must avoid saying any thing more on this subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I can see him and Mr. Muhlenberg together, which I hope will be in the present week.</p>

               <p>It was our wish to have given a joint answer with Mr. Venable to your favour of the 5th instant concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publication of the proceedings in an inquiry in which we were jointly engaged with him in 1792, respecting an affair between yourself and Mr. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds; and into which, from the circumstances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we deemed it our duty to inquire. His depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture however for Virginia precludes the possibility of so doing at present. We nevertheless readily give such explanation upon that point as we are now able to give; the original papers having been deposited in the
<pb n="xl" facs="unknown:032222_0077_0FF19940C4015C30"/>
hands of a respectable character in Virginia soon after the transaction took place, and where they now are.</p>
               <p>We think proper to observe that as we had no agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in or knowledge of the publication of these papers till they appeared, so of course we could have none in the comments that were made on them.</p>
               <p>But you particularly wish to know what the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression was which your explanation of that affair made on our minds, in the interview we had with you upon that subject at your own house, as stated in the paper No. 5. of the publication referred to; and to which we readily reply, that the impression which we left on your mind as stated in that number, was that which rested on our own, and which was that the explanation of the nature of your connection with Reynolds which you then gave removed the suspicions we had before entertained of your being connected with him in specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Had not this been the case we should certainly not have left that impression on your mind, nor should we have desisted from the plan we had contemplated in the commencement of the inquiry, of laying the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before the President of the U. States.</p>
               <p>We presume that the papers to which our signatures are annexed are in all cases correct. Tis proper how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to observe that as the notes contained in No 5. were intended only as memoranda of the explanation which you gave us in that interview, as likewise of the information which was afterwards given us by Mr. Clingham on the same subject, and without a view to any particular use, they were entered concisely and without form. This is sufficiently obvious from the difference which appears in that respect, between the papers which preceded our interview and those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in No. 5. of the publication.</p>
               <p>We cannot conclude this letter without expressing our surprise at the contents of a paper in the Gazette of the United States of the 8th instant, which states
<pb n="xli" facs="unknown:032222_0078_0FF1998A74FED178"/>
that the proceedings in the inquiry in question, were the contrivance of two very profligate men who sought to obtain their liberation from prison by the favor of party spirit. You will readily recollect that one of those men Mr. Clingham was never imprisoned for any crime alledged against him by the department of the Treasury, and that the other Mr. Reynolds was upon the point of being released and was actually released and without our solicitation or even wish, by virtue of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with him by that department before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry began. We feel too very sensibly the injustice of the intimation that any of us were influenced by party spirit, because we well know that such was not the case: nor can we otherwise than be the more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised that such an intimation should now be given, since we well remember that our conduct upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion excited your sensibility, and obtained from you an unequivocal acknowledgment of our candour.</p>

               <p>I have your letter of this date. It gives me pleasure to receive your explanation of the ambiguous phrase in the paper No. V. published with your signatures and that of Mr. Venable, and your information of the fact, that my explanation had been satisfactory to you.</p>
               <p>You express your surprise at the contents of a paper in the Gazette of the U. States of the 8th, instant. If you will review that paper with care, you will find, that what is said about <hi>party spirit</hi> refers to the <hi>view</hi> with which the accusation was instituted by Reynolds and
<pb n="xlii" facs="unknown:032222_0079_0FF19946603160F8"/>
Clingman, not to that with which the inquiry was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into by you. They sought by the <hi>favour of party spirit</hi> to obtain liberation from prison—but though they may have rested their hopes on this ground it is not said, nor in my opinion implied, that you in making the inquiry were actuated by that spirit—I cannot however alter my opinion that they were influenced by the motive ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.—For though, as you observe Clingman was not in prison (and so far my memory has erred) and though it be true, that Reynolds was released be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inquiry began by virtue of an agreement with the Treasury Department (that is the Comptroller of the Treasury) for a reason of public utility which has been explained to you.—Yet it will be observed that Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as well as Reynolds was actually under a prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the same offence, and that it appears by No. I. of the papers under your signatures, that for a period of more than three weeks, while <hi>Clingman</hi> was in the act of soliciting the "<hi>aid and friendship of Mr. Muhlenberg on behalf of himself and Reynolds to get them released or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the prosecution</hi>" he <hi>Clingman</hi> frequently dropped hints to <hi>Mr. Muhlenberg,</hi> that Reynolds had it in his power <hi>very materially to injure the Secretary of the Treasury</hi> and that <hi>Reynolds knew several very improper transactions of his;</hi>—and at last went so far as to state that <hi>Reynolds said he had it in his power to hang the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treasury</hi> who was <hi>deeply concerned in specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</hi> From this it appears, that the suggestions to my prejudice were early made, and were connected with the endeavour to obtain relief through Mr. Muhlenberg—I derive from all this a confirmation of my opinion founded on the general nature of the proceeding that <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Clingman,</hi> knowing the existence in Congress of a party hostile to my conduct in adminstration, and that the newspapers devoted to it, frequently contained insinuations of my being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in improper speculations, formed upon that
<pb n="xliii" facs="unknown:032222_0080_0FF199904D04A440"/>
basis the plan of conciliating the favour and aid of that party towards getting rid of the prosecution by accusing me of Speculation. This is what I meant in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication alluded to and what I must always believe.</p>
               <p>With this explanation, you will be sensible that there is nothing in the publication inconsistent with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to you at closing our Interview. It is very true, that after the full and unqualified expressions which came from you together with Mr. Venable, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in terms but agreeing in substance, of your entire satisfaction, with the explanation I had given, and that there was nothing in the affair of the nature suggested; accompanied with expressions of regret at the trouble and anxiety occasioned to me—and when (as I recollect it) some one of the Gentlemen expressed a hope that the manner of conducting the inquiry had appeared to me fair and liberal—I replied in substance that though I had been displeased with the mode of introducing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to me (which you will remember) I manifested at the time in very lively terms yet that in other respects I was satisfied with and sensible to the candour with which I had been treated. And this was the sincere impression of my mind.</p>

               <p>Your letter of yesterday in answer to mine of the same date was received last night. I am sorry to say, that as I understand it, it is unsatisfactory—It appears to me liable to this inference that the information of Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had revived the suspicions which my explanation
<pb n="xlv" facs="unknown:032222_0082_0FF19991E191B830"/>
had removed. This would include the very derogatory suspicion, that I had concerted with Reynolds not only the fabrication of all the letters and documents under his hand but also the forgery of the letters produced as those of Mrs. Reynolds—since these last unequivocally contradict the pretence communicated by Clingman. I therefore request you to say whether this inference be intended.</p>

               <p>In my last letter to you I proposed a simple and direct question, to which I had hoped an answer equally simple and direct. That which I have received, though amounting, if I understand it, to an answer in the negative, is conceived in such circuitous terms as may

leave on obscurity upon the point which ought not to have remained. In this situation, I feel it proper to tell you frankly my impression of the matter.</p>
               <p>The having any communication with Clingman, after that with me, receiving from him and recording information depending on the mere veracity of a man undeniably guilty of subornation of perjury, an done whom the very documents which he himself produced to you shewed sufficiently <note n="*" place="bottom">See the letter from Reynolds to Clingman in which he declares that he will have satisfaction of me at all events and that he trusts only to Clingman.</note> to be the accomplice of a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive attempt upon me, the leaving it in a situation where by possibility, it might rise up at a future and remote day to inculpate me, without the possibility perhaps from the lapse of time of establishing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, and all this without my privity or knowledge, was in my opinion in a high degree indelicate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. To have given or intended to give the least sanction or credit after all that was known to you, to the mere assertion of either of the three persons <hi>Clingman, Reynolds</hi> or his wife would have betrayed a disposition towards me which if it appeared to exist would merit epithets the severest that I could apply.</p>

               <p>Your favour of yesterday (to use your own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) gives an indelicate and improper coloring to the topic to which it refers. I will endeavour in a few
<pb n="xlvii" facs="unknown:032222_0084_0FF1999398B881A8"/>
words to place the points in discussion where they ought to stand.</p>
               <p>It was never our intention other than to fulfill our duty to the public, in our inquiry into your conduct, and with <hi>delicacy</hi> and <hi>propriety</hi> to yourself, nor have we done otherwise.</p>
               <p>To this truth, in respect to the inquiry, as to our conduct upon that occasion, you have so often as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, that nothing need now be said on that point. Indeed I should have considered myself as highly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, advised as I was of your conduct, had I not united in the inquiry into it: for what offence can be more reprehensible in an officer charged with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his country, than to be engaged in specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And what other officer who had reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this could justify himself for failing to examine into the truth of this charge? We did so—apprized you of what we had done—heard your explanation and were satisfied with it. It is proper to observe that in the explanation you gave, you admitted all the facts upon which our opinion was founded, but yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for them, and for your connection with Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds on another principle. Tis proper also to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that we admitted your explanation upon the faith of your own statement, and upon the documents you presented, though I do not recollect they were proved or that proof was required of them.</p>
               <p>You will remember that in this interview in which we acknowledged ourselves satisfied with the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation you gave, we did not bind ourselves not to hear further information on the subject, or even not to proceed further in case we found it our duty so to do. This would have been improper, because subsequent facts might be disclosed which might change our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and in which case it would be our duty to proceed further. And with respect to Mr. Clingman we
<pb n="xlviii" facs="unknown:032222_0085_0FF1994BC01C32C0"/>
thought it highly proper to hear what he had to say, because we had before heard him on the subject, and because you had acknowledged all his previous infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be true, and because he was a party and had a right to be heard on it. You observe by the entry that we did not seek him, nor even apprize him of the explanation received from you, on the contrary that he fought us and in consequence of information received from Mr. Wolcott.</p>
               <p>The subject is now before the public, and I repeat to you what I have said before, that I do not wish any opinion of my own to be understood as conveyed in the entry which bears my single signature, because when I entered it I had no opinion upon it, as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears by my subsequent conduct, having never acted upon it, and deposited the papers with a friend when I left my country, in whose hands they still are. Whether the imputations against you as to specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are well or ill founded, depends upon the facts and circumstances which appear against you upon your defence. If you shew that they are ill founded, I shall be contented, for I have never undertaken to accuse you since our interview, nor do I now give any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on it, reserving to myself the liberty to form one, after I see your defence: being resolved, however, so far as depends on me, not to bar the door to free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry as to the merits of the case in either view.</p>
               <p>This contains a just state of this affair so far as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, which I presume will be satisfactory to you; and to which I shall only add that as on the one hand I shall always be ready to do justice to the claims of any one upon me, so I shall always be equally prepared to vindicate my conduct and character against the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of any one who may assail them.</p>

               <p>Having seen in a pamphlet published in Philadelphia entitled "The History of the United States No. 5" a paragraph to the following Effect:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>During the late Canvass for the Election of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, Webster in his Minerva, gave a Hint that Mr. Hamilton would be an adviseable Candidate. A person in this City who chanced to see this News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Paper, wrote immediately to a Correspondent in New-York. The letter desired him to put himself in the way of Mr. Hamilton and inform him that, if Webster should in future print a single paragraph on that Head, the papers referred to were instantly to be laid before the World. The Message was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Mr. Hamilton and the Minerva became silent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I declare that the Contents of the foregoing para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, as far as they relate to myself, are totally <hi>false.</hi> I never entertained an idea that Mr. Hamilton was a Candidate for the Presidency or Vice-Presidency at the late Election.—I never uttered, wrote or published a Hint or Suggestion of the kind; nor did I ever receive from Mr. Hamilton or any other person either directly or indirectly, any Hint or Communication to discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue any notice or Suggestions on that subject. I have examined the Minerva for several Months previous to the late Election, and I cannot find a Suggestion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in that paper, of Mr. Hamilton's being a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate as aforesaid, either from any Correspondent or republished from any other paper; nor have I the least knowledge what the suggestions in the foregoing para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph allude to.</p>
               <p>My own idea uniformly was, that Mr. Adams and Mr. Pinckney were the only Candidates supported by Mr. Hamilton and the friends of our Government in general.</p>

               <p>I know well that you were a clerk in the Treasury Department while I was in the office of Secretary of State; but as I had no relation with the interior affairs of that office, I had no opportunity of being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with you personally, except the single occasion on which you called on me. The length of time you were in the office affords the best presumption in your favour, and the particular misunderstanding which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to you with your principals may account for your not having obtained from them those certificates of character which I am not able to supply. I doubt not however that a knowledge of your conduct wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you establish yourself will soon render all certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates unnecessary, and I sincerely wish you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain employment which may evince and reward good conduct.</p>

               <p>I have maturely considered your letter of yesterday
<pb n="1iii" facs="unknown:032222_0090_0FF1999E4AD51DF8"/>
delivered to me at about nine last night and cannot find in it cause of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>There appears to me in the first place an attempt to prop the veracity of Clingman by an assertion which is not correct, namely that I had acknowledged all his previous information to be true. This was not and could not be the fact—I acknowledged parts of it to be true but certainly not the whole—on the contrary, I am able to prove that a material part of it, according to its obvious intent, is false, and I know other parts of it to be so—Indeed in one sense I could not have made the acknowledgment alledged without acknowledging myself guilty.</p>
               <p>In the second place there appears a design at all events to drive me to the necessity of a formal defence while you know that the extreme delicacy of its nature must be very disagreeable to me. It is my opinion that as you have been the cause, no matter how, of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness appearing in a shape which gives it an adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous importance, and this against the intent of a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reposed in you by me, as contrary to what was delicate and proper, you recorded Clingman's testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony without my privity and thereby gave it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as I had given you an explanation with which you was satisfied and which could leave no doubt upon a candid mind it was incumbent upon you as a man of honour and sensibility to have come forward in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that would have shielded me completely from the unpleasant effects brought upon me by your agency. This you have not done.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, by the affected reference of the matter to a defence which I am to make, and by which you profess your opinion is to be decided—you imply that your suspicions are still alive. And as nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have shaken your original conviction but the wretched tale of Clingman, which you have thought fit to record, it follows that you are pleased to attach a degree of weight to that Communication which cannot be accounted for on any fair principles. The result in

 my mind is that you have been and are actuated by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives towards me malignant and dishonourable; nor can I doubt that this will be the universal opinion when the publication of the whole affair which I am about to make shall be seen,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I received your letter of the 22nd instant by Major Jackson and have paid it the attention it merits.</p>
               <p>Always anxious to do justice to every one, it would afford me pleasure could I answer it in a manner satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to your feelings: but while the respect which I owe to myself forbids my replying in that harsh stile which you have adopted, that same respect with an attention to truth, according to the impressions exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my mind, will compel me upon all occasions to place this affair on its true ground.</p>
               <p>Why you have adopted this stile I know not. If your object is to render this affair a personal one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us you might have been more explicit, since you well know, if that is your disposition, what my determination is, and to which I shall firmly adhere. But if it is to illustrate truth and place the question on its true merits, as I have always been disposed to do, it appears illy calculated to promote that end.</p>
               <p>I have constantly said and I repeat again that in making an entry which appears after our interview with you, and which ought to have been signed by the other gentlemen as well as myself I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to convey an opinion upon it, nor does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any opinion of my own, but merely notes what Clingman stated, leaving it upon his own credit only. But you wish me to state that this communication made
<pb n="lv" facs="unknown:032222_0092_0FF1999FDFAEFA28"/>
no impression on my mind, and this I shall not state because in so doing I should be incorrect. On the other hand, I do not wish to be understood as intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that this communication had absolutely changed my opinion, for in that event I should have acted on it, whereas the contrary was the case as you well know. And with respect to the propriety of noting down that communication, I have no doubt on the point, since I should have noted any other that might have been made on the same topic by that or any other party. Indeed if it was proper to note the communications first received, it was equally so to note this, and <hi>that</hi> you did not disapprove. Had we proceeded in it you may be well assured we should have apprised of it, as in the other case, as well from motives of candour towards you, as propriety on our own parts.</p>
               <p>It is not my wish to discuss the fact whether you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all or only parts of Clingman's communication in our interview with you, because upon the principle in which I stand engaged in this affair, not as your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser, but called on to explain, it is one of no import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to me. Such was the impression upon my mind; if however the contrary were the case, and you shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be so, I should be equally contented as if it were otherwise, since it is my wish that truth appear in her genuine character, upon the present, as upon all other occasions.</p>

               <p>Your letter of the 25th instant reached me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Without attempting to analize the precise import of your expressions, in that particular, and really at a loss for your meaning when you appeal to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a determination to which you say you should firmly adhere, I shall observe, in relation to the idea of my desiring to make the affair personal between us,
<pb n="lvi" facs="unknown:032222_0093_0FF1995BAA14DF78"/>
that it would be no less unworthy of me to seek than to shun such an issue.—It was my earnest wish to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a conduct on your part, such as was in my opinion due to me, to yourself, and to justice. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I did on the coolest reflection, that this had not been the case, I did not hesitate to convey to you the impressions which I entertained, prepared for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences to which it might lead.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, it would have been agreeable to me to have found in your last letter sufficient cause for relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing those impressions. But I cannot say that I do—The idea is every way inadmissible, that <hi>Clingman's</hi> last miserable contrivance should have had weight to shake, though not <hi>absolutely change</hi> the opinion which my explanation had produced; and that having such an effect it should have been recorded and preserved in secret without the slightest intimation to me. There was a vast difference between what might have been proper before and after my explanation; though I am not disposed to admit, that the attention which was paid to such characters, even before, would have been justifiable, had it not been for the notes in my handwriting.</p>
               <p>But the subject is too disgusting to leave me any inclination to prolong this discussion of it. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic explanation to which I am driven must decide, as far as public opinion is concerned, between us. Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the appeal will be in one respect, I know that in the principal point, it must completely answer my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

               <p>In my opinion the idea of a personal affair between us ought not to have found a place in your letters or it ought to have assumed a more positive shape. In the state to which your correspondence had brought the question, it lay with you to make the option whether such an issue should take place. If what you have said be intended as an advance towards it, it is incumbent upon me not to decline it.

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were under a contrary impression, I frankly own you are mistaken.

               <p>N. B It may be proper to observe that in addition to the original letters from Mrs. Reynolds, there are in the hands of the gentleman with whom the papers are deposited, two original letters from her, one addressed to Mr. R. Folwell—the other to a Mr. Miller, and both of them signed MARIS CLINGMAN, in the former of which she mentions the circumstance of her being married to Clingman.</p>
