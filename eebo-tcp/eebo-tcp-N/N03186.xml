            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM XXV.11.</bibl>

            <p>THIS Pſalm was pen'd by <hi>David,</hi> in a time of great Affliction. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt likely, from ſeveral Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in it, that he wrote it in his Old Age, after his ſhameful fall into Murder and Adultery; and in the time of the great Rebellion, which was raiſed againſt him, by his ungrateful Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who wou'd have uſurp'd the Crown and Kingdom from him. And as Sin is the only ground of God's Diſpleaſure, and the moral cauſe of all the Afflictions we meet with; ſo we find <hi>David</hi> here (as in all the other Pſalms which were pen'd on the like ſorrowful Occaſions) makings mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confeſſion of his Sins, and ſeeking the Favour and Protection of God, by firſt, ſecuring a Pardon to himſelf And indeed this is the only effectual Courſe we can take, to obtain mercy from God, in any time of Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003851_0003_100264CFAD825078"/>And as I am now call'd, by the Providence of God, to preach the laſt Sermon to two Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Criminals,</hi> who in a few hours, are to have the fatal Sentence executed upon them, I know of no Subject more proper than this, to quicken &amp; direct them in their ſpeedy Preparations for that awful Eternity they are going into. And therefore, poor miſerable Men, I beſeech you, by the Mercies of God, to give the moſt ſerious and cloſe Attention to theſe publick Counſels which are the laſt you are ever like to receive, in this way, before you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the awful Bar of God; where, 'tis likely, before this Day is ended, you will receive that Divine Sentence, which will determine your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State, and fix you either in everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or in endleſs Miſery. Indeed the little Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance I have had with you ſince your Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment and Condemnation (by reaſon of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Indiſpoſitions, and other neceſſary Avocations) very much unfit me for making thoſe particular Applications to you, which, I fear, your unhappy State and Circumſtances may call for. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould have been glad if my dear and reverend Brother <note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooper.</hi>
               </note>, who has often viſited you in Priſon, and almoſt daily attended you with his inſtructive Counſels and Prayers, would for this once, have exchanged the Lecture with me, and been God's Meſſenger to you on this awful Occaſion. But ſince he has declined the Service, that he might have greater leiſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his tender Compaſſions for you in thoſe more private and perſonal Applications, which you have all along ſtood in the greateſt need of; and ſince the Lot is now fallen upon me, I ſhall endeavour, by the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, to give you the moſt
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003851_0004_100264D131411D98"/>
ſeaſonable Advice I can from theſe words of the Pſalmiſt; which contain a moſt moving and ardent Addreſs to God: An Addreſs fit for any Sinner in a dying Hour, and eſpecially for ſuch notorious Malefactors as you have been. And that you may be enabled by divine Aſſiſtance, to make this Prayer to God in your laſt Moments, with that Underſtanding, Faith and Fervency, which will ſecure your eternal Salvation; I ſhall, firſt, briefly explain theſe Words, and then ſpeak to ſome Doctrinal Notes from them.</p>
            <p>And for the Explanation of them, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the following things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have here <hi>David</hi>'s Petition for pardoning Grace, in theſe words, <hi>Pardon mine Iniquity.</hi> To pardon iniquity, is to do away the Guilt of Sin; or to free a Sinner from that ſentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which he has juſtly fallen under, by his Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God. And this is the Subject of <hi>David</hi>'s Requeſt here. <hi>Pardon mine Iniquity:</hi> mine Iniquity, in the ſingular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. From whence 'tis very likely the Pſalmiſt had an immediate reference to ſome particular hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Tranſgreſſion, he had been guilty of, and for which he was then full of Diſtreſs, both in Body and Mind. And if he had an Eye here to his <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> (as I obſerved before) theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were Sins of a complicated guilt: and we have no reaſon to wonder at the Anguiſh of Soul he expreſſes on the account of them. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we need not confine the ſenſe of the words ſo as to exclude his other Sins: For when a true Penitent pleads for the Pardon of any particular great Tranſgreſſion, he has been left to fall into, in a day of Temptation, he earneſtly deſires the pardon of all his Sins, at the ſame time. And that this was the caſe with <hi>David,</hi> when he pen'd this
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003851_0005_100204A35D15E088"/>
Pſalm, appears from the 18<hi>th verſe</hi> of the Context, <hi>Forgive all my Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We may obſerve, of <hi>Whom</hi> it is, <hi>David</hi> asks the Pardon of his Iniquities. And this is of God alone: <hi>O Lord, pardon &amp;c.</hi> For as God is moſt highly offended by Sin, and as he is the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Prayer; ſo 'tis He only can effectually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Tranſgreſſions: and agreably we read in Pſal. 130.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. <hi>With the Lord there is forgiveneſs, and with him there is plenteous Redemption, that he may be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We may further obſerve, the <hi>Arguments, David</hi> made uſe of for the ſucceſs of his Prayer. And theſe are two: The one taken from the final Cauſe, and the other from the Object. The firſt is taken from the <hi>final</hi> Cauſe; in theſe Words, <hi>For thy Names ſake,</hi> i e. That the Greatneſs of thy free and ſovereign Grace and Mercy, may be diſplayed and magnified in pardoning mine Iniquities. This is a very natural Plea in it ſelf, and one of the moſt ſucceſsful Pleas we can make for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pardon For Mercy is <hi>emphatically</hi> the Name of God: and the Diſplay of it, in a way conſiſtent with Divine Juſtice and Holineſs, is the laſt and higheſt End of Forgiveneſs For God forgives a Sinner, <hi>not for his own worthineſs, but for his great Mercies Sake in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Again, the other Argument here, is taken from Sin, the <hi>Object</hi> of pardoning Mercy: In theſe words, <hi>for it is great.</hi> That is, the Iniquity of which I beg a Pardon, is great. It is attended with very great Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: I have greatly diſhonoured thy Name by it: It has contracted an exceeding great Guilt to my Soul: It has bro't me already into the greateſt Adverſity: And unleſs I obtain Forgiveneſs from thee, it will quickly plunge me into the Depth of irrecoverable and endleſs Miſery. This Argument, indeed, is very ſurprizing in the Nature of it; and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003851_0006_100264D2C4E4DE60"/>
what one wou'd ſcarce chuſe to make uſe of, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Favour of an offended Neighbour or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the greatneſs of our Offences againſt Men, is generally tho't a ſufficient Reaſon why they ſhould retaliate upon us. And therefore a Confeſſion of this nature to Man, does too often ſerve only the more to irritate the Paſſions of the Injured againſt the Offender; and ſometimes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the nature of the Offence may be, it would put it out of the Power of thoſe to whom we confeſs to forgive. But it is far otherwiſe with reſpect to the infinite God. For, as we read in Iſai. 55.8, 9. <hi>My tho'ts are not your tho'ts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord. For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my tho'ts than your tho'ts.</hi> And therefore ſince God's great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in forgiving Iniquity is to exalt free &amp; ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace thro' Jeſus Chriſt; the greater our Tranſgreſſions have been, the more illuſtrious will his Mercy appear in the Act of Forgiveneſs. And for this Reaſon among many others, he allows us, with <hi>David</hi> in the Text, to mention the greatneſs of our Iniquity, as an Argument why he ſhould pardon and forgive us.</p>
            <p>And now from the Words thus explained, we may make theſe three general Obſervations,</p>
            <p n="1">I That God alone ought to be addreſſed unto, for the Pardon of all our Iniquities.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whenever God pardons Iniquity, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons it, <hi>for his own Name's Sake</hi>; or to magnify his free and ſovereign Grace and Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">III. Since this is God's chief End in pardoning Iniquity, the true Penitent may humbly plead the Greatneſs of his Sins, as an Argument with God, why he ſhould pardon and forgive him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003851_0007_100204A8D02400F8"/>I. I ſhall obſerve from theſe Words, That God alone ought to be addreſſed unto for the Pardon of all our Iniquities.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall not have time to enquire particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into the Nature of a Pardon: Nor is there any need of it in this place: For ſince my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deſign is chiefly to direct and encourage ſuch Sinners, as are deeply wounded with a ſenſe of their own Sin and Guilt, in the ſure way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pardoning Mercy of God; every ſuch Sinner muſt needs underſtand ſomething of the true Nature of a Pardon; and feel the neceſſity, and ſee the worth of it, in his own Experience. And therefore I ſhall only, Firſt, Confirm the Truth of this Obſervation; and then, Secondly, Show after what manner a diſtreſſed Sinner muſt make his Addreſs to God for his pardoning Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall prove to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God, and He alone, is to be ſought unto, for the Pardon of our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties And the Truth of this will appear in two particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Sin is immediately and directly an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to God. For as the Apoſtle obſerves in 1 Joh. 3.4. <hi>Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God.</hi> That is, all and every Sin oppoſes and tramples upon God's ruling Authority. And all they that are guilty of it, ſet up themſelves, more or leſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government of God, and <hi>practically</hi> ſay with the rebellious Jews, in Jer. 2.31. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more unto thee.</hi> And 'tis upon this account only, that Sin contracts ſuch Guilt as to need a Pardon. Indeed, in many Caſes, one Man may really injure and grieve another. And, in all theſe Caſes, we uſually ſay, ſuch a Man has ſinned againſt his Brother or Neighbour. But then we muſt obſerve, that the real ſinfulneſs of ſuch Actions ariſes only from the Contrariety of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003851_0008_100264D635275878"/>
them to that holy Law of God, which forbids this Ill treatment of Mankind. So that, in ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, God is the only Object againſt whom Sin <hi>is</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be committed. And therefore, in the Nature of the thing, it is moſt reaſonable, yea, and abſolutely neceſſary too that God, and he only, ſhould be religiouſly Addreſs'd unto, for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin. And beſides this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is none but God, who can effectually forgive Sin. For Sin, as it expoſes the Tranſgreſſor to eternal Miſery, is a matter of Concernment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Sinner only. The Sinner tranſgreſſeth the Law of God by his Iniquity, and the Juſtice of God arreſteth the Sinner for his Tranſgreſſion: And thus God is offended, and the Sinner brought under a ſentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for one and the ſame Act of Sin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Offence is againſt God only, there is none but he can releaſe a Sinner from the Guilt of Sin. And this is the meaning of that Confeſſion, in Dan. 9.9. <hi>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveneſſes.</hi> And now ſince Forgiveneſs, as it reſpects a Man's eternal ſtate, belongs to God only, we ought ſurely to ask this Forgiveneſs of God, and of him alone: And it would be both impious and fooliſh in a Sinner, either to requeſt or expect a free and full pardon of his Sins from any elſe.</p>
            <p>And having thus briefly confirm'd the Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come now, in the next place, to conſider how, or after what manner, we muſt make our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God, for the Pardon of Iniquity, ſo as to find Mercy with Him. And here I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1 When we pray to God for a Pardon, we muſt pray with a deep ſenſe of our utter Unworthineſs of the Mercy. For ſuch is the odious and defiling Nature of Sin, that it vilifies and debaſes the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, and renders them the proper Objects
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003851_0009_100264D7B8A7D090"/>
for revenging Righteouſneſs. And it is not poſſible for a Sinner, on the account of any worthineſs in him, to challenge a Pardon, or claim any other Favour, at the hands of God. And therefore whenever we plead with God for a Pardon, and hope to find Mercy with Him, we muſt go to the Throne of Grace, as it were, with Aſhes on our Heads, and with Ropes on our Necks, and confeſs that we are Malefactors, juſtly doom'd to eternal Wrath We muſt take with us words, and either, ſay with <hi>the penitent Prodigal,</hi> in Luke 15.21. <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee; and am no more worthy to be called thy Child.</hi> Or, we muſt confeſs with the repenting <hi>Jews,</hi> in Dan. 9 7. <hi>O Lord Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee; but unto us Confuſion of faces.</hi> In a word, we muſt freely acknowledge that Hell and the inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Torments of it, are our juſt Deſert; and that every thing, on this ſide the everlaſting Burnings, is of the free &amp; ſovereign Mercy of God to us. This we have ſtrongly recommended to us, in that peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Language of the afflicted Church, Lam. 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When we pray for the Pardon of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we muſt make a free and full Confeſſion of our Sins unto God. That is, we muſt not only make a free and ingenuous Confeſſion of ſuch Actual Tranſgreſſions and the Aggravations of them, with which we find our Conſciences op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and burdened: but we muſt be led on by theſe to the corrupt Fountain from whence all our Actual Sins proceed, and particularly confeſs and bewail that Corruption of Nature we brought into the World with us. Of this <hi>David</hi> has left us a moſt excellent Example, in the <hi>Fifty firſt Pſalm,</hi> which is full of penitential Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his ſcandalous Sins of Adultery &amp; Murder:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003851_0010_100264D93B85EA40"/>
for if we compare the 3<hi>d.</hi> &amp; 4<hi>th. verſes</hi> with the <hi>Title</hi> of the Pſalm, we ſhall find that he makes a moſt ingenuous Confeſſion of thoſe Sins in them. <hi>For</hi> (ſays he in his Addreſs to God) <hi>I acknowledge my Tranſgreſſions: and my Sin is ever before me. Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight: that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> And then he traces theſe, and all the other ſins of his Life, to the accurſed Fountain of them, in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption of his Nature; and makes a moſt ſorrowful Confeſſion of this, in the <hi>5th</hi> verſe. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in Iniquity; and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> And ſuch a free and full Confeſſion of Sin is generally neceſſary to a Pardon: as appears from thoſe two Texts of Scripture, Prov 28 13. <hi>He that covereth his Sins ſhall not proſper: but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> And 1 Joh. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 9 <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When we pray to God for the Pardon of our Iniquity, we muſt pray for it in the Name of CHRIST, and hope to receive the Mercy for <hi>his Sake alone.</hi> For as Chriſt is the only MEDIATOR between God and the Sinner, ſo he is the only Way of our Acceſs to the Father, and Acceptance with him. And therefore if we beg a Pardon, or ask any other Favour, in the Name of any one but Chriſt, God will cloath Himſelf with a thick Cloud, and turn a deaf Ear to our Prayer. <hi>But</hi> (as the Apoſtle obſerves in 1 Joh 5.14.) <hi>this is the Confidence we have in him,</hi> i. e in Chriſt, <hi>that if we aſk anything according to his will he heareth us.</hi> And this holy Confidence is grounded upon that Promiſe of our bleſſed Saviour to his Diſciples, Joh. 14 13, 14. <hi>And whatſoever ye ſhall ask [in my Name] that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003851_0011_100204AA6754B1F0"/>
If ye ask any thing [in my Name] I will do it.</hi> And conſequently when a Sinner asks the Forgiveneſs of Sin, with any reaſonable hopes of ſucceſs, it muſt be in ſome ſuch Language as this, Dan. 9.18, 19 <hi>O my God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> incline thine ear, and hear:— for we do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our righteouſneſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for thy great mercies. O Lord hear, O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forgive, O Lord hearken and do, defer not, for thine own ſake</hi> [for thy dear Son's ſake] <hi>O my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, When we pray for a Pardon, we muſt humbly reſolve and promiſe to God, that, by his Grace, we will forſake all Iniquity. For to ask the Forgiveneſs of Sin without ſuch a purpoſe of Heart, and Engagement to God, is baſely to play the Hypocrite, and to dare the Almighty to take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon us. This, I think, appears very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from thoſe Words of the Pſalmiſt. Pſal 66.18. <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi> But, on the other hand, when a Sinner goes to the Throne of Grace for a Pardon; if he finds his Heart broken for Sin, his Soul full of the hatred of it, and, with holy <hi>Job,</hi> is bro't to loath and abhor himſelf for his Iniquities; and with theſe Diſpoſitions is led on to ſay, as in <hi>Job.</hi> 34.32. <hi>Lord, if I have done Iniquity, I will ſo no more.</hi> Theſe are the Evidences of true Repentance. And ſuch a Sinner, upon his asking, after this manner, ſhall receive the Forgiveneſs of his Sins, thro' the Merits and Mediation of Chriſt our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finiſhed the firſt general Head, and come now to my ſecond Obſervation from theſe Words. And this is,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whenever God pardons Iniquity, he pardons it <hi>for his own Names Sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition is evidently contain'd in theſe Words of the Pſalmiſt. <hi>For thy Names ſake, O Lord, pardon &amp;c.</hi> For here <hi>David</hi> makes uſe of the NAME
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003851_0012_100264DAEB95AB48"/>
of God as the ſtrongeſt Argument for a Pardon: Which plainly implies that the Magnifying of God's Name, is the laſt &amp; higheſt End of Forgiveneſs And that this is really the Caſe, I think, no one can doubt when he reads that ſolemn Declaration of God himſelf to his People Iſrael, in Iſa 43.25 <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here we may, firſt, briefly enquire into the meaning of this Expreſſion, <hi>For thy Names ſake</hi> And, ſecondly, Give you ſome Reaſons to prove that when ever God pardons Iniquity he pardons it for his own Name's ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall briefly enquire into the meaning of this Expreſſion. <hi>For thy Name's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Name of God, in this place, we may underſtand the infinite Grace and Mercy of God. For this Mercy is ſpoken of once and again in this Context; and to the ſame Purpoſe, for which the Name of God is mentioned in the Text. And this makes it moſt probable that they both ſignify one and the ſame thing in this Pſalm. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis certain the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God is elſewhere emphatically ſtyl'd the <hi>Name</hi> of God; as tho' the Almighty eminently gloried in this Perfection of his Nature, and delighted chiefly in the diſplay of it. This is evident from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s humble Requeſt to God, in Exod. 33.18 and God's condeſcending Anſwer to it, in the 5<hi>th.</hi> and 6<hi>th.</hi> verſes of the next Chapter· <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Petition to God is, <hi>I beſeech thee, ſhew me thy Glory:</hi> And we have the Anſwer referred to, in the following words. <hi>And the Lord deſcended in a Cloud, and ſtood with him there, and proclaimed the Name of the Lord· And the Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> Here we ſee the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003851_0013_100204AFB58D55D8"/>
Goodneſs and Mercy of God are expreſly called, the Name of God· And in this ſenſe, <hi>For thy Name's ſake,</hi> is as much as to ſay, For thy Mercy's ſake, or to make a Diſplay of the Riches and Glory of thy free Grace and Mercy. But ſince this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play cannot be made but in a way conſiſtent with the eſſential Rights of Divine Juſtice; and ſince we know of no other way (to uſe the Pſalmiſts words in Pſal. 85.10.) wherein <hi>Mercy and truth may meet together: righteouſneſs and peace kiſs each other,</hi> in the Pardon of Sin, but only by the Death and Sacrifice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; I add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not unlikely, that by the Name of God here, the Pſalmiſt might alſo have an Eye to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> For I make no doubt, ſince Chriſt was ſo often &amp; clearly <hi>typified</hi> by the legal Sacrifices of old, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews</hi> had ſome way or other a Dependance upon the future Sacrifice and Satisfaction of the promiſed Meſſiah, for the Pardon and Forgiveneſs of their Sins; and that they frequently pointed to him in their Prayers to God for a Pardon. Now there is no one Expreſſion which they commonly made uſe of, in this Caſe, that has a clearer Aſpect this way, than the Expreſſion in the Text, <hi>For thy Name ſake.</hi> For the <hi>Name of God,</hi> we know was <hi>in the Angel,</hi> whom God ſent to conduct the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> through the Wilderneſs (<hi>Exod</hi> 23.21.) By which Angel Chriſt is generally underſtood. And if ſo, Why may'nt we rationally ſuppoſe, that in Alluſion to this, the <hi>Jews</hi> frequently ſpake of the expected Meſſiah under this Character. <hi>The Name of God</hi>? Which if they did, <hi>For thy Names ſake</hi> here may ſignify as much as for the <hi>Meſſias ſake,</hi> in whom thy Name is. And that which renders this the more probable is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the believing <hi>Jews</hi> made uſe of this Expreſſion much after the ſame Manner, &amp; in the ſame Caſes, wherein we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003851_0014_100264DD67794538"/>
make uſe of theſe Words, <hi>For Jeſus Chriſt's ſake</hi>: as tho' they ſignified one &amp; the ſame thing. And this Interpretation receives ſtill farther Light and Strength when we conſider that <hi>David</hi> who made uſe of this Expreſſion, was one to whom God had made wonderful Diſcoveries, by the Spirit of Prophecy, of the future Death &amp; Sufferings of the Son of God in our Nature; and no doubt, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, at the ſame time, the great Importance and Neceſſity of them for the Pardon of Sin And therefore it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that <hi>David,</hi> when he was in ſo great Concern to obtain the Pardon of Sin, as we find in this Pſalm, cou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to obtain it, in any other way, than on the Account of the Death and Sacrifice of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Meſſiah And if this may be allowed a true Account of the Name of God, in the Text, then the full meaning of the Pſalmiſts Petition in it, is this, Lord, pardon mine Iniquity, that thy free Grace and Mercy may be magnified, in and thro' Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſiah. Where the magnifying divine Grace is to be conſidered as the <hi>principal End</hi> of Forgiveneſs, &amp; the Merits of Chriſt as the neceſſary <hi>Medium</hi> to it And having thus briefly explained the Point, I proceed in the next Place</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To prove that whenever God pardons iniquity, he grants the Mercy upon no other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than only to diſplay and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if the Riches of his Grace, in and thro' the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And this will fully appear in two Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is a thing <hi>originally</hi> in the Sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that can move the Lord to extend his pardoning Mercy to him Indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we conſider a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he is a Subject of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sin; ſo he is a proper Object for mercy. But when we conſider him under all the unhappy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the Fall has brought him into, this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003851_0015_100264DFDDCCE800"/>
quite alters the Caſe with him. For it is with a Sinner, in this Reſpect, as it is with a Malefactor brought into Priſon and Chains by a vicious Life. If we conſider ſuch an one, ſimply in his afflicted ſtate, he is a proper Object for Compaſſion. But if at the ſame time, he appears obſtinate in thoſe Vices which have brought all his Diſtreſs &amp; Ruin upon him; he cannot deſerve any Mercy ſhou'd be extended towards him. And this is the very Caſe with a Sinner when the Grace and Mercy of God firſt finds him out. For we are not only miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>the Children of Wrath, by Nature:</hi> but we are naturally obſtinate in thoſe Sins, which have bro't all our Miſery and Diſtreſs upon us. For the Sinner, in his natural ſtate, is in Love and League with Sin: at Enmity againſt God, from whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone his Salvation muſt come: and walks on in a conſtant Courſe of thoſe Iniquities, which are the higheſt Provocation to Heaven. And there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be any Alteration in him for the better: No Repentance for Sin: no godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Iniquity; 'till God of his free &amp; ſovereign Grace, grants him Repentance unto life. And now, this being the true ſtate of the Sinner by Nature, there can be nothing found in the Sinner, conſidered in himſelf, that may be tho't a ſufficient Motive to the Lord to extend his pardoning Mercy to him; ſince the very neceſſary Qualifications of a Pardon, as well as the Pardon itſelf, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God. And from hence it plainly appears, That whenever God pardons Iniquity, he pardons it <hi>for his own Name's ſake.</hi> The Argument for a Pardon is wholly in himſelf, and not at all in the Sinner. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither the Sinner himſelf, nor any meer Creature, is able to pay the neceſſary Price of a Pardon, to the Juſtice of God, for him. For tho' God intends to magnify free and ſovereign Grace
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003851_0016_100264E34ED028F8"/>
in the Forgiveneſs of Sin; yet he has no deſign to exalt one Perfection of his Nature, to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of another. And therefore ſince Juſtice is as dear to God as Mercy; he can never exalt his Mercy but in a way conſiſtent with the Rights of infinite Juſtice. Now Juſtice indiſpenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires full Satisfaction for the Offence, before the Bands of Guilt be looſed, and the Tranſgreſſor diſcharged. What this Satisfaction muſt be, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the nature of Sin, which is infinitely evil; not <hi>ſimply,</hi> but <hi>objectively</hi> conſidered. And, for this Reaſon, the Price of Forgiveneſs muſt be of infinite Value to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ar a full proportion to the nature of the Offence, and from hence it evidently appears that no meer Creature can pay ſuch a Price as this to Divine Juſtice; for 'tis impoſſible, in the Nature of things, that a finite Being ſhould be able to pay an infinite Price. And the neceſſary Concluſion from this, is, that if ever Satisfaction be made to the Juſtice of God for our Tranſgreſſions, God himſelf muſt <hi>provide,</hi> as well as <hi>accept</hi> the Price. And ſuch a Price God has provided, in giving his only begotten Son to die a Sacrifice for Sin; and his Juſtice has accepted it, on the Account of all that truly Repent and believe in him. And now the concluding Argument, from the whole, is this, That whenever God magnifies his Mercy in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Iniquity, it is, and can be, only for his <hi>Name's ſake,</hi> that is, for his Son's ſake, or upon the account of the infinite Merit of his Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. And now I have done with the ſecond general Propoſition, and come to obſerve, in the laſt place,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That ſince God's great End in pardoning Iniquity, is to magnify his infinite Grace &amp; Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, the truly penitent Sinner may humbly plead the Greatneſs of his Sins, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with God, why he ſhould confer his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003851_0017_100204B14EE4B6B0"/>I ſay, the <hi>truly penitent</hi> here, becauſe this was the Caſe with <hi>David,</hi> when he made uſe of the Argument, in the Text, <hi>O Lord, Pardon mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: for it is great.</hi> And without this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 'tis impoſſible for a Sinner, by all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the World, to prevail with the Lord to pardon his Iniquity: For our Saviour has pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily told us (in Luk. 13 3, 5) <hi>That except we repent we ſhall certainly periſh.</hi> But, on the other hand, if the Sinner has <hi>a truly broken and contrite Heart</hi> in him: if he finds his Soul full of Grief, and Sorrow, and holy mourning for Sin: full of the Hatred of Sin, full of ſelf-loathing on the Account of it; and humbly reſolves, by the Grace of God, never to have any thing more to do willingly with Sin: He is then a fit Object for pardoning Mercy. And, in this holy Frame and Temper, he may go to the Throne of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, with Humility and Confidence, make uſe, even of the Greatneſs of his Sins as a prevailing Argument with God for a Pardon</p>
            <p>And there are theſe two Reaſons with which I ſhall confirm this comfortable Doctrine to the penitent Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greater our Iniquities have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more do we need the pardoning Mercy of God For the more notorious and aggravated a Sinner's Tranſgreſſions have been, the greater is the Guilt he has contracted by them: and unleſs he obtains the Forgiveneſs of them, he muſt certainly ſuffer a heavier Vengeance for them. And thus the greateſt Tranſgreſſors are in the moſt deplorable Caſe, and are under the moſt amazing Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And now, ſince the proper Objects of Mercy are <hi>miſerable</hi> Creatures; the more miſerable they are in themſelves, the fitter Objects are they for Mercy And Mercy never works with tenderer Bowels, or with more melting Compaſſions, than
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003851_0018_100264E507367368"/>
while it has to do with the moſt diſtreſſed Objects. And from this Conſideration, the penitent Sinner, who finds himſelf deeply wounded with a Senſe of his own Sin, and Guilt, and Miſery, may take Encouragement to go to the only Phyſician of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Souls, and to ſpread his deplorable ſtate before him, in ſome ſuch Language as this.
<q>Lord, I have ſtrangely play'd the Prodigal, and run away from thee, ever ſince I was born, ſpeaking lies. I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. Mine Iniquities are increaſed beyond Account; and they have been attended with theſe and the other the moſt aggravated Circumſtances. I have abuſed thy Grace and Patience towards me, as much as ever any wretched Creature has done; and may juſtly account my ſelf, <hi>the very Chief of Sinners.</hi> And by reaſon of my Tranſgreſſions, which are of a crimſon and ſcarlet dye, I have expoſed my ſelf to thy hotteſt Wrath and Vengeance: And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I obtain pardoning Mercy from thee, my Condemnation, at the Day of Judgment, and my miſerable Portion in Hell, will for ever be more intollerable than <hi>that</hi> of the Sinners of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>: Nor did any poor Wretch ever ſtand in more need of thy pardoning Mercy than I do. <hi>For thy Name's ſake,</hi> therefore: For thy Mercies ſake in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity: for it is</hi> exceeding <hi>great,</hi> and my miſerable Condition is inexpreſſibly, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably great on the account of it.</q>
And now, if there is any thing, the penitent Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor can ſay or do, that is likely to move the Divine Compaſſions towards him: nothing ſeems to have a more promiſing tendency this way, than ſome ſuch ingenuous Confeſſions as theſe. And therefore, for a true Penitent, to mention the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003851_0019_100204B481D3FCB0"/>
of his Sins, after this manner, is as proper an Argument as he can make uſe of, to obtain Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from God. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The greater our Tranſgreſſions have been, the more will the Mercy of God be magnified in pardoning of them. For ſince God's chief deſign in Forgiveneſs, is to diſplay the Glory of his free and ſovereign Grace in Jeſus Chriſt; the greater thoſe Sins are which he forgives, the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will his Mercy appear in the Act of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For the Riches of Divine Grace and Mercy appear to be no leſs than infinite, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Unworthineſs is over-look'd, and the moſt crimſon Guilt is removed, by them. Hence, in this way, <hi>the ſuper-abounding Grace of God</hi> is occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally illuſtrated from <hi>the Abounding of Sin;</hi> as the Bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us in <hi>Rom</hi> 5.20. And he elſewhere confirms this Truth to us in his own Example. For when he firſt acquaints us what a great Sinner he had been: That he had been <hi>a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, and Injurious,</hi> in 1 Tim. 1.13. He tells us in the next verſe, that in his obtaining Mercy, <hi>the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant.</hi> And indeed, the Mercy of God never appears more illuſtrious than it does, in Reſcuing the moſt miſerable and unworthy Objects from Deſtruction. For in ſuch Inſtances, the Grace of God diſcovers it ſelf to be Almighty-Grace, and that nothing can be too hard for it. And ſince this is the true ſtate of the Caſe, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the true Penitent from going to the Throne of Grace, and pleading thus with the Almighty? eſpecially if he knows his Tranſgreſſions have ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceeded.
<q>Lord, my Sins have been many, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the higheſt Aggravations: I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know the Number nor the heinous Guilt of them But this I am ſure of, tho' my Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have abounded, thy Grace and Mercy in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003851_0020_100264E9888AB8C8"/>
Chriſt Jeſus have abounded much more. And thou haſt taken Occaſion heretofore, highly to magnify thy Grace in pardoning the Chief of Sinners: Yea, the greater their Tranſgreſſions have been, the brighter Diſplay haſt thou made of thy free and ſovereign Grace in the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. O therefore take Occaſion once more, from the <hi>Heinouſneſs</hi> of my Sins, to ſhew forth the infinite Riches of thy Mercy. And if thou wilt forgive my crimſon and ſcarlet Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, thy Grace ſhall forever have the Praiſe of it, through Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
And now for the Penitent Tranſgreſſor to mention the Greatneſs of his Sins, after this manner, is certainly pleaſing in the Sight of God; and ſo muſt be as proper an Argument, as he can make uſe of to prevail with the Almighty to extend a Pardon and Eternal Salvation to him.</p>
            <p>And thus I have gone through the doctrinal Handling of theſe words, and come now to the APPLICATION of them, in two general Heads.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is,</p>
            <p>I By way of ſolemn <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Warning</hi> to all, eſpecially to our profane Children and Youth, who are madly running on in the ways of Sin, and have hitherto obſtinately refuſed to be reclaimed, by all the Means and Methods that have been uſed with them for this End<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, I ſhall improve what has been ſaid by way of ſolemn Caution and Warning to all ſuch as theſe. For there is nothing more natural to carnal Sinners than baſely to abuſe the Doctrine of Divine Grace and Mercy: and to take Occaſion, from the Conſideration of it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their unruly Luſts and Corruptions. For whenever they hear this Doctrine preach'd, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Where Sin has abounded, Grace has much more abounded,</hi> (which Doctrine was delivered only for the Encouragement and Conſolation of ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003851_0021_100264EB0BDE0A48"/>
as are in deep Diſtreſs and Anguiſh, and have their Hearts broken, at the ſight of their great Sin and Guilt before God) I ſay, when they hear this Doctrine of Divine Grace, diſplayed in all the Glories of it, they preſently make a miſapplication of it; and ſecretly ſay, This is comfortable Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine indeed: For I ſee now that my Sins can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be too many for God to pardon. Nay, the greater they are, the more illuſtrious will the Grace of God appear at laſt in the Pardon &amp; Forgiveneſs of them. And ſince it is thus, ſays the ungrateful Wretch, I may ſafely continue ſtill longer in my Sins, and take my fill of ſenſual Pleaſures; and am reſolved to do ſo, and make no doubt but the Grace of God will abound, at laſt, in my Pardon and Salvation. And if the profane Sinner be in his Youthful Days, he will preſume upon long Life; and, from the Doctrine of Divine Grace, hope for the Mercy of God, after a long Life ſpent in Sin and Rebellion againſt Heaven. But, O vain and deluded Sinner! This is horrid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the ſight of an holy, Sin-hating, and Sin-revenging God. And therefore the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> juſt after he had delivered this comfortable Doctrine, for the eaſe of diſtreſſed Conſciences, fore-ſeeing the infinite Hazard many would be in of abuſing it to the vileſt purpoſes, ſolemnly warns all profane Sinners againſt this fatal Abuſe of it, in Rom. 6. beginning. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound? God forbid!</hi> Which is a form of Speech he frequently made uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſhow his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abhorrence of any great Iniquity, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I now ſolemnly ſay to all profane Sinners, and particularly to our graceleſs Children and Youth; <hi>God forbid,</hi> That any of you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one Year, one Day, or ſo much as one Hour longer in Sin, with hopes that the Grace
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003851_0022_100204BA5FD0E1D8"/>
of God will hereafter abound in your Pardon and Salvation. And to ſet home this ſeaſonable Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this ſolemn Warning, I muſt beſeech, and, in the Name of God, demand your ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, Your paſt Iniquities are very many, and exceedingly aggravated already. For tho' ſome of you are but Young in Years, yet you are Old in your Iniquities: For you have all been Tranſgreſſors from the Womb, and been guilty of innumerable Sins every Day, ſince you have come to the Exerciſe of Reaſon. And as all your Sins have been againſt Goſpel Light and Grace, they have been dreadfully aggravated on this account. And many of your Sins have been of the moſt heinous Nature: ſuch as Curſing, Swearing, Lying, Stealing, Prophaning the Name and Day of God, Uncleanneſs, and the like. So that every ſuch Sinner, tho' ever ſo young in Years, has infinite Reaſon already to make his Prayer to God, in the words of my Text, <hi>O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity: for it is great.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, If you don't ſpeedily repent and reform, 'tis not unlikely, God may, in a little time, utterly forſake, and give you up to thoſe moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and ſcandalous Tranſgreſſions, which will quickly bring you to a moſt ſhameful and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death, by the Hands of Publick Juſtice. For have we not here, before our Eyes, a moſt fearful Example of two miſerable Men, and one of them too in the very <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> of Youth, who but a <hi>twelve month</hi> ago, it may be, as little tho't of ever coming to ſo ignominious a Death, as the moſt ſecure of you all. But behold, by the juſt Judgment of God, they appear, in this vaſt Aſſembly, with their Lives forfeited into the Hands of Publick Juſtice; and are under a Sentence of Condemnation to die in a few Hours, for their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003851_0023_100264ED8A453A08"/>
and ſcandalous Crimes. And unleſs you ſpeedily repent and return to God, and commit the keeping, both of your Bodies and Souls to Him, in a way of well doing, you can have no ſecurity but this will be the miſerable portion of ſome or other of you, before you have ſeen the Revolution of another Year. But ſuppoſe, after all the crying Sins your own Conſciences are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to, you ſhould eſcape the Hands of Publick Juſtice: Yet,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, 'Tis likely God will take you into his own Hands, and ſpeedily inflict his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and more terrible Vengeance upon you. For this has frequently been the dreadful Doom of ſuch bold and Heaven daring Tranſgreſſors, as many of you are. For did not <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> die ſuddenly in their Youth, for their horrid Prophaneneſs and Impiety? Were not <hi>Annanias</hi> &amp; <hi>Sapphira</hi> ſuddenly ſtruck dead, by the Hand of God, with a Lye in their Mouths? And have you not read or heard of many others, whom God has made the amazing Examples of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, in this way? And were not all theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples intended by God for a ſolemn Warning to all others? O then think ſeriouſly on them, you that upon every turn, are ready to imprecate the Vengeance of God, and to wiſh you may either rot alive, or may die, or be damned, or the like, if you either did, or would do, this or the other thing. And, at the ſame time, conſider how juſt it would be, for, God to take you at your Word, and to ſend you into the Congregation of the Dead, with this viſible Mark of his fiery Indignation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe you ſhould eſcape with Impunity in this World, and ſhould live to grow old in Years as well as in Sin; Yet after all,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003851_0024_100264EF26E21230"/>4. Conſider, 'Tis moſt likely God will deny you his Grace at laſt, and bring the Damnation of Hell upon you in the long run. For the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> has told us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Mouth of God, in in Chap 65.20. <hi>That the ſinner being an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed.</hi> And conſequently the longer he lives in Sin, the more aggravated will be his eternal Damnation. And Oh, that every Chriſtleſs and Graceleſs Sinner in this Aſſembly, and particularly the prophane Children and Youth in it, might be ſo impreſt from theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to be ready to hearken to all the Warnings and Counſels that are given them from God, both by his Word and Providences!</p>
            <p>And here, upon this awful Occaſion, I would, with all earneſtneſs, beſeech our tho'tleſs Youth, and all others that are madly walking in the ways of their own Hearts, and in the ſight of their Eyes, to hearken to the ſolemn Warnings that have been frequently given, by Condemned Criminals, at the Time and Place of their Execution. For theſe are certainly Warnings from the Dead, if there are any ſuch given us in this World. What you may hear from theſe miſerable Men, or how far they may think it their Duty, in their dying Moments, to give Glory to God, in this way, I know not But I am certain that ſome others when they have been greatly awakened, at the near Proſpect of Death and Eternity, have given the moſt ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſolemn Warnings to their vain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and to all Spectators, to beware of thoſe Sins which have led on by degrees to their tragical End. And they are uſually ſuch as theſe. Their early Diſobedience to their Parents; Their reſiſting and grieving the ſtriving Spirit of God: Their Neglect of Prayer: Their Deſpiſing the Sabbaths of the Lord, and turning a deaf Ear to the many Warnings and Counſels that were given to them in the Miniſtry of the Word: Their prophane
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003851_0025_100264F1B1410240"/>
Curſing and Swearing, and taking the Name of God in vain: Their intolerable Pride: Their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Paſſion: Their frequent running into bad Company: Their Drunkenneſs: Their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs: Their Theft, and the like. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you would not fall after their fatal Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Oh! beware of theſe Heaven during Sins, which without a ſeaſonable and thorow Repentance, will inevitably lead to the like, or a much worſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And let all thoſe whoſe conſciences witneſs to their own Guilt, in any of theſe reſpects, be perſwaded to fly inſtantly to the Blood of Chriſt for the Pardon of all their paſt Sins. Pray earneſtly for a new Heart: make an entire Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your ſelves to God now in &amp; thro' the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and commit the keeping of your ſelves to Him, in a way of well-doing. And in this way you may reaſonably expect the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſanctifying, and the comforting Influences of God's holy Spirit while you live, and hope for eternal Life in the World to come.</p>
            <p>And this leads me now to the next Head of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. And this is,</p>
            <p n="2">II. By way of <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Encouragement.</hi> Firſt, To all ſuch Sinners who are in Diſtreſs and Anguiſh from a Conſideration of the Greatneſs of their Sins. And Secondly, to the poor condemned Criminals in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſay a word for the Conſolation and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of all ſuch Sinners who are in deep Diſtreſs and Anguiſh, from a conſideration of the Greatneſs of their paſt Sins. For there have been (and, doubtleſs there are at this day) many poor Sinners, who, under very awakening Convictions, have had ſuch a doleful Proſpect of the heinous Nature of their paſt Tranſgreſſions, that they have been ready to conclude, they have ſinned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beyond all Hopes of Recovery; and that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003851_0026_100264F428BAA6A8"/>
now there can be no Mercy in ſtore for them. They have ſinned, it may be, againſt former Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Means, and, perhaps, notoriouſly broke their former ſolemn Vows and Engagements made to God in a ſerious Frame: and the very tho'ts of theſe things are ready to drive them into utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. And therefore when they have gone to ask Counſel of the Miniſters of Chriſt, or any other experienced Chriſtians, they have frequently made theſe or the like mournful Enquiries. Did God ever forgive ſuch a vile Tranſgreſſor as I have been? one who has ſo often, and for ſo long a time, been daring the Vengeance of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me? Is it poſſible, that ſuch as I am ſhould ever obtain Mercy from God? Can there be any Grace in ſtore for me? &amp;c. Now to every ſuch diſtreſſed Soul I can anſwer, with all Aſſurance, in the Affirmative, and ſay, <hi>Yes</hi>; God has forgiven many a Tranſgreſſor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as great as you have been: For ſuch were <hi>Manaſſah, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and many more. And 'tis poſſible you may obtain Mercy, at the hands of God, as well as they. Nay, 'tis very probable there is Grace particularly in ſtore for you And this I will venture to ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for your Encouragement, That if you hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewail and lament your Sins before the Lord, the greatneſs of your paſt Sins will be ſo far from being a hindrance to a Pardon, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther move the Lord ſpeedily to take pity on you, under your diſtreſſing Circumſtances. For the Grace of God can as eaſily triumph over the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as over the leaſt Unworthineſs: And he is as ready to forgive the greateſt Tranſgreſſions, to the truly penitent, as to pardon the leaſt Iniquity. And therefore if you will but improve the Liberty you may take at the Throne of Grace, and plead with <hi>David</hi> in the Text, <hi>For thy names ſake, O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is great</hi>; you
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003851_0027_100204BD0C28C330"/>
may be ſure of a gracious Anſwer For God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who cannot deceive, has promiſed, <hi>That if we confeſs and forſake our Sins, we ſhall find Mercy.</hi> Prov. 28.13. And to encourage you to lay hold on this, and ſuch like Promiſes, he has further ſaid, in Iſai 55 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this leads me now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To direct my ſelf to the poor Condemned Criminals in this Aſſembly. And what a word of Encouragement does this Subject afford to you in your preſent moſt deplorable Condition. Alaſs! miſerable Men! we heartily mourn your ſad State and Doom. For tho' your Tranſgreſſions have been many and great and your Iniquities have found you out, and you are to be cut off this Day, from the Land of the Living; the one for a <hi>cruel Murder</hi>; and the other for a vile <hi>Burglary</hi> and Theft, which is now made a <hi>capital</hi> Crime, by the wholeſome Laws of the Land; yet our Bowels are moved with the tendereſt Compaſſion for you: and we heartily wiſh and pray for your Eternal Salvation. But I muſt confeſs 'tis with Fear and Trembling what the Event may be. For when we conſider the great Advantages you have had, ſince your Trial and Condemnation, firſt, in the mercy of the Government, in ſparing you ſo long from Execution; and then, in the unwearied pains which ſome of the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt have taken with you: In the firſt place, to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the miſerable State you are in, by the Breach of the firſt Covenant between God and Man; and, in the next place, to give you a true Goſpel Account of the New-Covenant way to Eternal Life by Jeſus Chriſt: And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that after all this, you have (eſpecially one
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003851_0028_100264F5ACB87898"/>
of you) too frequently given way to Intemperance, and in the Exceſs of Drink and Paſſion have often vented a Rage and Madneſs, far unbecoming the ſtate of true Penitents. I ſay, when we conſider theſe Things, we can't but have a great Jealouſy leaſt the Grace of God has been beſtowed upon you in vain. But, O wretched Men! I pray you would not miſconſtrue this Plainneſs: nor look upon it as an Effect of Ill-will, or of an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Temper, or as if I mention theſe things to drive you now at laſt into a Deſpair of the Mercy of God. No, God knows it proceeds from a ſenſe of Duty, and from a tender Compaſſion for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and immortal Souls; if now in the laſt hour or two of Life, you may be brought to a ſaving Repentance. And therefore, if we can miniſter any Light and Direction to you, under your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Darkneſs; any Word of true Support and Comfort to your ſinking Spirits; or be any ways helpful to you in your ſpeedy Preparation for Death and Eternity: The Searcher of all Hearts knows how ready we are, to do all we can for you, in theſe Reſpects. And ag<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ably, if your miſerable and diſtreſſing Circumſtances have now at laſt been a means to revive the Convictions of God's Spirit in you, and thereby to bring you into a deep Concern for the Salvation of your periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls (which is our earneſt Prayer to God for you) then, what you have heard at this Time muſt bring a rich Cordial to your fainting Souls. For have your Sins been very many and great? Jeſus the Son of God is a great Saviour, <hi>and able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him.</hi> Are they of a crimſon and ſcarlet dye? There is merit enough in the precious blood of Chriſt to cleanſe you from the Guilt and Pollution of them all. And if you are tempted to queſtion his Willingneſs to ſave ſuch vile Sinners as you have been: If you have now a broken and contrite Heart in you, I can
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003851_0029_100204BF9D800080"/>
aſſure you from the holy Scriptures, that God now invites, intreats, and commands you to come unto him for eternal Life and Salvation. And you may go to him, under all your Sin and Guilt, and even make uſe of the greatneſs of your Sins, as an Argument to move his eternal Compaſſions towards you <hi>For, behold, now is the accepted Time: behold, now is the Day of Salvation:</hi> tho' alas! This is the very laſt of your Days of Grace, and this the laſt publick Call you are ever like to have to Repentance and Salvation, before you die. Oh then, miſerable Men, fly to a SAVIOUR now, as to your only Refuge; fly to him inſtantly: for, behold, ETERNITY, ETERNITY is at the Door: and you muſt, before this Sun is ſet, enter into an awful Eternity: And now is the only Time you are ever like to have to prepare for that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Oh then, I ſay again, fly to the Almighty JESUS this moment. Caſt yourſelves down at his merciful Feet: Smite upon your Breaſts, and let each of you cry out, in Agony of Soul, <hi>God be merciful to me a poor Sinner.</hi> Beg of God the deepeſt Repentance for all your paſt Sins, and particularly for the Sins for which you ſtand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die: Plead with him for a new Heart: Be earneſt with him for a ſaving Faith in Chriſt. And when you have done this, then lift up your Eyes to Heaven, and you may behold the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty REDEEMER, with the Arms of his Mercy open to receive you And you may ariſe and run into them for Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>And, in particular, as you are now going to meet <hi>the King of Terrors,</hi> in the moſt formidable Appearance, Oh! beg ſpeedy Preparation for Death, that you may be able to meet it with a ſuitable Frame of Spirit: That, in your dying Moments, you may give Glory to God, by a moſt penitent Confeſſion of Sin; by expreſſing a lively Faith in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003851_0030_100264F756C44EE0"/>
Chriſt; by a ſtedfaſt Hope of eternal Life; and by a chearful Reſignation of your Spirits into the Hands of our glorious God and Saviour. And in this way, tho' the Death of the Body may be ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſhameful, the Reproach of it will be done away in the Day of Chriſt's Appearing, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true Penitent ſhall appear with him in Glory. But, Oh! miſerable Men! I cannot take my leave of you, 'till I obſerve to you, That if after all the Means and Pains that have been uſed with you, both in private and publick, you ſhould die in a ſtate of Impenitency, with a reigning Enmity in your Hearts againſt the Bleſſed God, and with an unforgiving Spirit towards Men; <hi>which God forbid</hi>: then all the ſolemn Applications that have been made to you now, and at other ſeaſons, ſince your Condemnation, will ſerve only to aggravate your dreadful Doom, at the Great Day, and your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miſery in the World to come. But while you remain fit ſubjects for it, our Prayers ſhall be, that all may miniſter to your Eternal Salvation. AMEN.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſorrowful occaſion upon which the foregoing very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and pathetical ſermon was preach'd, is told us in the <hi>title-page.</hi> One of theſe criminals, namely, <hi>Matthew Cuſhing,</hi> was an unhappy youth, who had not ſeen <hi>twenty two years</hi> in the world. I ſuppoſe there has not at any time been a criminal amongſt us more talk'd of, and whoſe circumſtances have ſo rung thro' the town and country. Many of the reports that have gone abroad, I am very ſure are falſe and groundleſs; for this reaſon, as well as to gratify the deſires of ſome ſerious perſons, who would willingly know what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all the means of grace uſed with him had upon him, I ſhall endeavour to give a plain and faithful account of his behaviour after his condemnation, and at the time of his execution, ſo far as it came under my knowledge and obſervation: And it may be, the honour of God, and good of others may be ſomething ſerved by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003851_0032_100264FC307CD398"/>He was born at <hi>Limerick</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of Roman catholick parents. What impreſſions of religion he had receiv'd were in their way; but theſe were very ſmall, and next to none. He left his parents when he was about ſixteen years of age, but was never ſo happy as to fall in the way of religious inſtruction, or a good example. And therefore when I firſt ſaw him after his condemnation, I found him as ignorant as you can well ſuppoſe a rational creature to be, who had ever liv'd in thoſe countrys that are call'd chriſtian. But as he greatly needed inſtruction, ſo he ſeem'd to me to have a good natural capacity for it, and to be very deſirous of it. He entreated me to ſee him as often as I could, and that it might be daily if I could ſpare him the time; and always receiv'd my viſits to him with all thankfulneſs. He likewiſe deſir'd to hear the word of God in public, which was readily granted him: And ſo he conſtantly attended the <hi>Lecture</hi> on <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> and on <hi>Lords-days</hi> where he choſe for himſelf.</p>
            <p>By the bleſſing of God on theſe means uſed with him, he in a little time attain'd to ſome good degree of knowledge in the things of God and ſalvation; tho' he was not able to read, which was a great hindrance to his progreſs in knowledge, and made the labour of thoſe that inſtructed him much the harder. And when he thus became a little better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, he would ſpeak of his unhappineſs
<pb facs="unknown:003851_0033_100204C799383128"/>
in the want of a good education; and ſay of himſelf, that in time paſt <hi>he knew little more than a bruit.</hi> No wonder then he was, (to uſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s expreſſions) <hi>as a horſe, or a mule, which hath no underſtanding; whoſe mouth muſt be held in with bit and bridle.</hi> I mention this to excite parents very carefully to bring up their children in <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> as one powerful means of reſtraint when they grow up: And to let our catechized inſtructed youth know, that by their ſinning againſt ſuch a religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as they have been favour'd with, their ſins become more heinous in the ſight of God, than the ſins of others, ſuch as he was.</p>
            <p>The arrows of conviction alſo ſeem'd at times to ſtick in him. He us'd frequently to confeſs his ſins, and bewail himſelf on the account of them with crying and tears; ſpeaking of himſelf as an <hi>over-grown ſinner,</hi> for whom he was afraid there was no mercy; and lamenting not only the ſinfulneſs of his life, but of his heart &amp; nature as the ſource and ſpring from which all proceeded: And was divers times over-heard in his priſon chamber, in the night time eſpecially, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pleading with God in prayer.</p>
            <p>But at other times his behaviour was with much levity &amp; unconcernedneſs The vain and inconſiderate people that reſorted to the priſon yard, and were almoſt continually

calling to and talking with him, were a great hurt and ſnare to him; ſo that he was once or twice ſadly overcome with ſtrong drink; and being of a very quick and haſty natural temper, he once and again fell into violent tranſports of paſſion, wherein <hi>the language of hell</hi> which he had ſo us'd himſelf to before, was utter'd by him in a moſt ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and under a kind of ſatanic impreſſion.</p>
            <p>By and by again he would bewail himſelf, and ſeem'd aſtoniſh'd at the prodigious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his own heart, the enmity, (or <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,</hi> as his own word was) which he found there againſt God and holineſs. After one ſuch fit I remember he ſaid to me, <hi>He had carried himſelf ſo as to make every body hate him, and he did not wonder at it, for he now hated himſelf more than others could hate him.</hi> And added, <hi>That he now ſaw if it were poſſible for him to go to heaven with ſuch a nature as his, not chang'd &amp; renew'd, heaven would be no heaven to him, but a place of uneaſineſs and miſery rather.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus there were frequent ſtruggles between ſtrong convictions and raging corruptions, till on the very day before his execution he fell into as bad a frame is he had been in at all, wherein his <hi>tongue</hi> was as it were <hi>ſet on fire of hell.</hi> This gave the greateſt concern and anxiety of mind to thoſe whome had been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for his converſion, and uſing the means of ſalvation with him, in hopes he
<pb facs="unknown:003851_0035_100264FF38A00090"/>
might be found among the elect of God; and made them ready to give up all hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and begin to fear whether he would not even die raging &amp; curſing, or lay violent hands on himſelf before hand, as I know he had been tempted to do.</p>
            <p>But by degrees the tranſport went off, ſo that in the beginning of the evening, he again appear'd to be in a moſt humble, broken, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent frame. A Miniſter of the Town <note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. <hi>Byles.</hi>
               </note> who now went in to ſee him, tells me, <hi>He never ſaw a man in ſo perfect an agony. O Sir,</hi> ſaid he to the Miniſter upon his going in, <hi>Can you think there are any hopes of me?</hi> The Miniſter replyed, <hi>I ſaw you in ſo good a frame yeſterday, that I began to conceive good hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you.</hi> He anſwered, —<hi>But I have this day been curſing and ſwearing again! — Oh! was there ever ſuch a wicked heart as mine?— I ſee I can't truſt to my own reſolutions! —Oh! if I ſhould be in ſuch a frame to morrow when I am to die!</hi> And the tho't and fear of this ſeem'd greatly to diſtreſs him, and make him cry to God for help.</p>
            <p>He now deſir'd ſome body might read to him ſome ſuitable portions of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which was done till late at night: and the remainder of the night, a great part of it
<pb facs="unknown:003851_0036_100204CEB8D368B8"/>
at leaſt, he ſpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thoſe that watch'd at the place have told me, in earneſt prayer to God.</p>
            <p>And now the awful and deciſive day is come on, on which he appear'd compos'd and prayerful, and expreſs'd a humble reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the will of heaven in his death; declaring <hi>he mattere'd not what his body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuffer'd here, if it might be well with his ſoul hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he went to the place of execution, he was full of earneſt ſhort addreſſes to heaven, ſuch as theſe; <hi>Lord, be merciful to me a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! — I am an overgrown Sinner! Lord GOD! ſearch me! — O turn my ſoul over and over!</hi> [By which he meant that the work of grace in him might be a perfect &amp; through work] <hi>Lord, let my death be ſanctified to all theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they may all, every one of them take warning by me!</hi> He now ſpake of his <hi>late ſins,</hi> as the moſt aggravated ſins of his life, and lying moſt heavy upon him.</p>
            <p>Being come to the gate at the end of the town, he look'd up upon it and cried, <hi>Lord! let the gate of heaven now be open to receive me, as this gate is open to me to go thro'!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being arriv'd at the place of execution, tho' he in ſome circumſtances ſhew'd ſuch preſence of mind as ſome were ready to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, yet nothing I think that could juſtly be call'd ſtupidity or hardneſs. He declar'd
<pb facs="unknown:003851_0037_10026501B08737C0"/>
               <hi>he was not afraid of the death he was to ſuffer, only of appearing before his judge.</hi> With a loud voice he warn'd the ſpectators of thoſe ſins and vices, which had fill'd up his ſhort life, and ripen'd him for the judgments of God. And when the public prayer made on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was over, to which he compoſedly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, then he fell into an <hi>agony,</hi> and in his <hi>agony he prayed</hi>; and never did I hear ſuch piercing cries go up to heaven, at which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds were diſſolv'd into tears. With unutterable anguiſh he ſent up ſuch petitions as theſe, <hi>O Lord God, be merciful to me a poor ſinner! O Lord, ſave a periſhing ſinner, that is periſhing before God and man! Let me not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in this world and in the other too!</hi> And now he call'd to the ſpectators, <hi>O pray for me, for I an't able to pray for my ſelf!</hi> In theſe petitions he made Chriſt his plea and argument, ſaying, <hi>Lord, ſave me thro' the means of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt! His blood is ſufficient! His blood is ſufficient! He came to ſave the chief of ſinners. O Lord God, draw me to thy Son Jeſus Chriſt!</hi>— So when <hi>the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of death compaſs'd him, and the pains of hell gat hold upon him, and he found trouble and ſorrow, he call'd upon the name of the Lord, O Lord, I beſeech thee to deliver my ſoul.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given a plain narrative of matter of fact. I pronounce nothing at all upon it. It becomes us to leave him in the hands of a ſovereign, righteous, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
<pb facs="unknown:003851_0038_100265042409F3C0"/>
God, whoſe judgment, and not ours, has the diſpoſal of him. There is no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity further to try the ſincerity of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Whether <hi>the ſtrong man arm'd,</hi> who ſtrove ſo violently to keep poſſeſſion of the houſe, was in the laſt conflict overcome and turn'd out, and the ſpirit of God became triumphantly victorious, and <hi>reſcu'd the prey from the mighty,</hi> we muſt not know till the great day of the manifeſtation of all things.</p>
            <p>If the caſe ſhould be as bad as any may fear, and there was not after all a true work of grace wro't in this miſerable man, we may learn this from it, <hi>That converſion, wherever it is wro't, is the work of free, ſovereign, almighty grace.</hi> It is not in the power of men or means to convert a ſinner; nor is it in the power of a ſinner to convert himſelf. The fear of death and hell, in the near views of them, will not work a ſaving ſanctifying change in the ſoul. A ſinner may ſee his ſins, &amp; have great concern for them, and yet not hate them ſo as to turn from them. He may ſee his duty, and yet not have a heart to do it. He may ſee his danger, and yet run upon it. He may ſee the day of death and judgment near; and yet not do any thing to purpoſe in the great buſineſs of his ſalvation.— Where then is that <hi>free-will,</hi> and thoſe powers of nature which ſome ſo earneſtly plead for? Therefore, <hi>O unconverted ſinner,</hi> ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, God of his free grace muſt work
<pb facs="unknown:003851_0039_100204D44061F238"/>
all your works in you and for you. If you have any tho'ts of turning to him, beg of him not to leave you to your ſelf. Be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely afraid of doing any thing to provoke him to take his holy Spirit from you. Let <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s prayer in the day of his conviction be yours, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To have done; I am hot without hopes God intends good to ſome ſouls by means of this providence. I have obſerved in times paſt, ſome or other have been awakened by the publick diſcourſes on ſuch ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And if what a miniſter intends more particularly for the benefit of one, is ſet home by the Spirit of God on another, free-grace will ſtill be glorified, and a ſoul ſaved. We muſt leave it to God to <hi>ſhew mercy to whom he will ſhew mercy</hi>; and none <hi>may find fault with his will. For my tho'ts are not your tho'ts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thot's than your tho'ts.</hi>
