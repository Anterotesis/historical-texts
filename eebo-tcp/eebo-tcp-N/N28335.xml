            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE LADY OF THE PRESIDENT VON DER WENSE, OF THE FAMILY OF AHLEFELD.</head>
            <p>IT has been often said, that poetry and love obey no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It is not true, my most amiable friend; since, if your memory is faithful in respect to trifles, you will recollect that this play has to thank your commands alone for its existence.</p>
            <p>On a dark and rainy evening in Pyrmont, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the enjoyment of the charms of nature, you took refuge in the temple of Thalia. Nauman's opera of Cora was the piece performed. The performers were bad, and my only pleasure arose from being placed behind you and partaking at times of your conversation. Among other observations you remarked, "that this opera con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an excellent subject for a play."</p>
            <p>I felt that this idea would have originated with me, if I had not been situated exactly as I was: however, I seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with avidity, and entreated you to command the execution. This was long refused. Commands are not the language of my friend. However, I insisted upon a positive command.</p>
            <p>"Well, then, I command it," you said at length, with a naiveté all your own. I bowed—and behold, here stands my "Virgin of the Sun." At your command the poor maiden appears trembling in your anti-chamber. Give permission that she may enter, and attend your toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette with downcast eyes, until you beckon her forward with the smile of friendship.</p>
            <p>"Approach, my child! Thou shalt be welcome to me for thy father's sake, who possesses my friendship, and from whom I would now be far from withdrawing the least of his joys, since so little remains in this world for him to lose."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037763_0005_100F0972C15E4010"/>
Alas! it is too true! I possessed a treasure once that might have been compared to you—for she was the best of wives and of mothers. She has gone to the house of her father, to mingle with her sister angels. You drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a tear over my sorrows. For that tear my heart still thanks you, and impels my pen to this open declaration of my highest esteem and admiration.</p>

I have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my zeal and my valor in many a well-sought field—I proved them more especially on that day when the throne of Ataliba shook beneath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Iluascar, and Rolla's sword enriched the fields

Lay your hand upon your heart and tell me; what are your sensations in the moments of temperance and reflection? Don Alonzo Molina quitted the savage followers of Pizarro, because he abhorred their barbarities—because he saw in every Indian an unoffending brother. That was noble! "I will go," said he, "among these well-deserving people, and be their friend and instructor." This was worthy of my friend!—You put in execution your benevolent plan. You were received—beloved—honored—and cherished. What followed? On one of their solemn festivals, my noble friend Alonzo beholds in the temple a priestess of the sun, as she presents the bread of sacrifice to the king. She is young—she is lovely. The heart of my friend is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed—suddenly all his great designs are lost in the sea of oblivion; and the champion of the rights of humanity slumbers on his post.</p>

                        <hi>(Shaking his hand.)</hi> Alonzo—when I see a boy struggling in the water, it is not my practice to call to him—" You should not have fallen in." I draw him out, if I can.—But here, we are fairly in the mire, and the devil fetch me if I see the way to get out of it. If we had a ship, or a conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's cloak, to whisk us off through the air, Don Juan Velasquez would not be the last among the fugitives. But, as it is—arm thyself with courage Velasquez—wrap thyself up to the teeth in thy cloak, and let the thunder and lightning come when it will.</p>

Here has the reverend Don Juan Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasquez been preaching like a bishop; yet scarcely does the sound produced by the clapping of two heathenish hands reach the culprit who was doing penance under the lecture, but all the moralizing is lost in the air, and the penitent skips off to fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for another confession.</p>

You will be burnt at the stake, without doubt: farewell—I wish you much pleasure.—I shall return home, and take ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Diego, or trusty Diego, or our trusty and well-beloved friend Diego with me—And when Diego and I, or I and Diego, are safe in Madrid, we will say a prayer to help you out of your diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>

                     <p>Yes, indeed. A strange but pleasing sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness has taken possession of my heart. When, at the last festival, I adorned the porch of the temple with flowers, I saw upon the steps a young woman lying asleep, and on her breast lay a little lovely angel, which smiled as it looked in my face. My full heart melted—I stretched out my arms to the child—I wished softly to steal it from its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and press it to my throbbing bosom. But what is so easily broken as the slumbers of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mother? Hardly had I touched the child, ere she sprung anxiously up, clasped her treasure close to her heart, and darted in my face a look of displeasure and distrust. Alonzo, is it not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to be a mother?</p>

                     <p>It is sure and simple. Yes, the rising of this morning's sun, shall show, whether the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my heart deceive me, whether the gods are displeased or not with Cora. Hitherto the moon and stars alone have been the witnesses of our love; but the sun himself, the greatest of our gods, shall now be the witness and the judge. We will ascend yonder hill together. We will turn our faces towards the east, and joining hand in hand, as a token of our union, boldly await the rising of our god. If Cora have done evil, either the sun will veil himself from her sight, or the first ray of his light which falls upon her, will annihilate the criminal. Soon will his beams ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above the horizon; hasten, hasten to ascend the hill! <hi>(She ascends the hill, Alonzo follows her.)</hi> Behold!—A minute longer and we had been too late—see how the east is streaked with gold! Oh! rejoice, Alonzo! No cloud troubles the serenity of my god—he is not offended! <hi>(She kneels.)</hi> Father, I thank thee!—Oh! if what I feel is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, be thy glorious countenance veiled in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as a token of thy wrath!—No! See, Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, he smiles! he blesses your Cora!—O, my heart is full of joy and gratitude! Kneel with me, Alonzo, and let us offer our prayers and our thanks.</p>

My mother used ever to say—"Rolla is good; love him, become his wife, and I shall die in peace."—But my poor mother died, and Rolla was gone to the wars, and a sacred flame was kindled in my bosom. He came back, but I could not love him. My heart listened only to the gods, and I sighed for the day on which I should be wedded to the sun.</p>

                     <p>I love! Yes, Rolla, I love this young man. I saw him for the first time in the temple. He stood by the side of the king. I trembled, and the offering almost fell from my hand. His ardent looks, rivetted on me, told me his heart was mine. The gods saw, and pitied us. You must well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member those awful days, when for several months the mountains shot forth fire; the sea boiled; and the earth quaked—When our buildings were laid in ruins, and even the holy temple of the sun was burst in two several places, and the sacred walls which surround it were rent in twain. We, poor terror-struck creatures, ran from the death that threatened us in our cells—but, under the wide canopy of heaven, still death pursued us. The earth yawned—the walls crash'd—we mingled our shrieks with the groans of suffering nature. Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, ever watchful, perceived the breach in the wall, and boldly rushed among the ruins. There opened the earth, and here my arms, to receive him. He gave me life; I gave him love.</p>

Thank thee, Cora! for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rain which thus revives a withered plant. Yes, we will fly!—It is dangerous, but such danger shall be welcome to Rolla.

                     <p>According to your orders we went to look for Cora. We ran hither and thither, and called her by her name, but to no purpose; till, at last, as we were looking about and listening, we thought we heard voices on the other side of the wall, just by the arbour, where the little stream is lost in the wood. We followed the sound, and crept softly through the thick bushes, till, at length, we came to a great, great rent in the wall, from the top to the bottom, and so broad that Amazili and I could easily go through it, and we had only to step over a few stones to get quite on the outside.</p>

                     <speaker>Ida.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and was talking with the Spaniards. At first we thought they were men, and were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to run away; but they entreated us very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to stay: and, as we found they really were only Spaniards, we thought there could be no harm in complying with them.</p>

"My Cora is young and inexperienced, should she ever want maternal counsel, be it received from you!"

She is a good girl, she will never occasion you trouble." And when he imprinted the last kiss upon your forehead, and the tear trembled upon his grey eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lashes—what were his parting words?—" Cora, honor her as your mother!"</p>

My remainder of years are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. Be you his father when I die! I know that the boy is brave. He will never forget that the blood of the Incas flows in his veins.

Oh! had you known me in youth, you would have seen one more eager to brandish the sword in the face of my country's enemies, than to hold the knife to the throat of the lambs and turtle doves of the altar.

Thou—the only being on whom my love hangs, the only being for whose love I pant! Listen to my mournful story!

                     <p>As high priest I had free access at all times to the house of the stars. My eyes roved at pleasure among the blossoms which were daily unfolded within its walls. This long remained a mere amusement to the eye, in which the heart took no part. At length Zulma shone forth in the midst of her sisters, an image of the god she served. I saw and loved her: struggled with my passion, but could not overcome. I was soon convinced that her heart beat responsively to mine. The voice of reason and duty was listened to no longer—passion was ascendant in our bosoms—and—Rolla, you are my son!</p>

                     <p>Right. The Inca is the image of God upon earth. The last Inca, as well as the first. Therefore, may the present Inca, who rules a mild and civilized people, ameliorate the laws which were made for savages.</p>

In climbing the lofty heights of honor, still love has been my conductor. It was my companion in the day of danger; and, in the field of battle, the only word I heard was Cora.—O Inca! shew that you have the feelings of a man! Extend your mercy to Cora—on my knees I entreat for her life. Since Cora has called me brother, I have

               <p>Call me what you please!—Yet, if I be an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast, think not that I am suddenly become so. This heart was born to be the seat of mighty passions.—To the common swarm of emmets which bustle about the world, I had an aversion, even as a boy. When my play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates were merry and sportive around me, I played it is true, but I always found it irksome, though I never could precisely ascertain to what cause that feeling might be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed. But when storms lowered around the horizon, when our mountains vomitted forth flames at midnight, or
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037763_0077_100F0A0CB0369B08"/>
subterraneous groanings announced an approaching earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, then my heart felt elevated; my languishing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit revived; the withered plant again reared its head. As I advanced in life, no female attractions had power to charm my eyes;—they remained stedfastly and eagerly fixed on the more brilliant rays of honor. Blinded to every beauty of Nature, my heart, my throbbing heart, burned solely to run the career of same and glory; while each victory that I obtained, far from proving an assuag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drop to mitigate the flame, served only to increase its ardor.—Then it was that I saw Cora again!</p>

               <p>Since she immediately began to avoid me, I saw that the effort was painful, that love and duty were at war in her bosom, and, desirous to render the conflict less severe, I determined equally to avoid her. Many months lingered on in this miserable situation, while both endured the keenest torments of hopeless passion: our cheeks grew pale; our eyes became hollow and sunk; despair reigned in every feature; till at length Zulma's weaker frame could no longer support such complicated sorrow—she was attacked with a violent illness, and lay at the point of death; while I—Rolla, you seem af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected!</p>
