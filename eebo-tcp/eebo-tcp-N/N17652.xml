            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ENQUIRY into the EFFECTS of SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS upon the HUMAN BODY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BY ſpirits I mean all thoſe liquors which are obtained by diſtillation from the fermented juices or ſubſtances of any kind. Theſe liquors were formerly uſed only in medicine.—They now conſtitute a principal part of the drinks of many countries.</p>
            <p>Since the introduction of ſpirituous liquors into ſuch general uſe, phyſicians have remarked that a number of new diſeaſes have appeared among us, and have deſcribed many new ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms as common to old diſeaſes. Spirits in their firſt operation are ſtimulating upon the ſyſtem. They quicken the circulation of the blood, and produce ſome heat in the body. Soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they become what is called ſedative; that is, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the action of the vital powers, and thereby produce langour and weakneſs.</p>
            <p>The effects of ſpirituous liquors upon the human body in producing diſeaſes are ſometimes gradual. A ſtrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, eſpecially if it be aſſiſted with conſtant and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, will counteract the deſtructive effects of ſpirits for many years, but in general they produce the following diſeaſes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſickneſs at the ſtomach, and vomiting in the morning. This diſorder is generally accompanied with a want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for breakfaſt. It is known by tremors in the hands, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that perſons who labour under it are hardly able to lift a teacup to their heads 'till they have taken a doſe of ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial liquor. In this diſorder, a peculiar paleneſs, with ſmall red ſtreaks, appear in the cheeks. The fleſh of the face at the ſame time has a peculiar fulneſs and flabbineſs which are very different from ſound and healthy fat.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="unknown:022865_0005_0FBA9C6A1D3FD6B8"/>
2. An univerſal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. This diſorder begins firſt in the lower limbs, and gradually extends itſelf throughout the whole body. I have been told that the merchants in Charleſton, in South-Carolina, never truſt the planters when ſpirits have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the firſt ſymptom of this ſecond diſorder upon them. It is very natural to ſuppoſe, that induſtry and virtue have become extinct in that man whoſe legs and feet are ſwelled from the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſtruction of the liver. This diſorder produces other diſeaſes ſuch as an inflammation, which ſometimes proves ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fatal—the jaundice—and a dropſy of the belly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Madneſs. It is unneceſſary to deſcribe this diſeaſe with all its terrors and conſequences. It is well known in every townſhip where ſpirituous liquors are uſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Palſy and 6. the Apoplexy compleat the group of diſeaſes produced by ſpirituous liquors. I do not aſſert that theſe two diſorders are never produced by any other cauſes, but I maintain that ſpirituous liquors are the moſt frequent cauſes of them, and that when a prediſpoſition to them is produced by other cauſes, they are rendered more certain and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous by the intemperate uſe of ſpirits.</p>
            <p>I have only named a few of the principal diſorders produced by ſpirituous liquors. It would take up a volume to deſcribe how much other diſorders natural to the human body are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and complicated by them. Every ſpecies of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and putrid fever is rendered more frequent and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate by the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p>The danger to life from the diſeaſes which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is well known. I do not think it extravagant therefore to repeat here what has been often ſaid, that ſpirituous liquors deſtroy more lives than the ſword. War has its intervals of deſtruction—but ſpirits operate at all times and ſeaſons upon human life. The ravages of war are confined to but one part of the human ſpecies, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to men, but ſpirits act too often upon perſons who are exempted from the dangers of war by age or ſex; and laſtly, war deſtroys only thoſe perſons who allow the uſe of arms to be lawful, wheareas ſpirits inſinuate their fatal effects among people whoſe principles are oppoſed to the effuſſion of human blood.</p>
            <p>Let us next turn our eyes from the effects of ſpirits upon health and life to their effects upon <hi>property;</hi> and here freſh ſcenes of miſery open to our view. Among the inhabitants of cities, they produce debts—diſgrace and bankruptcy. Among farmers they produce idleneſs with its uſual conſequences, ſuch as houſes without windows—barns without roofs—gardens
<pb facs="unknown:022865_0006_0FBA9C6EC56E1B30"/>
without encloſures—fields without fences—hogs without yokes—ſheep without wool—meagre cattle—feeble horſes—and half clad dirty children without principles, morals or manners.—This picture is not exaggerated. I appeal to the obſervations of every man in Pennſylvania, whether ſuch ſcenes of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs do not follow the tracks of ſpirituous liquors in every part of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>If we advance one ſtep further and examine the effects of ſpirituous liquors upon the <hi>moral faculty,</hi> the proſpect will be ſtill more diſtreſſing and terrible. The firſt effects of ſpirits upon the mind ſhew themſelves in the <hi>temper.</hi> I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerved men who are intoxicated in any degree with ſpirits to be peeviſh and quarrelſome; after a while they loſe by degrees the moral ſenſe. They violate promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements without ſhame or remorſe. From theſe deficiences in veracity and integrity, they paſs on to crimes of a more heinous nature.—It would be to diſhonour human nature only to name them.</p>
            <p>Thus have I in a few words pointed out the effects of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors upon the lives, eſtates and ſouls of my fellow-creatures.—Their miſchiefs may be ſummed up in a few words. They fill our church yards with premature graves—they fill the Sheriff's docket with executions—they croud our jails—and laſtly they people the regions—but it belongs to another profeſſion to ſhew their terrible conſequences in the future world.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to combat ſome prejudices in favor of the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> occaſions in which ſpirits have been thought to be neceſſary and uſeful.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In very cold weather.</item>
               <item>2. In very warm weather. And</item>
               <item>3. In times of hard labour.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. There cannot be a greater error than to ſuppoſe that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors leſſen the effects of cold upon the body. On the contrary, I maintain that they always render the body more liable to be affected and injured by cold. The tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary warmth they produce is always ſucceeded by chillineſs. If any thing beſides warm cloathing and exerciſe is neceſſary to warm the body in cold weather, a plentiful meal of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food is at all times ſufficient for that purpoſe. This by giving a tone to the ſtomach invigorates the whole ſyſtem, while the gentle fever created by digeſtion adds conſiderably to the natural and ordinary heat of the body, and thus renders it leſs ſenſible of the cold.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="unknown:022865_0007_0FBA9C7048164C18"/>
2. It is equally abſurd to ſuppoſe that ſpirituous liquors leſſen the effects of heat upon the body. So far from it, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſe them. They add an internal heat to the external heat of the Sun; they diſpoſe to fevers and inflammations of the moſt dangerous kind; they produce preternatural ſweats which weaken, inſtead of a uniform and gentle perſpiration which exhilarates the body. Half the diſeaſes which are ſaid to be produced by warm weather, I am perſuaded are produced by the ſpirits which are ſwallowed to leſſen its effects upon the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I maintain with equal confidence, that ſpirituous liquors do not leſſen the effects of hard labour upon the body. Look at the horſe—with every muſcle of his body ſwelled from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'till night in the plough or the team, does he make ſigns for ſpirits to enable him to cleave the earth, or to climb a hill?—No.—He requires nothing but cool water and ſubſtantial food. There is neither ſtrength nor nouriſhment in ſpirituous liquors. If they produce vigour in labour, it is of a tranſient nature, and is always ſucceeded with a ſenſe of weakneſs and fatigue. Theſe facts are founded in obſervation; for I have repeatedly ſeen thoſe men perform the greateſt exploits in work both as their degrees and duration, who never taſted ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p>But are there no conditions of the human body in which ſpirituous liquors are required? Yes, there are; 1ſt. In thoſe caſes where the body has been exhauſted by any cauſes, and faintineſs, or a ſtoppage in the circulation of the blood has been produced, the ſudden ſtimulus of ſpirits may be neceſſary. In this caſe we comply ſtrictly with the advice of Solomon, who confines the uſe of "ſtrong drink" only to him "that is ready to periſh!" And 2dly. When the body has been long expoſed to wet weather, and more eſpecially if cold be joined with it, a moderate quantity of ſpirits is not only proper but highly uſeful to obviate debility, and thus to prevent a fever. I take theſe to be the only two caſes that can occur in which ſpirituous liquors are innocent or neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But if we reject ſpirits from being part of our drinks, what liquors ſhall we ſubſtitute in the room of them? For cuſtom—the experience of all ages and countries, and even nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all ſeem to demand drinks more grateful and more cordial than ſimple water.</p>
            <p>To this I ſhall reply, by recommending in the room of ſpirits in the firſt place,</p>
            <p n="1">1. CYDER. This excellent liquor contains a ſmall quantity of ſpirit, but ſo diluted and blunted, by being combined with an
<pb facs="unknown:022865_0008_0FBA9C742791EDB8"/>
acid and a large quantity of ſacharine matter and water, as to be perfectly inoffenſive and wholeſome. It diſagrees only with perſons ſubject to the rheumatiſm, but it may be rendered inoffenſive to ſuch people by extinguiſhing a red hot iron in it, or by diluting it with water. It is to be lamented that the late froſts in the ſpring often deprive us of the fruit which affords this liquor. But the effects of theſe froſts have been in ſome meaſure obviated by giving an orchard a north-weſt expoſure, ſo as to check too early vegetation, and by kindling two or three large fires of bruſh and ſtraw to windward of the orchard the evening before we expect a night of froſt. This laſt expedient has in many inſtances within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of my knowledge, preſerved the fruit of an orchard, to the great joy, and emolument of the ingenious huſbandman.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BEER is a wholeſome liquor compared with ſpirits. The grain from which it is obtained is not liable, like the apple, to be affected with froſt, and therefore it can always be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured at a moderate expence. It abounds with nouriſhment—hence we find many of the common people in Great-Britain endure hard labour with no other food than a quart or three pints of this liquor, with a few pounds of bread a day. I have heard with great pleaſure of breweries being ſet up in ſeveral of the principal county towns of Penſylvania, and I eſteem it a ſign of the progreſs of our ſtate in wealth and happineſs, that a ſingle brewer in Cheſter county ſold above 1000 barrels of beer laſt year. While I wiſh to ſee a law impoſing the beavieſt taxes on whiſky diſtilleries, I ſhould be glad to ſee breweries (at leaſt for ſome years) wholly exempted from taxation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WINE is likewiſe a wholeſome liquor compared with ſpirits. The low wines of France I believe could be drank at a leſs expence than ſpirits in this country. The peaſants in France who drink theſe liquors in large quantities, are a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſober body of people. Wines of all kinds yield by chemical analyſis the ſame principles as cyder, but in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proportions, hence they are both cordial and nouriſhing. It is remarked that few men ever become <hi>habitual</hi> drunkards upon wine. It derives its reliſh principally from company, and is ſeldom like ſpirituous liquors drank in a chimney cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or in a cloſet. The effects of wine upon the <hi>temper</hi> are likewiſe in moſt caſes directly oppoſite to thoſe that were mentioned of ſpirituous liquors. It muſt be a bad heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is not rendered more chearful and more generous by a few glaſſes of wine.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="unknown:022865_0009_0FBA9C7551B64570"/>
4. VINEGAR and WATER ſweetened with ſugar or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, is the beſt drink that can be contrived in warm weather. I beg leave to recommend this wholeſome mixture to reapers in a particular <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is pleaſant and cooling. It promotes perſpiration, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They will in a little while be delighted with the good effects of their aſſociation. Their grain will be ſooner and more carefully gathered into their barns, and an hundred diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcenes of ſickneſs and contention will be avoided, which always follow in a greater or leſs degree the uſe of ſpirituous liquors. Under this head, I ſhould not neglect to recommend butter-milk and water, or ſour milk, (commonly called bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clabber) and water. It will be rendered more grateful by the addition of a little ſugar. PUNCH is likewiſe calculated to leſſen the effects of heat, and hard labour upon the body. The ſpirit in this liquor is blunted by its union with the vegetable acid. Hence it poſſeſſes not only the conſtituent parts, but moſt of the qualities of cyder, and wine. To render this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor perfectly innocent and wholeſome, it muſt be drank <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>There are certain claſſes of people to whom I beg leave to ſuggeſt a caution or two upon the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Valitudinarians, eſpecially thoſe who labour under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the ſtomach and bowels, are very apt to fly to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for relief. Let ſuch people be cautious how they repeat this dangerous remedy. I have known many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of excellent characters and principles, who have been betrayed by occaſional doſes of gin or brandy to eaſe the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, into a love of ſpirituous liquors, inſomuch that they have afterwards fallen ſacrifices to their fatal effects. The different preparations of opium are a thouſand times more ſafe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent than ſpirituous liquors in all ſpasmodic affections of the ſtomach and bowels. So apprehenſive am i of the danger of
<pb facs="unknown:022865_0010_0FBA9C770E520018"/>
contracting <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſpirituous liquors, by accuſtoming the ſtomach. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, that I think the fewer medicines we exhibit <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the better.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some people from living in countries ſubject to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fever, endeavour to fortify themſelves againſt it by two or three glaſſes of bitters made with ſpirits every day.—There is great danger of men becoming <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from this practice. Beſides, this mode of preventing intermittents is by no means a certain one. A much better ſecurity againſt them is to be found in the Jeſuits bark. A tea-ſpoonful of this excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, taken every morning during the ſickly ſeaſon, has in many inſtances preferred whole families in the neighbourhood of rivers and mill-ponds from fevers of all kinds. Thoſe who live in a ſickly part of the country, and who cannot procure the bark, or who object to taking it, I would adviſe to avoid the morning and evening air in the ſickly months—to kindle fires in their houſes on damp days, and in cool evenings throughout the whole ſummer, and to put on woollen cloathing about the firſt week in September. The laſt part of this direction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies only to the inhabitants of the middle ſtates. Theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I am perſuaded will be more effectual in preventing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal fevers than the beſt preparations that can be made from bitters in ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men who follow profeſſions that require a conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the mind or body, or perhaps of both, are very apt to ſeek relief from fatigue in ſpirituous liquors. To ſuch perſons I would beg leave to recommend the uſe of TEA inſtead of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Fatigue is occaſioned by the obſtruction of perſpiration. Tea, by removing perſpiration, removes fatigue, and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorates the ſyſtem. I am no advocate for the general or exceſſive uſe of tea.—When drank too ſtrong it is hurtful, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to the female conſtitution; but when drank of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree of ſtrength, and in moderate quantities with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and cream or milk, I believe it is in general innocent, and at all times to be preferred to ſpirituous liquors. One of the moſt induſtrious ſchoolmaſter. I ever knew, told me that he had been preſerved from the love of ſpirituous liquors by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting a love for tea in early life. Three or four diſhes drank in an afternoon, carried off the fatigue of a whole day's labour in his ſchool. This gentleman lived to be 71 years of age, and afterwards died of an acute diſeaſe in the full exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all the faculties of his mind.</p>
            <p>To every claſs of my readers, I beg leave to ſuggeſt a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the uſe of TODDY. I acknowledge that I have known ſome men who by limiting its ſtrength conſtantly by
<pb facs="unknown:022865_0011_0FBA9C7AAFBF5BB0"/>
meaſuring the ſpirit and water, and who by drinking it <hi>only</hi> with their <hi>meals,</hi> have drank toddy for many years without ſuffering in any degree from it; but I have known many more who have been inſenſibly led from drinking toddy for their conſtant drink, to take drams in the morning, and have afterwards paid their lives as the price of their folly. I ſhall ſelect one caſe from among many that have come within the compaſs of my knowledge, to ſhew the ordinary progreſs of intemprance in the uſe of ſpirituous liquors. A gentleman, once of a fair and ſober character, in the city of Philadelphia, for many years drank toddy as his conſtant drink. From this he proceeded to drink grog—after a while nothing would ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him but ſlings made of equal parts of rum and water, with a little ſugar. From ſlings he advanced to raw rum—and and from common rum to Jamaica ſpirits. Here he reſted for a few months; but at laſt he found even Jamaica ſpirits were not ſtrong enough to warm his ſtomach, and he made it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice to throw a table-ſpoonful of ground pepper into each glaſs of his ſpirits, in order (to uſe his own expreſſions) "to take off their coldneſs;" it is hardly neceſſary to add, that he ſoon afterwards died a martyr to his intemperance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude what has been ſaid of the effects of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liquors with two obſervations.—1. A people corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtrong drink cannot long be a <hi>free</hi> people. The rulers of ſuch a community will ſoon partake of the vices of that maſs from which they are ſecreted, and all our laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments will ſooner or later bear the ſame marks of the effects of ſpirituous liquors which were deſcribed formerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inviduals. I ſubmit it therefore to the conſideration of the Legiſlature of Pennſylvania, whether more laws ſhould not be made to encreaſe the expence and leſſen the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirituous liquors, and whether ſome mark of public infamy ſhould not be inflicted by law upon every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed before a common magiſtrate of drunkenneſs.</p>
            <p>The ſecond and laſt obſervation I ſhall offer is of a ſerious nature. It has been remarked that the Indians have diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where in America ſince their connection with the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans. This has been juſtly aſcribed to the Europeans having introduced ſpirituous liquors among them. Let thoſe men who are every day turning their backs upon all the benefits of cultivated ſociety, to ſeek habitations in the neighbourhood of Indians, conſider how far this wandering mode of life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſame cauſe which has ſcattered and annihilated ſo many Indian tribes.—Long life, and the ſecure poſſeſſion of property, in the land of their anceſtors, was looked upon
<pb facs="unknown:022865_0012_0FBA9C7C49740B40"/>
as a bleſſing among the ancient Jews.—For a ſon to mingle his duſt with the duſt of his father, was to act wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his inheritance; and the proſpect of this honour often afforded a conſolation even in death.—However exalted my countrymen, your ideas of liberty may be, while you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe yourſelves by the uſe of ſpirituous liquors to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, of them, you are nothing more than the pioneers, or in more ſlaviſh terms, the, "hewers of wood" of your more induſtrious neighbours.</p>
            <p>If the facts that have been ſtated, have produced in any of my readers who have ſuffered from the uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors a reſolution to abſtain from them hereafter, I muſt beg leave to inform them that they muſt leave them off <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and <hi>entirely.</hi> No man was ever <hi>gradually</hi> reformed from drinking ſpirits. He muſt not only avoid taſting, but even ſmelling them, until long habits of abſtinence have ſubdued his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them. To prevent his feeling any inconveniences from the ſudden loſs of their ſtimulus upon his ſtomach, he ſhould drink plentifully of camomile or of any other bitter tea, or a few glaſſes of ſound old wine every day. I have great pleaſure in adding, that I have ſeen a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have been <hi>effectually</hi> reſtored to health—to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter —and to uſefulneſs to their families and to ſociety by following this advice.</p>
