            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE CHURCH of ENGLAND PLANTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE obſerved it to be the Track of many a little Scribbler, who ſteps into a News-Paper, to uſher in his Production with a pompous Account of what <hi>he is.</hi> In your Hand-Bill of the 28th of laſt <hi>September,</hi> communicated to us with the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Chronicle, you have avoided this Fault, and informed us <hi>what you are not;</hi> you would be original in this as well as your other Plans —You ſay, <hi>You have not the Honour of a Seat in the Lower Houſe of Aſſembly.</hi> You might have ſpared yourſelf this Trouble, no one could have ſuſpected it; there cannot be a Set of Freeholders upon Earth ſo ignorant as to chooſe a Man for their Repreſentative, who is capable of <hi>diſcloſing ſuch weak Sentiments to the Publick,</hi> and inſulting the repreſentative Body of a Province, by giving Advice unworthy the loweſt Circle of a Tippling-Houſe.</p>
            <p>Your chief Complaint lies, <hi>That the Clergy ride you like Aſſes;</hi> I will venture to ſay, that the Parſon who rides you has a very dull Beaſt under him. You may think per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that I am angry with you; far otherwiſe. I was never better pleaſed. I am pleaſed with you for writing againſt the Clergy, becauſe you have done it ſo weakly, that you have advanced their Intereſts rather than impaired them, have proved their Advocate rather than their Opponent, and by a feeble and impotent Attack have confirmed the Eſtabliſhment you endeavoured to overthrow.</p>
            <p>To give Advice even to a Friend is a delicate Matter; it implies a Kind of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority which Men unwillingly acknowledge. It is a good Maxim never to give Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice until it is aſked; had you ſtayed until you had been aſked, you would have been ſilent for ever.—But when an Individual preſumes to inſtruct the Repreſentatives of a Country, the greateſt Caution is neceſſary not to give Offence: But this ſeems below your Concern; you not only inform the Aſſembly what their Duty is, but you plainly tell them they have neglected their Duty, and inſult the Body from whom you expect Redreſs. You talk of Grievances and <hi>Burdens,</hi> but <hi>One in particular which</hi> THEY <hi>have had in their Power to have relieved you of ever ſince the firſt Riſe of it, and that is, in Regard of the Clergy, who now ride you like Aſſes, and think it out of your Power to relieve yourſelves.</hi> How far the Aſſembly could effect your Relief of <hi>themſelves,</hi> the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011830_0003_0F8D4E5BC76635F8"/>
Nature of the Conſtitution muſt determine; but had the Burden been ſo preſſing, I dare ſay they would have uſed their beſt Endeavours to have prevented your being rode to Death.</p>
            <p>You proceed to tell us, That at the Time of the firſt ſettling of the Province,
<q>there was an abſolute Neceſſity to encourage the Clergy to ſettle amongſt us in a <hi>WILDERNESS COUNTRY;</hi> but why ſo much larger Encouragement was given to them than our neighbouring Provinces gave you cannot conceive.</q>—The Neceſſity to encourage the Clergy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue amongſt us is as abſolute and evident as it was firſt to ſettle them in this <hi>Wilderneſs Country.</hi>—As the Eſtabliſhment of a national Religion, ought to be One of the firſt and principal Acts of Civilization, ſo it ought to be the laſt Act that ceaſes, and only to expire with the Conſtitution. Men are prone to ſlide back into a Savage State when left without Inſtruction, and the Precepts of Religion are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Children now, as they were formerly to our Fathers.</p>
            <p>[Before I proceed further with our <hi>Planter</hi>'s Remarks, I ſhall beg Leave to lay before the Publick, a brief Account of the Origin of that Eſtabliſhment the Church at preſent enjoys, extracted from authentic Papers.</p>
            <p>The Charter of the Province recites Two Reaſons which induced the then Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> to aſk, and the Crown to grant it: The Firſt was for the Propagation of the Chriſtian Religion in a Country partly occupied by Savages, who had no Knowledge of the divine Being; and the Second was for the extending of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt declared Intent of the Crown in the Charter, the Propagation of the Chriſtian Faith, it happened that for above Sixty Years after the Grant, no Attempt was made for eſtabliſhing a Proteſtant Church or Clergy in this Province, but, the Government of <hi>Maryland</hi> devolving at the Revolution into the Hands of his late Majeſty King <hi>William,</hi> then it was that under Governors appointed by his Majeſty, ſome Acts of Aſſembly were propoſed, and indeed paſſed here, for ſettling the religious Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England</hi> amongſt his Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects in this Colony.</p>
            <p>But as the Province abounded with Papiſts, Quakers, and other Diſſenters, who had then a great Influence in our Aſſemblies, none of thoſe Acts which they prepared and paſſed among themſelves were made effectual, but they were all from Time to Time repealed in <hi>England,</hi> on Account of ſeveral Defects therein.</p>
            <p>The Acts prepared and paſſed in <hi>Maryland</hi> for eſtabliſhing Religion, juſt now mentioned, were repealed and declared void by Order of his Majeſty's Council of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>January</hi> 1695, and the 30th <hi>November</hi> 1699.</p>
            <p>The next Act for the Eſtabliſhment of Religion which was prepared in <hi>Maryland,</hi> was paſſed the 26th of <hi>April</hi> 1700, and that being tranſmitted to the Lords Commiſſioners for Trade and Plantations, their Lordſhips, with the Aſſiſtance of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and alſo of the principal Officers of the Crown named in their Commiſſion, took that Act into Conſideration, and judged it liable to many material Objections, and accordingly repreſented the ſame to his late Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> in Council.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty had ſo much at Heart the Eſtabliſhment of religious Worſhip here according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Maintenance of Miniſters, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011830_0004_0F8D4E61E4631428"/>
by Order in Council of the 13th of <hi>February,</hi> 1701, he declared his Diſlike of that Act, and directed the Lords Commiſſioners for Trade and Plantations to prepare a new Draught of an Act for that Purpoſe, with ſuch Alterations from the former Act as were proper to thoſe Ends, and agreeable to the Toleration allowed in <hi>England</hi> to Proteſtant Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>The Lords Commiſſioners of Trade and Plantations having prepared a Draught of an Act accordingly, and laid it before his Majeſty in Council, ſome of the People called Quakers, in Behalf of their Brethren in <hi>Maryland,</hi> petitioned his Majeſty in Council againſt that Draught, on the 22d of <hi>May,</hi> 1701, as appears by Order of Council of that Date. His Majeſty was pleaſed to hear them and their Counſel againſt it, as well as to hear the Reaſons offered for it; and after due Conſideration of the whole, by Order of Council of the 5th of <hi>June,</hi> 1701, directed that Draught to be ſent to the Governor and Council in <hi>Maryland,</hi> to be by them propoſed to the Aſſembly here at their next Meeting, in order to be paſſed into a Law. That Draught was ſent, was propoſed, and was paſſed into an Act here accordingly, upon the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> 1702, and was tranſmitted from hence, and again referred to the Examination of the Lords Commiſſioners of Trade and Plantations, and by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for the royal Sanction and Approbation, on the 18th of <hi>January,</hi> 1702. And, by Order of Council of the ſame Day, reciting that the Governor, Council, and Aſſembly of <hi>Maryland</hi> had Authority to ordain Laws, which were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and be in Force until the royal Pleaſure ſhould be ſignified to the contrary, that Act, ſo ſolemnly deviſed, prepared and conſidered in <hi>England,</hi> and paſſed in <hi>Maryland,</hi> was approved, confirmed, finally ratified and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Innovation that I find to have been made in this Eſtabliſhment was, by an Act paſſed in 1715, C. 24. now in Force, whereby Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> is to be deducted and paid by the Clergy to the Sheriff for his Collection, although the forementioned Act had enacted, that the Sheriff ſhould collect the Forty <hi>per</hi> Poll in the ſame Manner he did the Publick and County Levies, which County Levies were paid for by the County, and given to the ſeveral Officers, without deducting any Thing for Collection.—To this the Clergy ſubmitted, being from their ſmall Income then and low Circumſtances unable at a great Expence to ſeek Relief at Home.</p>
            <p>The next Attempt was of a more important Nature, and tended more effectually to reduce the Maintenance provided and eſtabliſhed by the royal Authority for the Clergy of this Province. An Act was paſſed in 1728, C. 2. entitled, <q>
                  <hi>An Act for the amending the Staple of Tobacco,</hi>" which enacted, That, for the Eaſe of the People, and for the diſcharging all parochial and other Charges payable in Tobacco, and aſſeſſed and levied on the People, all Perſons may pay the whole or any Part thereof at Ten Shillings Currency <hi>per Cent.</hi> at or before the 10th of April Yearly, or 3-4th Parts thereof in Tobacco in Specie, in full Diſcharge and Satisfaction of the whole, at the Choice of the Debtor; and that the Sheriffs ſhall have until the laſt of <hi>June</hi> Yearly to return and make up the Accounts of the publick Allowances and other Tobacco Demands; and that all Perſons paying Money in Diſcharge of Tobacco or 3-4ths in Tobacco, ſhall be as good as a Tender of the whole.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt this Act the Reverend Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> with Six Clergymen, put in a Petition into the Upper Houſe of Aſſembly, in Behalf of themſelves and abſent Brethren, which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011830_0005_0F8D4E62A7951650"/>
was unſucceſsful. Upon the Act paſſing in <hi>Maryland</hi> on the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> 1728, Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> went over to <hi>England</hi> to petition the Crown againſt it; and on the 17th of <hi>December,</hi> 1729, being the Day appointed for the Hearing by the Committee of the Lords of his Majeſty's moſt honourable Privy Council, to whom his Majeſty had referred it to conſider and report what was fit for his Majeſty to do therein, on that Day the late Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> ſent for Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> and aſſured him if he would withdraw his Petition from before the Council, he would diſſent to the Act; and promiſed <hi>upon his Honour</hi> that he would give poſitive Inſtructions to his Governors never to preſume to paſs an Act of that Nature for the future.—However the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſpection Laws in 1747, 1753, and 1763, ſtripped the Clergy in the ſame Manner of One Fourth of their original Stipends; and the Bill now depending, which has paſſed the Lower Houſe of Aſſembly, and waits the Concurrence of the Council and Governor, gives an Option to the People to pay off the Clergy 30 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll, inſtead of 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> 
               <hi>per</hi> Poll, if paid in Specie by the 10th Day of <hi>June</hi> Yearly, or 30 <abbr>lb</abbr> 
               <hi>per</hi> Poll at the Rate of 12 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> 6 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> Currency <hi>per</hi> Hundred in Money, if not paid in Tobacco by that Time, and ſubjects the Clergy to the very ſame Inconveniences the Act of 1728 would have laid them under, had it not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to at that Time. If Tobacco be a Drug, the Planter will pay off in Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; if it be worth more than 12 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> 6 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> he will pay off in Money, becauſe he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed until the 10th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> for his Money Payment; and then he pays but for 30 <abbr>lb</abbr> inſtead of 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Tobacco allowed by the old Act, ſo that the Planter not only gains One Fourth in the Quantity, but may, if Tobacco bears the Price it has done for Three Years paſt, be a Gainer of 100 or 150 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the Price, rating his Payment at 12 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> 6 <hi>
                  <abbr>d.</abbr> per</hi> Hundred.</p>
            <p>The Aſſeſſment of the 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> 
               <hi>per</hi> Poll for the Clergy was deſigned in Lieu and in Nature of Tythes, and was formerly paid as ſuch in Kind; by which the Clergy had the ſame Chance and Benefit as other Perſons, either as to the Riſe or Fall of the Commodity, as they have in their Tythes in Kind in <hi>England.</hi> Now by this Act all that Advantage is taken from them, let it riſe or fall they muſt ſtill be Sufferers, they will loſe in any Caſe, and have no Poſſibility of gaining.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears how far theſe ſeveral Acts have tended virtually and in Subſtance to repeal the Act ſo ſolemnly enacted and ratified by the royal Authority, and how greatly the Maintenance thereby provided and eſtabliſhed for the Clergy has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and diminiſhed. And this Conſideration may have Weight to make the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly cautious how they act with reſpect to the Clergy, who, upon this Principle, can never fail of Redreſs, when they are driven to the Neceſſity of applying Home.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now return to our <hi>Church of England Planter,</hi> who, though he writes to the Vulgar, and writes like one of the Vulgar, may ſerve to ſhow the Clergy what they are to expect, if they once loſe Sight of their fundamental Law.</p>
            <p>If indeed, Sir, your Allegations be true, <q>That thoſe Gentlemen <hi>(the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy)</hi> have vaunted over Government, Veſtry, and Laity, bidding Defiance to the whole, as, <hi>you urge,</hi> it is notoriouſly known they have done ever ſince the Year <hi>1702,</hi> until the Firſt Inſpecting Law on Tobacco paſſed which you date in <hi>1751:</hi>
               </q> If this be true, that the Clergy, inſtead of recommending Obedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011830_0006_0F8D4E632971FC40"/>
have <hi>bid Defiance to the whole;</hi> inſtead of cultivating the Good-Will and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their Veſtry and Pariſhioners, have notoriouſly inſulted and abuſed them, and have become <hi>Ramping Lions,</hi> as you elegantly expreſs it in another Place, inſtead of <hi>Meek Lambs,</hi> I wonder they had not been chained down in their Dens long ſince, and that the Aſſembly, <q>
                  <hi>in whoſe Power</hi> (you ſay) it was to have corrected theſe Enormities, ſhould have let them paſs unnoticed from the Year 1702, <hi>until</hi> the Firſt Inſpecting Law on Tobacco;</q> but as we hear no more of them ſince, and your Complaints of theſe Violences terminate <hi>then,</hi> it is hoped that Law worked a thorough Cure, and the Wiſdom of the Legiſlature could not be too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, that under One Act reformed the Clergy and the Tobacco.</p>
            <p>You wonder <q>why the Clergy had a larger Encouragement here, than in our neighbouring Provinces;</q> you may as well wonder why they had any Encourage at all, ſince in many of our neighbouring Provinces they have none; which are thereby deprived of the ineſtimable Benefit of religious Union, and for Want of a national Church, are by the Equality of all Sectaries, torn and convulſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Struggles between them for Superiority and Pre-eminence, whilſt their Miniſters feel all the Miſeries of a precarious Dependance often on involuntary Contributions, and are expoſed to Contempt, the never failing Attendant on Poverty.</p>
            <p>You reſt your whole Plan of Reform, upon a Preſumption that the Act of 1701-2, <hi>for the Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Church, and the Maintenance of Miniſters in this Province, is not in Force:</hi> Now, if it appear that this Act is in full Force, and has all the Marks of legal Authority a Law can have, the pretty Structure you have been erecting, falls (like the baſeleſs Fabric of a Viſion) to the Ground in an Inſtant.</p>
            <p>It appears then that after paſſing the General Aſſembly, it was aſſented to by a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor acting under a Royal Commiſſion, that was ratified by Queen <hi>Anne</hi> in Council, <hi>Jan.</hi> 18, 1702, that it was excepted, with only one Act more, out of the general Repeal in 1704, that it was made the Baſis of many ſubſequent Acts, and that it has been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Legiſlature here, and admitted by the People for nearly 70 Years. You urge, <q>that this Act of Aſſembly was <hi>INTENDED</hi> to be made in our Sovereign King <hi>William</hi>'s Time, but the King was dead at that Time, altho' not known here, as he died on the <hi>8th</hi> Day of <hi>March 1701-2,</hi> and the Seſſion began on the <hi>16th</hi> of the ſame Month, ſo that he could not give his Aſſent to it, by which Means it became void.</q> That a dead King could not give his Aſſent to an Act, is a Diſcovery for which you ſhall have Credit; but tho' he could not, his Governor acting under <hi>his Commiſſion</hi> could; and the dead King could no more <hi>diſſent</hi> than <hi>aſſent.</hi> In Judgment of Law, the King in his political Capacity <hi>dieth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he is not dead in Law at leaſt, until publick Proclamation of his Succeſſor in thoſe Dominions wher in his Deputies reſide.—All his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors muſt neceſſarily continue in Commiſſion until formaly ſuperſeded by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and if the Aſſent of his Governor to a Law in his Majeſty's Name, before the Knowledge of his De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And this continuing Power upon the Demiſe of a King is ſo eſſential to good Government;

that it is extended by Act of Aſſembly to the Officers of the Lord Proprietary.<note n="*" place="bottom">1751 Chap. 27.</note>— You ſay, he (the King) <hi>could not give his Aſſent to it, by which the Act became void;</hi> I never heard that the Aſſent of the King or the Lord Proprietary himſelf, not perſonally preſent, was neceſſary to the Validity of a Law here; the Power of Diſſent indeed lies at home, but the Aſſent of the Governor, as the King's or Proprietor's Repreſentative, and one Branch of the Legiſlature, gives an Act full and competent Authority, until the Diſſent arrives. By an Act, 1638, C. 1, for eſtabliſhing the Houſe of Aſſembly, <hi>all Acts aſſented to and approved by the ſaid Houſe, or major Part thereof, and afterwards aſſented to by the Lieutenant-Governor, in the Name of the Lord Proprietary, are adjudged and eſtabliſhed for Laws</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See alſo 1650, C. 2.</note>. And by the Order of Council before recited, of the 18th of <hi>January</hi> 1702, it was declared, <q>that the Governor, Council, and Aſſembly of <hi>Maryland,</hi> had Authority to ordain Laws, which were to continue and be in Force, until the Royal Pleaſure ſhould be ſignified to the contrary.</q>—If there be any Doubts concerning the Legality of the original Law of 1701-2, the Exception out of the general Repeal in 1704 would ſerve to remove them; if the Authority of the Law and of the Exception could be objected to, the ſeveral Acts dependant upon it, by which it is interwove into, and become Part of, the Conſtitution, would in Return prop, ſupport and confirm it.—I will take them in order, and quote the References acknowledging the Validity of the Act of 1701-2.</p>
            <p>By an Act paſſed in 1704, C. 34, § 5, the Veſtrymen are directed, where there is no Miniſter reſident in the Pariſh, to keep a fair Account of the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll, levied in their Pariſh, according to an Act, entitled, <hi>An Act for the Eſtabliſhment of religious Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo of the 10 <hi>per</hi> Poll <hi>to be raiſed and levied in Virtue of that Act,</hi> and tranſmit it to the Governor and Council.—By an Act in 1715, C. 24, the Defects of the Act of 1701-2 are remedied, and the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll during a Vacancy, not before provided for, was therein directed to be laid out by the Veſtry, in repairing or building Churches, or in purchaſing or ſtocking a Glebe: By the laſt Section of this Act, the Sheriff, who had no Allowance for his Trouble under the original Act, was allowed to deduct 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> for collecting the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll, and paying the ſame either to the Incumbent or Veſtry.</p>
            <p>An Act in 1715, C. 30, repeals a Clauſe in an Act of Aſſembly, entitled, <hi>An Act for eſtabliſhing religious Worſhip in this Province,</hi> &amp;c. requiring that all Veſtrymen ſhould ſubſcribe the Aſſociation, and directs that they ſhall take the Oaths of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration. An Act in 1716, C. 5, directs, that nothing therein contained, ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to extend, to alter any Directions given by the Act for the <hi>Eſtabliſhment of religious Worſhip within this Province,</hi> as to the Manner of adminiſtering the Oaths required. In 1730, C. 23, an Act paſſed, entitled, A SUPPLEMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARY Act, to an Act, entitled, <hi>An Act for the Eſtabliſhment of religious Worſhip in this Province, according to the Church of</hi> England, &amp;c. wherein the Defects of that Act were remedied. By an Act in 1733, it was enacted, that the Bills of Credit, then emitted, ſhould paſs in Payment within this Province for Current Money, and all and any of the Inhabitants were enabled to diſcharge all Lawyers Fees and Levies

therewith <hi>(the</hi> 40 per <hi>Poll and all Tobacco directed by an Act of Aſſembly of this Province to be levied and applied to the building or repairing any Church or Churches excepted.)</hi> An Act in 1747<note n="*" place="bottom">The Three principal Inſpecting Acts.</note>, C. 1, recites, that in Regard it is the general Expectation, that by Means of this Act, Tobacco will be <hi>meliorated,</hi> the Quantity undoubtedly leſſened, and the Mode of Payment much facilitated, and thereby the Stipends of the Clergy made <hi>more valuable</hi> than at preſent, and that it is deemed but highly reaſonable, that in Regard this Province will be at an Expence in carrying this Act into Execution, in which the Clergy ought to bear a Part; be it enacted, that during the Continuance of this Act, the County Courts ſhall levy on the taxable Inhabitants of the reſpective Pariſhes, or Part of Pariſhes, within their Counties, no more than Thirty Pounds of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll, inſtead of 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll by a <hi>former</hi> Act directed, <hi>notwithſtanding any thing in the ſaid former Act contained.</hi> The Acts of 1753<note n="*" place="bottom">The Three principal Inſpecting Acts.</note>, and 1763<note n="*" place="bottom">The Three principal Inſpecting Acts.</note> C. 18, § 23, make the ſame Reference in the ſame Words to the <hi>former</hi> Act, and the latter Act continued in Force until the Day of <hi>October</hi> 1770.</p>
            <p>To theſe Acts I may add one in 1715, and another in 1749, empowering the Miniſters, Veſtry and Churchwardens, to ſummon and admoniſh Fornicators and Adulterers; as well as ſeveral other Acts reſpecting Parochial Libraries, reſpecting Glebes, reſpecting the various Offices of Churchwardens and Veſtrymen, who owe their very Exiſtence to the Act of 1701-2 alone, all which confirm and eſtabliſh the Validity of that Law.—If ſo uniform, ſo uninterrupted an Acknowledgment of the Legiſlature, thro' ſuch a Series of Years, if their Faith ſo ſolemnly and ſo repeatedly pledged to the Clergy in ſuch a Variety of Acts, will not weigh againſt the Objection ariſing from King <hi>William</hi>'s Demiſe, there is a Salvo for that too— nothing more nor leſs than a plain, poſitive declaratory Act of Parliament, which will put the Validity of the Law of 1701-2 beyond the Poſſibility of a Doubt, and render it of general Acceptation.</p>
            <p>By the Statute made in the 7th Year of King <hi>William</hi> the 3d, C. 27, entitled, An Act for the better Security of his Majeſty's Royal Perſon and Government, it was enacted in § 21, <q>that no <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> either Civil or Military, ſhall ceaſe, determine or be void, by Reaſon of the Death or Demiſe of his <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> or of any of his Heirs or Succeſſors, Kings or Queens of this Realm, but that every ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhall be, continue and remain in full Force and Virtue, for the Space of Six Months after ſuch Death or Demiſe, unleſs in the mean Time ſuperſeded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

the Proviſions, Clauſes, Matters, and Things whatſoever, contained in this Act, and of <hi>that Part</hi> of the Act made in the 7th Year of the late King, <hi>which is recited</hi> in this preſent Act, ſhall extend, and be conſtrued to extend to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Iſlands of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> and to all his MAJESTY'S DOMINIONS in AMERICA and ELSEWHERE: And the laſt Clauſe enacts, that this preſent Act, and all other Acts to which the Royal Aſſent ſhall be given after the 8th Day of <hi>March</hi> 1701, and before the End of this preſent Seſſion of Parliament, ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and begin, and be taken, conſtrued, and adjudged in Law to commence and begin upon the ſaid 8th Day of <hi>March</hi> 1701, unleſs in ſuch Acts, ſome other Time for Commencement thereof be ſpecially limited and appointed <note n="*" place="bottom">This Act of Parliament ſeems, as well by its Date as by its retroſpective Power, to have the Act of Aſſembly of 1701-2 particularly in View.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Act of Parliament firſt explains the Word <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> to include any Patent or Grant, Civil or Military; next extends all the Powers contained under the former Act to all her Majeſty's Dominions in <hi>America</hi> and elſewhere; and laſtly, has a retroſpective View with reſpect to Time, and to prevent a Moment's Lapſe or Interregnum, commences on the 8th of <hi>March,</hi> the Day of the King's Death, which muſt certainly cover the whole Time of the Seſſion here, from the 16th to the 25th of that Month. And here the Ignorance of our <hi>Planter</hi> appears notorious, he picked up his little Knowledge from <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Laws, and preſumed, becauſe the King was dead, the Commiſſion of the Governor ceaſed and determined, and from hence formed this curious Concluſion, that upon <hi>dropping of the Inſpecting Law, the Clergy will be left deſtitute of any Act in their Favour:</hi> An Opinion in which I think now he ſtands alone. I wiſh as much as he, that the Clergy may be precluded the Occaſion of their returning to their old Claim of 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll, but by endeavouring to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Act itſelf, he not only intereſts the Biſhops' Influence with the Proprietor in their Favour, (of which, he ſays, he is apprehenſive) but perhaps the Crown itſelf, which cannot tamely ſee an Act paſſed, and ſo ſolemnly confirmed by the Royal Authority, ſo wantonly trampled under Foot, or permit the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo long and ſo well eſtabliſhed in this Province, to be ſtript of its whole Support by a pitiful Cavil; but I dare ſay that the Wiſdom and Policy of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature here, will make ſuch an Application needleſs, and that they will equally deſpiſe his Plans and Apprehenſions: The Clergy, if they are wiſe, will be very cautious how they apply Home for Redreſs, and the Aſſembly will be too juſt, as well as too politic, to drive them to that Extremity.</p>
            <p>The Clergy are intitled under the Act of 1701-2, to the full Compliment of 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll; the Sheriff is therein obliged to collect it in the ſame Manner, and by the ſame Authority as the Publick and County Levies<note n="‡" place="bottom">Which are under Execution. <hi>Vide</hi> LL, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. fol. 245 &amp; 1724, C. 21. Sect. 2.</note> are collected, and to pay it to the Incumbent of each Pariſh. It was not until the Year 1715 that an Act paſſed, allowing the Sheriff to deduct 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for his Trouble. On making the Firſt Inſpection-Law in 1747, (not as you ſay in 1751, for you are as bad at Chronology as Legiſlation) it was thought proper as the Value of the Staple would increaſe by the Regulation, that there ſhould be a Fifth deducted in all Tobacco Payments; the Clergy were included under this Act; One Fifth deducted would reduce the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll to 32 <abbr>lb</abbr>; 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> was alſo allowed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency

               </abbr>6 <hi>per</hi> Hundred.</p>
            <p>The Tobacco and Money Payments, we may preſume, were at that Time (<hi>Anno</hi> 1753) juſtly proportioned, and 12<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ</hi>
               </abbr>6 looked on nearly as an average Price for One Hundred Pounds of publick Tobacco: The Benefit of the Inſpection-Law to the Province is hence notorious, that 12<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ</hi>
               </abbr>6 is become ſcarcely Two Thirds, and of late not One Half of the Worth of that Quantity of Tobacco: but if the Tobacco be increaſed in Value, the Planter has no Reaſon to complain <hi>in Fact,</hi> becauſe he only pays his old Proportion of 30 <hi>per</hi> Poll; it would be uncharitable to ſuppoſe, that he grudges the Miniſter thoſe Returns he receives himſelf in ſo much greater Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Complaint lies only on the Compariſon. The Farmer, whoſe Lands, now cleared and fitted for Cultivation, produce vaſt Crops of Grain, for which he finds an immediate and liberal Market, compounds at the Rate of 12<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ</hi>
               </abbr>6; and here the Compariſon ſtrikes. There can be no good Reaſon given, why in publick Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one Man ſhould pay double or treble the Proportion of another, for the ſame Services; and if there appears a Neceſſity for eaſing the Planter, there may be Room to lay a little Addition on the Farmer, the Merchant, and the Gentleman, ſo that the Loſs may not be ſo ſeverely felt by the publick Officer, the Lawyer, or the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>I calculate that One Half of the Pariſhes of <hi>Maryland</hi> do not conſiſt of above 1200 Taxables; ſeveral of them fall ſhort of that Number. You think <q>
                  <hi>10 per</hi> Poll would be ſufficient to maintain a much greater Number of the Clergy than we have now, in a very genteel Way.</q> I ſuppoſe you would chooſe to aſſeſs the 10 <hi>per</hi> Poll at 12<abbr>

               </abbr>6 <hi>per</hi> Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; the Salary then on 1200 Taxables would amount to £ 75. Currency, that is £ 45.

We muſt allow you are an excellent Judge what will maintain a Clergyman and his Family in a genteel Manner! You refer us for Example to the PROVINCES of <hi>Virginia,</hi> (old and new <hi>Virginia</hi> I preſume) in the Firſt the Salary of the Clergy, ſo far from being left to the Diſcretion of a Veſtry, is fixed by Law to 16 Hogſheads of Crop Tobacco, with an Allowance of 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Shrinkage, and a good Houſe, Barn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with a Glebe of at leaſt 200 Acres of Land, are directed to be provided for the Miniſter of each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at the publick Expence.</p>
            <p>The Clergy of <hi>Virginia,</hi> who were before allured into this Province, and filled the Pariſhes here, when thoſe in <hi>Virginia</hi> were left deſtitute, will now be no longer deſirous of changing their Situation, ſince, at the Rate of 12<abbr>

               </abbr>6 <hi>per</hi> Hundred, One Half of the Pariſhes of <hi>Maryland</hi> will fall ſhort of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Stipend, conſidered together with the Conveniency of their Glebes.

               <hi>"I would further recommend that there ſhould be a Clauſe in that Act to impower the Veſtry of each Pariſh to call before them, by Way of Summons, the Clergyman of their Pariſh, for Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Duty, or any Miſconduct, when of their own Knowledge, or on the Complaint of any Two or Three reputable Pariſhioners, that they ſhall fix a Day and ſend their Summons to their Clergyman, and that they ſhall alſo ſet up an Advertiſement at the Church Door at leaſt Ten Days before the Time of meeting, ſignifying that their Clergyman is to appear on ſuch a Day before the Veſtry—and if any of his Pariſhioners have any Complaint to make againſt him, they may attend on that Day, and then if they of</hi> THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE, <hi>or upon the Oath of Two or more creditable Witneſſes, have Reaſon to condemn him for Neglect of Duty or Miſconduct, that they ſhall reprimand him for the firſt and ſecond Time, and for the third diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him."</hi>—A very ſummary Way of Proceeding, indeed!

Your Veſtry is at once Judge, Jury and Evidence; they may proceed to Sentence <hi>of their own Knowledge,</hi> without Proceſs, without Form, without Precedent, without Law, common, civil or eccleſiaſtical; and, to crown the whole, without Appeal too. Hatred or Intereſt may produce an Accuſation, Suſpicion be received as Proof, and Paſſion pronounce Judgment.</p>
            <p>Do you exclaim againſt the Admiralty Courts, which proceed by the known Rules of the Civil Law? Do you ſhudder at the Introduction of an Eccleſiaſtical Court? and yet adopt a Plan a Thouſand Times more tyrannical! View but the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon!</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Revenues of the Clergy, wherever they have become any ways conſiderable, have always been the Subject of popular Converſation, and often been made a Topic fit for the Purpoſe of factious and deſigning Men to raiſe publick Diſcontent. But violent Changes have ſeldom proved for the better, and Innovations in religious Matters have ever been of dangerous Conſequence to a State—as we read in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, Four different Changes in Religion took Place during the Courſe of a few Years, by the Authority of the Sovereign alone.—If the Act of 1701-2 be not in Force, we have no eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England</hi>—for no Church is deemed a ſettled and eſtabliſhed Church, unleſs a certain Income or Revenue is provided for its Miniſters. There is no Reſtraint on Marriages, either in reſpect of the Perſon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing, or thoſe joined in Marriage; there is no Veſtryman or Churchwarden; nay, no Edifice properly called a Church; the Building itſelf may be turned into a Barn by the Propietor of the Soil.—And further—the Act of Toleration, extended to Proteſtant Diſſenters and Quakers here by that Act, ceaſes, and they are liable to all the Pains and Penalties of former Statutes.</p>
            <p>If the Act of 1701-2 were a real Grievance to the People; if the Tax of 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll were too heavy for their Circumſtances to bear; if they were really oppreſſed and rode by the Clergy, there is not a Man in the Province that would be more ready with Heart and Hand to give a Lift to overturn the Act than myſelf: But this is far from being the Caſe.—</p>
            <p>The 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll is reckoned not a 20th Part of the Increaſe of that One Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and if the Inſpection-Law had been continued, which would have been much to the Clergy's Content, the 30 <hi>per</hi> Poll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therein aſſeſſed was One Fourth leſs, and the Compoſition at 12<abbr>

                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> may be computed, for the Reaſons before aſſigned, ſcarcely One Hundredth Part of the Farmer's Increaſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Farmer pays One Tenth Part of the Produce of his Lands, which, his Labour incluſive, is nearly One Fifth of the Returns, either to the Church or the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriator who claims under the ſame Title: yet he has no Reaſon to complain. If he received the Land by Deſcent from his Anceſtors, it was with this Reſervation; if he purchaſes it with his Money, or rents it of another, a proportionable Deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made. What is not a Man's by Inheritance, or Purchaſe, or Contract, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be his own. The Tithes in <hi>England</hi> and the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll in <hi>Maryland</hi> ſtand upon the ſame Principle, to wit, the Law of the Land; and Law is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Property: Remove the Land-mark and the Field lies in common—and I ſpeak of Property as inviolable, at leaſt until the Time comes, when <hi>inter Arma ſilent Leges.</hi> If then the Freeholder in <hi>England</hi> has no juſt Cauſe of Complaint, how much leſs has the Inhabitant of <hi>Maryland,</hi> who contributes ſo much leſs to the Maintenance and Support of an eſtabliſhed Clergy, which certainly tends to the Peace and civilizing of any Country, and conduces as well to the temporal as to the eternal Welfare of a People.</p>
            <p>The Right of Patronage is one of the richeſt Plumes in the Proprietor's Cap—but as this falls to the Ground entirely with the Act of 1701-2 (for what is a Right of Patronage worth without an Endowment?) ſo the ſplitting of Pariſhes into ſmall Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011830_0014_0F8D4E6E8BEE36E8"/>
is a great Diminution of the Value of that Right; it deprives him of the Power of rewarding Merit, and cuts off, in great Meaſure, the generous Emulation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling among the Clergy; the Hopes of Rewards being the human Means for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Virtue, and recommending Learning amongſt Mankind. This minute Diviſion is not only incompatible with the infant State of any Country, where the Inhabitants lie thinly ſcattered over a vaſt Tract of Land, unleſs <hi>an additional Burden be laid on each Individual to maintain ſo numerous a Clergy,</hi> but is highly impolitic in the back Parts of this Province, where Three Fourths of the Inhabitants are Foreigners, invincibly attached to their own Religion, Language and Manners, amongſt whom no Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can hope for any more Reſpect than his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity entitles him to or his Income commands.</p>
            <p>The Clergy are at preſent divided in their political Character—thoſe poſſeſſed of good Livings and ſecured by the Laws of the Province, unſolicitous of further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, have a natural Deſire to promote the Happineſs and ſecure the Liberties of the People by whom they are maintained, and thus become Friends of the Publick. The expectant Clergy, who are in waiting for Preferment, which flows from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will naturally fall in with, at leaſt not openly oppoſe, the Views and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe Perſons from whom they are to receive Promotion.—Power always follows Property—a Balance of Power can only be preſerved by a Balance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty—but this Balance had like to have been deſtroyed by a Bill in the Year 1768, eſtabliſhing a Commiſſion Court for Eccleſiaſtical Matters—which would have united and blended together the Property and Influence of the whole Body of the Clergy with that of the Government; for he that can puniſh, will command and muſt be obeyed too. It will always be an Object worthy the Policy and Wiſdom of the Lower Houſe of Aſſembly, to keep the Puniſhment of the Clergy out of the Hands of the Government, leſt by inculcating into the Minds of their Hearers that paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which they are ſubjected, the Contagion ſpread to the Laity too; and the Government, if they are wiſe, will keep the Puniſhment as well as Promotion of the Clergy out of the Hands of the People, leſt they prove, as they do in <hi>Virginia,</hi> a dead Weight againſt Government; and thus balanced will they become an excellent Barrier, either when the Government would break through that ſacred Compact which makes the Intereſts of the governing and the governed reciprocal, or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would throw off all Obedience to Government, by which they are protected in their Perſons and Properties.</p>
            <p>I ſhould never have thought the <hi>Church of England Planter</hi> worth anſwering, had I not found that the Idea of the Invalidity of the Law of 1701-2 had been mentioned in a reſpectable Meeting, and had become popular under the Sanction (by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I know not) of one of the moſt conſiderable Men in the Province. There cannot therefore be the leaſt Doubt but that the Church is in Danger.—To neglect to provide for Self-defence at any Time is to ſleep in a Siege—but to neglect it now is to ſleep on an Attack.—The Conſcience as well as the Intereſt of the Clergy is concerned in this Debate; the Preſervation of the pureſt Church on Earth is intruſted to their Care, and they never will be able to anſwer it either here or hereafter, if they neglect ſo ſacred a Depoſit.—That the Notion of the Invalidity of the Act of 1701-2 is a mere Fiction, calculated to raiſe an Alarm, there is not the leaſt Doubt:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011830_0015_0F8D4E6F44170710"/>
But the Clergy, if they are not dead to every Senſe of their Duty as well as their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, will, upon the firſt Attack upon any Individual, join their Purſe, Heart and Hand, to defend his and their own Rights againſt all Oppoſition. The Church of <hi>England</hi> has at preſent the Right, and will be ſupported, doubtleſs, by the Power both of the Proprietor and the King, if ſuch Interpoſition be neceſſary. The Church tolerates all other Perſuaſions, but ſhould the Sectaries obtain the Poſſeſſion of the Loaves and Fiſhes, it would hardly meet even with Toleration itſelf. Our <hi>Planter,</hi> ignorant and illiterate as he is, ſhews the Deſign in Agitation.—<hi>Our Colleges in</hi> North-America <hi>have not been uſeleſs to us, and that we can get Readers from them, and marry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by the</hi> OTHER <hi>Clergy.</hi> And again he recommends—<hi>not to let them at Home force their Clergy on us, as they have done their Revenue Officers.</hi> Ignorant that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly <hi>to encourage faithful and able Miniſters to</hi> COME <hi>and</hi> RESIDE <hi>in this Province,</hi> that the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll was given—and now they are come, have left their Country, Friends and Connexions at Home, under the Security of Laws, under the Faith of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature, under the moſt ſolemn Engagements of Protection and Support, they are to be deprived of their Freeholds without legal Proceſs, plundered of their Property by Chicane and Violence, and turned out with their Families and their Religion to ſhift for themſelves, and to ſeek for Refuge in ſome other <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> Country.</p>
            <p>Heu Pietas! Heu priſca Fides!</p>
            <p>May the Divine Being, who is the GOD of Order and not of Confuſion, inſpire the Government with Inclination to ſupport the Eſtabliſhment of our Holy Church, the Clergy with Reſolution to defend its Rights, and the People with Submiſſion to its Divine Ordinances, which teach to render to All their Dues—Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>AS the Partition of Pariſhes is at preſent a favourite Object of the Lower Houſe of Aſſembly, it may not be amiſs to inquire how far ſuch a Practice is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to publick Faith, to Law and o Precedent.</p>
            <p>The Charter gives <hi>Lord Baltimore "the Patronage and Advowſon of all Churches, which (with the increaſing Worſhip and Religion of</hi> CHRIST) <hi>hereafter ſhall happen to be built within the Province.</hi>"—The Act of 1701-2 <hi>appropriates "the</hi> 40 per <hi>Poll that is to be levied upon every taxable Perſon within each reſpective Pariſh within this Province, as they have been, now are, or hereafter ſhall be, laid out, limited or appointed by Laws of this Province, to the Miniſter of each reſpective Pariſh, preſented, inducted, or appointed by his Excellency the Governor, or Commander in Chief for the Time being."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The different Modes or Variations of Payment ſince, refer to the ſame original. The Queſtion is, whether his Lordſhip, or his Lieutenant Governor, having once preſented or inducted a Parſon into a Pariſh, can revoke or annul that Induction by his own Act, or with the Concurrence of any other Power within this Province.— If he can, he has more Power than the King has in <hi>England;</hi> for after Induction, a Church is full againſt the King; and the Rector of a Pariſh here is no longer a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for Life, but Tenant at Will. If he can take away Part, by little and little he may take away the whole, and give the ſame Thing Ten Times over.</p>
            <p>It has been ſeen in the foregoing Sheets, how ſolemnly the Act of 1701-2 was enacted, ratified and confirmed, by which 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll was ſettled on the eſtabliſhed Clergy, as an Encouragement for them to <hi>come</hi> and <hi>reſide</hi> in this Province. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, many Clergymen of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have come over from Time to Time, and made ſome little Settlement for themſelves and Families. The 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll may be conſidered in lieu of Tithes; both were given for the ſame Intent; both belong to Eccleſiaſtical Perſons; and both have the Law of the Land for their Support.—<q>A Parſon has, during his Life, the Freehold in himſelf of the Parſonage Houſe, the Glebe, the Tithes, and other Dues.</q> It were needleſs to quote Authorities for this Poſition, it never has been contravened. This is a Right common to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in every Miniſter of the Church, in every Country where it is eſtabliſhed by Law.—The publick Faith is pledged to a Miniſter of a Pariſh in this Province by Three ſolemn Acts; Firſt, by an Act of Aſſembly, conferring an Endowment here upon the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Secondly, by another Act, fixing and aſcertaining the Bounds and Limits of each particular Pariſh; and Thirdly, by an Act of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor's, by Virtue of his Charter-Powers, conſtituting and appointing the Rector of a Pariſh, <hi>to have, hold and enjoy his Church, with all the Profits and Advantages whatſoever, appertaining to a Miniſter of that Pariſh, and requiring the Churchwardens, Veſtrymen and Pariſhioners of the Pariſh, to receive, acknowledge and aſſiſt him, in all Matters relating to the Diſcharge of his Function.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act is abſolute, unconditional, final and irrevocable; all which Properties are neceſſary to make it legal. If it were conditional it would be Simoniacal, and if
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011830_0017_0F8D4E72770DA4A8"/>
revocable it would be void in Law. Even Bonds of Reſignation, which the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Times has introduced into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, are held by ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men to be null in Law, becauſe they put a Power of Deprivation in the Patron's Hands, which belongs only to a Court of Judicature. A Diviſion is a partial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, a Deprivation a Puniſhment, a Puniſhment implies a Crime, and a Crime requires Proof, Proceſs and Judgment—but here, by a ſimple Vote, a Clergyman incurs the higheſt Puniſhment he can merit in his official Character, without a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and may be deprived of half his Salary, of half his Glebe, of half his Houſe, of half his Dues (they ſhould in Pity take half his Children too) without a Crime.</p>
            <p>The Charter of this Province requires, "<hi>That the Laws of this Province be conſonant to Reaſon, and be not repugnant and contrary, but, ſo far as may be, agreeable to the Laws, Cuſtoms and Rights of the Kingdom of</hi> England." I cannot repeat too often, and I do it with Confidence, <hi>"that a Parſon has during his Life the Freehold in himſelf of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage Houſe, the Glebe, the Salary, whether accruing from Tithes or Modus, or</hi> 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> per <hi>Poll of Tobacco, and other Dues, if not removed by voluntary Ceſſion, or legal Deprivation by due Courſe of Law."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe the Idea of the Clergy's Property ſeems to be lightly conſidered in the preſent Diſpute, I would aſk, What Reaſon can be given, why they ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clud'd the common Privileges of Mankind?</p>
            <p>
               <q>The third abſolute Right, inherent in every <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> is that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; which conſiſts in the free Uſe and Enjoyment, and Diſpoſal of all his Acquiſitions, without any Control or Diminution, ſave only by the Laws of the Land. The original of private Property is probably founded in Nature; but the Modifications under which we at preſent find it, the Method of conſerving it to the preſent Owner, and of tranſlating it from Man to Man, are entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Society; and are ſome of thoſe civil Advantages, in Exchange of which every Individual has reſigned a Part of his natural Liberty.—The Laws of <hi>England</hi> are therefore, <hi>in Point of Honour and Juſtice,</hi> extremely watchful in aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and protecting this Right. Upon this Principle the Great Charter has declared, that no Freeman ſhall be diſſeized or diveſted of his Freehold, or of his Liberties, or free Cuſtoms, but by the Judgment of his Peers or by the Law of the Land. And by a Variety of antient Statutes it is enacted, that no Man's Lands or Goods ſhall be ſeized into the King's Hands, againſt the Great Charter and the Law of the Land, and that no Man ſhall be diſinherited nor put out of his Franchiſes or Freehold, unleſs he be duly brought to anſwer, and be forejudged by Courſe of Law <note n="*" place="bottom">See Page 13.</note>: <hi>If any thing be done to the contrary, it ſhall be redreſſed, and holden for none.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So great, moreover, is the Regard of the Law for private Property, that it will not authoriſe the leaſt Violation of it; no, not even for the general Good of the Community. If a new Road, for inſtance, were to be made through the Grounds of a private Perſon, it might, perhaps, be extenſively beneficial to the Publick; but the Law permits no Man or Set of Men to do this without Conſent of the Owner of the Land. In vain may it be urged that the Good of the Individual ought to yield to that of the Community; for it would be dangerous to allow any private Man, or even publick Tribunal, to be the Judge of this common Good,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011830_0018_0F8D4E72D0CAB0D8"/>
and to decide whether it be expedient or no. Beſides, the publick Good is in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more eſſentially intereſted than in the Protection of every Individual's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rights, as modelled by the municipal Laws. In this and the like Caſes, the Legiſlature a one can, and indeed frequently does, interpoſe and compel the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual to a quieſce. But how does it interpoſe and compel? Not by abſolutely ſtripping the Subject of his Property in an arbitrary Manner; but by giving him a full Indemnification and Equivalent for the injury thereby ſuſtained. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is now conſidered as an Individual, treating with an Individual for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change: All that the Legiſlature does is to oblige the Owner to alienate his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions for a reaſonable Price; and even this is an Exertion of Power which the Legiſlature indulges with Caution, and which nothing but the Legiſlature can perform.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the Practice of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Houſe of Commons; ſo juſt, ſo temperate, ſo worthy of Imitation! So tender are they of private Property, that the moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate publick Utility will not permit them to infringe it. A Canal is to be cut for the Benefit of Trade; it intercepts and ruins the Navigation of a River, made before at great Expence; many private Perſons had embarked their Property in clearing the River, and a Bill was rejected in the Houſe of Commons for cutting a Canal, until the Petitioner had ſatisfied all the Adventurers in the Navigation of the River. A publick Good is propoſed; private Advantage ought to ſubmit: True; publick Good implies more Good than Harm; but it would be more Harm than Good to the Publick to deſtroy the Idea of Property, and forcibly to take away a Man's Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions without due Satisfaction, either to make a Road or cut a Canal; the Precedent would lead to Anarchy, Confuſion and Ruin—Nor is the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Legiſlature leſs tender of the Property of the Church: The Great Charter begins with granting all its Rights and Liberties to the Church; the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Legiſlature protects the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Church inviolable. A Bill was agitated ſome Time ago, to defalcate Part of the rich Dignities, and to apply it to the Augmentation of ſmall Benefices. It was rejected upon this Principle, that the Revenues were private Property, which ought to be held ſacred and inviolate; and if they admitted a Precedent of that Nature, there would be no End to Applications, until the Crown was ſtripped of every Piece of Preferment worth beſtowing.—To render a Diviſion of a Pariſh practicable in <hi>England,</hi> the Conſent of the Ordinary, Patron and Incumbent, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The Ordinary is a Party, as ſuperintending the Affairs of the whole Church; the Patron is a Party, having the Advowſon thereof, which is a temporal Right; and the Incumbent is a Party, as perſonating that particular Church, and having it not only for his own Uſe, but in Truſt for that of his Succeſſors. There is not One Inſtance in all the Parliamentary Proceedings of a forcible Diviſion of a Pariſh, to take Place during a Plenarty, without the Conſent of the Incumbent.— Deprivation indeed is the Conſequence of an Attainder by Act of Parliament; but a Deprivation without a Crime is an Idea too arbitrary ever to be brought into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. A Man is ſet apart for the Miniſtry; his Youth is ſpent in Study; he is cut off by Law from the Exerciſe of any Trade or handicraft Buſineſs, even from turning Agriculture into a Profit: He obtains a Living; where he ſits down, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

incapacitate, he diſcharges his Office by the Aſſiſtance of another; he ſits ſecure under his Vine or Fig-tree, depending on his own Innocence and the Law of the Land. The Law directs what he is to do, and what to avoid; and, whilſt he executes the Condition to the beſt of his Power, and avoids the Crimes, by which he may incur a Forfeiture, no Power on Earth can in Juſtice deprive him.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to theſe Principles has been the Practice of the Legiſlature of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince hitherto, in reſpect to the Diviſion of Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>When the Pariſh of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was erected out of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> in the Year 1744, C. 3, the Act recites, that the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hugh Jones ſhall continue Incumbent of both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes during his Life.</hi>—When <hi>All Hallows</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Worceſter</hi> County was divided, and <hi>Worceſter</hi> Pariſh erected thereout, 1744, C. 24. the Diviſion was directed <hi>to take Place after the Death of the Rev.</hi> Mr. Glaſgow, the then Incumbent—When <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Pariſh in <hi>Baltimore</hi> County was divided, and Part thereof, lying in <hi>Anne-Arundel</hi> County, was united to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Pariſh, 1742, C. 15. the Partition was directed to take Place after the Death of the Rev. <hi>Benedict Bourdillon.</hi>—When <hi>St. Mary Whitechapel</hi> Pariſh was erected out of <hi>Great Choptank</hi> Pariſh, 1725, C. 10. the Act recites, that the Rev. <hi>Thomas Nowel</hi> had Notice thereof, and <hi>aſſented thereto.</hi>—By an Act appointing Commiſſioners for dividing <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s County into Four Pariſhes, and to erect <hi>Trinity</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Charles</hi> County out of Part of <hi>All Faith,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> Pariſhes, 1744, C. 14. it is provided by the 7th Section, that all the Part of <hi>All Faith</hi> and <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> Pariſhes, now lying within <hi>Charles</hi> County, ſhall hereafter be deemed and remain a diſtinct and ſeparate Pariſh, by the Name of <hi>Trinity</hi> Pariſh, but ſo as not to affect the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll, until after the Deceaſe or Removal of the preſent Incumbent or Incumbents of the ſaid Pariſhes of <hi>All Faith</hi> and <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen.</hi>—By the 9th Section it is provided, that ſuch Diviſions or Alterations of the Pariſhes aforeſaid, or the erecting the aforeſaid <hi>Trinity</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Charles</hi> County, ſhall not take Place or Effect, until the Death or Removal of the preſent Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents reſpectively, ſo as to alter the Income of any of the ſaid preſent Incumbents in the Pariſhes they now enjoy.</p>
            <p>It were needleſs to multiply Examples. The Legiſlature has been hitherto too juſt and conſiderate to deprive a Man of Part of his Property without his Conſent. The Precedent brought on the other Side proves nothing. When <hi>St. Luke</hi>'s Pariſh was erected out of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s in <hi>Queen Anne</hi> and <hi>Talbot</hi> Counties, 1728, C. 19. the Preamble recites, <q>Whereas Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Wilkinſon,</hi> the preſent Incumbent of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Pariſh aforeſaid, having had due Notice thereof, and <hi>making no material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> againſt paſſing of an Act, as above prayed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
It has been argued from the Words making <hi>no material Objections,</hi> that the Diviſion was made without the Conſent of the Incumbent; which Conſtruction is not admiſſible. Thoſe Words rather imply his Conſent, and this Explanation is confirmed by a ſimilar Recital in an Act paſſed 1722, C. 3. to unite Part of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Pariſh in <hi>Baltimore</hi> County to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Anne-Arundel</hi> County, <q>that the Rev. Mr. <hi>Tibbs,</hi> the preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Pariſh, had due Notice thereof, and <hi>makes no Objections</hi> againſt paſſing of an Act as aforeſaid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when the remaining Part of the ſaid Pariſh of <hi>St. Paul</hi> was made a new Pariſh, and Part of <hi>All Hallows</hi> and <hi>St. Anne</hi>'s Pariſhes added, the Preamble recites,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011830_0020_0F8D4E745F556490"/>
               <q>that the Rev. Meſſ. <hi>Tibbs, John Humphreys</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Golbatch,</hi> the ſeveral Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents of the ſeveral Pariſhes, after having due Notice thereof, and <hi>making no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Objections,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In both theſe Inſtances, <hi>making no Objections,</hi> and <hi>making no material Objections,</hi> are ſynonimouſly uſed, and imply the Conſent rather than the Diſſent of the ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents. For if they had made any Objections, that ſuch a Diviſion, againſt their Will, was contrary to publick Faith, to Law and Precedent, they muſt have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>material</hi> to any Legiſlature upon Earth.</p>
            <p>It may be contended, that a Legiſlature can make a Precedent where they find none; and that they are omnipotent within their Juriſdiction. But there are ſome Things impoſſible for Omnipotence itſelf. God himſelf cannot contradict his own Attributes; one of the principal of which is <hi>Juſtice.</hi> He cannot do an <hi>unjuſt</hi> Thing. An Example worthy the Imitation of the Powers on Earth.</p>
            <p>The Charter, which give the Legiſlature here its legal Exiſtence, grants the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy the Protection of the eccleſiaſtical Laws. <hi>The Church is directed to be dedicated and conſecrated according to the eccleſiaſtical Laws of the Kingdom of</hi> England. The Rights of the Clergy and of the Laity are coeval and coexiſtent: As the Layman claims a Trial by his Peers, ſo a Clergyman ſhall not be deprived but by legal Proceſs, and a final Sentence pronounced by a Biſhop; that is to ſay by canonical Cenſures, or in purſuance of diverſe penal Statutes, which declare the Benefice void, for ſome Non-feaſance or Neglect, or ſome Mal-feaſance or Crime. The Extent of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, or the Largeneſs of an Income, are not Objects within the Cogniſance of that Law; and if a Man perform his Duty conſcientiouſly and to the beſt of his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he is as free from its Cenſures as its Puniſhments. If Property may be alienated by Violence, becauſe it is thought too much, no Man is ſecure, becauſe each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Perſon thinks his Neighbour has too much.</p>
            <p>Tithes in <hi>England</hi> are of common Right. They have the Protection and Support of the common Law. If a Perſon be unjuſtly deprived of his Benefice by an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Court, he has his Remedy in the Court of King's Bench, where a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is granted. But old Age, Infirmity, or Non-reſidence, are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, in the Eye of the common Law, to countenance a Deprivation. In ſuch Caſes the Ordinary may provide, who has by Statute <note n="*" place="bottom">12 <hi>Ann.</hi> St. 2. C. 12.</note> a Power of ſequeſtering Part of the Income of the Pariſh to pay an Aſſiſtant.</p>
            <p>An Induction in this Province is in the Nature of a Patent; and if an Induction can be vacated, <hi>becauſe</hi> it includes the Circumference of 100 Miles, a Patent may be vacated upon the ſame Principle, <hi>becauſe</hi> it contains Ten or Twenty Thouſand Acres of Land. The Publick is much more injured by the latter than by the former Grant. Immenſe Bodies of Land in a few Hands prevent the Settlement and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of a Country, in which its Wealth and Strength conſiſt—but it is immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to the Publick, if divine Service is performed, and the Ceremonies of Marriage, Burial and Chriſtening be done by a Perſon legally authoriſed, whether it be done by a Rector or Curate of a Pariſh. If the ſacred Boundaries of Property be once vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Authority, there will ſoon be as little legal Security on this as on the other Side of the <hi>Allegany</hi> Mountains; and our Lives will be as unſafe as our Property.
<q>To bereave a Man of Life, or by Violence to confiſcate his Eſtate, without Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation

or Trial, would be ſo groſs and notorious an Act of Deſpotiſm, as muſt at once convey the Alarm of Tyranny throughout the whole Kingdom <note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſtone.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtirring up the People to petition againſt their reſpective Miniſters, without any juſt Cauſe of Complaint, is not only highly ungenerous, but ſhows a factious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Diſpoſition, and tends to ruin the Peace and Happineſs of Society. It agitates and inflames the Minds of the People, makes them unfit to receive thoſe divine Precepts which recommend brotherly Love, Unity and Concord, totally deſtroys that mutual Confidence that ought to ſubſiſt between a Miniſter and his Congregation, and gives the Sectaries every poſſible Advantage againſt the Eſtabliſhed Church. A Man may perhaps gain a little tranſitory popularity, an additional Vote at an Election, or the Huzzas of a Mob, but can never have the Approbation of his own Conſcience, or the Applauſe of prudent Men, who diſturbs the Peace of his Neighbourhood, from ſuch mean, and apparently ſelf-intereſted Conſiderations.—The Clergy have now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, an Opportunity of counteracting thoſe Meaſures, and of regaining the good Will and Confidence of the People. They are looked upon as mercenary; I do not know they are more ſo than other Men. Upon Failure of the Inſpecting Act, the Law of 1701-2 will give them an indubitable Right to 40 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll: but the Upper Houſe has propoſed during this Seſſion, and the Lower Houſe has acceded to the Propoſition, that the Clergy ſhould receive on 32 Pounds of Tobacco, at the Rate of 12<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ</hi>
               </abbr>6 <hi>per</hi> Hundred (<hi>i. e.</hi> 4 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> common Money <hi>per</hi> Poll) which additional Two Pounds in the Money Payments, to what was aſſeſſed under the late Inſpection Law, may, I apprehend, be founded on ſimilar Reaſons to thoſe explained in the Tenth Page of the foregoing Letter.</p>
            <p>The Advantage hence to thoſe who do not raiſe Tobacco will be conſiderable, as they will be freed from the diſagreeable Neceſſity of ſwearing off making Tobacco for the future, or otherwiſe of lying at the Mercy of the Sheriff, who may make them pay at the Tobacco Price; and the Benefit to the Tobacco makers will be ſtill greater, who, ſuppoſing Tobacco to average 20<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> Currency <hi>per</hi> Hundred, may pay the Clergy off at 4<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> inſtead of 8<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> a Tax, the Value of 40 Pounds of Tobacco.</p>
            <p>I ſubmit it therefore, whether it would not be equally for the Eaſe of the Clergy and of the People, that the Clergy agree, and publiſh their Conſent in the Gazette, that all Perſons indebted to them for the 40 Pounds of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſame to the Sheriffs in Tobacco before the 10th of <hi>June</hi> Yearly, or in common Money, at 4<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>per</hi> Poll, before the 10th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> Yearly, until other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion be made by Act of Aſſembly.—The Clergy can give no Umbrage to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Propoſition flowed from the Upper Houſe, and the People will pay with Chearfulneſs, as it was approved by their Repreſentatives. By this Conduct the Clergy will prevent the undue Advantages that may be taken of them in the Collection of the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll, will cut off many Occaſions of Diſpute and Altercation, will ſtop many unneceſſary Law-ſuits, ſtand higher than ever in the Opinion of their Friends, and even force their Enemies to admire, what they would not have Virtue to imitate.</p>
