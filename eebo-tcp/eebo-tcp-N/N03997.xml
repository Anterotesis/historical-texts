            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HE must be a</hi> Stranger in Israel, <hi>who has not heard of the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon religious Appearances in the several Parts of this Land, among Persons of all Ages and Characters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is an Affair which has in some Degree drawn every One's Attention, and been the Subject of much Debate both in Conversation and Writing. And the grand Question is,</hi>—Whether it be a Work of God, and how far it is so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The most serious and judicious, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Christians, have look'd upon it to be,</hi> in the main, <hi>a genuine Work of</hi> God, <hi>and the Effect of that Effusion of the</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT <hi>of</hi> Grace, <hi>which the faithful have been praying, hoping, longing and waiting for;
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004931_0003_0000000000000000"/>
while at the same Time they have look'd upon some Circumstances attending it, to be from natural Temper, human Weakness, or the Subtilty and Malice of Satan permitted to counter-act this Divine Operation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here rightly to</hi> distinguish <hi>is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no small Difficulty; and requires both a scriptural knowledge of, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Acquaintance with</hi> the Things of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Edwards's <hi>Discourse concerning</hi> the distinguishing Marks of a Work of the SPIRIT of GOD, <hi>has met with deserv'd Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and been of great Use.—The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Performance, by another dear and reverend Brother in a different Part of the Country, is also, in our Opinion, exceeding well adapted to serve the same Design,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>to help People to judge of the present Work,</hi> whether, <hi>and</hi> how far <hi>it is of</hi> GOD; <hi>and to remove those</hi> Prejudices, <hi>which may keep them from owning it to the Honour of</hi> GOD, <hi>and from coming under the Power of it to their own Salvation.</hi>

               <hi>Whoever</hi> takes up this Book and reads, <hi>has as it were in his Hands a Glass, in which he may</hi> behold what Manner of Person he is; <hi>whether a natural or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Man, a Hypocrite or a sound Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>

               <hi>The</hi> Form <hi>in which it appears, is</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistical; <hi>in the Manner of a</hi> Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>carried on by Persons under borrowed Names; which makes it not the less plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, entertaining, and instructive, It is a Method the best suted of any to answer the</hi> Design: <hi>For this Way of Instruction is the most easy and familiar; engages the Attention more closely, strikes the Mind more directly, and gets the nearest Access to</hi> Conscience, <hi>which the Reader will easily discern to be the special Aim of the</hi> Author; <hi>whose</hi> Name <hi>would have been a sufficient Recommendation of the Work, had he thought it proper to have prefix'd it to a Performance of</hi> this Kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in the Want of that, as many of us as have had the Pleasure to read it in</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, <hi>do with Freedom and Satisfaction recommend it to those into whose Hands it may come, and them to the blessed Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the</hi> DIVINE SPIRIT <hi>in the reading of it. And if particular Persons, while they

are reading it, would as it were</hi> place themselves in the Room of the Inquirer <hi>in the Conversation thus represented, with an</hi> open Mind <hi>and a</hi> serious Disposition, <hi>the important Things which are the Subject of it, might, by the Blessing of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>be brought so close and home to them, as to put them into something of a like Frame with that which the</hi> two Disciples <hi>were in, while they convers'd with the risen</hi> SAVIOUR <hi>in their Way to</hi> Emmaus, <hi>who said after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one to another,</hi> Did not our Hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the Way, and while he opened to us Scriptures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in recommending this Book to the World, we would be understood as</hi> owning, <hi>and</hi> bearing a publick Testimony to, <hi>what is call'd the present Work of GOD in this Land, as it is here</hi> stated <hi>and</hi> distinguish'd <hi>(separate from those</hi> Disorders, Errors, <hi>and</hi> Delusions, <hi>which are only the unhappy</hi> Accidents <hi>sometimes accompanying of it) to be such</hi> a glorious Display <hi>of the divine

Power and Grace, as may well raise our Wonder, excite our Praises, and engage our Prayers for the Preservation and Progress of it.</hi>—</p>

                     <q>I acknowledge, Sir, that your Conditions are just and reasonable.

                     <q>I first object against those FRIGHTS and TERRORS, that so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abound, not only among ourselves, but in several Parts of the Country.—Can it be suppos'd, that a merciful God should take Pleasure in the melancholly Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Soul-Distresses, and desponding Fears of his Creatures?—I must confess, I have a very different Idea of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>

                  <p>No, Sir, it can't be supposed, that God takes Pleasure in the Misery of any of his Creatures, <hi>as such.</hi> But it must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd agreeable to the divine Goodness, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his reasonable Creatures from their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, in a Method agreeable to their rational Nature. And that this is applicable to the Case before us, may perhaps appear evident to you, if you'l be pleased to answer me to a few Questions.—And I first enquire, Whether we are not all of us, whilst unconverted

                  <p>This then is the Case of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viced Sinner. He has a sensible View, that he is by <hi>Nature a Child of Wrath,</hi> that he is guilty of numberless Sine both of Omission and Commission, that he is by the Law of God sentenced to eternal Condemnation; and lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble every Moment to have the dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence executed upon him, to his everlasting Ruin.—He has hitherto withstood the Offers of Salvation in the Gospel, which dreadfully aggravates his Guilt and Misery.—He finds himself uncapable to comply with the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004931_0009_0000000000000000"/>
Proposals of Salvation by Jesus Christ; and has therefore no Claim to the Comforts of them. Though God can, if he pleases, give him this Power, he has not Security that God ever will.—He knows that if he dies in his present State, he has nothing before him but <hi>a fearful Expectation of fiery Indignation, which shall consume him.</hi> And whether he shall ever obtain a saving Change, is to him dreadfully uncertain. He may die suddenly in his Guilt and Pollution.

And now judge you, whether a reasonable Being can possibly avoid a distressing Concern, upon a realizing Apprehension of such an amazing State of Guilt and Danger.</p>

                  <p>That is, they have no feeling Sense of their Sin and Danger; and therefore no active Desire of a Deliverance from it. They have no lively Apprehension of their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an Interest in Christ; and therefore no proper Sollicitude to obtain it.—They are in Love with their Lusts and Idols; which must be more embitter'd to 'em, before they can be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004931_0010_0000000000000000"/>
willing to part with them.—Their earnal Mind is Enmity to God and Godliness; and they cannot submit to the Yoke to Christ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Yoke of Sin and Satan more sensibly galls their Necks; and appears an intolerable Burden to 'em.—Their sensual Pleasures and Gratifications appear more desirable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to 'em, than an Interest in Christ and a Life of Holiness and Piety. They cannot therefore help but choose them, as preferable to the Salvation proposed in the Gospel, until an awaken'd Conscience discovers to them their Misery and Folly, makes them feel themselves perishing with Hunger; and thereby puts 'em upon a proper Concern about returning to their Father's House.</p>

                  <p>They who are brought up under Gospel-Light, have a doctrinal Knowledge of these Things: but no felling sensible Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them. We see in Fact, how many Persons of Knowledge and Capacity there be, who have all their Lives had the great Things of their eternal Peace inculcated upon them in the Ministry of the Gospel, who yet live and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004931_0011_0000000000000000"/>
die as if they had no Souls to be saved of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no future Retribution or eternal World before them. We see in Fact, that among those who have a sufficient speculative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Doctrines of the Gospel, the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard follows his Cups, and the Adulterer his wanton and unclean Lusts; though they can't but acknowledge, that these are the Paths of Destruction and Death. But then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how many Instances (through the great Goodness of God) have we lately seen, of a thorough Reformation of these sinful Courses, of an earnest Enquiry after an Interest in Christ, of an hearty Acceptance of an offer'd Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and of a holy and religious Life, among those, who by strong Convictions have been brought to a sensible Impression of the great Concerns of an eternal World!—In short, it is impossible to be otherwise, but that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Sinner must indulge his Lusts while they remain so pleasant to him, and he feels no Danger in their Gratification; and that he most reject a tendred Saviour, whilst he does not realize his own perishing Circumstances and want of Salvation.—And on the other Hand, It is impossible to be otherwise, but that a convinced Sinner must be in earnest enquiring after the Way of Salvation, while he feels his Danger, Misery, and Necessity of an Interest in Christ.</p>

                  <p>Well then by your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, it is necessary from the Nature of Things, that preparatory to an actual Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, a Sinner must have some impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sense, that he is in a State of Sin, Guilt and Misery; and that he is in Danger of the Wrath to come. He must have such a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Evil and deadly Nature of his Sins, as will cause him to prefer an Interest in Christ and the great Salvation, to his most darling Lusts and Idols; and chuse the Service of Christ, before the Service of Sin, Satan and the World. And what Inducement can such a Person possibly have, to give this Preference to the Service of Christ, but either Love to him or Fear of Danger? Love to Christ he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004931_0012_0000000000000000"/>
have. For that is the Consequence of Faith; and can never go before it. This must therefore be the Product of Fear, of such Fear as is effective of this wonderful Change in the Frame and Disposition of the Soul.—And now having thus allow'd the Premises, can you deny the Conclusion, that such Degrees of Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as will excite a proper Sollicitude about Deliverance from deserved Wrath, are a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Preparation to a Reception of Christ by Faith?</p>

                  <p>If we consider this Case in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther View, you will find the same Conclusion follow.—A saving Faith, according to your own Description, does as well imply <hi>a depending upon Christ for Salvation,</hi> as receiving him upon Gospel-Terms; and can any Man be brought to this without previous Convictions of his lost and undone State? I would here also take Liberty to ask you a few Questions, to which I only desire a considerate and candid Answer.—And I would first enquire, whether the most careless and secure of our Gospel-Sinners could be so easy and quiet as they appear to be if they expected to live and die in their present State of Sin and Guilt?</p>

                  <p>It is therefore evident, that a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure World cannot possibly rest upon Christ alone for Salvation, while their Security itself suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that they are depending upon their own Capacity to exercise, or at least to obtain the Grace they hope for; &amp; consequently that they must be brought out of that Security, before they can savingly believe in Jesus Christ: Or in other Words, that Convictions must proceed their Conversion to God.—But I go on to enquire, By what Means Sinners usually quiet their Consciences, when they upbraid them for particular Sins, either of Omission or Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; or set the Gilt and Danger of their State before their Eyes?—You are sensible that there is nothing more common, than for Persons to wear off such Lashes of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and return again to former Calmness and Serenity of Mind.

                     <q>You expect, I see, that I should now relate my own Experiences in this Case. For I can't but be a Stranger to the Operations of other Men's Minds. I will therefore inform you something of the Exercise of my own Soul, in the Case which you propose.—Though (I thank God) I have been kept from gross Enormities; and have had a good Reputation for Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; yet I frequently feel the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004931_0014_0000000000000000"/>
of Conscience, both for the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or careless Performance of Duty; and for the many sinful Imperfections of my Life. These awaken me to Resolutions through God's Grace, that I will be more diligent and conscientious in the Performance of Duty, that I will maintain a more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and careful Regard to my Heart and Life, that they may be regulated according to the Gospel of Christ: and I can't but hope that God will for Christ's sake, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my Duty and Repentance; and not impute my Sin to me</q>

                  <p>What you represent as your own Case, is common to Multitudes besides your self. And indeed Sir, I should be guilty of greatest Unfaithfulness, if I did not tell you, that all this is far short of any good Evidence of a State of Safety.—In your Purposes and Endeavours to reform and regulate your Duties and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, you do well: but while you raise your Hope of Acceptance with God upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, you are building upon a Quick-Sand. You expect your Duties and Repentance will be accepted for Christ's sake before you clear it up to your self, that you are interested in Christ, and have a Claim to his Intercession. Has Christ purchased for you the Power to alone for your Sins by your Duties, your good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions and Reformations; or is this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004931_0014_0000000000000000"/>
to your Description of Faith? Are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pacify an offended God by your Performances, consistent with your resting upon Christ alone for Salvation?—It is plain from this Account of your Case, that instead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon what Christ has done and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for you, your Dependance is upon what you do, or intend to do for him.—You are by Nature <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins;</hi> and how can your Duties and good Purposes revive you?—You owe ten Thousand Talents to divine Justice; and will your Resolutions of future Obedience pay the Debt?—You have (if Christless) no Title to Salvation; and will you purchase the eternal Inheritance with your own Performances?—Allow me to proceed as before; and ask you a few Questions upon this Case of yours, as you have represented it.—Have you ever sensibly felt the Sinfulness of your Nature, the Hardness of your Heart; and your natural Enmity to God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness?</p>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004931_0015_0000000000000000"/>
that Salvation is you are to depend upon him for.—Permit me yet to enquire, Have you had a sensible Apprehension of your just Desert of God's Wrath; and of your utter Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that he should ever bestow Mercy upon you? Or to use St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Expression, has the Law come with such Power, that <hi>Sin has received and you died?</hi>

                  <p>So do the very worst of Men; and even the Devils themselves.—But if you have no more than a doctrinal Knowlege of this, How can you depend upon Christ alone for Salvation, when you han't so much as felt that you are not already safe? How can you depend upon Christ to save you from the Wrath to come, when you have no realizing Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of your being expos'd to that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Wrath? What Sort of Salvation can such a Person depend upon Christ for?—I must yet take Leave further to enquire of you, whether you have ever been feelingly sensible that your highest Attainments in Religion are not only <hi>Loss,</hi> as being imperfect and unequal to the Demands of Justice; but <hi>Dung</hi> (a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Thing) through the Sinfulness that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004931_0015_0000000000000000"/>
them; and the Guilt thereby contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—You are sensible from whose Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I take this Enquiry. And have you ever been able to say as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did in this Case?</p>

                  <p>How then have you <hi>won Christ, been found in him,</hi> and depended only upon <hi>the Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</hi> while you yet have no <hi>your own Righteousness</hi> which <hi>if of the Law;</hi> and have never yet realized to your self the infinite Defects of all you are and can do? O Sir, if you had a just View of the best Duties, and the best Frames and Purposes that you could ever boast of you would be deeply sensible, that the Defect and Sinfulness that accompany them, might justly condemn both you and them.—Bear with me once more; if I proceed to enquire, Have you given up all Hopes and Expectations of obtaining a Victory over your Corruptions, of obtaining a more spiritual Habit and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soul; and a more acceptable Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of religious Duty; or even any good Qualification whatsoever, by your most earnest and active Endeavours, until you are united to Christ; and derive all gracious Supplies from him?—Has this View of your Impotence brought you in a Way of most diligent Duty, to lie at God's Foot as a guilty helpless Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004931_0016_0000000000000000"/>
that have no Claim to Mercy, resolving never to rest until you are interested in him, and are thereby renewed in the Spirit of your Mind?—Let your Conscience impartially an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to these Enquiries. For you may assure yourself, that it is impossible, from the Nature of Things, to depend upon Christ for Salvation; and at the same Time to maintain a reserv'd Expectation of obtaining gracious Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by your own Endeavours. This, in other Words, is to depend <hi>only</hi> upon Christ; while you depend <hi>partly</hi> upon yourself for Santifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And yet it is equally impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Christ at all, in any other Way than a Course of diligent Duty. For by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, you practically reject him and his offered Salvation.</p>

                  <p>No Sir, I have not forgot <hi>the</hi> Subject of our Discourse, I will now leave it to you to judge, whether it is possible for any Man to be seelingly sensible of the Sinfulness of his Nature, and the Enmity of his Heart to God, of his utter Unworthiness of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, of the infinite Defects and even of the Guilt and Pollution of his highest Attainments
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004931_0016_0000000000000000"/>
in Religion, whilst Christless; and of his own Impotence and utter Inability to help himself, or ever make his Case better by any Power of his own; and yet under a Sense of all this Misery, to remain secure and easy.—Judge you, whether it be not absolutely necessary, that this View must put any reasonable Being under Distress, proportionable to the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these Things upon his Mind; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it does not appear from what has been said, to be an Inconsistency, for any Man to believe in Christ, before he has had some sensible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prestion of these Things.</p>

themselves upon some Consideration; and do thereby prick their Consciences; and awaken some Resolutions of Reformation; their good Purposes are (like the Principle from whence they flow) but unsteady, transient and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd.

Lusts to him, that put him upon a most earnest and active Care about his eternal Interests, that empty him of his self-Sufficiency; and cause him with Diligence to <hi>fly for Refuge to the Hope set before him.</hi>—From whence should these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but from the blessed Spirit of God? They are not the Productions of <hi>Nature;</hi> for that is Enmity against God. And there never was one Instance yet seen, of any Man's producing these Effects by the Power of his own good Purposes or Resolutions, as I have observ'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—They do not proceed from the <hi>Devil;</hi> for he is not such an Enemy to his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as thus to drive Men from his Service <hi>into the Kingdom of God's dear Son.</hi>—The Change often appears powerful and wonderful; and therefore must proceed from a powerful and wonderful Agent.</p>

                  <p>This Question makes Way for two further Evidences, that the Spirit of God is the glorious Author of this Work. First, I must inform you, that the Fact in quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your Supposal.—Read all the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Authors upon practical Godliness, from the Beginning of the Reformation; and you'l find that they teach the same Doctrines which I have now insisted on.—Read the Narratives of particular Conversions, not only in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but in all the proceeding Ages of the Church, and in all the most distant Countreys and Nations; and you'll find that the Work has always been carried on in Men's Hearts, in a Method substantially the same with what I have described, by the same Progress of Convictions and Humiliations.—And how could this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be, unless it proceeded from the same bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Author? For there could be no Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, Collusion, or Endeavours of Imitation, in Persons so far removed from, and so unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one another.—And <hi>Secondly</hi> whence is it that we hear of so much of these
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004931_0019_0000000000000000"/>
Things now, but from the more plentiful Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the blessed Spirit?—Whence is it that this blessed Work has spread so extensively, far and near, among young and old; and there are so many crying out under the Burden of their Sins; and so earnestly enquiring after the Way of Salvation?—Is not human Nature the same now that it used to be?—Whence is it that the Ordinances, that were before but as a dead Letter, do now make such a lively Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression? Certainly <hi>this is the Lord's Doing; and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>How do we know that these Convictions are any Thing more, than the natural Effects of those pungent and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying <hi>Addresses,</hi> from some warm and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ministers, which we lately hear of?</q>

                  <p>I readily allow, that a short tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Surprize may be this Way excited; but then this Effect could last no longer than the Cause operates. This only could never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a real effectual lasting Change.—I also allow, that God deals with Mankind as with reasonable Creatures: and when he designs this Change in the Hearts of any, he will provide and bless some suitable Means to effect it. If he saw us, it will be in the Way of his own appointing.—But can you yourself imagine, that the most pungent Address of any Teacher
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004931_0020_0000000000000000"/>
under Heaven, can in a natural Way produce those Effects that are frequently seen among us?—Consider I beseech you, the natural State of carnal Men. They <hi>are dead in Trespasses and Sins.</hi> And can a plain Discourse of the most zealous Preacher, how pungent soever, awaken these dead Men to such a lively lasting Concern about their Souls, that they can rest no more until they find Rest in Christ?—They are blind and ignorant, they have no just Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of their own deplorable Condition; of the way of salvation provided for 'em ;or of the glorious Excellency of an offer'd Saviour. And will this enlighten their Minds, to a lively View of, and acquaintance with the Things of their everlasting Peace?—They are proud and self-righteous. And will this lay 'em in the Dust, and bring them to renounce all their own Attainments, Duties, false Hopes, and Refuges?—They have a natural Enmity and Opposition to this Change. And will this so suddenly conquer their Aversation to a Life of Godliness, their Love to their Lusts, Ease and Security, their natural rooted Inclinations to sensual Pursuits; and their habitual Custom in Sin?—Will this cause 'em to lay aside all their Prejudices, beloved Lusts, fleshly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and Endearments?—They have strong and mighty Opposition to conquer. And will this overcome all the Craft and Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? Will it constrain them to forsake all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004931_0020_0000000000000000"/>
their Pleasures, worldly Pursuits, merry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and alluring Expectations; for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent melancholy, fearful, pensive Life? Will it fortify them against all the Persuasions of their carnal Acquaintance, against the Banter and Reproach of their old Companions; and against the Doubts and Misgivings of their own unbelieving Hearts? Could any of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> produce such Effects as these upon their Hearers?—If this be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect, what's the Reason that it was produced no sooner, upon those who have heard so many Scores of Sermons, as pungent and awakening as that which at last prov'd success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? And what is the Reason that it has not a like Effect upon others, naturally as capable of Impression; and as well prepared to receive it, as those who are thus suddenly, throughly, and powerfully awaken'd? In a Word, The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> himself assures us, that <hi>the Excellency of the Power is of God and not of Man;</hi> and that <hi>neither is he that planteth any Thing; nor he that watereth: but God that giveth the Increase.</hi> Let who will oppose the Work, or deny to God the Honour of it, I shall be awfully care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ascribe that to poor Worms, which is manisestly (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks) <hi>the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's mighty Power.</hi>

                  <p>Your Intelligence has been very defective; or else your Prejudice against these.

Don't you know and don't we all know, that the Ministers there under whose Instrumentality that Work was carried on, are calm, sedate, and judicious Men, unto whom the greatest Adversaries of this wonderful Work of God could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to impute the least Tincture of <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm</hi> or irregular Heat?

The sanctifying and abiding Effects of some of these convictions do loudly and manifestly declare, that they proceed from God himself.—Yet I can't help but conclude, that there has been a great deal of <hi>human Infirmity</hi> sometimes disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in this Case. Perhaps <hi>some</hi> of those who have thus openly proclaim'd their Distress, <hi>might</hi> have put a greater <hi>Restraint</hi> upon their
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004931_0024_0000000000000000"/>

                  <p>Though I have told you before, that these divine Experiences are <hi>incommunicable,</hi> inexpressible to those who are Strangers to them, yet there may be a certain and safe <hi>Distinction</hi> made between the one and the other, by these following Rules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> False and delusive Joys never do, but the unspeakable Joy and Comfort of Believers always does, flow from <hi>good Evidences of a jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified State.</hi>—The Spirit of God never does set his Seal to a Blank; nor cause Persons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, they don't know why, or for what.—They therefore, who depend upon their <hi>Joys,</hi> as the <hi>only</hi> Evidence of a justified State, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deceived: But they whose Rejoicing flows from <hi>good Evidences</hi> of a justified State, are never deceived.—In those who are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed, this is the Order. They are first <hi>justified by Faith, and have Peace with God;</hi> and thence <hi>rejoice in Hope of his Glory.</hi>—Should I congratulate you upon your Accession to the Government of this Province, it might fill you with sudden <hi>Joy,</hi> from your imaginary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: But as this Rejoicing had no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it must quickly end in Disappointment

and Vexation. But should I bring you the <hi>King's</hi> Letters Patent, vesting you with that Dignity, your <hi>Joy</hi> would be rational and grounded. The Application of this to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Case is easy and familiar. And then Again.—</p>

                     <q>Pardon me, Sir, if I take Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to interrupt you, that I may (before you proceed further) enquire whether this <hi>Distinction</hi> of yours (which I acknowledge to be most just and scriptural) don't necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conclude against most of those <hi>sudden</hi> transporting Joys, of which we are treating. For how can these flow from good <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of a justified State, which are such quick Transitions from greatest Darkness and Distress?</q>

                  <p>Don't you think, that the Spirit of God can make a <hi>quick Discovery</hi> of Jesus Christ, to the most dark and distressed Soul; and enable him to give a speedy, hearty, and sensible Consent to the Gospel-Offer?—Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Case to be (as it frequently is) that a Person is at least under a most uncomfortable <hi>Suspence</hi> with Respect to his State. He sees many dark Symptoms upon his Soul; and is filled with awful Jealousy of the Event; if not under greatest Agony from a dreadful Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal Misery. In the Time of this
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004931_0029_0000000000000000"/>
thick Darkness, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God shines with a <hi>surprizing Light</hi> into the Soul, discovers the Fulness and Sufficiency of Christ, and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness and Willingness to save all that come to him, enables the poor trembling Soul heartily and willingly to <hi>accept</hi> this precious Saviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Terms; and to <hi>feel</hi> that he does so. By this Means he finds <hi>Joy and Peace in Believing.</hi>—Now, in this Case, his Rejoicing is founded upon the most sensible Evidence of a true Faith in Christ; though perhaps there may be but little or no discernable Distance of Time, between his acting Faith in Christ, and this ravishing Fruit of it. The Continuance or Renewal of this <hi>Joy</hi> in Believes is in like Manner accompany'd with such Outgoings of the Soul to Christ, and such a <hi>shedding abroad of the Love of God in their Hearts,</hi> as carries its own Evidence with it.—They have <hi>Reason</hi> to rejoice, or else it would be a fallacious and absurd <hi>Joy.</hi>

                     <q>This Explanation of the Case, removes the Difficulty beyond my Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.—You'll now be pleased to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to give the <hi>other Distinctions,</hi> you were about to propose, between the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluding Joy of the Hypocrite, and these Sealings of God's holy Spirit.</q>

                  <p>I would (<hi>Secondly</hi>) observe, that the <hi>Joy</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> tends to <hi>exalt</hi> his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and life him up with a high Opinion of <hi>himself;</hi> it causes him like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, to <hi>think himself righteous and to desoise others:</hi> But the <hi>Joy</hi> of the true Believer does always exceedingly <hi>humble</hi> his Soul, and lay him low, under a deep Sense of his Vileness and Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness. It fills him with admiring, &amp; adoring Thoughts of the wonderful distinguishing Grace of God, to such a guilty and polluted Creature as he is. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Joy</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> tends to <hi>Security;</hi> and to more Negligence, slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Formality in Duty: But the <hi>Joy</hi> of the true <hi>Believer</hi> has an <hi>animating</hi> and <hi>quickning</hi> Influence upon him, in all the Duties of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Life. It causes him to heartily love, and diligently attend all the Ordinances of God; <hi>and to mount up with Wings as the Eagle, it run and not be weary, to walk and not saint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Joy</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> leaves him under the <hi>Dominion</hi> of his <hi>Lusts,</hi> more careless of his Heart and Life, more bold and confident in the Commission of Sin, from an Apprehension of the Safety of his State: But on the contrary, the <hi>Joy</hi> of the true <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> causeth him to <hi>loath himself for all his Iniquities and Abominations;</hi> and from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004931_0030_0000000000000000"/>
of Love to God, to be more careful to approve himself to him; and more fearful of offending him.—In a Word, These ravishing and transporting Influences of the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> are always a happy Source of habitual <hi>Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mindedness,</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> towards God, and <hi>Righteousness</hi> towards Men.

                  <p>I see no great Danger of Mistake by those, who will <hi>seriously</hi> and <hi>impartially</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to 'em.—For, on the one Hand, Can the <hi>Devil</hi> himself delude any Soul by good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of a justified State, and by the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a lively Faith? Or will he endeavour by these transporting Comforts, to make any Man walk humbly with his God, to quicken him in his spiritual Walk, to embitter his Sins to him; and make him more watchful over his Heart and Life; and more spiritual and heavenly in his whole Conversation? This cannot be. <hi>Such Joys</hi> therefore must always be acknowledged to be the Fruits of Gods blessed <hi>Spirit;</hi> and the Manifestation of his Love to the Soul.—And, on the other Hand, It is impossible that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God should

delude Men with false, groundless, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Comfort and Joy; or lead them by his divine Influences to Pride, Self-Opinion, and Vanity of Mind; and to Hypocrisy and Formality, Boldness and Security in Sin. <hi>This Joy</hi> therefore, however rapturcus and extatic can be no other than a dangerous and fatal Delusion.</p>

amuse themselves and one another.—But would they duly consider, that <hi>for every idle Word they speak, they must give an Account in the Day of Judgement,</hi> they would be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to follow that Advice (Eph. iv. 29.) to <hi>have their Communication such as it good for the Use of Edifying, that it may minister Grace unto the Hearers.</hi> And that Advice (Col. iv. 6.) <hi>Let your Speech he alway with Grace, season'd with Salt.</hi>—It is most evident from the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of religious Concerns, from the infinite Value of our own Souls and the Souls of our Neighbours, as well as from the plain Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Word of God, that we should improve our Occasions of conversing together ordinarily and chiefly in religious Discourse.</p>

                  <p>There is (I confess) great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not only of apparent, but of real Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and spiritual Pride, by making our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Experience the ordinary Topic of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.—Christians themselves have unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Remains of <hi>Vanity</hi> and Pride in their Hearts, which are too apt to be elated, and blown up by every Representation of their own Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. For which Reason they should be very cautious of pouring Oil upon that Fire, which is so apt of it self to blaze.—They are also under the strict and curious Inspection of the carnal <hi>World,</hi> who are always ready to take Occasion of <hi>Prejudice,</hi> from every imaginary Appearance of Pride, or Self Exaltation. This should therefore excite their Caution, left they bring Reproach upon the Operations of God's Holy Spirit; and cause the good Ways of the Lord to be evil spoken of.—And what
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004931_0034_0000000000000000"/>
is as much to be fear'd as either of the Things now mention'd, is the Danger of tempting and prompting some <hi>Pretenders</hi> in Religion, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> the Truth, in the Narrative of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and to recommend themselves to their Company, by speaking of Experiences which they have never had, when these are made the <hi>common</hi> Subject of Discourse.</p>

                  <p>When Persons are in <hi>Darkness</hi> and Distress about their <hi>State,</hi> it is needful that they should <hi>make their Case known,</hi> to their Minister, or some faithful experienced Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that they may obtain that Assistance, Comfort, or Counsel, which their Condition requires. For how can we <hi>comfort those in Trouble</hi> (as directed, in forecited 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 4.) if they don't make their Trouble known?—When a convinced Offender is so distressed with the Burden of some <hi>particular Sin,</hi> or with some particular Darkness and Difficulty relating to his <hi>Conduct,</hi> that he can find no Means to case his Mind, or quiet his Conscience, he should in this Case also make his Difficulty known; and <hi>seek Direction</hi> from his Minister, or some faithful Friend, that his wounded
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004931_0034_0000000000000000"/>
Conscience may be safely healed, Here that Rule takes Place, Jam. v. 16. <hi>Confess your Faults one to another; and pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>—Moreover, when imparting our Experiences, whether we be apply'd to, or not may be <hi>likely</hi> to alleviate the Agonies of any wounded and distressed Souls, it is then proper to let <hi>such</hi> know, how we our selves have conflicted with the <hi>like</hi> Darkness, Trials, or Temptations; and to endeavour to <hi>comfort our selves together,</hi> and help them (if possible) <hi>to the same Comforts wherewith we have been comforted of God,</hi> according to the forecited 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 11. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4.—Further-more, when by conversing with any, we find them building their <hi>Hope</hi> upon a <hi>false</hi> Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be seasonable to let 'em know how we our selves have formerly been under the same dangerous <hi>Deceit;</hi> and how by the Power of divine Grace, our Feet have been pluck'd out of the fatal Snare. This is a likely Means <hi>to save them by Flar, pulling them out of the Fire,</hi> according to that in <hi>Jude</hi> 23. This is the Course the Apostle took, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Self-Deceivers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, &amp;c.—I may also add, that intimate Christian <hi>Friends</hi> may profitably improve Occasions to assist, comfort, and quicken one another, by mutual Communications of religious Experience. For <hi>as Iron sharpneth Iron, so may a Man</hi> this Way <hi>sharpen the Countenance of his Friend.</hi> Prov.

xxxvii. 17.—Upon the whole, I think that an ordinary and common Discoursing of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Experiences, except upon such Occasions as I have mention'd, is not so likely to promote the Interests of Religion; at least without the utmost Guard against those Indiscretions, which to too frequent the familiar Practice of it may tend to betray us into.</p>

enter upon Discourses of this Nature, in the most <hi>tender, kind</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> Manner possible, that we may insinuate ourselves into the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sections, and not ruffle the Passions of those with whom we converse. Thus did our LORD himself by the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> as you may see in his Epistles to them.—We should endeavour to describe the Danger, and to detect the Sins and Delusions of some Men, in a more general and distant Manner, without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Application to them; when we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude, that they would not bear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Examination and Admonition. Thus we may without Offence, in the most strong and pointed Manner, address the Consciences of such Men as would be prejudiced and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by a personal Address. This Method (you know) the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> took with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi> and lest his own Conscience to make the Application. <hi>Acts</hi> xxiv. 25. We should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wist take Care, not too <hi>bluntly</hi> and <hi>abruptly,</hi> without a proper Introduction; nor <hi>unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> in the Midst of Conversation or Business; much less <hi>imperiously,</hi> in a Way of Challenge Or Demand, to examine any Man as to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Experiences, lest we bring Contempt upon our selves and our Profession.—But yet it is doubtless our Duty upon proper Occasions, in a kind affectionate Manner, to discourse our Neighbour upon his religious State and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, so that the Rule be therein attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

I see that the Fault is no both Sides, by which these Distances and Alienations of Mind are kept up among Professors of Religion.—But though I have carried my Censure too far, even till I have fallen into the same Fault myself; yet you must nevertheless own, that this judging and censuring Spirit is what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> every where condemn.</q>

It may perhaps further remove those sinful Prejudices, that I am sensible I have entertain'd.—As you have already shewn who are <hi>not</hi> guilty or finfully <hi>judging</hi> one another: Be pleas'd also to shew <hi>what this Sin is,</hi> which the Scriptures so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and who may be said to be guilty of it.</q>

                  <speaker>THEOPH.</speaker>
                  <p>The Lord grant, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Concern may end in well-grounded Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Peace!—As for my Sentiments upon the Subject under Consideration, I shall offer them in the following Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no Doubt to be made but that there has be'n <hi>uttely a Fault among us,</hi> in the <hi>Censoriousness</hi> and reproachful Aspersions, that have be'n so commonly observ'd and complain'd of, in so many Parts of the Country: Nor can it be doubted by any that have read the New Testament, that this is a very great Sin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of christian Charity, injurious to our Neighbour's Reputation, productive of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Animosities; and of Prejudices in Men's Minds against the Professor, and even the Profession of vital Piety: And therefore very provoking unto God.—But then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, that we our selves may avoid this Sin, which we so justly condemn in others, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to conclude, that some of these act with <hi>good Views,</hi> though upon mistaken Principles; and that they have a <hi>Zeal for God</hi> therein, tho' it be <hi>not according to Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They who adventure to censure the State of such, who are of a <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>blameless Conversation,</hi> Friends to a religious Life, and careful Observers of the Ordinances of God, without any special Acquaintane with their
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004931_0039_0000000000000000"/>
religious <hi>Experiences,</hi> are guilty of this Sin. <hi>Who art thou that judgest another Man's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? to his own Master he standeth or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</hi> Rom. xiv. 4. <hi>Judge Nothing before the Time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkness; and will make manifest the Counsels of the Heart.</hi> 1 Cor. iv. v.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They who <hi>publish</hi> and proclaim abroad their <hi>Fears</hi> and Apprehensions, of regular and blameless Professors, that they are but <hi>Formalists</hi> and Hypocrites, though they may suppose they have good <hi>Grounds</hi> for their Fears, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing guilty of that <hi>judging,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemns. For they hereby <hi>set at Nought their Brother,</hi> contrary to Rom. xiv. 10. And <hi>speak evil of their Brother; and judge their Brother, and</hi> thereby <hi>speak Evil of the Law, and judge the Law; they are</hi> therefore <hi>not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, but Judges.</hi> Jam. iv. 11.—These Apprehensions, if such we have, should either be <hi>concealed</hi> in our own Breasts; or else (if we have Opportunity for it) privately, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, and affectionately communicated only to the <hi>Person concern'd,</hi> for his best Good and Advantage.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They who with Rigour, Roughness and Asperity, in dealing with any Persons of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Conversation, do admonish them of their
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004931_0039_0000000000000000"/>
                     <hi>Formality;</hi> and they who in a <hi>positive, haughty</hi> Manner determine their present <hi>State</hi> and future Danger; these are likewise guilty of this Sin, For herein also they <hi>are not Doers of the Law, but Judges;</hi> and hereby they <hi>put a Stumbling Block and Occasion to fall, in their Brother's Way,</hi> contrary to <hi>Rom. xiv. 13.</hi> They here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by irritate Men's Passions, prejudice them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Persons and Profession of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishers: and inflame the Enmity of their carnal Mind to the Power of Godliness?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Men run into these Methods of judging those <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, who are visibly <hi>well-qualified</hi> for the Ministry, and have <hi>visibly conducted</hi> themselves <hi>well</hi> in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their sacred Trust, they, they are more <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravatedly</hi> guilty of this Sin; by prejudicing People against their Ministers; and thereby making them flight the Ordinances of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to the great Danger of their precious Souls. This is to do direct Violence to that Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 Tim. v. 19. <hi>Against an Elder receive no an Accusation, but before two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;</hi> and to that Exhortation, Phil. ii. 29. <hi>Hold such in Reputation.</hi>—Upon the whole, they who have been guilty in any of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, have great Reason for a particular and deep <hi>Repentance;</hi> and for a solemn Care to <hi>reform</hi> their future Conduct. For, whatever Thoughts they may now entertain, they must
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004931_0040_0000000000000000"/>
quickly stand before that Judge, who will let the World see the Honour he puts upon <hi>Word;</hi> and the Regard he expects from all who profess his Name, to the <hi>Rules</hi> which he has given them.—Thus, Sir, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured according to my Capacity, to answer your Demands in this Instances also.—Are there any other Difficulties before you, which you desire should be consider'd?</p>

Sense of their Sin, Guilt and Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; who have been thereby driven to Despain of Help from any Refuges of their own; who in this their Extremity, have had a Discovery of the Sufficiency and Willingness of the Lord Jesus Christ to save them; and have betaken themselves for Refuge to this Hope set before them; such may be capable to exhibit in some Measure these their Experiences, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which flow from them, to others; and thereby give good <hi>Reason</hi> to hope, that the Power of God's <hi>special Grace</hi> has indeed passed upon their Souls.—And if in any late Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this Change has appeared very <hi>sudden</hi> and surprizing, there is the clearer Evidence of the <hi>almighty</hi> Efficiency, by which it is wrought; and the greater Resemblance of the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions in the Christian Church.</p>

                     <q>I left you last with a Sort of a <hi>Resolution,</hi> that I would lie at the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool of God's Mercy; and determin'd, if I must perish, to perish there. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I retired to my <hi>Closet</hi> as soon as I came home; and attempted to pour out my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed Soul to God. But alas! my Mind was Nothing but <hi>Horror</hi> and Distress. The Sins of my past Life, even from my earliest Youth, were set in Order before my Eyes. I could not look to God, but as to a provoked Judge. The Idea's of eternal Destruction seem'd to interrupt every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Sin, and every Petition for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and in short, the whole Performance was meer Medly of Distraction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sasion: Insomuch that the small Glearn of Comfort, which flow'd from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Resolution, was now quite lost. For what Hope could I entertain from
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004931_0045_0000000000000000"/>
such <hi>Lip-Service</hi> to an Omniscient God!—I retired to my <hi>Bed;</hi> and there lay tossing to and fro, until the Dawning of the Day.—I spend the following Day in <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> with but little better Success.—I examin'd my Conduct towards <hi>Men,</hi> in all the Dealings of my Life, as particularly as I could; and resolv'd upon <hi>Restitution</hi> to all whom I and wrong'd, in every Instance that I could remember. But this Bed also was too short for me to stretch my self upon.—I saw that these Things, though necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duties, would never appease the Divine Justice, and atone for my Sins; nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the Favour of God.—I sometimes endeavour'd to comfort myself with <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of a more strict and watchful Life: and sometimes endeavour'd to look to the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for Salvation; but was sensible, that I could not act <hi>Faith</hi> in him.—I spent a great Part of my Time for the first <hi>Fortnight,</hi> in Acts of <hi>Devotion;</hi> and yet found my Heart as hard as a Stone. I could excite no Affection or Passion, but <hi>Fear,</hi> in any of my Approaches unto God.—I was now ready to conclude my Case <hi>hopeless:</hi> that I was lest of God; and that my Day of Grace was past.—In this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termity</hi> I retired to my <hi>Closet;</hi> and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, with a more feeling Sense, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my utter <hi>Unworthiness</hi> of Mercy; and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004931_0045_0000000000000000"/>
was filled with Admiration at the <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of God towards me, that I was yet out of Hell. I saw that I could not help my self; and did not deserve, that God should help me. I concluded the Duty with a Sort of <hi>Resignation</hi> of my self into his Hands. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that I lay at his <hi>Mercy;</hi> is he would grant me an Interest in Christ and his Salvation, it would be to the eternal Glory of his great Name: But he would be most <hi>just,</hi> if he should cast me off forever. I resolved to leave the Case with him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he would be pleased to deal with me. And this something eased my Mind; and put me into a more calm and quiet Frame.</q>

Tho' my Sins were ever so many and great, he would frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive them all. The Efficacy of his Blood was sufficient for any Sinner under Heaven; and therefore sufficient for me.—I found my self joyfully willing to accept this Saviour upon any Terms; to do, be, or bear whatever he call'd and enable me to.

Whence this astonishing Mercy to so vile a Wretch!

accepted at the Bar of your final Judge. Or if they all decree you a Hypocrite; and the Lord Jesus Christ accepts and approves you in the great Day, you will be safe enough.—I will can't however but hope, that I have Cause to join with you in praising God for this Work of Grace, which he has wrought in your Soul. May the succeeding Fruits of the blessed Spirit convince us both, that our Hopes are well grounded.

We are as earnest with Sinners to believe <hi>immediately</hi> in Christ, as you can be: and therefore admonish them to cry earnestly to God that he would remove all Hindrances out of the Way; and enlighten, persuade and enable them to believe, that they may be saved.—We exhort them to look to Christ <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;</hi> but not with their Eyes <hi>shut.</hi>—We call upon 'em to give Christ <hi>immediate</hi> Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Souls: but we advise them, in Order to it, to get the Doors of their Hearts <hi>open'd</hi> which are barr'd against him; that so <hi>be may come in and sup with them, and they with him.</hi> We call upon them to use all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means, to <hi>awake out of their Sleep, and

                  <p>Well now, if you please, consider the <hi>other</hi> Part of your Charge against the carnal Ministry you complain of; and see whether we are so guilty as you suppose, by preaching that Men may have a joyful <hi>Persuasion</hi> that they are <hi>interested in</hi> CHRIST; and yet be <hi>Unbelievers.</hi>—I would then enquire, Whether we must conclude such a <hi>Persuasion</hi> to be a saving <hi>Faith,</hi> if it should puff a Man up with <hi>Pride</hi> and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind; and cause him, like the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, to think himself righteous, and to despise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> or like those in the <hi>Prophet,</hi> to say, <hi>Stand by the self; come not nigh me; for I am holier than thou?</hi>

                  <p>That this <hi>can</hi> be, is too evident from unquestionable Fact, open to every Body's Observation.—And you are to remember, that I am not enquiring, whether these Persons <hi>have</hi> true Faith: but whether this <hi>Persuasion</hi> of an Interest in Christ be <hi>essential</hi> to a true Faith.

                  <p>I acknowledge the Truth of what he says, that <hi>Faith</hi> is the Exercise of the Mind; and that every Man may <hi>know</hi> the Operations of his own Mind: But it does now follow from thence, that every Man must know whether he be, or be not a <hi>true</hi> Believer.—Tho' we cannot but be conscious to the Actings of our Minds, and feel them operate: yet we may not <hi>certainly</hi> know what is the exact <hi>Quality</hi> of those Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and whether our <hi>Faith</hi> be <hi>saving</hi> and true, or not.—The Believer may sensibly feel such Exercises of Mind, as look very much <hi>like</hi> true <hi>Faith:</hi> And yet through the Darkness of his Understanding, the Prevalence of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Fear of Presumption, he may be awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jealous, that this is but a <hi>counterfeit Grace,</hi> which may leave him expos'd to Disappointment and Confusion. Alas, it's to be fear'd that Thousands deceive themselves in this most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Case, by taking the Resemblance for the Reality: and hence we may well dread being cheated by meer Appearances.</p>
                  <p>It must also be acknowledged, that clear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and satisfying <hi>Evidence</hi> of the Exercise of Faith is not only <hi>attainable:</hi> but is what has
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004931_0054_0000000000000000"/>
been actually attain'd by many of the Children of God, to their unspeakable <hi>Consolation;</hi> and is what should and will be earnestly <hi>pressed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> by every true Believer. He that can content himself without Assurance, does thereby evidence that he has hitherto rested short of true Faith. A true Believer can't willingly be at a dreadful Uncertainty, what his eternal State is like to be: but will <hi>give Diligence to make his Calling and Elections sure.—Manifestation</hi> is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the <hi>Comfort,</hi> though it be not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the <hi>Safety</hi> of a Child of God. It's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the <hi>Joy</hi> of Faith, though not to the <hi>Being</hi> of Faith. But this notwithstanding, it must be remembred, that it is our <hi>Acceptance</hi> of Christ (and not our <hi>Persuasion</hi> that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him) which <hi>given us the Power, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, to become the Children of God.</hi> Joh. i. 12.—It is Christ's <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and not our <hi>Evidence</hi> of an Interest in it, that is the Matter of our Justification before God. <hi>We are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Jesus Christ.</hi> Rom. iii. 23.—Accordingly, our Safety is founded upon our trusting in Christ, and committing our Souls to him; and not upon the Satisfaction we have in our Minds about it. Eph. i. 12. <hi>That we should be to the Praise of his Glory, who first trusted in Christ.</hi> 2 Tim. i. 12. <hi>He is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that Day.</hi> Whence it follows, that the Joy
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004931_0055_0000000000000000"/>
and Peace, which is commonly found, first or last, in a greater or lesser Degree, in all true Believers, in not <hi>Faith</hi> in Jesus Christ: But a <hi>Fruit</hi> or Consequence of Faith and the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it to their own Consciences. AFTER <hi>thay ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise.</hi> Eph. i. 13.</p>
                  <p>What a dreadful Train of <hi>Consequences</hi> will follow from the Supposition, that <hi>Faith</hi> consists in a satisfactory <hi>Persuasion</hi> of our good Estate! IF so, Then our Justification must depend upon our Frames; and be as mutable as our Comfort. For how often soever we want this <hi>Persuasion,</hi> we are Unbelievers; and while such, in a State of Condemnation. <hi>Joh. iii. 18.</hi>—IF so, then tempted, deserted, or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Believers can have no possible Means of Comfort or Relief. Those <hi>who walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and see no Light,</hi> can no Ways be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to <hi>trust in the Lord, and to stay themselves upon their God;</hi> as directed in <hi>Isa. I. 10.</hi>—IF so, the most secure and presumptuous Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Flatterers are in the safest State: And how then can that be true, that <hi>he who thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self something, when he is nothing, deceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self!</hi> Gal. vi. 3.—IF so, the Church of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicca</hi> was in the Exercise of a true Faith, when she said, <hi>I am rich and increased with Goods; and have Need of Nothing.</hi> Rev. iii. 17.—IF so, there can be no Occasion for the Apostle's Exhortation, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. <hi>Examine yourselves
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004931_0055_0000000000000000"/>
whether ye be in the Faith.</hi> For we can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certain, whether we have a <hi>satisfying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion</hi> of our own good Estate, or not. Nor is there any Occasion to <hi>give Diligence to make our Calling and Election sure;</hi> as we are exhorted 2 Pet. i. 10. For what Diligence can be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to know what is the settled and satisfying <hi>Persuasion</hi> of our own Minds?—In fine, IF so, there is no Means left to detect confident Self-Deceivers, or to recover bold presumptuous Sinners out of their dangerous Soul-destroying Mistakes. Insomuch that I don't know what Doctrine can have a directer Tendency to the Destruction of Multitudes of poor Sinners, than this has.</p>

                  <p>Shall we then <hi>sum</hi> up your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions upon this Subject?—You can't deny but that the Scriptures make <hi>Holiness</hi> absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to Salvation; that no one can <hi>have this Hope, who don't purify himself, as Christ is pure;</hi> that every one hath this Hope, that doth thus purify himself; that he who <hi>doth Righteousness is righteous; and that they who live in Sin,</hi> have <hi>not seen him, neither known him;</hi> and that this is the Light, by which the Children of <hi>God</hi> are manifest, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Devil.</hi>—You can't but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that all this is the very Word of God.—And yet you will hold, that we must <hi>not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> our Justification, by that which God himself has told us is a sure Mark and Evidence of it; and without which he has assured us, that we are not in a justified State. We must not make it manifest to our selves whose Children we are, by that which God himself has told us, is the proper Manifestation of it.—And what is the Reason why we must not try ourselves by this Rule? Because this
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004931_0058_0000000000000000"/>
were <q>to light up a Candle to see the Sun. We may have a better and clearer Evidence.</q> What, without this I An Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that may consist with a Course of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning! And may with the greatest Assurance be pretended to, by Men of most profligate and abandon'd Lives! Let these but impute their presumptuous Confidence to the Spirit of God, and call it his <hi>witnessing with their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> and their State is safe!—You tell us indeed, that they who have this Witness, <hi>will</hi> not sin; But what if they should?—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, you will answer with a famous <hi>Rabbi</hi> of the present Day, "That we must not mind Sin any more than a Fly."—What Sort of Doctrines are these! I hope our People are better instructed by their carnal Ministers (as you are pleased to stigmatize us) than to receive such carnal, such dangerous and mischievous Principles as these are.</p>

                     <q> I see, he is ruffled: He's gone away in a Pet. But though he's gone, I hope you will for my Sake more particularly clear up the Subject before us; and shew how far we may depend upon <hi>internal Manifestation</hi> of the Love of God, as an Evidence of our Safety; and how far we ought to look to our <hi>Sanctification</hi> for the Comfort of a justified State.</q>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <p>You may remember, I said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this in our former Conference. To which I will now add;—It is doubtless true, that the Believer may in such a feeling and sensible Manner exercise Faith in Christ, he may have such a clear Discovery of his Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, so heartily comply with the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Call, so firmly depend upon the Promise; and have all this so clearly manifested to himself by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, that he can at that Time no more doubt of it, than of any other Operations of his own Mind.—But then it must be remembred, that these sensible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are but <hi>transient</hi> Things. He may <hi>lose</hi> them: and if the Spirit of God withdraw his comforting Influences, he certainly <hi>will</hi> lose them; and not so much as retain a lively <hi>Idea</hi> of the transporting Comforts, which he
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004931_0059_0000000000000000"/>
then had, And what shall he do now? Whither shall he betake himself for Support?—He remembers indeed, that he has had Comfort and Joy: But this Prop is now knockt from under him. <hi>He goes forward, but it is not there: And backward, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive it.</hi>—Besides, Many have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>same</hi> Experience, and to the <hi>same</hi> Assurance that he has formerly had, who are evidently <hi>Self-Deceivers.</hi> And how shall he know that <hi>he</hi> is not himself likewise in a most dangerous Mistake, but by the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> in his Heart and Life?—These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be consider'd, as the <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> Evidences in his Favour.</p>
                  <p>If he maintains an habitual Course of vital and true <hi>Holiness,</hi> he thereby clears up his Interest in CHRIST. For from his only, the Head of Influences, this Sanctifying Change in the Man must proceed. If he has not a Principle of Holiness in his Heart, and is not careful to be practically holy in his Life and Conversation, he can't <hi>belong to Christ, or be his Disciple;</hi> He can have no Interest in Christ. For <hi>Christ come to save his People from their Sins.</hi>—And if we yet further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Case; how many true <hi>Believers</hi> are there, who may never have experienced such clear, Lavishing, and unquestionable <hi>Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the Love of God to their Souls? And
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004931_0059_0000000000000000"/>
which Way possibly can such evidence their Justification, but by their <hi>Sanctification?</hi> They sometimes doubt whether their <hi>Faith</hi> (taken under an abstract Examination) be sincere, and genuine: But they may perhaps find beyond Doubt their Sorrow for and Hatred of all Sin, their Love to Holiness, and their unfeigned Endeavours of Conformity to God in all Things. They find the purifying Effects of Faith. By this therefore, they may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their State good. They may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themselves to be in <hi>Christ Jesus, because old Things are passed away; and all Things are become new in them.</hi>—In find, Sanctification is in it self a good Evidence for us: But where that is wanting, we can have none at all.</p>

                  <p>The Lord graciously prevent the spreading of such dangerous Contagion.—What! <hi>Justified</hi> before we had a Being! Pardon'd, before we had sinned! Acquitted from Guilt, before we were guilty! Why not sanctified and glorified too from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Is it not true of all who <hi>believe not, that they are condemned already?</hi> Are they justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from Eternity; and yet condemned for their Unbelief?—What, the <hi>Law</hi> not a Rule of Life to Believers! Have they then no Rule to walk by! Are they under no Obligations to Obedience? Nay, are they not even under greater Obligations, from the special Love of God manifested to them? <hi>Do we then make void the Law by Faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.</hi>—What, does God <hi>see no Sin</hi> in his Children! Are we not expresly told that <hi>the Thing which</hi> David <hi>did, displeased the Lord?</hi> 2. Sam. xi. 27. Don't Believers fin against greater Obligations? And are not therefore <hi>their</hi> Sins especially displeasing to God?
