            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>3d Art. of the Bill of Rights of Virginia —"That Government is, or ought to be, inſtituted for the common benefit, protection and ſecurity, of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Nation, or Community; of all the various modes and forms of Government, that is beſt, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing the greateſt degree of happineſs and ſafety, and is moſt effectually ſecured againſt the danger of mal-adminiſtration; and that when any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be found inadequate or contrary to theſe purpoſes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeaſible right, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, alter, or aboliſh it, in ſuch manner as ſhall be judged moſt conducive to the public weal.</p>

            <p>"<hi>THE</hi> Freedom of the Preſs is one of the great Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of Liberty, and can never be reſtrained but by Deſpotic Government,"—Therefore every citizen has the right of printing his thoughts of the Government and Laws under which he lives. I conceived the Remarks contained in the following ſheets, might be in ſome meaſure beneficial to my Country, and have committed them to the Preſs.— Perhaps ſome obſervations made may be ſomewhat incongruous to the popular ſentiment; however, I truſt they will be found conſiſtent with Truth and ſound Policy.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who write in favor of the reformation of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, generally ſuppoſed to be eſtabliſhed on the principles of Liberty, have many prejudices to encounter.—A jealouſy which pervades all ranks of Citizens, and which is the ſureſt evidence of their attachment to the principles of Freedom, makes them watch with vigilance the ſteps of a Reformer. And while this active ſpirit is alive in my Countrymen, I have the conſolation to hope that no Reformer, howover he may cloak himſelf under the ſpecious pretenſion to patriotic zeal, will ever meet the approbation of Virginians unleſs ſupported by Truth.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. ARTICLE 1ſt of the BILL of RIGHTS.</head>
               <p>"ALL men are by nature equally free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and have certain inherent rights of which when they enter into a ſtate of ſociety, they cannot by any compact, deprive or diveſt their poſterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the means of acquiring and poſſeſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and purſuing and obtaining happineſs and ſafety."</p>
               <p>This, my countrymen, was the language of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia aſſembled in full and free convention in 1776, —when the recent experience of arbitrary power awakened in every patriotic breaſt a determined oppoſition to Deſpotiſm,—when Americans had ſaid they would be FREE. How forcible the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion—how pointed the ſentiments this article contains!—It will ever reflect honor upon thoſe worthy patriots who compoſed it, and upon the people whoſe exertions in its ſupport proved their attachment to its principles—who under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſuch principles fought and bled ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully.</p>
               <p>Yes, "all men by nature are equally free and independent," and the hiſtory of mankind evinces
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047801_0004_10249769B258DEC8"/>that all diſtinctions, titles and enſigns of royalty have originated in the ſlavery of one party and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm of another. While the principles of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were well underſtood, mankind preſerved their freedom and independence. But when tyrants roſe up and would enſlave the world, they began by taking advantage of the ſuperſtition of the croud, by locking up the fountains of wiſdom and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the human mind with a veil of ignorance.— They knew the force of light and truth, and by degrees ſubſtituted in their place ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. They perſuaded to conqueſt and rapine, and introduced the cuſtom of rendering neighbouring nations, tributary. Soon after the cuſtom or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſlaves of the conquered obtained, and this was attended with the moſt pernicious effects. Accuſtomed to behold others in a ſtate of vaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the genuine principles of liberty began to be corrupted. Mankind ſoon doubted whether liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was eſſential to happineſs; and the poorer claſs often ſold themſelves. By the habit of aſſociating together, the ſervile ſpirit encreaſed. A few by degrees became poſſeſſed of greater power, which encreaſed as their wealth was augmented, till at length they ruled with deſpotic ſway. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ignorant and inattentive glided imperceptibly to the loweſt ſtate of vaſſalage, and not a trace of their former ſituation remained. Tyrants imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſecure, proceeded to more open and violent acts of deſpotiſm. Sometimes indeed a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et would ſing the loſt liberty of his countrymen, and in plaintive ſtrains bemoan their unhappy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047801_0005_1024976B3655AB00"/>but he was obliged to uſe figures and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, and couch his meaning under ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure repreſentations, as could be underſtood but by few, and were therefore totally uſeleſs to the generality of mankind.</p>
               <p>Here then we ſee the great importance of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diffuſion of knowledge, and the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of tolerating ſlavery in any country.</p>
               <p>Could any man have ſuppoſed the ſtate which had adopted this as the firſt article in her Bill of Rights, "all men are hy nature equally free and independent," ſhould not before this time have provided for the emancipation of ſlaves? That the ſtate which in the preamble to her conſtitution ſtates as an inſtance of royal miſrule, "prompting our Negroes to riſe up in arms againſt us, thoſe very Negroes whom by an inhuman uſe of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, he hath refuſed us permiſſion to exclude by law," ſhould have been nineteen years inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and yet paſſed no effectual act for the abolition of ſlavery? Is it material to ſtate in a bill of rights that all men by nature are equally free and independent, and yet ſhall one half of the community be continued in ſlavery? Have all men certain inherent rights, of which when they enter into a ſtate of ſociety they cannot deprive or diveſt their poſterity, and ſhall ſome be born ſlaves? Have all men a right to the enjoyment of life and liberty, the means of acquiring and poſſeſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and ſhall ſome be neither free, acquire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, nor poſſeſs it? Have all a right to be tried by an impartial jury of twelve men of their vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047801_0006_1024976D3381A370"/>and ſhall four juſtices of the peace conſtitute a court, to try and condemn one half of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity?—And is not this the ſituation of the ſlaves in Virginia? Her legiſlature ſuffers it to be ſo; yea they refuſe permiſſion to bring in a bill for emancipation: My Countrymen, let us not make a hypocritical declaration of a Bill of Rights.</p>
               <p>The advantages reſulting to Virginia from the emancipation of ſlaves may be eſtimated by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of her ſituation with that of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtates who have aboliſhed ſlavery.—I leave the reader to form his own concluſions by making the compariſon himſelf.</p>
               <p>The diſadvantages attendant on the toleration of ſlavery are numerous, obvious to every obſerver, and in every man's mouth. It is injurious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intereſt civil and religious, pernicious to the morals of the people, promotive of arrogance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, impatience and extravagance,—It impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhes the community, promotes diſtinctions odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable, deſtroys the prime of our ſoil, continues an expenſive and injurious trade, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the encouragement of manufactures, hinders our citizens from excelling in any of the uſeful arts of life, gives our country a rude uncouth appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, deprives us of the advantage of faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſe intereſt would be a ſpur to honeſty and diligence, and upon the whole, is the ruin and diſgrace of Virginia and her neighbouring South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern States.</p>
               <p>I am aware that this is not a popular ſubject, but I am equally convinced that if it is not ſoon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047801_0007_102497709E500E38"/>the language of our legiſlature we may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect greater calamities than we have yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.—How impolitic to have from their very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation an enemy in the heart of our country!— While they are ſlaves their ſervile condition will render them diſaffected to their rulers. Can the ſlaves of a deſpot love? They may FEAR, but never can they LOVE.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II. ART. 2d of the BILL of RIGHTS.</head>
               <p>"THAT all power is veſted in, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently derived from the people; that magiſtrates, are their truſtees and ſervants, and at all times amenable to them."</p>
               <p>Let us examine how far the Conſtitution cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with this article.—The 15th article of the Conſtitution ſtates and provides, That the Governor with the advice of the Privy Council ſhall appoint juſtices of the peace for the counties, and in caſe of vacancies or a neceſſity of encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their number hereafter, ſuch appointments to be made on the recommendation of the county courts—The clerks ſhall be appointed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective county courts—The ſheriffs and coroners ſhall be nominated by the reſpective county courts approved by the governor, with the advice of the privy council, and commiſſioned by the governor. The juſtices ſhall appoint conſtables, &amp;c. &amp;c.— Here then are juſtices appointed by a governor—
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047801_0008_10249773CD73C960"/>Does this correſpond with the 2d article of the bill of rights, which ſtates that all power is veſted in and derived from the people? The governor creates juſtices, the juſtices clerks, ſheriffs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, and new juſtices—Has this the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of keeping the legiſlative, executive, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary branches of government ſeparate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, as the 3d article of the conſtitution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides? (except that juſtices of the peace ſhall be eligible to either houſe of Aſſembly.)</p>
               <p>Here is a power created by a governor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to create itſelf—which, may make laws, for it may conſtitute a majority of the legiſlature—ſet upon the bench to determine upon theſe laws, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point its own clerk to record its deciſions, create its own ſheriff to ſerve its executions, its coroners &amp;c.—Is not this blending the three powers which ſhould be kept ſeperate and diſtinct?</p>
               <p>Of what uſe to ſay all power is derived from the people? Let us ſee what degree a magiſtrate on the County Court bench is removed from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1. The people elect the Aſſembly. 2. The Aſſembly the governor. 3. The governor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the firſt ſet of magiſtrates. 4. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate appoints his ſucceſſor, for recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſeldom refuſed—Thus in the 4th degree from the people we come to a juſtice of the peace— two degrees farther off than preſident of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States—now is this comportable with all power being derived from the people?—The very idea is ridiculous—Couſins in the fourth degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity but ſeldom claim kin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:047801_0009_1024977578212FB8"/>
Enquire what is the effect of this ſtrange med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley? You will be told a parcel of ignorant beings are placed on the bench who know little of law and it is to be feared often too little of the purport of their title; you will be told of lazy, ignorant drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken clerks, and bankrupt ſheriffs, as the ſaying is, like prieſt like people. You will be told of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates on the bench drunk, deciding contrary to reaſon, law and every principle of equity—Hence come appeals after appeals, and more iniquity and litigation than I can enumerate.</p>
               <p>But Says the Bill of Rights "magiſtrates are the truſtees and ſervants of the people, and at all times amenable to them."</p>
               <p>How are you to impeach a magiſtrate of the County Court? by the General Aſſembly; yes &amp; of that branch of government they may conſtitute the majority. How then is the matter likely to terminate? Boaſt then no longer of a Bill of Rights.</p>

               <p>Provides two repreſentatives for each counts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It has long been matter of complaint that the ſtate is unequally repreſented in conſequence of this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:047801_0011_1024977AC731E758"/>article of the conſtitution. Some counties are more than one-third larger than others, ſome have one-third ſewer, who are entitled to vote—But a ſmall county has the ſame number of repreſentatives— the ſmalleſt with the largeſt in the ſtate—100 free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders ſend as many delegates to the aſſembly as 500—and as the proportion of ſmaller counties is ſomething above that of the larger—one-third on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſtate may paſs a law, to which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining two-thirds may be oppoſed. So that a minority of the people may rule.</p>
               <p>This evil might be remedied, if the people would exerciſe their right to reviſe the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſtate might be divided into diſtricts, and each diſtrict might ſend one or two repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives according to the number of voters. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an equal repreſentation is matter of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and might eaſily be procured. I ſubmit the matter to my countrymen.</p>

Does it requite eight privy councillors and a governor, to prevent the importation of the ſmall-pox or yellow-fever? to iſſue a proclamation to make veſſels ſuſpected perform quarantine forty days, to pardon now and then a horſe-thief, to commiſſion a county ſurveyor, militia officer, &amp;c?</p>

               <p>Article 14th of the Conſtitution provides for the appointment of the court of Appeals.</p>
               <p>Now of this court there are five judges, while the General court at preſent conſiſts of ten—Suppoſe then, the preſent General court was made a court of Appeals? Would there not be a better chance for wiſdom among the ten? Perhaps ſome one might object that the appeals are carried from the diſtrict Courts, and this would be bringing the ſame cauſe before two at leaſt of the ſame judges—juſt as if I were to appeal from Dick to Richard.—This objection is eaſily obviated—Let the court of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals require ſeven judges, then any cauſe which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:047801_0013_102499DCA47BDFD0"/>might be brought in that court, from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſtrict might be tried by ſeven different judges —becauſe thoſe who preſided in that diſtrict and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe firſt, might retire if the whole ten judges were preſent, and have an odd judge to keep them company.</p>
               <p>But as ſome people are fond of putting difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the way—It might be aſked what would you do with caſes referred by the diſtrict Judges to the General court? The anſwer is equally obvious and reaſonable. Let this be the final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch caſes.—This would ſave a good deal of expenſe in the appeal buſineſs, and I doubt not but that the deciſion would be as ſtrictly legal.</p>
               <p>By diſcarding the preſent court of Appeals we ſhould ſave 5000 dollars, which if added to the 6667 before ſaved will amount to 11,687 dollars— a pretty round ſum; a peny ſaved and wiſdom gained is ſomething worth while. The people will think of the matter and form their opinions accordingly.</p>

Alas the Halcyon days of the drunken clergy are over! the ſixteen thouſand weight of tobacco, has fled with the remains of prieſtcraft beyond the Atlantic, where it was firſt provided.

               <p>AN act of Aſſembly (paſſed 17th of December 1792) makes it felony without benefit of clergy to ſteal any mare, horſe or gelding, foal or filley.</p>
               <p>The great Monteſquieu ſays Vol. 1. B. 13. Cha. 4th. P. 221—</p>
               <p>"Liberty is in its higheſt perfection, when cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal laws, derive each puniſhment, from the criminal nature of the crime. There are then no arbitrary deciſions; the puniſhment does not flow
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047801_0016_102499E2F1A6F7D0"/>from the capriciouſneſs of the legiſlator, but from the very nature of the thing; and man uſes no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to man." Every one will eaſily perceive that the above cited act of Aſſembly does not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with this principle of Monteſquiu—"That Liberty is favored by the nature and proportion of puniſhments." For it makes the lower ſpecies of crimes equal with the higher, and puniſhes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction the horſe theif and the murderer.</p>
               <p>The ſame writer ſpeaking of the power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſays, "Experience ſhews that in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries remarkable for the lenity of penal laws, the ſpirit of the inhabitants is as much affected by them, as in other countries by ſeverer puniſhments. The imagination grows accuſtomed to the one as well as the other."</p>
               <p>Again when there is a breach of ſecurity with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to property, there may be ſome reaſons for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting capital puniſhments. But it would perhaps be much better and more natural, that crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the ſecurity of property ſhould be puniſhed with the loſs of property; and this ought to be the caſe if men's fortunes were common or equal. But as thoſe who have none, are generally readieſt to attack the property of others, it has been found neceſſary inſtead of a pecuniary to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute corporal puniſhments. I join him in ſaying, that, what he has here advanced is extremely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to the liberty of the citizen, and is founded in nature. Experience alſo proves that corporal puniſhments of the leſſer degree, have a ſtronger tendency to prevent the commiſſion of theſe crimes
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:047801_0017_102499E5E9553128"/>than thoſe of a capital nature—In many places where the citizens of this common wealth have been infeſted with horſe thieves, though every exertion was made to bring them to juſtice, and ſome ſuffered death, others continued theſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices till the introduction of Lynch's law. The free exerciſe of this, though inconſiſtent with the principles of liberty, and often managed in too arbitrary a manner, has extirpated theſe peſts from neighbourhoods and rendered this property before uncertain, ſafe and ſecure. I would by no means be underſtood to recommend this mode of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure, but rather to inſiſt upon a fair and legal trial by the twelve jurors, and after full conviction of guilt, to uſe liberally the laſh and ſame length of confinement, or any puniſhment ſhort of death which may be deemed ſufficient.</p>
               <p>What ſome advance, viz. that a man who would ſteal a horſe can never afterwards make a good citizen, I am by no means willing to admit— There has been many a brave ſoldier whoſe back bore the laſting records of the Cat with nine tails —and there have been ſome inſtances of pardoned criminals becoming uſeful citizens.</p>
               <p>A man deſerves death, who has attempted or perpetrated the crime of murder. Life for life is conſiſtent with reaſon. In this caſe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death is the remedy as it were of a ſick ſociety. But ſurely, leſſer crimes call for, leſſer puniſhments. The loſs of a horſe can ruin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but few. But he who is deprived of life or liberty has loſt all that is dear and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</p>

               <p>An act paſſed the tenth of December, 1793, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides in the 22d clauſe—Where goods cannot be ſold for three-fourths of their value, the debtor may give bond and ſecurity for the payment of the debt in twelve months.

               <p>I ſhall only obſerve here (with Monteſquieu) great is the ſuperiority which one citizen has over another, by lending him money, which the latter borrows in order to ſpend, and of courſe has no longer in poſſeſſion. What muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if the laws of a republic, make a further addition to this ſervitude and ſubjection, or in other language this impriſonment and ſale of property at three-fourths of its value?

               <p>IT may not be improper here to ſuggeſt that the Conſtitution ſhould limit the wages of the members of Aſſembly. To leave the matter to their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is perhaps throwing a temptation in their way.

               <p>I think their conduct in this particular merits the diſapprobation of the people, not ſo much on account of the largeneſs of the addition as the precedent it eſtabliſhed. Their uſual wages had been ten ſhillings, there was then an implied contract that they ſhould ſerve the people at this price when they were elected, and though it might have been propoſed that the wages of the Aſſembly ſhould be raiſed from and after the expiration of that ſeſſion, it was highly improper that they ſhould give <hi>themſelves</hi> an additional ſum.</p>

               <p>IN the firſt part of theſe remarks, I was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily led to ſhew the inconſiſtency of tollerating ſlavery, when the bill of rights had declared all men by nature equally free and independent—I ſhall here reſume the ſubject and endeavor to illuſtrate the evil more clearly and if poſſible recommend a remedy.</p>
               <p>Monteſquieu,—ſpeaking of ſlavery ſays, "The ſtate of ſlavery is bad. It is neither uſeful to the maſter nor the ſlave; not to the ſlave, becauſe he can do nothing from a motive of virtue; not to the maſter becauſe by having too great an authority over his ſlaves, he inſenſibly accuſtoms himſelf to the want of all moral virtues, and from hence grows fierce, haſty, ſevere, choleric, voluptuous and cruel. In moderate (by which he means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican) ſtates, it is a point of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:047801_0020_102499ED82BECA10"/>that there ſhould not be a great number of ſlaves. The political Liberty of thoſe ſtates adds to the value of civil Liberty and he who is depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the latter is alſo deprived of the former. He ſees the happineſs of a ſociety of which, he is not ſo much as a member; he ſees the ſecurity of others fenced by laws himſelf without any protection. He ſees that his maſter has a ſoul which can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large itſelf, while his own is conſtrained to ſubmit to continual depreſſion. Nothing can more aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate a man to a beaſt, than living among free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men himſelf a ſlave. Such people as theſe are the natural enemies of the ſociety and their number muſt be dangerous." I grant you this is a ſevere repreſentation of the caſe; ſeveral acts have paſſed tending to mitigate the ſtate of ſlavery in Virginia. But ſtill I muſt adopt the language of Sterne,— But ſtill ſlavery howſo'eer diſguiſed, thou art a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter draught.' I have quoted enough to demonſtrate the evil—Let us aim at a remedy.</p>
               <p>Paley in his Moral Philoſophy has this remark —"The great revolution which has taken place in the Weſtern World may poſſibly conduce (and who knows but that it was deſigned?) to accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the fall of this abominable tyranny (alluding to ſlavery;) and now that this conteſt and the paſſions which attended it are no more, there may ſucceed perhaps a ſeaſon for reflecting—whether a legiſlature which had ſo long lent its aſſiſtance to the ſupport of an inſtitution replete with human miſery, was fit to be truſted with an empire, the moſt extenſive that ever obtained in any age, or quarter of the world."</p>

No doubt this excelent writer had a deep ſenſe of the evils introduced by ſlavery, and it was natural enough to ſuppoſe, that a people who had bravely reſiſted Britiſh Tyranny and eſtabliſhed their Independence, would have aboliſhed this inſtitution. And I would now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it will yet be the caſe.—Several efforts have been made and I doubt not would have been attended with ſucceſs, but for this great objection. The diſcharging of slaves from all obligation to obey their maſters, which would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a general emancipation, would have no better effect, than to let looſe one half of mankind upon the other. There is however one ſafe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſtill remaining. I mean a gradual emancipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carried on by proviſions of law and under the protection of civil government. In this way the Greek and Roman slavery was aboliſhed—by this method the Northern States have ſome of them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the deſirable purpoſe—and it is hoped by theſe means, this odious inſtitution will be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Virginia.</p>

               <p>That the government ſhould be reviſed is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all who think of the matter. That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have a right to do ſo, the bill of rights has very judiciously declared—and that the exerciſe of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:047801_0022_102499F1380EDC50"/>this right cannot be attended with any bad conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, I think that love of Liberty which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the breaſt of every real Virginian is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſecurity. To ſecure the happineſs of the people is the object which ſhould ever be kept in view. But that in many caſes under the preſent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this is not ſufficiently ſecured, many have been a long time convinced. The adminiſtration of juſtice under the preſent ſyſtem of County courts is a proof of this. The evils reſulting from the local ſituation of the county court magiſtrates, are ſerious and alarming.—However upright they may be, yet the power of prejudice often may lead them aſtray, for <hi>"humanum eſt errare."</hi> A particular acquaintance with the parties litigant, a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the caſe by one concerned, the loadſtone of conſanguinity, may incline the mind ſo far as to prevent an impartial deciſion. Indeed a good man man feel himſelf embarraſſed in a ſituation ſo very delicate.</p>
               <p>The ignorance of the magiſtrates muſt prevent, them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>Their being made eligible to either houſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and returning again to their judicial capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and perhaps in mediately to exerciſe the office of ſheriff, is allowing them priveleges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to temptations, which may be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dangerous conſequences. It is certainly
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:047801_0023_102499F31425E1F8"/>inconſiſtent with every principle of democracy.</p>
               <p>That they ſhould nominate ſheriffs and appoint clerks is by no means favorable to the liberty and ſecurity of the people.</p>
               <p>But as it is doing nothing to point out evils without aiming at a remedy, with much diffidence I preſume to offer one.</p>
               <p>To remedy the want of knowledge at preſent too apparent, let a law be paſſed or the conſtitution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that all judges of inferior courts ſhould paſs an examination touching their legal knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three judges of the ſuperior Courts, that they be appointed by the general Aſſembly upon their producing a certificate of their examination ſtating that they were acquainted with the laws of their country. That previous to their appointment they ſhould be recommended by a jury of their vicinage as perſons of good moral character.</p>
               <p>To remedy the evils reſulting from their local ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, let the ſtate be divided into twelve diſtricts or more if found neceſſary, and let them be ſtiled circuits.—Let one judge appointed in the manner already propoſed (or any other mode better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to anſwer the purpoſe) preſide in a diſtrict, ride to the different Courthouſes, ſit ſo many days twice or thrice a year, and be ſent to a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circuit every ſucceeding court.

Is not a plan of this nature more conſiſtent with that excellent principle of keeping the different branches of government ſeperate and diſtinct? Is it not more likely to enſure the impartial adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of juſtice?</p>
               <p>I am aware that if county courts are aboliſhed, there will remain much local buſineſs which ſhould not occupy the time of the circuit courts, for this purpoſe let magiſtrates be appointed or elected by the people to continue in office four or five years, or thoſe now in office be continued.

               <p>I HAVE attempted to make ſuch remarks as have occurred to my mind, to point out evils which appear to me to exiſt, and propoſe remedies which might tend to prevent them. If they are founded in reaſon and conſiſtent with civil and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical liberty, I truſt they will meet the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my fellow citizens.</p>
               <p>I beg leave here to ſubjoin a few more remarks of a general nature.—</p>
               <p>Political happineſs muſt reſult from political freedom—and every law which tends to preſerve the liberty and happineſs of the people ſhould be immediately adopted and regularly executed.</p>
               <p>

It is remarked generally by ſtrangers that the people in the Northern States, are in a much better ſituation, than the Virginians and their Southern neighbors. That they improve much more rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the knowledge of every uſeful art and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by theſe means become more independent and reſpectable. That there is ſurely a difference cannot be denied. Many cauſes conſpire to bring it about. Among theſe it may not be improper to mention, the defects too apparent in our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Laws—The toleration of ſlavery—and the extenſive ſcale on which we continue the Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co trade. To prove this laſt cauſe an evil, I ſolicit attention to the following particulars.—</p>
               <p>It muſt be the prime of our ſoil which is allotted to the culture of this plant. The conſequence is that our lands are cut and cleared up wherever the ſoil promiſes a flouriſhing crop. In good ſtrong land the beſt timber is generally found—But this is ſacrificed to the main object, and in profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate abundance committed to the flames. Hence ſo much of our land is rendered in a great meaſure uſeleſs.—Haſtily cut down—injudiciouſly tended, in a few years whole tracts (where the country is hilly) are ſwept into the vallies and covered with immenſe bodies of ſand, which it would require the work of ages to remove. From the waſte of timber comes the neceſſity of importing many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from foreign countries or neighboring ſtates, which as the ſaying is, coſt more than they come to; a ſaying ſo much in vogue as to need no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:047801_0027_102499FD697FA458"/>
The time and trouble expended in the culture of Tobacco is another object worthy notice.— Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter, prove little enough for the immenſe toil—Hence often it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that too little provender is made for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſtock—and it is no uncommon thing in travelling through Virginia in the months of February and March, to have the tender feelings of humanity tortured with the appearance of horſes, hogs and cattle, hardly able to creep upon the earth.—</p>
               <p>Picture to your imagination a valuable horſe, without fleſh on his bones, or ſkin on his back, after ſweating in the plough a whole ſummer,—no or without ſtrength to walk or ſkin to keep the yoke from his fleſh—But as the appearance of miſery even in the brute creation, is torturing to the generous mind, ſo is the deſcription,—Theſe are the fruits of Tobacco.</p>
               <p>Attend alſo to the price it bears when carried to market, if haply it be not refuſed.—From twenty-four to thirty ſhillings an hundred weight is a liberal calculation, and is this ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the direful drudgery? Let every one be his own judge.</p>
               <p>Will any man ſay, it becomes neceſſary, this alone will command caſh—and enable to pay taxes, &amp;c.—This is falſe reaſoning—The culture of Wheat would be far more profitable—There is no danger as ſome ſuppoſe of overſtocking the market. Rather the more Wheat we make, the better price we ſhall get. When other nations meet with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:047801_0028_102499FFA3773170"/>ſupply from the plenty in our markets—it will then be an object worth notice and our ports will be crouded with ſhips to carry it away.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be remarked, the extenſive culture of Tobacco is a heavy tax upon the people. It ſubjects them to the neceſſity of depending more upon foreign markets than home manufactures. And in proportion as a country is obliged to depend upon fereign inſtead of internal reſources, are they poorer and leſs independent.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there is no country more bleſſed as to air, ſoil produce, &amp;c. than Virginia—But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of impolitic management theſe bleſſings are but little improved. A hoſt of foreign merchants, take advantage of our imprudence, pour in their toys and fripperies and reduce our ſhort-ſighted citizens to a ſtate of debt and embarraſsment. My coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen cannot forget the immenſe ſums due Britiſh merchants and if they reflect but a moment, they will lament with me the ſlavery and difficulties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which many of our citizens, are at this moment laboring.—Picture to yourſelves the hundreds, who muſt part with houſe and home and every atom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> property to ſatisfy greedy creditors.—But all this has reſulted from depending on the Tobacco trade. Let this buſineſs be continued but a few years longer—Britiſh merchants have nothing more to do, but credit largely, by and by bring about a wardſhip themſelves to England and after Seven, Eight, or Ten years ſtruggle make a peace, upon condition, that all their debts ſhall be paid with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt—After a few years peace, they have only to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:047801_0029_10249A01262E4EA8"/>propoſe a Treaty of Amity, &amp;c. which American Senators will be found to adopt in conjunction with ſome wiſe Preſident, and ſaddle the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with inſolvencies.—But I truſt my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will at leaſt grow wiſe by experience. Make only half the Tobacco—try this a few years—I doubt not but the price will be double what it now is, and from the extenſive culture of wheat and a proper attention to manufactures our citizens in a tenfold better ſituation.</p>

               <p>ANOTHER remark founded in truth, is that Education does not flouriſh with the Virginians, in proportion to the advantages they enjoy. This is alſo owing in a great meaſure to the early habits we form of expecting our ſupport from Africans. Neceſſity is the mother of invention and humility the road to knowledge.</p>
               <p>There is a wide field open here for the exertions of our legiſlature—A much more commendable employment, than impoſing penalties on thoſe aſſiſting a poor Negro, who ſuppoſing himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to freedom appeals to courts of law and is unfortunately caſt. A few wholeſome regulations would ſoon place education upon a much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable footing.</p>
               <p>The eſtabliſhment of Colleges and Free-Schools in every diſtrict would tend to a more general dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſſion of knowledge, by rendering it more eaſy to obtain. This in a ſhort time would produce a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:047801_0030_10249A02A9EA1E28"/>viſible effect upon the temper and morals of the people. We ſhould ſoon have our houſes of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, filled with men of political deſcernment— and be no longer reduced to the neceſſity of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many who are totally uninformed.—Our courts of law would be ſupplied with men of legal infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and we ſhould no longer complain of the ignorance of county court magiſtrates.—Our bar would be graced with men of profound erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſcience of law and juriſprudence, inſtead of being peſtered with triſting Quibblers.— We ſhould have Phyſicians ſkilled in the nature of diſeaſes, the conſtruction of the human frame and the various medicines ſuited to the ſituation of the ſick in the room of pert Quacks, affecting a look of ſagacity to grace an enormous account. Our pulpits would be diſtinguiſhed by the abilities of divines ſkilled in the wiſdom of revelation, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of refuting the errors which abound—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of unmeaning declaimers beſet with narrow prejudice.</p>
               <p>It is in a republican government (ſays Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieu) that the whole power of education is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired—The laws of education in a republic ſhould have virtue as their object. This virtue may be defined the love of the laws and our country. As this love requires a conſtant preference of public to private intereſt, it is the ſource of all political virtues—for they are nothing more than this very preference itſelf. This love is particularly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Democracies. In theſe alone the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is intreſted to private citizens. Now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:047801_0031_10249A04DFBF4220"/>is like every thing elſe, to preſerve it we muſt love it. Has it ever been heard that Kings were not ſend of monarchy, or that deſpotic princes hated arbitrary power?</p>
               <p>Every thing therefore depends on eſtabliſhing this love in a republic; and to inſpire it ought to be the principal buſineſs of Education.</p>
               <p>Here then we may very juſtly infer the impolicy of importing teachers from foreign countries, whoſe minds are already formed upon the principles of Monarchy. But this has originated from the neceſſity of the caſe. Colleges and free ſchools under the protection of the legiſlature, and the foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering care of a ſound democratic conſtitution would be the only effectual preſervative againſt the evil.</p>
               <p>The want of a liberal and manly education will render us unable to perceive the value of liberty. It will alſo prevent the acquiſition of that dignity and authority of mind, which alone can make a ſucceſsful ſtand againſt the encroachments of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Ignorance is mean, and cannot offer theſe generous ſacrifices which our duty to our country demands, when its liberties are endangered. A mind deſtitute of a proper education, will be eaſily deluded by the ſophiſtical arguments of thoſe who, to ſerve ſelfiſh pupoſes, are ready to explain away every dear-bought privilege, with a view to make converts to doctrines detrimental to the rights of mankind. And with reſpect to thoſe, who are educated indeed, but educated in the manners and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:047801_0032_10249A07CDDEDF70"/>ſentiments of monarchical countries, their hearts are not <hi>American.</hi>

               <p>I SHALL now conclude the remarks, with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the great fundamental principles of political liberty and civil freedom are too little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by our preſent conſtitution and laws. And perhaps I am not far wrong when I aſſert, that at leaſt two thirds of thoſe who think at all about matters of government are of the ſame opinion.— The generality of our honeſt induſtrious citizens, ſeldom concern themſelves about political affairs. Engaged in the commendable employments of huſbandry and agriculture, and perſuaded they live in a land of liberty, they feel contented. Peace and Harmony, Friendſhip and hoſpitality are the natural conſequences, and I boaſt in adding the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of the citizens of Virginia.—Every good man will rejoice that this is the caſe and that the evils which may reſult from our preſent ſyſtem of government are not at this time ſenſibly experienced in a general degree.</p>
               <p>But all this is no argument againſt a reviſion of the government. For as in the human body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes lie ſometimes a long while dormant, and the mortal frame appear to enjoy health and vigour; yet at length they break out, and as water confined in limits overleaps the bounds and hurry this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tabernacle to the duſt—So it is with govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—Under the worſt of conſtitutions nations
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:047801_0033_10249A0A02B1BE38"/>ſometimes enjoy happineſs, till the daemon of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power aſcending the throne, plunge them into the depths of miſery and ſlavery. Then my countrymen, let us ſeize the occaſion which a ſtate of tranquility affords—delays are dangerous. And evils are always more eaſily cured, the earlier fit exertions, and proper remedies are applied.</p>
