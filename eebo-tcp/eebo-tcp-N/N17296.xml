            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ingenuous ſimplicity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends the doctrines and precepts of Jeſus Chriſt, forms a very pleaſing evidence of his deſign to reform the world. Should an impartial ſtranger conſider the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his religion at its moſt favorable periods, he could hardly imagine that it had ſo pure an origin; that the language of condeſcenſion, and the ſimple precepts of life, inſpired by an hope of immortality, could produce various and

contending ſects, who had loſt all affection for each other, had neglected the beſt virtues of life, and had built their hopes of glory on zeal and contention. Still the melancholy proofs of ſuch conduct have not prevented the belief, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more benevolent than the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jeſus Chriſt. Every thing kind flowed from his lips. He was born in humble life, and never roſe in his diſtinctions beyond what hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life could ſuggeſt and comprehend. Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was recommended in every diſcourſe; points never debated with paſſion; the hiſtory of his religion, ſo offenſive to his countrymen, intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in parables; and every idea of limited deſign excluded from his heart. Is it not time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the inſtructions of this wiſe friend of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to accept them uncorrupted by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, creeds or councils? Should a preacher appear in this aſſembly, of venerable piety, of ſimple manners, and with all the marks of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble birth, and declare, as the introduction to his religious ſervice, a zeal for the moſt important moral truths, and declare that by their fruits

men ſhould be known; and to our text ſhould he ſubjoin, Many will ſay to me, Lord, Lord, have we not prophecied in thy name, and in thy name done many wonderful works, and then I will profeſs to them, I never knew you; and ſhould he cloſe with the memorable words which repreſented only thoſe who obeyed his precepts as founded on a rock; could you ſuppoſe his deſign myſterious, or his doctrine partial, or illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral? Judge ye then of yourſelves, what is right.</p>
            <p>Let us then, in the conſideration of the text, endeavour to obtain the moſt obvious ſenſe of the ſeveral expreſſions, that we may be ſure of the general ſentiment they contain.</p>
            <p>What could he have intended, in ſaying, that many would ſay, Lord, Lord? The words ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, very fully explain the intention. He that doth the will of my Father, ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. And the pretenſions of ſuch perſons are cited in the next verſe, in which the exerciſe of even ſupernatural powers is conſidered as in itſelf unavailing. We have correſponding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022342_0006_0FB7ED7B761E6E60"/>
in Paul, who conſidered diſtinctly, all the evident endowments, of which the mind is capable, both miraculous and natural, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them inſufficient without charity, which he defined to be practical godlineſs, to deſerve the chriſtian character. They then, who cry, Lord, Lord, are they who do not obey the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, how far ſo ever they may go in pretentions of affection for it. Though they hold the firſt ranks, and the firſt gifts in the church; if they have the moſt commanding eloquence in deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering truth to others, or the moſt availing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſanctity, to gain them reſpect and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Yea, if God ſhould even ſupernaturally endue them for the moſt noble ends of his providence; yet, if they have not a right, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al temper, the whole ſhall not avail to place them among the meaneſt of thoſe who have been obedient. What a check this is to the preſumptuous, to the uncharitable, to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, and to the unfaithful! Heaven and happineſs were not deſigned by God as the excluſive rights of learned prieſts, or ingenious
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022342_0007_0FB7ED7F95E3BE98"/>
doctors; they are the end which God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for all mankind, and are therefore, by the ſame means, attainable by all men. Riches and honors cannot enſure the purchaſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can learning, pompous titles, reſpect nor dignity. Virtue alone is the moral happineſs of the world, and perſonal virtue alone ſecures heaven. Let then prieſts declaim, this is ſure, that the increaſe of virtue is the increaſe of happineſs; and whatever ſound may be made in this world, virtue alone will diſtinguiſh us in the next.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen how our religious advantages may render us happy, by rendering us virtuous, let us, in the next place, inquire, what Jeſus intended by doing the will of his Father. And he has ſo connected his diſcourſe, that whatever ſenſe may be applied to his words, in themſelves conſidered, they here admit only one explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When he announces his laſt bleſſing, it is upon thoſe who keep theſe ſayings and do them; and theſe ſayings or precepts are the will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022342_0008_0FB7ED810B6BC078"/>
of God. As no new ritual is propoſed, or doctrine which does not require action, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done, we may ſafely infer, that when he propounded his ſalvation to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, propoſed his own rewards, upon doing the will of God, he intended his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What the nature and extent of theſe commands were, he has determined by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding parts of his diſcourſe; ſo that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are offered to all who conformed to their conceptions of their moral obligations, and the foundation of his religion is placed in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For whatever conſiſted in belief, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic profeſſion, and zeal, they were ſuppoſed to perform, while the moſt important end of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was neglected.</p>
            <p>Such as were obedient, were of the kingdom of heaven. This expreſſion very frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, and never when it may not in ſome ſenſe apply to the hiſtory of Chriſtianity. By ſome it has been thought to denote the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a future ſtate, but never is ſo neceſſarily
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022342_0009_0FB7ED890AEEB4C0"/>
limited to this ſenſe, as to prevent its general deſign to repreſent the progreſs of Chriſtian truth in the world. When they, who do the will of God, are pronounced to be of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, it intends, that as to them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has its true and moſt acceptable effect: That the proper way to ſecure divine bleſſing, was to obey, to act moſt agreeably to our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and from the beſt motives reaſon or revelation could furniſh. This obedience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on our habitual inclination, connected with reaſonable purſuits after knowledge. The different capacities of men may admit degrees of virtue, but all are conſiſtent with religious integrity.</p>
            <p>From the ſentiment of the text, it is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that all men are, and always have been, capable of ſalvation. For if no external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or perſonal knowledge of a revelation, can avail, without an habitual diſpoſition to obedience, and this obedience is to be judged by its fruits, then this diſpoſition is preferred to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022342_0010_0FB7ED8ACDE357F8"/>
all thoſe advantages, in themſelves conſidered. And as the will of God implies the obligations of his creatures to all moral duties; ſo far as they are ſenſible of them, and conform, they do, in their meaſure, which is all that can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, perform his will, the end propoſed in the kingdom of God by Jeſus Chriſt. This is an obvious doctrine of Jeſus; and perhaps the reaſon why any have been taught to overlook it, has been, that it favors not thoſe comparative, if not excluſive advantages to which ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as it certainly does not their hopes, who cry, Lord, Lord, with affected devotion, and for their accompliſhments, real or pretended, would be thought better than others, without any juſt claims. When men can inform us of a more noble end in revelation, than to perfect the conſtitutions which God has given us, we may ſuſpect our argument; but when all the various opinions may accord with this end, in the judgments of their ſeveral advocates, we cannot be blamed for accepting the concluſion as free from their intricacies, or abſurdities, as is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022342_0011_0FB7ED8C7B80A2B0"/>
poſſible. For while objects and powers are ſo admirably connected in the whole ſyſtem, to make an abſtruſe religion, in order to introduce a diſtinction, which is internal; ſince the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive help attributed to the Chriſtian religion makes no outward diſtinction in the moral world, and the effects of the different motives may account for all we ſee, is to affront the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Chriſtian faith. But by placing religion in ſober action, we are able to ſee how all men are accountable for their reſpective ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and hereby we leave not God as a reſpecter of perſons, and prevent not the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſtribution of his favors. God, we all know, has variouſly beſtowed his gifts upon the human race; in equal variety he may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his moral as his other benefits; but as neither are in their relations unequal, and both may have a worthy end, there is no injuſtice with him. Without ſuch ſentiments, our moſt evident conceptions of juſtice may be violated.</p>
            <p>What evidence ſhould we conſider as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove this to be a doctrine of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022342_0012_0FB7ED931A8C7A70"/>
religion? At the critical moment when this truth was to be declared, ſhould an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, poſſeſſed of devout reſpect to heaven, and exemplary in his life, be declared acceptable to God, and revelation aſſiſt this true light with miraculous teſtimony, would it be concluſive? Can any evidence be better adapted? This we can produce, without any forced or critical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in poſitive terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peter was taught to call nothing unclean, becauſe the Jews thought other nations without the favor of God. Cornelius, a Roman officer in the province, was, for his devotion and alms, accepted of God. He was not proſelyted to the Jewiſh religion, becauſe Peter ſays, it was unlawful to keep company with him. Yet upon this evidence Peter exclaims, Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, for in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him. Nor was this truth queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the diſputes reſpecting the uſe of the Hebrew ritual. If evidence, in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, produces not conviction, arguments may be applied in vain. And what a generous
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022342_0013_0FB7ED94905E0870"/>
idea does this truth give us of God! He was the friend of Iſrael, that in the end he might advance a univerſal religion; but for a diſtant good, he never diſregarded a preſent benefit. He knew the capacity he had given, and the ſeveral means by which it might be improved. He knew the diſtance of our moſt pure concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from truth, in all its relations, and could eaſily pardon the little varieties in thoſe opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, which were, at beſt, imperfect. If he took care for ravens, how much more would he take care of mankind! How much more acceptable is the honeſt devotion of an heathen, than the hypocriſy of a Chriſtian! How much more pure the charity of a ſavage, than the pulpit-anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of a prieſt againſt churches which differ from his own. Bluſh, O Chriſtian, that thy il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal heart can call thy God to juſtify thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent attacks on other men, and fear leſt thy fate, more miſerable than their own, teach thee, with ſorrow, to renounce the execrable idea.</p>
            <p>And what may we infer more readily from this truth, than that the natural advantages of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022342_0014_0FB7ED96100549B0"/>
men conſtitute their only probation? Their gratitude is to ariſe from bleſſing they do really receive, their only devotion from the glory they behold, and their only obedience from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations they perceive. And do not our minds revolt, at the firſt reflection, on any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? Let miſery, in any degree, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the guilt of men, that they ſhould not riſe beyond the ſtrength of their powers in ſuch ſtate, is curſe enough. But to ſuperadd a gift which man has no natural power or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to accept, even when connected with his higheſt happineſs, is a policy unworthy the bounty of heaven. As revelation ſhews us the motives adapted to ſtrengthen and improve our virtue, will not God direct the natural powers to the beſt advantage, if he intends a bounty? Our moſt familiar ideas of goodneſs, eſpecially ſuch as the goſpel recommends, aſſure us of it, and we diſhonor God by any other ſuppoſition. We are all his offspring.</p>
            <p>We may alſo infer the original dignity of natural religion. For what good ends Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians

have ſhaken the foundations of their own religion, by depreciating natural religion, may not be eaſy to determine; but if the text is rightly explained, natural religion is ſtill the moſt excellent religion.

               </gap> inquiries may make it known to us, and our knowledge of its agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with our nature confirms us in our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it. Neither this law, nor its authority, is weakened by Chriſtianity; for as Chriſtianity has the ſame object, it can, at beſt, but claim to aſſiſt us in the knowledge, and confirm us in the practice of it. For to ſuppoſe an original law ſo defective in itſelf as not to be ſufficient to direct us, is to admit, at once, a defect in our conſtitution, which is as diſhonorable to God, as to charge him with changes in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other part of nature, becauſe his original laws were not ſufficient. Revelation cannot then be admitted but as a part of the original plan, or rather as ſuch a ſpring as may act in ſubſerviency to the original law, till a variety of cauſes, wiſely fitted to act, may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

this aſſiſtance unneceſſary. Chriſtianity is an help to recover the full force of natural law. The Son himſelf ſhall then be put under, and God, by perfecting human nature, be all in all.</p>
            <p>If this be true, there is not an abſolute, but only a relative difference in the condition of men. Natural law is always right, Chriſtianity will aſſiſt men to go right. There is nothing beyond our conceptions in this view of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. If God was pleaſed to conſtitute us for happy, natural action in the preſent being, and yet render us capable of future life, but not place the evidence of this future life ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in our natural condition as not to admit other evidence, we may not doubt of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and that he is able to make the evidence appear wiſe and fit. And when it concurs with natural religion, by our preſent good, to promote our final good, it may aſſiſt ſome, while it offers no injury to others; and as all things may be in a progreſſive ſtate, it may, at ſome future time, be as univerſal as natural religion

itſelf. But whatever our opinions of ſuch things may be, we ſhould be careful not ſo to frame them as to exclude natural law, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure one of our firſt and moſt noble ideas of perfection, an impartial regard to the capacities of creatures which God has created for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. However we may magnify our relative advantages, let us leave all men ſufficient for wiſe action; and if our juſt and exalted ideas of our own privileges do produce as juſt and exalted improvements, we are more ſure not to be found among thoſe boaſting profeſſors, who have ſaid much and done little, and may have our reward in ample glory for doing the will of God.</p>
            <p>The practical uſe of our text ſhould be, to teach us to place religion in thoſe things in which it really conſiſts. However numerous our doctrines, whether ſimple or myſterious; whether we receive all the dogmas of the Church or not, let us conſider that we ſhould produce good fruits. To have accurate and well defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022342_0018_0FB7EDA52BC9B780"/>
ſentiments, is not unworthy of our moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention. To be diſtinguiſhed, may be moſt laudable ambition. But let us not miſtake either of them for religion, without regard to our actions. All the orthodoxy in the world will not vindicate a diſhoneſt man. If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in ſupernatural gifts, and that we poſſeſs them, let us doubt our religion, if we allow ourſelves to violate juſtice, defame or injure other men. However God may produce his deſired regeneration in the mind, let it not have a viſionary, but an active operation, that we may ſhew, out of a good underſtanding, the works of meekneſs and love. But all the exerciſes of inſtrumental religion are not worth one good deed, and a diſhoneſt act is more than a balance for them all. We cannot be too careful to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt our virtue by the ſimple inſtitutions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; theſe ought to have been done, and not the other left undone; but we are guilty of heinous iniquity, if we make them a cloke to our vices. Let us then reflect on the various duties of external religion, which we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

with ſuch deception. How many ſolemn ſounds without ſober thought! how many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words and ill actions! how many attempts to deceive by aſſumed gravity! how many tears in vain! and let us learn to deſpiſe ſuch hypocriſy. Let the language of our counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances expreſs the cheerful devotion of our hearts. Let our gravity ariſe from a juſt ſenſe of religious truth, and all our actions have an undiſputed teſtimony to our ſincerity. The cries, and groans, and complaints of dangerous errors, diſturb the weak, the credulous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious. But the ſingle act of injuſtice ſpeaks louder to a diſcerning man than all this cant and hypocriſy. When a man is found, who does not profeſs much, nor deſpiſe all, who is pure from guile, peaceable in his life, gentle in his manners, eaſily diſſuaded from revenge, with an heart to pity and relieve the miſerable, impartial in his judgement, and without diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation, this is the man of religion. This is an apoſtolic deſcription of a good man; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opinions he may have, he ought to have ſome, and he has a right to chuſe for himſelf; this man is after God's own heart.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:022342_0020_0FB7EDA8D037DEE8"/>The candid ſentiment of the text demands alſo a practical effect. The opinions of men belong to God, and the conſciences of men are ſubject to no human tribunal. But wherever they have a virtuous effect, we ought in charity to ſuppoſe the favor of God. When the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homedan journies to Mecca, as his acts of ſelf-denial ſpring from his ſerious belief, we have no authority to determine in God's ſtead. But when we ſee his devotion, his zeal, and the acts of his unfeigned obedience, our affection ſhould teach us with what tenderneſs the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Parent views his creatures innocently err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him. And we ſhould diſmiſs all the partialities, which ariſe from our own particular connections. We ſhould be particularly kind to virtue, wherever we may behold it; and prefer, in this regard, the diſtant ſtranger, who practiſes it, to the child of our boſom, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects it. By conſidering religion in this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able view, we may increaſe our love for it, and be induced to conſider ourſelves, not of ſmall ſocieties only, under the formal obligations of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022342_0021_0FB7EDB0027F9278"/>
ſocial contracts, but as belonging to the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the faithful, who dwell in every nation, and in every clime, with one God and Father, who hateth nothing that he has made, but loveth and cheriſheth it.</p>
            <p>While we conſider religion in connection with the unnumbered ceremonies of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpread in ſtrange confuſion over the earth, we may be inclined to forget the reverence we owe to it, and deſpiſe the true excellence and glory of our nature. When we obſerve how often the various incidents of life tear aſunder the maſk, and expoſe the dreadful features con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed under it, we may be induced to curſe the religion which aſſiſted the diſguiſe. But when we familiariſe the reflection, that true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is true virtue, and that it is only ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition which lends the falſe appearance, we ſhall deteſt the impoſition, not more as an inſult to man, than to religion itſelf. And how happy ſhould we be, if we could attain that Chriſtian perfection, when we may love to appear what
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022342_0022_0FB7EDB1D23C7500"/>
we are, and yet deſerve the character of true Chriſtians. We cannot be too cautious. A form of prayer will eaſily paſs upon us as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. We may eaſily miſtake our gifts for divine fervor, and paſs on with our neighbours, and be as zealous as they, without the leaſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Our caution ſhould increaſe with our danger, and we ſhould remember, that our great obligation is to keep the heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſince from that alone are the iſſues of life.</p>
