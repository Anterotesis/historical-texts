            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN accurate and critical knowledge of law (ſuch as can only be acquired by much reading and long experience in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) is indeed a neceſſary qualification for thoſe perſons who undertake to deliver their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nicer and more difficult queſtions of juriſprudence, but when the Natural Rights of any of our fellow ſubjects are apparently at ſtake, every man has a right to judge for himſelf, and to declare his ſentiments, as far as plain concluſions of reaſon and common ſenſe will fairly warrant; and ſuch only are referred to in the following <hi>Declaration of the Natural Right of popular Repreſentation in the Legiſlature.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013613_0003_0F905BD7DA9AD250"/>
and being to be governed by ſuch laws as we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall chuſe, is the moſt fundamental and eſſential, as well as the moſt advantageous and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as all Britiſh ſubjects, whether in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Ireland, or the Colonies, are equally free by the Law of Nature, they certainly are equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the ſame Natural Rights that are eſſential for their own preſervation, becauſe this privilege of "having a ſhare in the legiſlation" is not merely a Britiſh Right, peculiar to this iſland, but it is alſo a Natural Right, which cannot, without the moſt flagrant and ſtimulating injuſtice, be withdrawn from any part of the Britiſh empire by any worldly authority whatſoever, becauſe, <q>by the Natural Law, whereunto he [Almighty God] hath made all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</q> ſays the learned Hooker<note n="(2)" place="bottom">Hooker's Eccleſiaſtical Polity, lib. 1, § 10, p. 87.</note>, <q>the lawful power of making laws, to command whole politic ſocieties of men, belongeth ſo properly unto the ſame entire ſocieties, that for any Prince or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, of what kind ſoever upon earth, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame of himſelf, [or themſelves,] and not either by expreſs commiſſion immediately and perſonally received from God, or elſe by authority derived at the firſt from their conſent upon whoſe perſons they impoſe laws, it is no better than mere tyranny!

It muſt indeed be acknowledged, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people of England is not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as equity may ſeem to require, ſince very many individuals have no vote in elections and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be ſaid expreſsly to give their aſſent to the laws by which they are governed. Nevertheleſs, the whole country which they inhabit, and in which they earn their bread, and even the very houſes in which they live (whether they are houſekeepers or lodgers) are repreſented<note n="(3)" place="bottom">I muſt beg leave to refer the reader alſo to ſome excellent obſervations on this head, in a pamphlet publiſhed ſince the above was written, entitled <hi>An Argument in Defence of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi> p. 76, 77, and 78.</note> by the votes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective proprietors, ſince every Freeholder has a right to vote; ſo that, in this one reſpect, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is general; and, though far from equal, would ſtill be a ſufficient check againſt arbitrary power; and afford ſufficient ſecurity for the lives and property of thoſe perſons who have no vote, if the laws againſt parliamentary corruption (and eſpecially that act of 7 and 8 Wil. III. c. 4.) were duly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; and alſo if all perſons, who are entruſted with the diſpoſal of public money, were required to render a ſtrict account of it, and to be ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed whenever convicted of exerting the influence of the public treaſury againſt public liberty, which is the moſt baneful treachery and diſhoneſty that men in office (who are the ſervants of the public as well as of the King) can poſſibly commit. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the inequality of the Engliſh repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the various means practiſed to corrupt it, yet it has been the principal inſtrument of preſerving amongſt us thoſe remains of natural Liberty which we ſtill enjoy in a greater proportion than moſt other kingdoms, and has occaſioned more examples of juſt retribution on <hi>Tyrants, Traitors,</hi> and <hi>Court

Favourites,</hi> in the Engliſh annals, than the hiſtory of any other nation affords; ſo that Mr. Rapin is thereby led to conclude his account of K. Richard II. (that notorious corrupter of parliaments, and enemy to the privileges of London and other corporations) with the following reflection: <q>That, in a government ſuch as that of England, all the efforts that the Sovereign makes to uſurp an abſolute authority, are ſo many ſteps which lead him towards the precipice.</q>

               </note> It is manifeſt, therefore, that the conſtitutional government of England, even with all its defects, is infinitely better than any other form of government whereby the people are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their juſt ſhare in the legiſlature;<note n="(5)" place="bottom">The celebrated Chancellor Forteſcue aſſerts, that a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited or politic government (like that of England) is infinitely more eligible, for the intereſt and ſatisfaction even of the Prince himſelf, than an abſolute regal power:—<q>Non jugum ſed libertas eſt politicè regere populum; ſecuritas quoque maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma nedum plebi, ſed et ipſi regi; allevatio etiam non mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſolicitudinis ſuae:</q>—<abbr>Viz.</abbr> 
                  <q>That to rule the people by government politic is no yoke, but liberty, and great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not only to the ſubjects, but alſo to the King himſelf; and further, no ſmall lightening or eaſement to his charge.</q> (De Laud.

So that thoſe politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who plead the neceſſity of ſecuring, at any rate, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in parliament, to vote implicitly for whatever the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propoſes, do miſerably betray the true intereſt and peace of their Sovereign! for this fixes upon the King and his miniſters (as in arbitrary governments) the blame and ignominy of every determination that happens to be wrong, which would otherwiſe either have been overruled by the free council of the nation, or elſe muſt have been equally imputed to the people themſelves; and yet this wretched policy has alternately been adopted by all parties, notwithſtanding that it is founded (like many of Machiavel's doctrines) on that abominable antichriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of mere worldly minded men,—"Let us do evil that good may come;"—"whoſe damnation (ſays the apoſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans) is juſt." Rom. iii. 8. The evil of an undue parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary influence they endeavour to excuſe by the plea of neceſſity for the good of the ſtate, though it is certainly the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant violation of the fundamental principles of the ſtate, and is abſolutely deſtructive of the true intereſt both of the prince and people!</note> ſo

that the inequality of Repreſentation in this iſland, affords no juſt argument for ſetting aſide the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the people in other parts of the Britiſh empire, becauſe experience teaches us, that even a defective Repreſentation is better than none at all; and therefore it is highly unreaſonable, and contrary to natural equity, to pretend that our brethren and fellow ſubjects in the more diſtant parts of the Britiſh empire ought to be deprived entirely of their natural Rights and Liberties, merely becauſe our own liberties are not entirely perfect! or becauſe our own repreſentation in the legiſlature appears, in ſome few reſpects, to be defective! and it would be quite as unreaſonable to alledge, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or reaſon of the maxim before quoted (<abbr>viz.</abbr> that law, to bind all, muſt be aſſented to by all) is unjuſt and inconcluſive, merely becauſe it would be very difficult to accompliſh it literally by the expreſs aſſent of every individual! but it is clearly ſufficient that the maxim be conſtrued to ſignify that delegated aſſent of the people by a majority of their legal repreſentatives, which is conſtitutionally neceſſary to make all laws binding;<note n="(6)" place="bottom">

If, therefore, King William, in the eye of the Law, be our King, we muſt in conſcience pay obedience to to him as ſuch. I take this (ſays he) for a certain truth, that as the law makes the King, ſo the ſame law extends, or limits, or tranſfers, our obedience and allegiance; and all oaths, impoſed by law, oblige the conſcience no farther than the law meant they ſhould oblige. Only this is always to be remembered, that whatever obedience the laws of the land require of us, it is to be underſtood with this proviſo, that it be not contradictory to the laws of God. But in that caſe we muſt obey paſſively, though we cannot obey actively; and with this tacit condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I do ſuppoſe, all oaths of fidelity in the world are given and taken.</q>

            <p>The true conſtitutional mode of connecting Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh dominions, that are otherwiſe ſeparated by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is demonſtrated by the eſtabliſhed example of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, which, by long experience, has proved to be ſufficiently effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. It muſt be acknowledged, indeed, that an act of Parliament was made in the 6th of George 1. chap. 5. wherein it is laid down, that <q>the King and Parliament of Great-Britain may make laws to bind Ireland.</q>
               <note n="(22)" place="bottom">
                  <p>If the preceding arguments are not ſufficient to prove in what light the ſaid Act is to be conſidered, yet the preſent diſtinct and ſeparate juriſdiction of the Iriſh Parliament, the continuation of their ancient and conſtitutional privileges, notwithſtanding the doctrine aſſerted in the ſaid Act, and their annual tranſactions, both in taxation and legiſlation, are facts which prove (better than arguments) that the people of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have an inherent right to enact laws independant of the Britiſh Parliament; otherwiſe the King's aſſent would not be ſufficient to render the ſaid laws valid and binding without the eſpecial approbation and conſent alſo of the Britiſh Parliament, which indeed is never required; ſo far is it from being neceſſary! And, farther, the inhabitants of Great-Britain would think it extremely unreaſonable and unjuſt, if the Parliament of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhould claim a right of making laws, with the King's aſſent, to bind any part of this iſland! The argument is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal; ſo that, if we ſhould really deteſt ſuch a meaſure againſt ourſelves, the law of laws forbids us to claim the like power over any of our fellow ſubjects, without their free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. "Non facias alteri quod tibi non vis fieri." This is laid down as one of the moſt common precepts of the law of reaſon, (Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 7.) and ſuch is the immutability of the law of reaſon, that againſt it there can be no preſcription, ſtatute, or cuſtom; and if any are made contrary thereto, they are not to be eſteemed ſtatutes or cuſtoms, but corruptelae, i. e. corruptions or depravities.—<q>Non ſunt ſtatuta five conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, ſed corruptelae.</q>
                     <bibl> Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 5. </bibl>To the ſame effect is that command of Chriſt himſelf (recorded in Matt. vii. 12.) which our Lord declared to be <q>the Law and the Prophets;</q> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <q>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets;</q> ſo that it may juſtly be entituled, the Law of Laws; and a ſtatute, therefore, which is contrary thereto, is doubly unlawful.</p>
                  <p>The ſeparate intereſts of the two kingdoms are ſufficiently reſtrained, with reſpect to each other, by our excellent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ſtate, which requires the aſſent of the people (that is of thoſe which are concerned reſpectively) to render any law valid and binding upon either nation; which the foregoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments demonſtrate; and I hope the ingenious and ſenſible author of the <hi>Argument in Defence of the Colonies</hi> (lately publiſhed) will acknowledge, that he has allowed too much, when he admits, in page 114, that <q>the whole kingdom of Ireland is bound by the acts of the ſupreme legiſlature,</q> &amp;c. which doctrine leads him afterwards to make a diſtinction between Taxation and Legiſlation.</p>
                  <p>And again, the two kingdoms are ſo firmly united by the bands of allegiance, to one head (or monarchy) of limited power, that their intereſts in all material external exigencies are thereby rendered mutual, as well as their internal intereſt, in the maintenance of natural and conſtitutional liberty, in each kingdom reſpectively, becauſe one of them cannot be deprived of this (as they are governed by the ſame head) without haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the deſtruction of the other. And this intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of mutual intereſt in the conſtitution of ſtate, and in the reciprocal enjoyment of the ſame reaſonable common law, whereby each kingdom enjoys an equality of privilege and natural freedom, renders the union of the two kingdoms more juſt and equitable, and, conſequently, more ſafe and durable than it could poſſibly have been made by any other means; and the inhabitants of both iſlands (though ſprung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by theſe means, acquired a certain mutual conſideration for each other, as fellow ſubjects, which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defenſive leagues; nor, perhaps, by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which divine providence has effected it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; this has firmly united the ſtrength of the two iſlands; whereby reciprocal ſuccour, in time of need, is inſured to both.</p>
