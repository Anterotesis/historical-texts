            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ONE of the moſt lively ſimilitudes under which the life of a Believer is expreſt and ſet forth, is that or a <hi>warfare,</hi> which is a life not of eaſe and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but attended with many hazzards, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and which every Chriſtian muſt endeavous <hi>to endure as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As a Souldier converſes with many dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and dwells as it were continually in the very Territories of Death, and the Grave; ſo the life of a Chriſtian is ſo full either of viſible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible difficulties, temptations, and dangerous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, with which he muſt enter the liſts, and is expoſed to encounter; as that he may be ſaid dayly to paſs the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and for to carry his <hi>Soul continually in his hand.</hi> The Devil the Captain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

and commander of the black Regiment of Hell, is reſtleſs in his attempts; like him (who whether conquered or did conquer) was never quiet: if ſo be either by himſelf or his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he may ſwallow us up, and utterly deſtroy us. The <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>men</hi> of it; ſome of theſe are the <hi>Militia</hi> and <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> of Satan, Enemies to the truth, and therefore continually oppoſing, both it, and its profeſſors: and as for the <hi>things</hi> of the world, the honours, pleaſures and profits of it, theſe have their ſnares, and ſtratagems. And as by the flatteries and allurements of theſe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would fain have overcome our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Captain Himſelf: So alſo by the ſame, would he fain over-come thoſe that are his followers, and who have liſted themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Captain. But beſides the many forreign, a Chriſtian hath many inbred and domeſtick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; <hi>We have enemies of our own houſe</hi>: there are not only the temptations of the Devil, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the world, which we have to conflict with; but there are alſo the <hi>luſts of the fleſh.</hi> The holieſt man that ever trode upon the face of the earth, (except the Son of Man, that Man Chriſt Jeſus, who was not a meer man, but the eternal Son of God, <hi>and God manifeſt in the fleſh</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him, that beſt of Men, that ever bleſt the earth with their reſidence upon it, have had fleſh luſting in them, unto ſin; and ſometimes leading them into Captivity, and making them <hi>bond ſlaves
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000816_0006_0FAA569670204060"/>
for a ſeaſon</hi>: and this enemy is more frequent &amp; conſtant in his aſſaults and bickerings, than a Chriſtians other enemies. If his forreign or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal enemies, do at any time ſtand ſtill, <hi>Sin,</hi> that treacherous inmate and curſed adverſary, will rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him any truce or reſpit at all. If there be a ceſſation (for a time) of the former, he can ſcarce paſs an hour without many fights and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages with the latter. As therefore a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier muſt not ſpare ſo much as one enemy, when he hath ſuch a command and commiſſion given him: ſo a Chriſtian muſt not ſpare ſo much as any one iniquity or luſt; his orders from his great Commander &amp; Lawgiver are ſo: but he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the ſuppreſſing, beating down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the ſame. And how ſtrong &amp; ſtrenuous the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was (who frequently ſpeaks of himſelf as a Souldier, not only as he was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel, but alſo as he was a Chriſtian: I ſay how ſtrong and ſtrenuous he was,) <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The Apoſtle have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the former part of the Chapter, been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his liberty in reference to <hi>Marriage</hi>; as alſo his requiring of <hi>Maintenance</hi> of them among whom he had been labouring in the work of the Miniſtry: and yet how he had abridg'd himſelf, &amp;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000816_0007_0FAA5698C91E88A0"/>
forborn to uſe the ſame, that ſo he might not be over-burden-ſome to them; nor hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and ſucceſs of the Goſpel among them: he doth in the latter part of the Chapter, particularly at the 24. <hi>v.</hi> endeavour to preſs his former diſcourſe, by telling them the difficulties of getting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and alſo the obligation they lay under to run in that race, and to contend in <hi>that warfare,</hi> that would bring them thereto. The method choſen by the Apoſtle to do this in, is borrowing an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſimilitude from ſome of thoſe <hi>Games</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> were wont to divert and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves in. There were ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Games</hi> celebrated, as the <hi>Pythean,</hi> the <hi>Neemean,</hi> the <hi>Olympick</hi> and the <hi>Iſthmean Games</hi>: the latter of which was moſt proper to <hi>Greece.</hi> And in which <hi>Games</hi> there were wont to be <hi>Running</hi> &amp; <hi>Wrestling,</hi> and <hi>Riding,</hi> and other feats of Activity; by which the Apoſtle doth indeavour to ſet forth the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>d by thoſe that would <hi>ſtrive</hi> and <hi>fight</hi> in, the way to Heaven. And that he might further prevail with them ſo to <hi>Run, as to win the prize,</hi> ſo to <hi>Fight the good fight, as to obtain the crown</hi>; he ſets before them the examples not only of other <hi>runners</hi> and <hi>wreſtlers,</hi> who were wont to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painfull, in dieting and ordering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before, and ſtraining and putting themſelves forth to the utmoſt in their race &amp; combat (tho' the crown and garland for which they ſtrove, was

mean and inconſiderable, (yea nothing) compar'd with that, which the Apoſtle with thoſe to whom he ſpake, laboured and contended for; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being a corruptible, the latter a crown that is incorruptible) I ſay, the Apoſtle doth not only ſet before them the examples of thoſe <hi>Gameſters,</hi> to preſs them to their duty. But he alſo propoſes to them his own example, telling them what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>did,</hi> and alſo would <hi>doe.</hi> Like the valiant Commander, who doth not ſay to his Souldiers (in an arduous and difficult encounter) <hi>Ite illuc, goe forth thither,</hi> as if they were to go forth upon Service, and he tarry behind in his Tent; but <hi>Venite huc, come ye hither, follow me, you ſhall go no further, than I will venture my own life.</hi> The Apoſtle knew full well, that thoſe that are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed &amp; uninclined to duty; if thoſe that dictate duty to them, and exhort them to the performance of it, are ſlothful &amp; negligent in duty themſelves, (I ſay) he knew full well, how that thoſe that are uninclined and indiſpos'd to duty, might be ready to alledge the old proverb, <hi>Phyſician, heal thy ſelf: Thou that teachest another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf.</hi> To anticipate therefore, &amp; prevent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of this nature, and to draw them to be active, induſtrious and very diligent in their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare, he tells them, he ran in the ſame Spiritual race with them, contended in the ſame Spiritual warfare, that he was their fellow Souldier; and gave them no other advice than he himſelf

            </p>
            <p>In the words of our Text, we have the Apoſtle aſſerting and declaring, how he fought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf, in his Spiritual warfare; and this the Apoſtle lays down,</p>

                  <p>Concluſion 1. <hi>Man naturally is in league and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Sin.</hi> As he came out of the hands of his Maker, he was in league &amp; correſpondence with him. Man was Gods friend: but ſince we have broke our league, and forfeited our correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with God; a quarrel is commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us: we have entred into a league and have kept up a correſpondence with Gods greateſt enemy; this amity and friendſhip, and the natural man is very near and intimate; it is got into every part of our Souls, it is become our near Neighbour, and we naturally love it as our ſelves; yea we are naturally under the dominion and power of ſin: Sin <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>reigns</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man; he is its ſlave and vaſſel: is as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, and it is a truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought into bondage.</hi> Then every natural man being daily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and maſtered by his luſts &amp; corruptions, he muſt needs be in ſervitude, ſlavery and bondage to them: nor needs there much adoe to overcome him; he is naturally willing to obey ſin, and ſo is a Servant of it, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Know you not that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and proclaims a War with it.</hi> We cannot give up our ſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and be faithful in his Service, unleſs we renounce the Service of Sin, and wage and maintain an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable War with that. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and this <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> are ſuch different maſters <hi>(Captains)</hi> as that it is impoſſible for a man to march under and ſerve them both. There muſt be a forſaking of the latter if we would cleave to the former. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity with God: and whoſoever will be a friend of the world, is an enemy of God.</hi> It is true of ſin and wordly luſts, that thoſe that are in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them are enemies of God and Chriſt; they wage War againſt Heaven, and bid open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>Well,</hi> but the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and Chriſt is enmity with ſin and worldly luſts; and whoſoever will be a friend of Chriſt, will be an enemy of ſin; he hath broke his league with it, and wages War againſt it: as when a league and Alliance between two Princes is broken, a War is wont to enſue and follow. If therefore indeed we have been brought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſerve him in the War againſt our Spiritual enemies, we have been brought to ſee ſin to be an enemy, and a treacherous one alſo. That which hath been wont to onſnare, and lead us Captive, and we have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000816_0014_0FAA569DFB52B8C8"/>
caſt off its Service, and are reſolved to live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Hoſtility with it.</p>
                  <p>Concluſion 3. <hi>As when a man liſts himſelf under the banner of Chriſt, he breaks his league and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with Sin, and proclaims a War with it; ſo he hath had a mortal wound given to the habit of it by the Spirit of God.</hi> When a man voluntarily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf to the Service of Chriſt, upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation &amp; call, (I ſay) when a man is brought effectually to anſwer that call; as he renounces his correſpondence with ſin, and enters upon a War with it; ſo, there is by the Spirit of God, a deadly blow given to the old man, our habit of ſin. However in a mans natural eſtate he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of ſin. Yet when Grace comes into a man, the Spirit of God which is ſtronger than that ſtrong man armed, comes upon him, overcomes him, and takes from him his armour wherein he truſted. Every one that doth indeed actually belong to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is freed from the reigning power and dominion of ſin: that is accompliſhed in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 14. <hi>That ſin hath not dominion over him: and ſin ſhall not reign in his mortal body, that he ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> The Spirit of God hath ſpoiled ſin of its power and dominion, and given it its Deaths wound. An unregenerate mans heart is Sins Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory: Sin is in ſuch a mans heart as in its Throne, before the Spirit comes, but when that comes, and by that the nature is changed and renewed;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000816_0015_0FAA569EBAB436A8"/>
Sin is caſt out of its Throne, and condemned to die.</p>
                  <p>Concluſion 4. <hi>Though a mortal wound be given by the Spirit of God to the habit of Sin, when a man Liſts himſelf under the banner of Christ, yet Sin is not then quite overcome and deſtroyed in a man</hi>: However Grace doth really ſubdue Sin, yet it does not wholly deſtroy Sin. Though it doth really purify a mans nature, yet in this life it doth not quite perfect his nature. A Chriſtian muſt not expect to experience a ſtate of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here in this life: No, that eſtate is reſerved till he comes to experience a ſtate of Glory. The beſt of men in this life have a double nature in them, as we may ſee of man in general, that he conſiſts of Body &amp; Soul; ſo we may ſay of every Godly Man (in a <hi>Theological</hi> ſenſe) that he hath both Fleſh and Spirit, Corruption as well as Grace. Though Sin be beat out of its ſtrong holds, yet it hath betaken it ſelf to its inward Caſtle, where it will remain and have a being in us, as long as we ſhall have a being here in this world. This <hi>Canaanite</hi> will dwell in the Land, nor can the Children of God drive it out of this City. God doth with us, in reſpect of Sin, (our inward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy) as the Pſalmiſt prayed againſt his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.11. <hi>Slay them not, ſcatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our Shield.</hi> Thus doth the Lord do in reſpect of Sin, and Corruption in his Saints here in this
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000816_0016_0FAA569F71195DD0"/>
World; thoſe enemies are brought down from that power and dignity, in which they were wont to be, but they are nor wholly ſlain. They are ſurrounded, are taken, arraigned, a Sentence of death is paſt upon them, and they are dead in Law, but yet they have their lives lengthened out for a ſeaſon during our bodily life, nor can we till the death of the Body, expect perfectly to be freed from the body of death. The wiſe man proclaims a Challenge to all the world, to enter the Liſts with him upon this account, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made mine heart clean?</hi> And though there may be ſome of man-kind, that may falſely and preſumptuouſly ſay that they have; yet none can truly and ſafely ſay that they have: <hi>For if we ſay we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us</hi>: 1 Joh. 1.8.</p>
                  <p>Concluſion 5. <hi>Sin not being thus quite overcome and deſtroyed; it follows that every man, who hath liſted himſelf under the banner of Chriſt, hath a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of principles in him, between which there can be no amity and friendſhip, but on the other hand a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual warring.</hi> The principles, Sin and Grace, Fleſh and Spirit are diametrically oppoſite one unto another, are the greateſt contraries in the whole world, as contrary as light and darkneſs, as life and death, as good and evil, as Heaven and Hell. And being ſo oppoſite and contrary, they cannot be dormant, and latitant in the Soul, but
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000816_0017_0FAA56A0577C5828"/>
muſt needs be up in armes, indeavouring to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and expell each other. Theſe two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are (as it were) the company of two armies, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.13. They lie intrencht and engaged one againſt the other. As long as a man keeps his league with ſin and ſerves that, he feels nothing at all of this: <hi>While the ſtrong man armed keeps the Palace, his goods are in peace.</hi> Luk. 11.21. As long as <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſubject to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and doth their drudgery, all is well, there's no ſtir; but when once they ſhake off that Servitude, and ſet out for <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they are purſued with all the forces and powers imaginable, to be brought back to their former bondage. Eſpecially therefore upon a mans firſt chuſing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the Captain of his Salvation, is this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett high; and not only then, but when we have made conſiderable proficiency, and have obtained much victory over Sin: Yea, thoſe that have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the higheſt Attainments are not free from this combat within, but like <hi>Rebekah,</hi> have twins, ſtruggling in their wombs; the Fleſh and the Spirit, like the twins in her womb, do war and ſtrive one with another. <hi>The law in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers wars against the law in the mind.</hi> Rom. 7.23. <hi>the fleſhly luſts war againſt the Soul.</hi> 1 Pet 2.11. and the Soul alſo wars againſt them. Gal. 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Flesh and thoſe two are contrary one to the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:000816_0018_0FAA56A34642C880"/>Concluſion 6. <hi>This keeping under the Body of Sin, and bringing it into ſubjection, conſiſts in ſuch a warring with Sin, as to endeavour its death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: and the ſubjecting all our faculties and members to the Service of God and Chriſt.</hi> We muſt endeavour the death and deſtruction of ſin in this ſenſe; there muſt be a <hi>Reſiſtance unto blood ſtriving against Sin,</hi> Heb. 11.4. Sin will have it pleas to be ſpared and ſaved alive, and we may be willing to deal gently with it, as <hi>David</hi> gave charge concerning <hi>Abſalom</hi>: this Priſoner of War will cry for quarter when the life of it is in danger, and will ſpeak us fair, and make ſeemingly great propoſitions. Some ſins will promiſe us profit and worldly gain, if we will not ſlay them; as thoſe ten men ſaid to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> Jer. 41.8. <hi>Slay us not, for we have treaſures in the field</hi>: Others will promiſe us promotions, and worldly honour, as <hi>Baalak</hi> ſaid to <hi>Balaam, Am I not able indeed to promote thee unto Honour</hi>: Others will promiſe us pleaſures and delights, if they may be ſpared and indulged: Others will plead they are little ones, and therefore will deſire they may eſcape: yea, and others will plead they are our Relations and our Kindred; fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones, and no man ever yet hated his own fleſh; but we muſt ſtop our ears againſt all their moſt curſed charmes, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do by every Sin, as <hi>Joab</hi> by <hi>Abſalom,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000816_0019_0FAA56A559D08928"/>
thruſt it through the heart.</hi> 2 Sam. 18.14. Both ſmall and great muſt be dealt with after this manner: The great ones, the Champions, the <hi>Goliahs,</hi> that come out of the Camp of theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, theſe <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> muſt be fought with and kill'd, and the little ones muſt be alſo daſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtones. This ſlaughter muſt be like that which <hi>Saul</hi> was commanded to effect againſt the <hi>Amalekites</hi>: 1 Sam. 15.3. all ſorts both young and old muſt be put to the Sword, and not ſo much as one <hi>Agag</hi> muſt be ſpared alive. And as there is in the duty we are ſpeaking of, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the death and deſtruction of Sin, ſo an endeavouring to ſubject all our faculties and members, to the Service of Chriſt: every thought we muſt endeavour to bring into obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 5. Our members, not only the parts of our Bodies, but the faculties of our Souls alſo, theſe muſt not be yielded as <hi>Inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto Sin: but yielded as inſtruments of righteouſneſs unto God,</hi> Rom. 6 13. <hi>we muſt not any longer live the reſt of our time, to the luſts of men but to the will of God,</hi> as it is expreſt, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.2. Our bodies, <hi>i. e.</hi> our whole man I conceive, a part is put for the whole man. Rom. 12.1. <hi>Our whole man muſt be preſented a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God</hi>: and when we do ſincerely endeavour this, <hi>viz.</hi> the death and deſtruction of Sin, and the improving the whole man for the Service of God; though in many things we may

fail, and ſometimes by our indwelling enemy, be put to the worſt, yet if this be our bent, inclination, ſincere deſire and endeavour, it will be accepted of God, and we ſhall be accounted by him, as ſuch as do keep under the Body of Sin, and bring it into ſubjection. And thus of the firſt thing propoſed to be ſpoken to; we paſs to the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhall endeavour to ſhew, how this keeping under the Body of Sin is neceſſary in order to the <hi>Fighting to purpoſe in the Spiritual War</hi>; and here, if we lay theſe two or three conſiderations together, it will ſufficiently appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Every one that fights to purpoſe in this Spiritual War, hath given up himſelf to Chriſt,</hi> he hath Listed himſelf under him, he is engaged to fight under his Command and Conduct; he is to march and follow him in the Spiritual Warfare. Chriſt is their Captain, and they are his Souldiers; <hi>God hath given Chriſt to be a witneſs to the people, a Leader and Commander to the people.</hi> Iſa, 55.4. A Leader to go before them as their Prince and Captain, and a Commander to give them Laws and Rules for their obedience. And every one that is indeed engaged in this Spiritual War, have Liſted themſelves under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to follow him as their Leader, and to obſerve his Laws and Rules as their great Commander, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000816_0021_0FAA56A68C2AEDE0"/>
are willing to follow him whitherſoever he goes, and to ſubſcribe all the Articles and Terms that he ſhall propoſe unto them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence every ſuch man is under the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to endeavour the keeping under the Body of Sin, and bringing it into ſubjection.</hi> This is the Command of Chriſt; yea this was the very end of the Death of Chriſt: rather than Sin ſhould not die, Chriſt himſelf became obedient unto Death. Now our very <hi>Baptiſm</hi> doth oblige us unto this, to fight againſt Sin to the very death of it. If that be <hi>Sacramentum Militare,</hi> then every one that hath taken that Oath, that hath received that <hi>Preſs Money,</hi> and yet is in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Sin, and doth not endeavour the death and deſtruction thereof, he is <hi>Proditor Militiae,</hi> a Flyer from his Colours, and Runs into the Enemies Camp. But when we grow up, and actually give up our ſelves unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if we are ſincere in our engaging our ſelves to Serve him; though we are not free from the aſſaults of Sin, yet we reſiſt it ſtedfaſtly; yea, we have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree mortified and ſubdued it; it is an inſeparable Character of thoſe that are Chriſts, Gal. 5.24. <hi>That they have Crucified the fleſh with the affections and lusts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Body of Sin if it be not kept under,

                  <p>This Enemy is always preſent with us, it incamps in us, round about us, and doth <hi>moſt eaſily beſet us,</hi> Heb. 12.1. It lies in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh behind, and in the midſt of all our lawful affairs and employments. Yea, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtarts out upon us, and ſurprizeth us in our beſt duties and performances; <hi>when we would do good this is preſent with us</hi> to impede and hinder us, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.21. It is adjacent and always at hand to oppoſe and hinder us in all our entercourſe and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with Heaven. So that unleſs we reſiſt ſtedfaſtly, and endeavour to bring it under, it will Captivate us, Impriſon us, and lay ſuch weights and ſetters upon us, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which we ſhall be utterly unable, <hi>to walk at liberty and ſeek Gods Precepts.</hi> Pſal. 119.45.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>A man is expoſed to all the aſſaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tan and other Enemies, as long as he doth not endeavour to keep under the Body of ſin, and bring it into ſubjection.</hi> In vain do we pretend to

maintain a War with Enemies abroad, if ſo be we are at peace with them at home; we lie open like a prey to our enemies without, if we do not ſee to it, that we keep under thoſe that are within. The wiſe man tells us, Prov. 25.28. <hi>That he that hath no rule over his own Spirit, is like a City that is broken down and without walls</hi>; That man whoſe Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> his paſſions and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly affections, been't kept under, and brought into order, that man is like <hi>Hazor,</hi> which had neither Gates, nor Bars to keep enemies out. <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.31. He lies open to all the aſſaults and temptations of the Devil and the World; innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the dangers &amp; miſchiefs that ſuch an one is expoſed to. And ſince Sin let alone doth ſo expoſe us; it concerns us to endeavour our own ſafety and ſecurity, to do what in us lies to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the danger, which by it we are obnoxious unto, and that by uſing all good means that it may be kept under, and ſubdued in us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>There can be no obtaining a Crown of Glory (which is the Reward through Grace of fighting to purpoſe in this Spiritual War) unleſs there be an endeavouring to keep under the Body of Sin, and bring it in ſubjection.</hi> Only thoſe will be found to have fought to purpoſe, who ſhall obtain the Crown. The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of Faith, lay hold of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life,</hi> get a good title to that, then do we
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000816_0024_0FAA56A8746B1CF8"/>
fight the good fight to purpoſe; and hence the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeaks concerning himſelf, 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And only thoſe ſhall have this Crown, as a gracious reward of their fighting the good fight, who have maintained a War with Sin, and have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the death and deſtruction of that, 'Tis moſt certain, there are but two ſorts of men in the world, there are no Neutrals, no middle ſtate: Every man is either under the Rule and Government of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe he is under the command of the Devil his greateſt enemy, he hath either Liſted himſelf under Chriſt's banner, or elſe he is a Souldier in the Devils Regiment. He therefore that willingly ſerves his luſts, and is in friendſhip with them; yea, that doth not endeavour the death and deſtruction of them, is an enemy to Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth his Service: and ſhall ſuch an one ever ſhare in the glorious Reward, which they have conferred upon them who are faithful? No, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the reward of a friend, ſuch an one ſhall have the puniſhment of an enemy. Luk. 19.27. <hi>Thoſe my Enemies that would not that I ſhould rule over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> This is all the Crown they ſhall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:000816_0025_0FAA56A93512E230"/>6. <hi>Thoſe that do not endeavour to keep under the Body of Sin, and bring it into ſubjection, ſhall moſt certainly periſh and be deſtroyed.</hi> If we do not endeavour to keep under our body of Sin, and bring it into ſubjection, it will in a ſence deſtroy us here in this world; for it not being ſubdued, will grow outragious and foil us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Angels and men: it will bring us into Scandals, and expoſe us to open ſhame. How many hath it ſerved thus, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belonged unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? when they have let ſin alone, and have diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the exerciſe of the Mortification of it: we may ſee it in <hi>David, Solomon</hi> and others: this enemy hath caſt down many wounded, yea many ſtrong men in this ſence have been ſlain by it. But that which is the dreadful conſequent and effect of not keeping under the body of ſin, and bringing it into ſubjection, is the perdition and deſtruction that it expoſes to in the world to come. This War with ſin, will terminate in nothing ſhort of the death of one of the parties engaged in it. If we are not the death of our Luſts and Corruptions, they will moſt certainly be the death of us, of our Souls: if we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by them, and brought into ſubjection to them, we ſhall have no other ſtipend and pay for our Service, but <hi>Death. Rom.</hi> 6.23. Out great Captain will not ſpare any man that ſpares any of his Sins. God hath appointed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000816_0026_0FAA56AA07339508"/>
Luſt to death, they are all men of death by his appointment; and whoſoever ſpares them, or lets them go, his life muſt go for theirs. As it was ſaid to him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.42. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go out of thine hand a man whom I appointed to utter deſtruction, therefore ſhall thy life go for his life</hi>: we muſt therefore vanquiſh by indeavouring the ſubjection of ſin, or elſe we ſhall be overcome by that, and muſt dye our ſelves. So that laying theſe things together, it is very evident and clear, <hi>that thoſe that would fight to purpoſe in this Spiritual War, muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep under and bring into ſubjection, all thoſe carnal lusts and affections, which they have warring in them.</hi> And thus of the two firſt things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed briefly to be touched upon: We come to the third and laſt, which is the</p>

                     <hi>Let every one that would fight to purpoſe in the Spiritual War, endeavour to keep under their Body of Sin, and bring it into ſubjection.</hi> If ſo be we had no Luſts warring in us and againſt us, there would be no need of ſuch an Exhortation; but ſince we have, a neceſſity lies upon us to ſuffer it and attend it, and Wo unto us if we don't. We read concerning <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>That
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000816_0027_0FAA56AAC5CB6DD0"/>
when he ſpied an Egyptian ſmiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren, he ſlew the Egyptian.</hi> There are if I may term them ſo, <hi>Egyptian</hi> Luſts within us, which ever and anon ſmite our Souls, which are nearer friends to us than a Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are our darlings, our all; when ever therefore we eſpy theſe cruel Taskmaſters, (they would be ſo) ſmiting our Spiritual part, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them, and endeavour to ſlay them. To animate and incourage us hereto, I ſhall lay down but two particulars, unto which I ſhall ſubjoyn two or three words by way of <hi>Direction,</hi> and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p>Motive. 1. <hi>This combate after a while, you may hope, will not be Irkſome and tedious, but pleaſant and delightful.</hi> Sinners that are overcome and led Captive by their Luſts, they count that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity their greateſt Satisfaction, and moſt pleaſant life, they like their Service, love their Maſter, and are unwilling to go out free; they think they muſt change <hi>Naomi</hi> for <hi>Marah,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when called upon hereto, are ready to ſay with the <hi>Olive-tree</hi> and <hi>Fig-tree, Judg.</hi> 9.9, 11. <hi>Should I leave my fatneſs, ſhould I forſake my ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good fruit</hi>? ſhould I leave the pleaſures that I enjoy in walking in the way of mine heart, and the ſight of my own eyes, to <hi>Mourn,</hi> to <hi>Faſt,</hi> to live a ſtrict life of <hi>Mortification</hi>? this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to comply with. <hi>Well,</hi> but give me
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000816_0028_0FAA56AB793AC990"/>
leave to tell you, as to this warfare, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a miſtake: You are not called to quit your pleaſures, only to change the objects of them, and that every way for your profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; to leave thoſe that are low and baſe for them that are high and noble, ſenſual delights, for ſpiritual delights, the ſatisfactions of Swine, for thoſe of Angels; and therefore if pleaſures and delights will charm you, or have any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon you, I will aſſure you, that here in this Warfare you may enjoy thoſe that are rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Heavenly, whereas as long as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſlaves to your Luſts, you may enjoy only thoſe that are baſe and filthy delights of a Beaſt, yea, of a Devil. Believe it, you will find one hour ſpent in prayer, mourning for ſin, and ſecret Communion with God, better than many ſpent in the ſervice of Sin; and thoſe luſts that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are wont to indulge themſelves in; ſo that though the beginning of this incountring the Body of Sin may be hard, it will be eaſy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while, and at length, very pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Motive. 2. <hi>The Victory is certain, and alſo moſt ſignal and glorious.</hi> This is that which encourages a Souldier to be Valiant, the hope of Victory; and this is the priviledge of the Chriſtian Souldier, that he ſhall moſt certainly have Victory. He is not left at uncertainty, to the chance of War, wherein the Victory in Battel, is not always to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000816_0029_0FAA56AC71510BB8"/>
the ſtrong: but a Chriſtian may know and be aſſured, that he ſhall overcome and obtain the Victory. The iſſue of the War is revealed, and made known to us by Chriſt in his word: as Sin, Satan, Death and Hell, could not conquer our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Captain himſelf ſo neither ſhall any of them be able to conquer his Souldiers. A Chriſtian may ſometimes be foiled, and ſeem to be beaten back, but yet he ſhall recover himſelf again; though he fall yet he ſhall riſe again: It may be ſaid of him, as of <hi>God, Gen.</hi> 49.19 <hi>Though a Troop may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, yet he ſhall overcome at laſt.</hi> And as this Victory is moſt certain, ſo it is moſt ſignal and glorious, the Victory it ſelf is moſt ſignal and glorious, and ſo is the Reward of it. The Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory it ſelf is ſo, it's a greater conqueſt than to be Conqueror of the World; for ſome that have been Conquerors of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have yet been taken Captives by their own luſts and affections, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. <hi>He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City</hi>: he that ruleth his Spirit is better and more victorious and more glorious. This is the nobleſt and moſt ſignal victory, &amp; the Reward alſo is moſt ſignal &amp; glorious, it being no leſs than a Crown, not of ſilver or gold, but of Eternal Life; if we through the grace and aſſiſtances of the Spirit, do kill and put to death the deeds of the Body, we ſhall live eternally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Let
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000816_0030_0FAA56AD7576AD10"/>
then the conſideration hereof incourage us to our Duty. For <hi>Direction</hi> take a few particulars briefly.</p>
                  <p>Direction 1. <hi>Begin with this enemy betimes</hi>; cruſh it in the firſt motions of it, it's eaſieſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming at the firſt. Warriors are wont to ſet upon their enemies, where they find them feebleſt; ſo we ſhould ſet upon ſin before it get head, and if we do, before it get too much hold upon our faculties, or break forth by outward acts, we may more eaſily ſubdue it, and hold it under, as a ſlave and vaſſal. Theſe Lions, we may more eaſily conquer and tame if we ſet upon them while they are Whelps, whereas if we let them grow up as in a little time they will, to be ſalvage beaſts, we ſhall find them very formidable, if not unconquerable. As ſoon therefore as we find this enemy to rebel, and to begin to War, let us riſe up in Arms againſt it, and endeavour by force of the ſame, to quell it and bring it into ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>Direction. 2. <hi>Hold no parley with this Enemy</hi>; it is ſo treacherous as that we had need awe our ſelves with a fear of being enſnared by it, and therefore muſt avoid all occaſions of it. Keep out of the way of its temptations. Its excellent advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. <hi>Enter not into the path of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000816_0031_0FAA56ADC0B3D328"/>
wicked, and go not in the way of evil men, avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away.</hi> This enemy will ſay to us as <hi>Jael</hi> to <hi>Siſera, Turn in, Turn in to me, fear not</hi>; but if we do hearken to its Sollicitations, it hath a <hi>Nail</hi> to ſtrike into our Temples, and be the death of us. It will take us as <hi>Joah</hi> did <hi>Abner</hi> by the beard, as if it would imbrace us; but if we take no heed, it will ſmite us under the <hi>fifth Rib,</hi> and ſhed out our bowels to the earth. It will come and kiſs us as <hi>Judas</hi> did our Saviour, when as with him, it hath been plotting nothing leſs than the betraying us into our enemies hand: we muſt therefore hold no parly with it, nor come any nearer than needs muſt to any of its quarters. Nor will it be caſt upon us in the day of Judgment, as a piece of Cowardiſe, thus to retreat from our enemy, but will be reckoned our greateſt valour and courage: It is the trueſt <hi>Magnanimity</hi> and moſt <hi>Heroick</hi> valour, in our Spiritual warfare, to be afraid of the leaſt iniquity, <hi>Happy is the man that thus feareth always.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Direction. 3. <hi>Cut off all the proviſions and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Sin</hi>; this is the Apoſtles advice, Rom. 13.14 <hi>To make no proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</hi> If we would ever ſubdue our Luſts, and be the death of them, we muſt cut off all the proviſion, which hath a tendency to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them and keep them alive. It is counted
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000816_0032_0FAA56B007E01148"/>
excellent policy in War, to leave as little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion as may be in the Enemies way. It's beſt to burn it, and deſtroy it, though it be in our own Country, if otherwiſe, it will have a tendency to relieve and ſupport our enemies. Thus muſt we endeavour to weaken the force of Sin, even this way; we muſt ſet a guard over our affections, and inferiour appetites; lay every thing under bonds, that we are in ſuſpicion, will take part with the enemy: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the utter conſumption of whatſoever would be like proviſion to our Luſts, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them and keep them alive. We muſt endeavour to ſtarve our Luſts, and if we afford them no ſuſtenance, but endeavour to deprive them of every thing or that nature, we may hope that they cannot hold out long, but muſt ſurrender, and acknowledge themſelves conquered.</p>
                  <p>Direction 4. <hi>Improve all the weapons that the Chriſtian Armour will afford you.</hi> This armour conſiſts of ſeveral pieces. We have a liſt of them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13, 14. And we muſt not content our ſelves with one or two pieces of this armour, but we muſt <hi>put on the whole armour of God.</hi> Eſpecially of all the pieces of armour; we muſt ſee to it, not to forget the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the word of God; of this Sword, we may truly ſay as <hi>David</hi> did of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000816_0033_0FAA56B138CCC968"/>
                     <hi>Goliahs, there's none like it.</hi> It is a two edged Sword, to cut the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Sinews</hi> of Sin aſunder. And <hi>Pray always</hi>: this is not only a part of our Chriſtian armour, but it is that which helps us, by which we are inabled to make a right improvement of all the reſt: this is neceſſary all along through the whole of our encounter with the body of ſin. We muſt therefore endeavour to manage this <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing,</hi> we muſt be continually lifting up our hearts and eyes to God; and when ever an army of Temptations doth aſſault us, ſay with <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> 2 Chorn. 20.12. <hi>O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our God we have no might againſt this great Company that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are unto thee.</hi> This is the way to fetch Chriſt into the field, and battel, for our help, and then we may be ſure of defence and protection, yea, of Victory and Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Direction 5. <hi>In the Combat with Sin, aim principally at the General of thoſe Enemies</hi>: I mean your beloved darling Iniquity; plant your main Artilery againſt that, thats the <hi>Goliah</hi> of theſe <hi>Philiſtins</hi>; a mans darling Sin is a captain ſin: that bears the authority in the Soul, and his other ſins are under it as Souldiers; it ſaving to one, <hi>Go, and it gos,</hi> and to another, <hi>Come, and it comes</hi>; a mans other Sins are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient unto this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is the ſin that is ſo
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000816_0034_0FAA56B2773F3428"/>
much tended and waited on. Now if we would keep under thoſe enemies and bring them into ſubjection, we muſt endeavour primarily and principally to deſtroy this principal of them; as it was ſaid to them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.31. <hi>Fight neither with ſmall nor great, ſave only with the King of Iſrael.</hi> So ſay I, fight neither againſt ſmall nor great Sins comparatively, but againſt this kingly, this maſter enemy; bind this ſtrong man, and you will eaſily take the houſe. Slay but this Champion, and the reſt will flee, as we read of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.51. <hi>When they ſaw that their Champion was dead, they fled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Direction 6. <hi>When you think you have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Victory or Conqueſt over Sin, take heed of Security.</hi> Though the Enemy may be quiet, yet fear leaſt he ſhould not be quite routed; therefore be always upon your watch, ready to withſtand a freſh aſſault: Let every day be a day for the training and exerciſing of all your graces; have them always in Battel array: See that they be continually in a Military poſture, and ſet an exact guard upon your hearts, that ſo when ever your affections move or ſtir unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably or diſorderly, they may be made to ſtand, not let to paſs, till we know from whence they come, and whither they tend; did we do ſo, in what excellent order might we have, and keep our Souls?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:000816_0035_0FAA56B3094ED3E8"/>Direction 7. <hi>Do what you do in this Combate, not in your own, but in the ſtrength of your Great Commander.</hi> If ever we would ſtorm and beat down the ſtrong holds that are within us, it muſt be by the concurrence of Divine Grace; <hi>the Weapons of our warfare are mighty through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. we come to be <hi>more than conquerors through him that loved us, Rom.</hi> 8.37. This Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will fling us down as faſt as we can riſe, if we encounter it in our own ſtrength; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would beat it down, we muſt ſay when we Encounter it, as <hi>David</hi> to the <hi>Philiſtin,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.45. <hi>I come unto thee in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael, whom thou haſt defied. Aſa,</hi> when he had a vaſt Army of Two Hundred and Fourſcore Thouſand, Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men of Valour, to fight with the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> he prays and truſts to God as if he had not one man. 2 Chron. 15.11. <hi>Help us O Lord our God, for we Reſt on thee, and in thy Name do we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this multitude.</hi> So muſt we ſay when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with Sin, Help us O Lord our God, for we have no power againſt the ſame, but do reſt on thee; God is able to make us ſtand againſt Sin; <hi>Through him we may do valiantly</hi>: Pſal. 60.12. <hi>he is the Lord, ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battel,</hi> Pſal. 24.8. Though the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may ſorely grieve us, and ſhoot at us, yet
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000816_0036_0FAA56B3DB139460"/>
he can make our Bow to abide in ſtrength, and the arms of our hands may be made ſtrong by the Hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Direction 8. <hi>In the ſtrength of your great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, endeavour to perſevere and hold out to the end.</hi> The Crown is at the end of the Warfare, it is not wont to be given till the Victory is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the promiſe is not to him that begins, but to him that overcomes. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt our great Captain, went forth conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to conquer; and however we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be his Souldiers, yet we ſhall never obtain the Crown, unleſs we endeavour in our meaſure to imitate him in this regard. O then let us all endeavour to be faithful to the death, that ſo we may receive the Crown of life; and it is but a little while, that we have thus to engage and combate with ſin <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> if we are faithful in the Service, and hold out, e're long we ſhall have done fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhall come to triumphing; We ſhall put off our armour, and put on a victorious Crown. The Great Lord of Hoſts, under whoſe Banner we fight, within a little time will remove our Quarters, he will draw us off from the Army Militant, here upon earth, to the bleſſed and triumphant in Heaven.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000816_0037_0FAA56B4779BC760"/>
Then we ſhall be out of Gun ſhot, ſhall never be any more annoyed, moleſted, or diſturbed with the body of ſin, but ſhall be perfectly freed from it, made perfect in Holineſs, and ſhall for ever be giving thanks and ſinging the praiſes of that God, <hi>who giveth as the Victory, through our LORD JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Amen.</hi>
