         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFATORY DEDICATION. TO LORD HAWKE, BARON TOWTON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN an aera when ambition—diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—and hypocritic gentleneſs of manners are profeſſedly the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of the moſt diſtinguiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;—when the external graces are more coveted, and more aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cultivated, than the virtues of the heart:—In an aera, my Lord, when many authors, and ſome the
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:024121_0003_0FC3BCE65A52BD30"/>
moſt eminent, labour to promote the firſt—increaſe the ſecond—heighten the poliſh of the third—and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute their pens, as if determined to extinguiſh the laſt, by every art of falſe reaſoning, by every invention of imagination; it may appear ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that this little volume, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly militating againſt theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of the great world, and attempting to ſupply their places by qualities built on the more ſolid ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of religion and morality, ſhould aſk for patronage from one whom fate has ordained to move in that elevated ſphere: but, my Lord, even in courts the moſt notorious for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy of manners, virtue has ever found ſome votaries.</p>
            <p>The corruptions of vice become conſequential in proportion as they become faſhionable; and folly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the air of ornamental grace, and diffuſes itſelf almoſt univerſally,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:024121_0004_0FC3BCE7CB579080"/>
only when cheriſhed and ſupported by thoſe whom the little world look up to in the ſuperior walks of life, and conſider as an example of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>From hence we find the advocates for error perpetually multiplying, and the clear fountain of true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs exchanged for the turbid ſtream of unprofitable pleaſure.— For it is certain, real felicity cannot be obtained but by a firm adherence to virtue, and a determined confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to its dictates.—The glare of vice may, for a while, dazzle the ſight; but it cheers not the ſoul, or makes glad the heart from the purity of its luſtre: like an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> it leads us into perplexities— doubts— and misfortunes, and there leaves us to ſtruggle with the calamities it has enticed us to purſue.</p>
            <p>The intent, therefore, of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſheets, is, to give a reliſh for
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:024121_0005_0FC3BCE96764AFB0"/>
the religious and moral duties; that the veil under which vice approaches the young and inexperienced may be thrown aſide; and its allurements, too often fatally ſucceſsful, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and evidently diſcovered as the harpies of miſchief, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The intent is, by gentle means to lead the negligent and incautious into the path of rectitude,—implant in their boſoms the love of truth,— and from the richneſs of the manure and fertility of the ſoil make the young plant ſhoot up with vigour, and bring forth the pleaſant fruit of goodneſs in abundance and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The intent is, I will not ſay to make every man the builder of his own fortune, but I will ſay more, the eſtabliſher of his own peace;—a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing infinitely more valuable than fame—riches—or power. For, if he
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:024121_0006_0FC3BCEAD5751290"/>
inculcates the maxims herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he will paſs through the buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the buſy world, though ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the ſnares of villainy, and machinations of treachery, in ſafety and without reproach:—and, when he retires into the ſequeſtered and ſolitary ſcene, he will provide for himſelf a rich repaſt, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection will feed on the conſolatory comfort of ſelf-approbation, and his hours paſs away in the ſweetneſs of content:—He will view the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of mankind with an eye of pity, and afford them relief:—He will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the pleaſures of his neighbours with a ſmile of ſympathy, and enjoy them as his own:—He will pay every tribute due to his Creator with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and joy, and will hold converſe with the God of his worſhip, from the incorruptibility of his heart, and the purity of his actions.</p>
            <p>From your Lordſhip's well-known
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:024121_0007_0FC3BCEC5E5ADFC0"/>
love of the ſocial virtues,—from that philanthropy with which your boſom is replete,—from the riſing progeny of little innocents with which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has bleſſed you, it cannot be doubted but every effort intended to produce theſe effects will meet with your countenance and protection.— On theſe conſiderations, therefore, I have ventured to dedicate this ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Lordſhip, flattering my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the liberty will not be offenſive, as the motive originated from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and laudable zeal, and the deſire of ſhewing the gratitude and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with which I am,</p>

               <p>THIS has ever been allowed a happineſs peculiar to the female ſex, particularly on ſubjects wherein they are in ſome degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant; for their imaginations generally keep pace with the narration, that they anticipate its end, and are ready to deliver their ſentiments on it as ſoon as it is finiſhed, while ſome of the male hearers, whoſe minds were buried in ſettling the propriety, comparing the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and examining the conſiſtencies of what was ſaid, are obliged to pauſe and diſcriminate before they think of anſwering.</p>
               <p>Indeed, a man of reflection, if he does not keep an intimate commerce with the world, will be ſometimes ſo entangled in the intricacies of intenſe thought, that he will have the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

               <p>It is eaſier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happineſs than truth in it. But, a young lady's vanity ſhould not be too much elated with this falſe applauſe, which is given, not to her merit, but her ſex: ſhe has not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps gained a victory, though ſhe may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a triumph; and it ſhould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her ſtrength, but her weakneſs. It is worth while to diſcriminate between the applauſe, which is given from the complaiſance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</p>

               <p>IGNORANCE of what is good or evil ſhould correct Anxiety about worldly ſucceſs. As raſhneſs is the vice of youth, the oppoſite extreme of immoderate care is the vice of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing years; but, ſince attention is ſo often fruſtrated, it ſhould never be allowed to deprive us of tranquillity; that degree of uncertainty, therefore, ought to render us temperate in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, calm the perturbation of hope and fear, and cure the pain of anxiety.</p>
               <p>Anxiety is the poiſon of human life. It is the parent of many ſins, and of more miſeries. In a world where every thing is ſo doubtful— where we may ſucceed in our wiſh, and be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable—where we may be diſappointed, and be bleſs'd in the diſappointment; what means a reſtleſs ſtir and commotion of the mind? Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude cannot alter the courſe, or unravel the intricacy of human events—Curioſity cannot
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024121_0017_0FC3BD0C8B3D3668"/>
pierce through the cloud which the Supreme Being hath made impenetrable to the human eye—Wiſdom commands man to retire after he has done all that was incumbent on him, and to poſſeſs his mind in peace. By going beyond this point, by giving himſelf up to immoderate concern about unknown events, he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to advance this ſucceſs, and does much to ruin his peace;—he plants within his breaſt the thorn which is long to gall him—To the vanity of life he adds vexation of ſpirit, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own creation, not of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>For the dubious goods of this world were never deſigned by God to raiſe ſuch eager at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. They were given to man for his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional refreſhment, not for his chief felicity: by ſetting an exceſſive value upon objects which were intended only for his ſecondary regard, he changes their nature. Seeking more ſatisfaction from them than they are able to afford, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives leſs than they might give; from a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken care to ſecure his happineſs, he brings upon himſelf certain miſery.</p>

               <head>AVARICE.</head>
               <p>ONE of the vices of old age, which appears the moſt unaccountable, is that covetous attachment to worldly intereſt with which it is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024121_0020_0FC3BD170883C388"/>
often charged. But this too can naturally be deduced from the ſenſe of its feebleneſs and decay.</p>
               <p>In proportion as the vigour both of body and mind declines, timidity may be expected to increaſe. With anxious and fearful eye, the aged look forward to the evils which threaten them, and to the changes which may befal. Hence, are they apt to overvalue riches, as the inſtruments of their defence againſt theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and as the moſt certain means of ſecuring them againſt ſolitude and diſreſpect.</p>
               <p>But, though this cautious frugality may be juſtified, ſordid avarice can by no means be excuſed. They ſhould be charitable and do good. They ſhould mix beneficence to their friends, with a cheerful enjoyment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which befit their ſtate. They will then receive the returns of real reſpect and love. Otherways, by their riches, they procure no more than pretended demonſtrations of regard; while their ill judged parſimony occaſions many ſecret wiſhes for their death.</p>
               <p>Chilled by the hand of time the heart loſes that tender ſenſibility, with which it once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the concerns and ſorrows of others. However, as in every period of life, humanity and friendſhip contribute to happineſs, it is both our duty and intereſt to cheriſh the remains of the kind affections, nor ſuffer them to be blunted
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024121_0021_0FC3BD1855E531B0"/>
or deſtroyed by ſordid avarice. We ſhould not, from having ſuffered much in the courſe of our long pilgrimage, become callous to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others. But, remembering we ſtill are men, ſtudy to keep our heart open to the ſenſe of human woe</p>
               <p>Practiſed in the ways of men, we are apt to be ſuſpicious of deſign and fraud; for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſtruſt of mankind too often go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We ſhould not however ſuffer that wary caution, which is the fruit of experience, to dwindle into craft; for amidſt the falſehoods of men, integrity is the beſt defence—he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to the end to walk uprightly, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to walk ſurely.</p>

               <p>AWE is the firſt ſentiment which ariſes in the ſoul at the view of greatneſs. But in the heart of a devout man, it is a ſolemn and elevating, not a dejected emotion; for he glows, rather than trembles, in the divine preſence. It is not the ſuperſtitious dread of unknown power, but the homage yielded by the heart to him, who is at once the greateſt and beſt of beings.</p>
               <p>Omnipotence, viewed alone, would be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable object. But, conſidered in conjunction

               <head>BEHAVIOUR.</head>
               <p>ONE of the chief beauties in a female cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is that modeſt reſerve, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring delicacy which avoids the public eye, and is diſconcerted even at the gaze of admiration. For when a girl ceaſes to bluſh, ſhe has loſt the moſt powerful charm of beauty. That extreme ſenſibility, which it indicates, is peculiarly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging.</p>
               <p>Silence in company, particularly a large one, is never miſtaken by the judicious and diſcerning for dulneſs, but beſpeaks a modeſty eſſential in the female ſex. Dignity of behaviour is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at public places, but care muſt be taken not to miſtake that for that confident eaſe, that unabaſhed countenance which ſeems to ſet the company at defiance.</p>
               <p>Women ſhould be cautious even in diſplaying their good ſenſe. It is often thought aſſuming a ſuperiority over the reſt of the company; but their learning ſhould be kept a profound ſecret, eſpecially from men, who generally look with a jealous and malign eye on a woman of great parts, and a cultivated underſtanding.</p>

in making the company pleaſed with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Detraction ſhould be avoided, eſpecially amongſt women where their own ſex is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it would be more noble for them to ſhew a compaſſionate ſympathy to the unfortunate, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe who are rendered ſo by the villainy of men. It is a laudable pride, as well as ſecret pleaſure, which ought to be indulged, in being the friend and refuge of the unhappy, but without the vanity of ſhewing it.</p>
               <p>Every ſpecies of indelicacy in converſation ſhould be conſidered as ſhameful and highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting. A ſacred regard ſhould ever be had to truth, for lying is a mean and deſpicable vice; though a lively embelliſhment of a humorous ſtory, which is only intended to promote inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent mirth, cannot be underſtood to fall under that head.</p>
               <p>Gentleneſs of ſpirit and manners is extremely engaging; but not that indiſcriminate attention, that unmeaning ſimper, which ſmiles on all alike. For this ariſes either from affectation of ſoftneſs, or from perfect inſipidity.</p>
               <p>A fine woman, like other fine things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has her proper point of view, from which ſhe may be ſeen to moſt advantage. To fix this point requires great judgment, and an intimate knowledge of the human heart.

                  </gap> of men, of men of the fineſt parts, is even beyond what ſhe conceives. They are ſenſible of the pleaſing illuſion, but they cannot, nor do they wiſh, to diſſolve it. But if ſhe is determined to diſpel the charm, it certainly is in her power, ſhe may ſoon reduce <hi>the angel to a very ordinary girl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a native dignity in ingenuous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to be expected in the gentler ſex, which is their natural protection from the familiarity of men. The ſentiment that a woman may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is ſecure, is both groſly indelicate and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and has proved fatal to many who have confided too much in this fallacious doctrine.</p>

               <p>THERE is no character more truly diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than that of a coquette; it originates from folly, is ſupported by vanity, and termin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in contempt. It is the certain mark of a narrow mind, the illiberal ſlave of fulſome adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and has all its enjoyments increaſed by ſelf-adoration.</p>
               <p>Yet there is a caſe where a woman may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet juſtifiably to the utmoſt verge which her conſcience will allow. It is where a gentleman purpoſes and declines to make his addreſſes, till ſuch time as he thinks himſelf perfectly ſure of her conſent. This at bottom is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of her ſex, the privilege of refuſing; it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024121_0036_0FC3BD3FCE036ED0"/>
to force her to explain herſelf, in effect before the gentleman deigns to do it, and, by this means, to oblige her to violate the modeſty and delicacy of her ſex, and to invert the cleareſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature.</p>
               <p>All this ſacrifice is propoſed to be made mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gratify a moſt deſpicable vanity in a man, who would degrade the very woman, whom he wiſhes to make his wife.</p>
               <p>But it ſhould be diſtinguiſhed whether from this motive he delays to ſpeak explicitly, or from a diffidence inſeparable from true attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the one caſe he can ſcarce be uſed too ill; in the other, he ought to be treated with the greateſt kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Women endeavour to juſtify themſelves to the world, and to their own conſciences, by a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of excuſes, when they act otherwiſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they plead ignorance, or at leaſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the gentleman's real ſentiments. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they plead the decorum of the ſex, which enjoins an equal behaviour to all men, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to conſider any man as a lover, till he has directly told them ſo. But they are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to plead the obligation of their virtue in oppoſition to the ſuperior ones of gratitude, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and humanity.</p>
               <p>The man is entitled to all theſe, who prefers one woman to the reſt of her ſex, and perhaps whoſe greateſt weakneſs is this very preference.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024121_0037_0FC3BD41256BF8A8"/>
The truth of the matter is, vanity and the love of admiration is ſo prevailing a paſſion amongſt the ſex, that they can be fond of the love, when they are indifferent to, or, even, when they deſpiſe the lover.</p>
               <p>But the deepeſt, and moſt artful coquetry is employed by women of ſuperior taſte and ſenſe, to engage and fix the heart of a man whom the world, and whom they themſelves eſteem, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are determined never to marry him. His converſation amuſes them, and his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the higheſt gratification to their vanity; nay, they can ſometimes be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame and happineſs.</p>
               <p>How odious muſt characters of this kind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, eſpecially when contraſted with thoſe who have principles, have generoſity and dignity of ſoul, that elevates them above the worthleſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity recited!</p>
               <p>Such a woman may always convert a lover, if ſhe cannot give him her affections, into a warm and ſteady friend, provided he is a man of ſenſe, reſolution and candour. If ſhe explains herſelf to him with a generous openneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he muſt feel the ſtroke as a man; but he will likewiſe bear it as a man: what he ſuffers he will ſuffer in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Every ſentiment of eſteem will remain; but love, though it requires very little food, and is eaſily ſurſeited with too much, yet it requires
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024121_0038_0FC3BD42BB88E7E0"/>
ſome. He will view her in the light of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman; and though paſſion ſubſides, yet a man of a candid and generous heart always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a tenderneſs for a woman he has once loved, and who has uſed him well, beyond what he feels for any other of her ſex.</p>

               <p>IF the attachment of a lover is agreeable to the object of his wiſhes, a woman ſhould permit nature, good-ſenſe and delicacy to direct her. If ſhe loves him ſhe ſhould not diſcover to him the full extent of her love; no, not although ſhe marries him. That ſufficiently ſhews her preference, which is all he is entitled to know.

               <p>Prudence is not natural to children; however, they can ſubſtitute art in its ſtead. But there is ſomething more becoming in the very errors of nature, where they are undiſguiſed, than in the affectation of virtue itſelf, where the reality is wanting. The preciſe and premature wiſdom which ſome girls have cunning enough to aſſume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their natural failings can be, as it effectually covers thoſe ſecret bad diſpoſitions, which, if they diſplayed themſelves, might be rectified. The hypocriſy of aſſuming virtues which are not inherent in the heart, proves the growth and diſcloſure of thoſe real ones, which it is the great end of education to cultivate.</p>
               <p>This cunning, which, of all the different diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions girls diſcover, is moſt to be dreaded, is increaſed by nothing ſo much as fear.

               <p>That bold, independent, enterprizing ſpirit, which is ſo much admired in boys, ſhould not, when it happens to diſcover itſelf in the other ſex, be encouraged, but ſuppreſſed. Girls ſhould be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciouſly carry on a diſpute, even if they know themſelves to be in the right. Yet they ſhould not be robbed of the liberty of private judgment, but by no means encouraged to contract a contentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greateſt importance to their future happineſs, that they ſhould acquire a ſubmiſſive temper, and a forbearing ſpirit: for it is a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the world will not fail to make them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſe, when they come abroad into it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they will not practiſe it the worſe for having learnt it the ſooner.</p>

               <p>Simple anger ſoon runs itſelf out of breath, and is exhauſted at the end of its tale, but it is for that choſen period that envy has treaſured up the moſt barbed arrow in its whole quiver: anger puts a man out of himſelf; but the truly malicious generally preſerve the appearance of ſelf-poſſeſſion, or they could not ſo effectually

               <p>THERE is a refined jargon, which has infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed letters, and tainted morals, unknown to our plain anceſtors, called <hi>ſentiment, which is the varniſh of virtue to conceal the deformity of vice:</hi> and it is not uncommon for the ſame perſons to make a jeſt of religion, to break through the moſt ſolemn ties and engagements, to practiſe every art of latent fraud and open ſeduction, and yet to value themſelves on ſpeaking and writing ſentimentally.</p>
               <p>Error is never likely to do ſo much miſchief as when it diſguiſes its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman who would be ſhocked
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024121_0064_0FC3BD89461A31E0"/>
at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a ſentimental connection, though perhaps with a dangerous and deſigning man. Such an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed attachment.</p>
               <p>In order to maintain the ſentimental cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with dignity and propriety, a woman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the moſt elevated ideas of diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate alliances, and diſintereſted love; and conſiders fortune, rank, and reputation as mere chimerical diſtinctions and vulgar prejudices. And among the many ſmooth miſchiefs of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is one of its ſure and ſucceſsful frauds to affect the moſt frigid indifference to thoſe external and pecuniary advantages, which it is its great and real object to obtain.</p>
               <p>A ſentimental girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her perſonal beauty; for ſhe has been daily accuſtomed to contemplate it herſelf, and to hear it from others. She will not, therefore, be very ſolicitous for the confirmation of a truth ſo ſelf-evident; but ſhe ſuſpects her pretenſions to underſtanding are more likely to be diſputed; and, for that reaſon, greedily devours every compliment offered to thoſe perfections which are leſs obvious, and more refined. She is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty; while it will be the moſt convincing proof of the taſte, ſenſe, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024121_0065_0FC3BD8B123ACB38"/>
of her admirer, that he can diſcern, and flatter thoſe qualities in her.</p>
               <p>This latent but leading foible forms a clue to the heart; directed by this the lover affects to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes; while he beſtows the moſt delicate praiſes on the beauties of the mind; and finiſhes the climax of adulation by hinting ſhe is ſuperior to it.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſublime attachments, if they end not in ſeduction, ſeldom conclude delightfully, even though they ſhould terminate in the vulgar cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe of marriage. The viſionary heaven ſoon fleets away, and the deluded goddeſs is ſhocked to find herſelf ſtripped of all her celeſtial attributes. She now beholds herſelf of leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the eſteem of the man ſhe has choſen, than <hi>any other mere mortal woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No longer ſhe is gratified with the tear of counterfeited paſſion, the ſigh of diſſembled rapture, or the language of premeditated ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. No longer is the altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations of fictitious fondneſs, the incenſe of falſehood, or the ſacrifice of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Her apotheoſis is ended!—She feels her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf degraded from the dignities and privileges of a goddeſs, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weakneſſes of a ſlighted woman, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected wife. Her faults, which were ſo lately overlooked, or miſtaken for virtues, are now

The paſſion, which was vowed eternal, laſted only a few ſhort weeks; and the indifference which was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing included in the bargain, that it was not ſo much as ſuſpected, follows them through the whole tireſome journey of their inſipid, vacant, and joyleſs exiſtence.</p>

               <p>There are three characters which every man ſuſtains; and theſe often extremely different from one another.

               <p>A MAN of delicacy oft betrays his paſſion by his too great anxiety to conceal it: eſpecially if he has little hopes of ſucceſs. True love, in all its ſtages, ſeeks concealment, and never expects ſucceſs—It renders a man not

only reſpectful, but timid, to the higheſt degree, in his behaviour to the woman he loves.</p>
               <p>To conceal the awe he ſtands in of her, he may ſometimes affect pleaſantry, but it ſits awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly on him; and he quickly relapſes into ſeriouſneſs, if not dullneſs.—He magnifies all her real perfections in his imagination, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them into beauties.—Like a perſon conſcious of guilt, he is jealous that every eye obſerves him; and to avoid this, he ſhuns all the little obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of common gallantry.</p>

               <p>Men employed in the purſuits of buſineſs, ambition or pleaſure, will not give themſelves the trouble to engage a woman's affections, merely from the vanity of conqueſt, and of triumphing over the heart of an innocent and defenceleſs girl.</p>
               <p>A man of parts, ſentiment, and addreſs, if he lays aſide all regard to truth and humanity, may engage the heart of fifty women at the ſame time; and may likewiſe conduct his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry with ſo much art, as to put it out of the power of any of them to ſpecify a ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that could be ſaid to be directly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of love.</p>

               <p>But as a woman in this country may eaſily prevent the firſt impreſſions of love, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of prudence and delicacy ſhould make her guard her heart againſt them, till ſuch time as

               <p>THERE is nothing which renders a woman more deſpicable than her thinking it eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to happineſs to be married.

motives of eſteem and affection, is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt, makes women the moſt reſpectable in the eyes of the world, and the moſt uſeful members of ſociety. Care ſhould be taken not to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the eaſe and independence of a ſingle life, to become the ſlaves of a fool, or a tyrant's caprice.</p>
               <p>Love is very ſeldom produced at firſt ſight; at leaſt, in that caſe, it muſt have a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable foundation. True love is founded on eſteem, in a correſpondence of taſtes and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſteals on the heart imperceptibly. Therefore, before the affections come to be in the leaſt engaged to any man, women ſhould examine their tempers, their taſtes, and their hearts <hi>very ſeverely;</hi> and ſettle in their own minds, what are the requiſites to their happineſs in a married ſtate; and, as it is almoſt impoſſible that they ſhould get every thing they wiſh, they ſhould come to a ſteady determination what they are to conſider as eſſential, and what may be ſacrificed.</p>
               <p>Should they have hearts diſpoſed by nature for love and friendſhip, and poſſeſs thoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which enable them to enter into all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements and delicacies of theſe attachments, matters ſhould be well conſidered before they give them any indulgence.</p>
               <p>Should they have the misfortune to have ſuch tempers, and ſuch ſentiments deeply rooted in

them; ſhould they have ſpirit and reſolution to reſiſt the ſolicitations of vanity, the perſecution of friends; and can they ſupport the proſpect of the many inconveniences attending the ſtate of an old maid, then they may indulge themſelves in that kind of ſentimental reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which is moſt correſpondent to their feelings.</p>
               <p>But if it is found, on a ſtrict ſelf-examination, that marriage is abſolutely eſſential to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piners, the ſecret ſhould be kept inviolable in their own boſoms;—but they ſhould ſhun, as they would do the moſt fatal poiſon, all that ſpecies of reading and converſation, which warms the imagination, which engages and ſoftens the heart, and raiſes the taſte above the level of common life. If they do otherwiſe, let them conſider the terrible conflict of paſſions this may afterwards raiſe in their breaſts.</p>
               <p>If this refinement once takes deep root in their minds, and they do not mean to obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, they may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embitter all their married days. Inſtead of meeting with ſenſe,— tenderneſs,—delicacy,—a lover,—a friend,— an equal companion in an huſband, they may be tried with inſipidity and dulneſs;—ſhocked with indelicacy;—and mortified by indifference.</p>
               <p>To avoid theſe complicated evils, joined to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:024121_0108_0FC3BA3BD80035F8"/>
others which may ariſe from the opinion of the world relative to the infelicity thence ariſing; women who are determined, at all events, to marry, ſhould have all their reading and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch a kind, as do not affect the heart nor the imagination, except in the way of wit and humour.</p>
               <p>Whatever are a woman's views in marrying, ſhe ſhould take every poſſible precaution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being diſappointed. If fortune, and the pleaſure it brings be her aims, the principal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſhe can have for this will depend on her marrying a good-natured, generous man; who deſpiſes money, and who will let her live where ſhe can beſt enjoy that pleaſure, that pomp, and parade of life for which ſhe married him.</p>
               <p>In order to enſure felicity, it is difficult to point out in the married ſtate the moſt effectual method; nor can we adviſe whom a woman ſhould marry, but we may with great confidence adviſe whom ſhe ſhould not marry.</p>

determined by their own taſtes. If they have enough between them, as will ſatisfy all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, it is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Marriage will at once diſpel the enchantment raiſed by external beauty; but the virtues and graces that firſt warmed the heart, that reſerve, and delicacy which always left the lover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to wiſh, and often made him doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his miſtreſs's ſenſibility and attachment, may and ought ever to remain.</p>

               <p>WHERE Religion is neglected there can be no regular or ſteady practice of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of morality. The character will be often inconſiſtent; and virtue, placed on a baſis too narrow to ſupport it, will be always looſe and tottering. For ſuch is the propenſity of our nature to vice, ſo numerous are the temptations to a relaxed and immoral conduct, that ſtronger reſtraints than thoſe of mere reaſon, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be impoſed on man.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe of right and wrong, the principle of honour, or the inſtinct of benevolence, are barriers too feeble to withſtand the ſtrength of paſſion.

               <p>Being unable to bear with becoming fortitude their forlorn and unprotected allotment in life, chagrin and peeviſhneſs are apt to infect their tempers; and they too ſeverely feel the great difficulty of making a tranſition, with dignity and cheerfulneſs, from the period of youth, beauty, admiration, and reſpect, into the calm, ſilent, unnoticed retreat of declining years.</p>

               <p>THE life of man is a mixed ſtate, full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and viciſſitude, of anxieties and fears.—For no man's proſperity on earth is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and aſſured—hence no ſtudy, to a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind, can appear more important than how to be ſuitably prepared for the misfortunes of life, ſo as to contemplate them in proſpect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſmay; and, if they muſt befal, to bear them without dejection.</p>
               <p>Throughout every age, power has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove adverſity to a diſtance.—Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy has ſtudied, when it drew nigh, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it by patience,—and wealth has ſought out every pleaſure that can compenſate or alleviate pain.</p>
               <p>But religion has been no leſs attentive to the ſame important object.—The defence which it

provides is altogether of an internal kind.—It is the heart, not the outward ſtate, which it profeſſes to guard, by affording the diſtreſſed that ſecurity and peace, which ariſe from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of divine protection.—It opens to them ſources of conſolation which are hidden from others.— By that ſtrength of mind with which it endows them, it ſets them upon a rock, againſt which the tempeſt may violently beat, but cannot ſhake; for it prepares the mind for encountering, with fortitude, the moſt ſevere ſhocks of adverſity.</p>

               <p>TEMPERANCE in pleaſure is eſſentially neceſſary to be obſerved, particularly by youth, that they may beware of that rock on which thouſands, from race to race, continue to ſplit. The love of pleaſure, natural to man in every period of his life, glows at this age with exceſſive ardour. — Novelty adds freſh charms, as yet, to every gratification.—The world appears to ſpread a continual feaſt;—and health, vigour, and high ſpirits invite them to partake of it without reſtraint. In vain are they warned of the latent danger.—The old,

They may all be comprized in few words, not to hurt ourſelves and not to hurt others by our purſuit of pleaſure, and theſe will be fully effected by temperance. Within theſe bounds, pleaſure is lawful, beyond them it becomes criminal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ruinous.</p>

our tongue from evil, and our looks and geſtures from all expreſſions of violence and ill-will.</p>
               <p>Pride, which produces ſo many evils in the human mind, is the great ſource of paſſion.— Whoever cultivates in himſelf a proper, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,— a due ſenſe of his own faults and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies,— and a due reſpect for others, will find but ſmall temptation to violent or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anger.</p>
               <p>Whenever, therefore, we feel ourſelves high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enraged, we ſhould ſuſpect ourſelves to be in the wrong, and reſolve to ſtand the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deciſion of our own conſcience, before we caſt upon another the puniſhment which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps due to ourſelves.—This ſelf-examination will, at leaſt, give us time to cool, and, if we are juſt, as it ſhould be our chief aim to be ſo, will diſpoſe us to balance our own wrong with that of our antagoniſt, and to ſettle the account with him on equal terms.</p>
               <p>There are many who acquire the character of ill-temper, when in reality they merit not the ſeverity of the accuſation; and this ariſes mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their mode of replication, or their manner of interrogating—as they are generally and unfortunately attended with a ſpecies of tartneſs on every trivial occaſion.—This indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to common obſervers a degree of petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and ſeems to take its origin from a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:024121_0157_0FC3BABF21456520"/>
or rather fear of their own conſequence being degraded or injured in ſome reſpect.— This ſhould be carefully avoided, for the very appearance of peeviſhneſs, is ungrateful and painful.</p>
               <p>The fretful man, though he injures us leſs, diſguſts us more than him who is paſſionate;— becauſe he betrays a low and little mind,—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on trifles,—and engroſſed by a paltry ſelf-love which knows not how to bear the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of any inconvenience. It is ſelf-love, then, which we muſt combat, when we find ourſelves aſſaulted by this infirmity; and by voluntarily enduring inconveniencies, we ſhall habituate ourſelves to bear them with eaſe, and good humour, when occaſioned by others.</p>
               <p>We ſhould endeavour, by denying ourſelves now and then innocent indulgencies, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a habit of command over our paſſions and inclinations, particularly ſuch as are likely to lead us into evil; and abſtract our minds from that attention to trifling circumſtances, which uſually creates this uneaſineſs.— Our minds ſhould, therefore, have always ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in purſuit worthy of them, that they may not be engroſſed by ſuch, as are in themſelves ſcarce worth a moment's anxiety; yet from too minute and anxious attention ſeldom fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a teazing,—mean— and fretful diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>We ſhould ſubſtitute in their room the purſuit
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:024121_0158_0FC3BAC0D4F95AB0"/>
of glory and happineſs in another life.—Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—reflection—rational converſation—and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, converſing with God, by prayer and meditation, would preſerve us from taking that intereſt in the little comforts and conveniences of our remaining days, which uſually gives birth to ſo much fretfulneſs in old people.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this is generally attributed to age, ſtill we often ſee the young—the healthy —and thoſe who enjoy the moſt outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, inexcuſably guilty of it.—The ſmalleſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in pleaſure, or difficulty in the moſt trifling employment, will put <hi>wilful</hi> young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of temper, and their very amuſements become ſources of vexation and peeviſhneſs.— There is a degree of reſignation neceſſary even in the enjoyment of pleaſure,—we muſt be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to give up ſome part of what we could wiſh for, before we can enjoy that which is indulged to us.—The craving of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs vanity, the too-conſtant companion of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful boſoms, will endure a thouſand mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, in the midſt of ſeeming pleaſure, will ſecretly corrode the heart; whilſt the meek and humble generally find more gratification than they expected, and return home pleaſed and enlivened from every ſcene of amuſement, tho' they could have ſtaid away from it with perfect eaſe and contentment.</p>
               <p>Sullenneſs and obſtinacy is, perhaps, a worſe

fault of temper than either of the former—and, if indulged, may end in the moſt fatal extremes of ſtubborn melancholy—malice—and revenge. —The reſentment which, inſtead of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, is paſſed in ſecret, and continually ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the imagination, will in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ruling paſſion; and then, how horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt be his caſe, whoſe kind and pleaſurable affections are all ſwallowed up by the torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as deteſtable ſentiments of hatred and revenge!</p>
               <p>We ſhould not brood over reſentment, but ſpeak calmly—reaſonably—and kindly—then expoſtulate with our adverſary; and either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ourſelves to him or quiet our minds under the injury we have ſuppoſed he has done us, by the principle of Chriſtian charity.—But if it appears we ourſelves have been the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, we ſhould acknowledge our error fairly and handſomely;—a generous confeſſion oftentimes more than atones for the fault which requires it.</p>
               <p>Truth and juſtice demand that we ſhould acknowledge conviction, as ſoon as we feel it and not maintain an erroneous opinion, or juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a wrong conduct, merely from the falſe ſhame of confeſſing our paſt ignorance.—With a diſpoſition ſtrongly inclined to ſullenneſs or obſtinacy, this may appear perhaps impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;—but by conſtant uſe the mind will gain

ſtrength from the conteſt, and this internal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will by degrees be forced to give ground.</p>
               <p>The love of truth and a real deſire of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, ought to be the <hi>only</hi> motives of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; and where theſe are ſincere, no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty can be made of embracing the truth, as ſoon as it is perceived—To receive advice— reproof—and inſtruction properly, is the ſureſt ſign of a ſincere and humble heart,—and ſhews a greatneſs of mind, which commands our reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and reverence, while it appears ſo willingly to yield to us in ſuperiority.</p>

               <p>A GOOD-NATURED man, whatever faults he may have, they will for the moſt part be treated with lenity;—he will generally find an advocate in every human heart;—his errors will be lamented, rather than abhorred; —and his virtues will be viewed in the faireſt point of light;—his good-humour, without the help of great talents or acquirements, will make his company preferable to that of the moſt brilliant genius, in whom this quality is wanting—but with it, ſuch a brightneſs will be added to their luſtre, that all the world will

               <p>It is true, we are not all equally happy in our diſpoſitions; but human virtue conſiſts in cheriſhing and cultivating every good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in checking and ſubduing every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to evil.—If a man had been born with a bad temper, it might have been made a good one, at leaſt with regard to its outward effects, by education, reaſon, and principle: and though he is ſo happy as to have a good one while young, he muſt not ſuppoſe it will always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, if he neglects to maintain a proper command over it.—Power—ſickneſs—diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments—or worldly cares may corrupt, or embitter the fineſt diſpoſition, if they are not counteracted by reaſon and religion.—Hence theſe ſhould be ever exerted in the exigencies of life—they will teach us a becoming ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under all the accidents of our mortal ſtate, with which it is ſo variouſly chequered;—di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt calamity of its ſevereſt ſting—make our enemies aſhamed of their perſecuting ſpirit—

               <p>By good temper is not meant an inſenſible indifference to injuries—and a total forbearance from manly reſentment.—There is a noble and generous kind of anger, a proper and neceſſary part of our nature which has nothing in it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or degrading—we are not to be dead to this —for the perſon, who feels not an injury, muſt be incapable of being properly affected by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.—With thoſe who treat us ill without provocation, we ought to maintain our own dignity—but whilſt we ſhew a ſenſe of their improper behaviour, we muſt preſerve calmneſs, and even good breeding,—and thereby convince them of the impotence, as well as injuſtice of their malice.</p>
               <p>Generous anger does not preclude eſteem for whatever is really eſtimable, nor does it deſtroy good-will to the perſon of its object—or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize any impeachment to reſt on the goodneſs of our diſpoſition:—It even inſpires the deſire of overcoming our enemy by benefits,—and wiſhes to inflict no other puniſhment than the regret of having injured one who deſerved his kindneſs:—It is always placable, and ready to be reconciled, as ſoon as the offender is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his error; nor can any ſubſequent injury provoke it to recur to paſt diſobligations, which had been once forgiven.—The conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>WIT is the moſt dangerous talent we can poſſeſs.—It muſt be guarded with great diſcretion and good nature, otherwiſe it will create many enemies.</p>
               <p>Wit is perfectly conſiſtent with ſoftneſs and delicacy; yet they are ſeldom found united.— Wit is ſo flattering to vanity, that they who poſſeſs it become intoxicated, and loſe all ſelf-command.</p>
               <p>Though it is the moſt captivating, yet it is the moſt dreaded of all talents: the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to thoſe who have it, and the moſt feared by thoſe who have it not. He who is grown rich without it, in ſafe and ſober dulneſs, ſhuns
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:024121_0171_0FC3BADA0732B278"/>
as a diſeaſe, and looks upon poverty as its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable concomitant.</p>
               <p>The moraliſt declaims againſt it as the ſource of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy itſelf: for he conſiders it as the parent of extravagance and beggary. —The Cynic will aſk of what uſe is it? Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower-garden, and yet it is allowed, as an object of innocent amuſement, and delightful recreation.</p>
               <p>A woman who poſſeſſes this quality has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a moſt dangerous preſent, perhaps not leſs ſo than beauty itſelf; eſpecially if it be not ſheathed in a temper peculiarly inoffenſive,— chaſtiſed by a moſt correct judgment,—and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by more prudence than falls to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lot.</p>
               <p>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for there is much more danger that folly ſhould ariſe from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what is our own, than of what we borrow.—But wit, like learning, is not near ſo common a thing as is imagined.—For flippancy, pertneſs, and impudence are often miſtaken for this brilliant quality; and people often imagine they are witty, only becauſe they are indiſcreet; and this makes the name of wit ſo cheap, while its real exiſtence is ſo rare.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who happily poſſeſs this talent, cannot be too abſtinent in the uſe of it.—It

               <p>THE prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the principal things on which the great machine of human ſociety turns. Thoſe who allow the influence which female graces have, in contributing to poliſh the manners of men, would do well to reflect how great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence female morals muſt alſo have on their conduct.

               <p>It is a certain truth, that women the moſt accompliſhed are ſure to acquire the univerſal admiration and eſteem of the world, if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the heart accompanies their thirſt of other knowledge,—and vanity, that idol of the ſex, be ſupplanted by modeſt humility.</p>

               <p>THE things in our own power, are in their own nature free, not capable of being countermanded or hindered; but thoſe that are not in our power are feeble, ſervile, liable to oppoſition, and not ours, but another's.</p>
               <p>When any frightful and diſcouraging imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation aſſaults us, we ſhould harden ourſelves, and meet it boldly, with this reflection, that it is only our apprehenſion of things, and not the real nature of the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>We ſhould on all occaſions, reflect with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of what nature and condition thoſe things are that miniſter delight, or are uſeful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to us, and that we have a natural tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for; and that theſe reflections may anſwer their end, we ſhould make them familiar, by beginning at the ſlighteſt and moſt inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and ſo riſe to the higher and more valuable.</p>
               <p>In every action we undertake, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider firſt with ourſelves, and weigh well the

               <p>That which gives men diſquiet, and makes their lives miſerable, is not the nature of things as they really are, but the notions and opinions which they form to themſelves concerning them. —wherever therefore we meet with obſtructions and perplexities—and fall into them, let us be juſt, and not lay the blame where it is not due; but impute it all to ourſelves, and our prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate opinions.</p>

               <p>Loud laughing is a mark of ill-breeding— laughing at our own jokes, too oft the effect of ignorance:—we ſhould not indulge even in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all but upon few occaſions, and then it ſhould not be much.</p>

in upon modeſty and good manners.—Wherever therefore any perſon flies out into obſcenity, if ſuch a liberty dare be taken, we ſhould reprove him publicly, and put a ſtop to his lewd conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;—but if that cannot conveniently be done, yet at leaſt we may do ourſelves the juſtice to diſapprove it; and by forbearing to join with him—by bluſhing for him—and by chiding looks, let all the company ſee plainly, that we deteſt his filthy ribbaldry.</p>
               <p>When the idea of any pleaſure ſtrikes our imagination, as we muſt on other occaſions, ſo ſhould we in this, eſpecially ſtand upon our guard, and not ſuffer ourſelves to be hurried away with the impetuous torrent;—we ſhould not run eagerly upon enjoyment, nor improve the thought into action;—but take time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and let that time be employed in making a juſt computation between the duration of the pleaſure, and that of the repentance ſure to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; and then we ſhall not fail to check our inclinations, and chide ourſelves for indulging them in any degree at all.</p>
               <p>When upon mature deliberation we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded a thing is fit to be done—let us do it boldly, and not affect privacy in it, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ourſelves at all what impertinent cenſures or reflections the world may paſs upon it; for if the thing be juſt and innocent, it is fooliſh to

               <p>If we take upon us a character above our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, we fall into a twofold inconvenience; —firſt, to miſcarry in what we have undertaken; and then to loſe the opportunity of undertaking ſomewhat elſe, more proportionable to our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in which we might have come off with honour.</p>
               <p>In all the affairs of human life, we ſhould take care not to hurt our mind, or offend our judgment; and this rule, if cautiouſly obſerved in all our deportment, will be a mighty ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to us in all our undertakings, and prevent us from being injured by folly, or aggrieved by impetuoſity.</p>
               <p>At the age of fourteen women begin to be courted and careſſed; then they think that the recommending themſelves to the affections of the men is the only buſineſs they have to attend to; and ſo preſently fall to tricking—to dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing—and practiſing all the little engaging arts peculiar to their ſex; in theſe they place all their hopes, as they do all their happineſs in the ſucceſs of them:—But they ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there are other attractives much more powerful than theſe; that the reſpect we pay them, is not due to their beauty, ſo much
