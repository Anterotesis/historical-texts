            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SO great a prevalence has cu≈øtom, that to ≈øee an Engli≈øh book without a Preface, is as ≈øtrange a ≈øight as a bull without horns, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of his defence. If this little Hi≈øtory of the Iri≈øh Robbers has any occa≈øion of a Preface, it can only be to obviate one objection that may be made by cavillers again≈øt it, viz. <q>Rogues merit no commendation; and therefore men ought to be cautious of introducing their actions in Hi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, le≈øt it ≈øhould be an encouragement to others to follow their example:</q> But I can a≈ø≈øure the Reader, that my intention is quite different: I have wrote with no other de≈øign than to di≈øcourage young men from falling into ≈øuch company as may lead them into a ≈øhameful way of living, which often brings them to an ill end, and leaves a reproach upon their family, who may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. We may ob≈øerve the great Redmond O'Hanlon, though he lived a merry life, yet it was but ≈øhort, and attended with ≈øuch dangers and fear, that he could have but little ≈øatisfaction, and at length he became ≈øuch an odium, that one of his own relations, for the lucre of a reward, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him out of the world as he lay a≈øleep. How ≈øafely, then can an outlawed rogue leave
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035355_0003_10049CABAEE2F1E8"/>his life in the power of another, when induced not only by the promi≈øe of a reward, but for the ≈øake of pardon to give information? And if a man has occa≈øion to di≈øtru≈øt his own comrades, with how much di≈ø≈øatisfaction mu≈øt he live? It is true, he may riot for a while, but let him take care, <q>le≈øt (according to the P≈øalmi≈øt) he be cut off in his wickedne≈øs, and die in his ≈øins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope the following Hi≈øtory may al≈øo be of ≈øervice to hone≈øt men of all profe≈ø≈øions, who may happen to have dealings, though at unawares, with ≈øuch kind of cattle as are here treated of.‚Äî By making our≈øelves acquainted with their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and ways of management, we may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to know how to di≈øcover their wiles, and break their mea≈øures. When a man is forewarn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, if he does not ≈øore-arm him≈øelf, I believe all men will think him blame-worthy. I am ≈øure this is my opinion, who am a well wi≈øher to all men.</p>

But poor Redmond, in this unhappy condition, once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ≈øafety, ≈øtaid abroad for a long time, ≈øtill refu≈øing to come to trial 'till he was outlawed, which put him to his ≈øhifts.

               <p>But ≈øeeming to reli≈øh this new cour≈øe of life more than the former, he proceeded in his rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, 'till from an infancy in the art, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one of the mo≈øt notorious and expert of that profe≈ø≈øion that had ever been bred in the kingdom of Ireland.

               <p>He was ≈øtrong and active, and as occa≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, could perform his feats either on foot or on hor≈øeback: but though he was ≈øo notorious a plunderer, he was naturally of a very generous di≈øpo≈øition, frequently giving ≈øhare of what he got from the rich to relieve the poor in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities. His remarkable actions and ≈øurpri≈øing attempts, ≈øpread his character through all the country; and being joined by a great number of his former acquaintance (adventerous lads who became his a≈ø≈øociates ≈øpontaneou≈øly) 'till his company was augmented to fifty effective men, mo≈øtly his own relations, he then began to take upon a captain's command, and appointed a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade

However, there was no robbery committed any where at all in the kingdom but was attributed to Captain O'H‚Äîn, though it is probable he might be an hundred miles di≈øtant at the ≈øame time: nay, ≈øo well was his character e≈øtabli≈øhed, and ≈øo notorious his actions, that it became a common proverb, when any man had a mind to brand another with infamy and ≈øcandal, for him to ≈øay, "You are as great a rogue as Redmond O'H‚Äîn."</p>

Such as made this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with him, had their names regi≈øtered in his pocket-book, and were ≈øo little afraid of lo≈øing any of their goods by robbers, that they thought their effects as ≈øafe in the field as in the hou≈øe; for if at any time they happened to have any thing ≈øtolen, upon application to Redmond, he would make the mo≈øt diligent ≈øearch that could po≈ø≈øibly be made through all parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till he found it and re≈øtored it to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and if he falled to find it, always allowed his benefactor two years ≈øalary to compen≈øate the lo≈øs. But he had ≈øo many emi≈øaries, and ≈øuch good intelligence, and all other petty rogues were ≈øo much afraid of him and his party, that none of them dared di≈øoblige him; and be≈øides, every robber was ≈øerved with a copy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtered names, and had ≈øtrict orders not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing that belonged to ≈øuch, but to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the lo≈øer in ≈øearching for their goods: ≈øo that his friends ≈øeldom ≈øuffered under his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Having once got cold, upon ≈øome de≈øperate occa≈øion, it threw him into a dangerous fever, of which he recovered; yet the place being damp where he lay, he lo≈øt the u≈øe of his limbs, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035355_0011_10049CC406C9E270"/>continued a cripple or lame for ≈øome years: yet during this time he was pre≈øerved among his friends, who had a great e≈øteem for him, and e≈øcaped from being taken, though he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a tory and a robber, and a reward of fifty pound was offered for taking of him, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioned frequent ≈øearches after him. He likewi≈øe was punctually paid his ≈øalary or tribute by his benefactors or allies (except a few who broke the truce, but dearly paid for it after) though robberies were not ≈øo frequent during his illue≈øs as before, ≈øo that he was under a nece≈ø≈øity of making his pay maintain him 'till he was able to go about again.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as he had recovered the u≈øe of his limbs, he took the field again, and ≈øcoured all the roads roads in the country, ≈øometimes alone, and ≈øometimes with company, and took ≈øpecial care to revenge him≈øelf on all tho≈øe who had neglected to ≈øend him his yearly pen≈øion while he was out of order; but found him≈øelf ≈øo clo≈øely hunted, that he fixed his head quarters at or about the bog of Allen for a con≈øiderable time, where he committed ≈øuch a number of notorious robberies, that the country was obliged to keep under arms to guard their effects. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taking this into con≈øideration, a fre≈øh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was i≈ø≈øued out, offering a reward of two hundred and fifty pound for the taking of him; upon which ≈øeveral attempts were made to ≈øecure him, but to no effect: though he was once taken in bed near Clonbullock; but had the good fortune to be re≈øcued by his comrades, as his captors were leading him to Naas goal.</p>

               <p>Soon after his return, he was in company with ≈øome of his a≈ø≈øociates beyond Armagh, where they met with cornet Montgomery's ≈øteward, who having received about 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> from his ma≈øter's tenants on an e≈øtats he had in that country, was carrying it home to his own hou≈øe near Killevan, in the country of Monaghan, where he dwelt.

This he did out of a pure regard that he had for the cornet, on account of ≈øome favour that he had done him formerly: and the cornet to make him a requital for ≈øo generous an action, made a promi≈øe that he would u≈øe his be≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to obtain the king's pardon for him, in hopes of his for≈øaking his new trade; and was as good as his word, as by the ≈øequel will appear.</p>

A little after this action, a merchant in Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk had a draught on a merchant in Newry for a large ≈øum, but was ≈øo much in dread of Redmond OH‚Äîn, that he was afraid either to ≈øend for the money, or to go for it him≈øelf: while he was thus con≈øulting with his wife how to get the money ≈øafely home, his apprentice, a lad about ≈øixteen years of age, overheard their di≈øcour≈øe, and as ≈øoon as he got an opportunity, de≈øired his ma≈øter to tell him why he was ≈øo much afraid of ≈øending to Newry?

               <p>Redmond was then under ≈øome nece≈øities for a little money; and as none of his companions were pre≈øent at the dialogue, he was re≈øolved not to let them know any thing of the matter, that he might have all the booty to him≈øelf: And to make him≈øelf the more ≈øure of the prey, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his comrades to a different po≈øt the next morning, and waited him≈øelf alone on the road leading from Newry, 'till the boy returned.</p>

               <p>Capt. P‚Äîr made ≈øome advances after this, in Lien≈øter, where coming one evening to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure farmer's hou≈øe, expecting to get a night's lodging, he ob≈øerved that the man and his wife were in deep ≈øorrow, which occa≈øioned him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the cau≈øe of their grief.

Then he a≈øk'd the farmer, "whether he had any friend at all that would endeavour to help him?" The farmer ≈øaid he knew of none. Then ≈øaid P‚Äîr, "If a friend ≈øhould be ≈øo kind as to lend ≈øo much money (which he under≈øtood to be about ≈øixty pounds) as would clear your landlord, would you repay it again of you could." "Indeed, ≈øaid the farmer, I would if I could." Well then, ≈øays P‚Äîr, here is the ≈øum; I'll be your friend ≈øo far as to lend it to you only upon our own note;" which he gave him, promi≈øing not to let his landlord know that he had any money 'till he had made all the excu≈øes that were po≈ø≈øible, ≈øay even ≈øo far as to let him begin to drive the cattle and turn him out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. This pa≈ø≈øed on very well till the landlord came with
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035355_0038_10049CEE8106A260"/>the Sheriff, in order to po≈ø≈øe≈øs him≈øelf: and after the tenant delayed as long as it was ≈øafe, he at la≈øt told him, that a friend of his had left ≈øo much money with him to keep, and rather than be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a beggar, he would give it to his landlord and let his friend wait 'till he could ri≈øe it.</p>
               <p>The landlord accepted the money; but was obliged to give an acquittance in full for all rent and arrears what≈øoever, and then, after having abu≈øed his tenant and called him a rogue and a villain ≈øeveral times, becau≈øe he did not pay the money long before that, thinking it was his own, he mounted his hor≈øe and rode home-wards, the Sheriff having taken another way.</p>
               <p>P‚Äîr in di≈øgui≈øe way-laid the landlord on the road, and took all the ca≈øh, with a watch, and ≈øome other things of value, from him; and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his tenant two or three days afterwards, told him his money was unlucky, for he had lo≈øt it, every penny, and a good deal more with it, on the road, being taken from him by an highway robber, whom he de≈øcribed as well as he could, not remembering ever to have ≈øeen him. In le≈øs than a week, P‚Äîr called at the farmer's hou≈øe dre≈ø≈øed as he was at fir≈øt, in order to ≈øee how he fared. The farmer told him the whole ≈øtory, and how that his landlord was robbed (which he was little ≈øorry for) on the road.

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035355_0039_10049CF015CA6650"/>the note to pieces, bid the farmer adieu.</p>
               <p>We have but an imperfect account of the re≈øt of the actions of his life.

               <p>It was cu≈øtomary with them when they met a chair conveniently with any one in it, for two of them to ≈øtop the men that carried it, while the third robbed the gentleman; but when they made an attack on a coach with but one ≈øervant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, one was ordered to each ≈øide, and to have an eye on the footman, whi≈øe the third ≈øtopped the driver till the ≈øeat was performed.

               <p>The ≈øixth adventure was at Marybone in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt, 1721, where ob≈øerving that a baronet with one ≈øervant attending him had received a large pur≈øe of gold, they dogged him on his way home to a field, near the bordered hou≈øe, and took above 200 guineas from him, with ≈øome ≈øilver, a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ring and a watch, then giving the ≈øilver to his man, they padded the hoof and made their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: However the gentleman adverti≈øed the robbery, offering a larger reward for the watch (in the news papers.) than it could be ≈øold for; upon which they ≈øent it privately to the place appointed for receiving it, and got the reward, without being a≈øked any que≈øtions.</p>
               <p>The next robbery they committed was in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember following (and as they fully propo≈øed ≈øhould be their la≈øt) when having moved their quarters nearer to Convent-Garden, in order to be le≈øs remote from the gambling tables, in and about the little Piazza, Bow-≈øtreet, Charles-≈øtreet, and

He had ≈øeveral ≈øons there whereof afterwards became very notorious, viz. Daniel, Charles and Luke. Daniel was put to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035355_0076_10049D967A0F4030"/>≈øchool in his youth, 'till he obtained the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good ≈øcholar; but not being fond of going abroad to fini≈øh his ≈øtudies, cho≈øe to ≈øtay at home and lead the life of his brother, rather than be put into orders, (for he was intended for a prie≈øt.) When he arrived to mans's e≈øtate, he was too ea≈øily drawn into be a clerk and regi≈øter to his his brother Cahier, who could neither read nor write; and at length, by following his pattern, was brought to the gallows, and executed along with him in Augu≈øt 1735. Their brother Luke would have had the ≈øame fate, only that he fled the country, tho' he never arrived to half the dexterity of Charles in the art of hor≈øe hiding. They all under≈øtood the canting language pretty well, yet made no u≈øe of it but upon proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions which made ≈øeveral of their neighbours think there was more laid to their charge than they de≈øerved, 'till time made the truth manife≈øt. But as our de≈øign here is only to give the hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Charles Demp≈øey, let us omit circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and proceed.</p>
               <p>This Charles Demp≈øey, alias Cahier na Cappul was born on the lands of Glenmalier, near Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librittas, in the Queen's County, and in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was kept mo≈øtly at his fo≈øter-father's, where he learned to ≈øpeak Iri≈øh, but little or no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh. From his infancy, it was ob≈øerved that he was much addicted to lying and defrauding his companiona, little children, out of their play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and was ≈øo extraordinary fond of hor≈øes and riding, that before he arrived to the age of five years, be could ride and ≈øtick on a wild hor≈øe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035355_0077_10049D98149ACBA8"/>better thau a great many men; a thing ≈øeldom known. 'Tis an old proverb, and commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, "that he that is born to be bang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will never be drowned." Nor has it been more apparently verified in the life of any per≈øon than in his, for at the age afore≈øaid, being prompted by his natural inclinations to ride one three years old colt, he per≈øuaded a man, to put him on his back, tho' he had nothing but a collar on his head; but not being any way capable of managing the young bea≈øt, he ran headlong' with him into the Barrow, and ≈øwam it, tho' there was a very high flood, and the ≈øtream rapid: He held his grip by the mane very well till he got to the further ≈øide, but ≈øtriving to land at a bad place, the bank broke under the bea≈øt's brea≈øt, and ≈øunk with it under water for a moment, and poor Charles was wa≈øhed off with the current, which carried them both down the river near 50 yards, till the colt found footing, and plunged out; yet he held a fa≈øt grip of the collar till he got on dry ground, tho' he was ≈øhortly after taken up for dead, and with ≈øome difficulty recovered. After this he u≈øed frequently to ≈øay, in Iri≈øh, he would not fear drowning if he were to ≈øail in a turf ki≈øh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he afterwards any thing afraid of the Barrow water, for he made ≈øeveral dangerous adventures acro≈øs to e≈øcape the hands of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuers.</p>
               <p>As he grew more cautious of pilfering publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than when he was young (not that he thought it any ≈øin, but in dread of the law) he managed his affairs ≈øo cunningly as to lay the facts always on others, becau≈øe he had an inveterate hatred to

               <p>From a child he had an ill-favoured a≈øpect, and in his countenance betrayed a deceitful heart, that is, he always carried a rogue's face, tho' his brother Daniel was a hand≈øome portly man, and of ≈øeemly behaviour. His Engli≈øh was but broken at be≈øt, and ≈øometimes he pretended to none at all, as will appear by the ≈øequel: And as the ≈øaying is, Save a thief from the gallows and he'll cut your throut, ≈øo it was with him; for his ingratitude was ≈øo great, and he had ≈øo tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fidelity, that he made no ≈øcruple of accu≈øing his neare≈øt relations, or even his landlord, nay per≈øons no ways guilty or concerned, to ≈øave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.</p>
               <p>At the age of twelve years he began to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe the art of decoying and catching hor≈øes, in which he acquired ≈øo much ≈økill, that he made no difficulty of laying hands on the wilde≈øt colt, and hor≈øes that had been handled, ≈øeemed to fall into his clutches of their own accord. Perhaps ≈øome reader would expect that I ≈øhould give a particular account of his management in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, but as our intent in publi≈øhing this hi≈øtory, is only to put hone≈øt people on their guard again≈øt robbers and rogues, it can be no way nece≈ø≈øary, neither it expedient to teach a thief how to catch a hor≈øe, or to ≈øteal: If I can ≈øhew an hone≈øt man how to outwit a rogue, or put a trick on him, 'tis as much as can be expected; and verily that was my chief de≈øign in publi≈øhing this book.</p>
               <p>But it fame be true, it will be entirely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs to mentionany particulars: the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035355_0079_10049D9B6B306968"/>will have and family do believe it was by a kind of witchara≈øt, or charm, that he decoyed and entrapped hor≈øes, and taught others to do ≈øo; and the affirm that he received this charm from a witch in the county of Monaghan, (with whom he was very intimate) for ≈øome ≈øingular ≈øervices he had done her. However, the following relation will make it ≈øeem probable that his father before him had the like charm; for which rea≈øon, I'm more than half inclined to di≈ø≈øent from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar opinion, and conclude, that this magic was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the family, and runs in the blood.</p>
               <p>The ≈øtory was related by a gentleman thus:</p>
               <p>"In the beginning of queen Ann's reign, I went to ≈øee a friend of mine near Abbeleix, and having arrived at the place, I walked about the fields in the evening alone, and when I came near to the bog, I found I had occa≈øion to ea≈øe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I cho≈øe a convenient place under a hedge for that purpo≈øe, but before I had fini≈øhed the di≈øcharge of my office, there appeared thro' the hedge a man before me, driving ≈øome hor≈øes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quietly into a corner, one whereof he took hold of him by the near foreleg, and held him fa≈øt 'till he threw a ≈øhert rope about his neck, then he vaulted on him with more agility than ever I ≈øaw a miller do on his ≈øacks: In this po≈øture with a long ≈øtick in his hand, he drove the colt (he was never handled before) acro≈øs the bog, till he got out of my ≈øight, plunging and leaping to ≈øuch a degree all the way, that one would have thought if the old boy were on his back he had but a dull chance from coming off without a broken neck; and by the noi≈øe they made, I conjectured they
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035355_0080_10049D9FF3D0D0F8"/>might have gone a mile at the ≈øame rate before I left the place. I had no notion of rapparees being out at this time, and thought it might be ≈øome one that owned the colt that had made ≈øo free with him, till returning to my friends, I told the ≈øtory and then they all ≈øu≈øpected, as it really was, from the manner of catching the colt, that old Demp≈øy (tho he had been quiet a long time) had come to pay them a vi≈øit." Thus the gentleman ended his ≈øtory, and now to preceed to Charles.</p>
               <p>His fo≈øter father was a tenant under Major P‚Äît, who once as he was riding out to take a review of his land, took notice of young Charles's activity in riding hor≈øes; upon which he had him ≈øent home, to him, in order to be an attendant on his groom, and to learn him to ≈øpeak Engli≈øh; where he behaved tolerable well and mode≈øt for a month or two and then he began his waggi≈øh tricks. "The groom and another ≈øervant happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have ≈øome difference between them≈øelves, Charles was re≈øolved to wind it up to the highe≈øt, and bring a battle about if po≈ø≈øible: they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been jarring and ≈øparing; and as the groom lay in a room under a hay loft, thro' which there was a private hole wide enough for a man to pa≈øs through, the young rogue took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, in the groom's ab≈øence, to drop a large ≈øur-reverence at the foot of his bed, not forgetting to be≈øprinkle it a little. When the groom was going to make his bed, what ≈øhould he lay his hand fir≈øt upon but the t‚Äî, which all bedaubed him, and threw him into ≈øuch a fit of anger, that he vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ved to be revenged of his fellow ≈øervant in
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035355_0081_10049DA18AED0AF8"/>the morning, whom he ≈øu≈øpected and nobody el≈øe. He went not to bed that night, but ≈øat up, and as ≈øoon as the ma≈øter came out the next day, made his complaint to him. His ma≈øter could hardly forbear ≈ømiling at the joke, tho' it was a dirty one; yet he ≈øhewed a very great re≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the other ≈øervant who was accu≈øed, tho' the fellow who was innocent, utterly denied that he knew any thing of the matter. All this gave the groom no ≈øatisfaction, but to logger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads he would and did go with the other, who proving too hard for him, the groom was wor≈øted and obliged to give out; then the other, and all that took his part reported that the groom had S‚Äît his own bed and that he laid it on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with no other view than to excu≈øe him≈øelf; which getting wind, he was ≈øo jeered about it, that he had no quietne≈øs, till he quitted his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and went away.</p>
               <p>There were ≈øeveral young gentlewomen in the hou≈øe, who were very glad of the groom's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becau≈øe he was very ready in making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints again≈øt them≈øelves to the old gentleman; from thence Charles took occa≈øion to let the young ladies into the ≈øecret, who approving of his management, employed him in ≈øeveral little affairs and about me≈ø≈øages not proper to mention here. But it happened once in the fruit rea≈øon, that the young gentlewomen had a great de≈øire for ≈øome choice fruit out of the orchard, into which they were refu≈øed admittance by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor; upon this they employed Charles to rob the orchard, who getting up very early by break of day, the next morning and without ≈øtaying to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035355_0082_10049DA37B530300"/>put on his breeches, crept thro' a hole in the roof of the privy-hou≈øe, adjoining the orchard, and went to pillaging the trees, where he filled a large chequer apron, with the choice≈øt fruit, and was making ready to return. There was a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman that lodged in the hou≈øe, who had got a touch of the country di≈øea≈øe and was ≈øomewhat very much out of order, and having occa≈øion to give ≈øpeedy vent, had repared to the coffee hou≈øe for that purpo≈øe while the boy was on his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. As the gentleman ≈øat on his ≈øeat, and was ≈øtooping forward, the boy came to the hole, where, without looking before him as he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending, the apron untied, and all the fruit came tumbling down about his ears; and at the ≈øame moment Charles fell with his legs on each ≈øide of the clergyman's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>k, and by the weight of the fall, threw him on his face, in this po≈øture they lay wedged together in a nook, for near the ≈øpace of a minute, before Charles could di≈øengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf; and the clergyman's ≈øurpri≈øe being height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened more and more upon feeling nothing but naked ≈økin about him he fainted quite away; and lay-≈øtill on the ground; the boy thinking he had killed the gentleman, ran away with all ≈øpeed, and came back no more to his ≈øervice: But the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman who could not ≈øee him, and was as much terrified as the boy, (without ≈øu≈øpecting him in the lea≈øt) went in and told the ≈øtory: ≈øome pitied him, others could hardly forbear ≈ømiling; but nobody could find out the truth, but the boy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mi≈ø≈øing two or three days, and the young gentlewomen knowing the apron that was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, called to mind the exploit they ≈øent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035355_0083_10049DA51374E948"/>and ≈øo conjectured that it could be none el≈øe but young Demp≈øey, who had affrighted the poor clergyman into a ≈øit.</p>
               <p>In days of his youth there was a miller, at the wind mill near Ballybritas, a fellow very fit for his purpo≈øe with whom he had picked an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Charles had often been tampering with him to come into his mea≈øures; but the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had imbibed ≈øuch ≈øtrange notions of a Judge, that he thought he mu≈øt be ≈øomething more than mortal, to decide and give judgment on criminal cau≈øes; Nay, he imagined the Judge knew the truth of every complaint that was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, before he heard it; for which rea≈øon, he was afraid of entering into any affair that might bring him before one, 'till he was fully informed what kind of a thing a Judge is. Charles to remove the≈øe ≈øcruples, prevailed on the fellow, who was very de≈øirous of knowing, to go along with him to Mary borough a≈ø≈øizes, where they heard ≈øome cau≈øes tried; which ≈øatisfied the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's curio≈øity ≈øo far, that he told Cahier, as they were returning home, that a Judge was like one of them≈øelves, and nothing el≈øe but a man, and that he would be nothing afraid of entering in the li≈øts with Charles as ≈øoon as he plea≈øed; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the fellow was enli≈øted and put into employment by his ma≈øter.</p>
               <p>By this time Charles had picked up acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in mo≈øt parts of the kingdom for putting his de≈øigns into execution. He fixed five or ≈øix of his own relations in Upper Ormond and O≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and as many in the counties of Leitrim, monag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, and Derry, be≈øides a va≈øt number of receivers
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035355_0084_10049DAA213AC278"/>and a≈ø≈øi≈øtants in almo≈øt every hole and corner in the country; ≈øo that nothing went ami≈øs with him. He had likewi≈øe never le≈øs than four ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices at a time, who were always bound for the term of ≈øeven years and paid a pretty round ≈øum of money for learning his art and my≈øtery, in which he had ≈øuch great ≈økill, that boys were ≈øent to him all the way from the county of Kerry, to be bound. Perhaps he was the fir≈øt Iri≈øh rogue that ever thought of ≈øuch a ≈øtratagem; for had he taken a thou≈øand pounds for teaching a boy to catch or disfigure a hor≈øe or cow only, I que≈øtion whether he could be hanged by our laws for it; and by the ≈øequel, we may ob≈øerve that he always acted in ≈øuch a manner as to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of evading the force of the law, if po≈ø≈øible, though he was as great a rogue as has been hanged.</p>
               <p>He had be≈øides his Satyrs, receivers and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, a number of ≈øpies and ≈øetters, who≈øe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs only was to make ob≈øervations, and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what cattle (and where they) might be mo≈øt ≈øafely conveyed away; and the≈øe had no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Satyrs or drivers them≈øelves. Whenever ≈øuch notice was given to Charles, an expre≈øs was immediately di≈øpatched to ≈øome one or more of the Satyrs, with a de≈øcription of ≈øuch bea≈øt or bea≈øts, which, without any more words, was ≈øufficient to be under≈øtood. By ≈øuch means as this the downright thievery could never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Charles, tho' every body knew that he was receiver general, and that his ≈øervants were all paid by the piece, ≈øo much a bea≈øt for officiating;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035355_0085_10049DABB7F9B640"/>but how Daniel kept his accounts is a ≈øecret.</p>
               <p>He had private places for hiding ≈øtolen cattle of all kinds in; and at any time when he thought proper, would order ≈øuch hor≈øes as came from Lein≈øter ≈øide or Mun≈øter, down to his corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the North, who either would ≈øend them from Derry, Newry, on Donaghadee to Scotland, or otherwi≈øe ≈øwap them off in fairs or ≈øell them. Such hor≈øes, as his corre≈øpondents got in exchange, they made no ≈øcruple of ≈øelling publickly becau≈øe they could prove the getting of them; but tho≈øe that were ≈øtolen in the North were commonly ≈øent to different hands, and were di≈øpo≈øed of in Upper Ormond, O≈ø≈øory, or in Mun≈øter. To ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the reader's curio≈øity, I ≈øhall rehear≈øe one ≈øtory, being part of the confe≈ø≈øion of one of the confederates while he lay in confinement, before he was executed in Kilkenny, which will give a more particular account of his management than the foregoing.</p>
               <p>He confe≈ø≈øed to the people who came to ≈øee him, that one of Charles's ≈øetters come to him by night where he lived, and told him there were three hor≈øes in a park near Clonegal; one was black, with a ≈øtar and one white foot, another a bay gelding, that padded, and the third, a white pad, with his mane and tail cut clo≈øe. He ≈øaid he under≈øtood the me≈ø≈øenger's meaning very well and accordingly conveyed the three hor≈øes down to Glenmalier in two nights after. After that he was pitched upon as the mo≈øt proper per≈øon for di≈øpo≈øing of them, and pur≈øuant to his orders took them down to the country of Monagham but as the white hor≈øe was ≈øo very remarkable
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035355_0086_10049E9F1B77C4D0"/>they ≈øtained him all over with a fle≈øh coloured red, in order to di≈øgui≈øe him, which was done with Brazilet and allum boiled in water; but that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was ≈øoon wa≈øhed off. This fellow was not ≈øo much as known in that country; ≈øo by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of ≈øome of his Brother receivers, he put off the three hor≈øe in a fair, being all ≈øightly cattle to good advantage, for two of them he got twenty pounds, and for the third a mare, that was afterwards ≈øold in the county of Waterford for ≈øix pounds. Some after the owner of the bay-hor≈øe was directed to Charles, in expectation of getting ≈øome tidings of his brea≈øt: but Cahier would not undertake the inquiry, till he was paid two guineas in hand; upon which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to ≈øearch for the hor≈øe. In about twelve days after the hor≈øe was taken out of a ≈øtone park in the night, where the la≈øt purcha≈øer kept him and ≈øo conveyed down to Charles, who gave the right owner notice that they might find ≈øuch a hor≈øe in the wood near the river Barrow; upon which the owner ≈øent his ≈øervant for him, and had him brought home without any compliments. Some time after, the owner was riding to the North to buy linen, and having his hor≈øe with him, he was challenged and ≈øecured till the a≈ø≈øizes; but the owner bringing ≈øufficient evidence that he bred him, and that he had been mi≈ø≈øing all the while the other had him, got the better of the di≈øpute, and took his hor≈øe home again. On the other hand, the purcha≈øer could only prove, that he bought him in a fair, but could not tell from whom; ≈øo by that means the thief was ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ≈øound.</p>
               <p>

By what has been related one may perceive how cunningly his affairs were carried on; and in the next place, I ≈øhall relate ≈øome of his own actions.</p>
               <p>There was an elderly gentleman in the King's County who had a particular humour of his own in ≈øeveral re≈øpects, and when he took a fancy to any thing was commonly ≈øo choice of it, that he would ≈øuffer no one el≈øe to u≈øe it. He had a dun hor≈øe of great ≈øpirit, and a good hunter; which he was ≈øo choice of, that he would not ≈øuffer his ≈øon to ride him. The ≈øon knew the goodne≈øs of the hor≈øe as well as the father, and had ca≈øt a covetous eye upon him, but could not tell how to compa≈øs his de≈øire till he had advi≈øed with Cahier, who gave him proper directions. In con≈øideration of a hand≈øome fee, Charles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided him with the ≈økin of a hor≈øe of the ≈øame colour, and with the like marks of his father's hor≈øe, which was then at gra≈øs. This ≈økin was dipt in a bog-hole and pre≈øented to the father by one of his tenants, as the ≈økin of his gelding, which, they ≈øaid, was drowned in a bog-hole.‚Äî The old man, who had not all the wit in the world, nor any mi≈øtru≈øt of the fraud believed his tenant's report, and took it for a matter of fact. However ≈øome time after the ≈øon, who had kept the hor≈øe concealed, rode on him home, pretended he had bought him in a fair; as ≈øoon as his father ≈øaw him he cried out, "D‚Äî, I vow to G‚Äîd, only my hor≈øe was drownded, I would take my oath that's he for he's as like as ever I ≈øaw any thing in my life," which expre≈ø≈øion pa≈ø≈øed to a ≈øterling joke among the gentlemen of the county
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035355_0088_10049EA25236DB68"/>for a long time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cahier had occa≈øion once to pay his corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dents in the county of Kilkenny a vi≈øit and to examine how the affairs and accounts ≈øtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; where, as he was on his march in the evening, he went into a poor widow's hou≈øe, and demanded a drink of milk, upon which ≈øhe brought him a large drink of butter-milk but di≈øliking it very much, he abu≈øed her to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpo≈øes, and bid her go for ≈øome of the new milk, which ≈øhe refu≈øed, and would not own to have any other than what ≈øhe brought; then he called her a bitch and a whore, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed her over and over, withal ≈øaying ≈øhe ≈øhould pay for that ill u≈øage: And indeed ≈øo ≈øhe did, for before next morning her two cows being all ≈øhe had, were ≈øtolen from her, neither could ≈øhe ger any tidings of them after.</p>
               <p>Much about this time he was in his prime, and kept a place much like an office of intelligence, where his brother Daniel was regi≈øter, who kept an account not only of their corre≈øpondents and place of abode, but likewi≈øe how and for what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bea≈øt was di≈øpo≈øed of: By this means they were able to an≈øwer ≈øuch people as came in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuit of cattle: if they were to be had at all, he generally de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035355_0089_10049EA3F9206B90"/>to before hand, which he ≈øeldom refu≈øed. Now we mu≈øt ob≈øerve, that Cahier never delivered to the owner any bea≈øt that had been ≈øtolen; all he did, was to direct him to go where he might find ≈øuch a one; and this ≈øtratagem was to prevent home proof being given again≈øt him. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, he had the misfortune to be bit even in this re≈øpect, and catched in ≈øuch a trap, that it co≈øt him a ≈øummer's work to get lo≈øe. This was in the year 1729, when the practice was ≈øo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of killing ≈øheep in the night time, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away their ≈økins, carca≈øes, and fat, which they di≈øpo≈øed of in di≈øtant places. This practice was carried on mo≈øtly by di≈øcarded ≈øhepherds (tho' not without Cahier's knowledge) who kept dogs trained ≈øit for the purpo≈øe, with other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</p>
               <p>A gentleman in the country of Kilkenny ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øome cows ≈øtolen from him, employed a tru≈øty ≈øervant to make enquiry from Cahier, who having received his fee, in a ≈øhort time gave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per directions, as he thought, where to find them.

               <p>This ≈øame tinker had been tried for his life, for facts of this kind, both in Naas and Armagh, and found means to get off in both places.

I heard of a very re≈øpon≈øible merchant's son in the county of ‚Äî, that had ju≈øt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a con≈øiderable fortune with his wife, who upon having notice thereof, made preparations for di≈øpo≈øing of all his effects, in order to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe the whole trea≈øure, (crown, jewels and all) and to carry them to France, about the time the late French King was married, expecting to make a million of money by the bargain, and to be able at his return to purcha≈øe the whole country before him; but the gay man his father being a man of better experience in the world, ≈øu≈øpected ≈øome deceit, and (though with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) di≈ø≈øuaded his ≈øon from engaging in ≈øo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a project.</p>
               <p>Manus had ≈øuch good fortune by his ≈øchemes, that in a little time he was able to make a new ingot of real gold, which weighed about twelve ounces, in the ≈øhape of a ≈ømall bar, and this he carried about for a decoy: Be≈øides he was ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by one of his accomplices from Dublin-with bra≈øs bars of the ≈øame ≈øize and form, gilded or covered over ≈øo that any per≈øon not well ≈økill<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Their mo≈øt u≈øual way of impo≈øing on cu≈øtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, was this; after the buyers had been proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of the trea≈øure, and manner of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it and ≈øo wrought up into a firm belief of the certainty thereof, without ≈øhewing any token of mi≈øtru≈øt; then Manus began to expo≈øe the gold bar which he call'd bra≈øs, as a ≈øample of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure,

It happened that while he pa≈ø≈øed thro' this la≈øt county, a man of ≈øome figure purcha≈øed ≈øome of his ingots of bra≈øs for which he paid Manus a pretty round ≈øum of money; in a few days after the gentleman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed his bargain to a gold≈ømith in Dublin, with a de≈øign of converting part of it into plate for his family, and to make money of the re≈øt; but to his ≈øorrow, being thoroughly made ≈øen≈øible of the fraud, he po≈øted home, and upon ≈øearch, had the good fortune of ≈øeizing Manus, whom he got com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Maryborough goal, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under confinement 'till the next a≈ø≈øizes.

               <p>Now he thought every hour a day 'till he got into ≈øome remote place, and ≈øo ha≈øted away with his man Andrew to Connaught, where having no acquaintance, they remained under ≈øome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before they got into a way of getting a livelihood, and ≈øo were under a nece≈ø≈øity of making the former ≈øpoil of the Dublinians main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them (of which they had ≈øtill a good plenty left, drinking wine and brandy very profu≈øely) till at la≈øt Andrew got acquainted with one Dominick D‚Äît, a rich farmer's ≈øon, and a ≈øharp in≈øinuating youth, who was very intimate with ≈øeveral gentlemen in that country. It was beneath a man of Emanuel's fortune to ≈øeek cu≈øtomers him≈øelf, wherefore Andrew was to manage that point, who thinking this young man would make a ≈øit bate for his hook, told him the whole ≈øtory concerning the finding of the trea≈øure, as before related, that for fear of the lord of the manor who heard of it, they fled,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035355_0109_10049EE14A638BC0"/>into that country to conceal it, and to be more private. They were over a cup of liquor at this time, and Farrel pretending to be drunk, called the other a≈øide and ≈øpoke very privately, de≈øir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to let no body know but his neare≈øt friends, who on his account only ≈øhould get good bargains.</p>
               <p>Young D‚Äît was overjoyed at the news, and returned in to talk to Manus, without delay or, ≈øu≈øpicion. Manus knowing his inclinations pulled out his ingot of gold. and ≈øwore the young man to ≈øecrecy, who was charmed with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the metal; and being very de≈øirous that his friends ≈øhould make their fortunes, he brought his uncle to Manus, who told him his u≈øual ≈øtory, (like an ignorant fellow, as he pretended to be) with great artifice and having charged him pretty high with liquor, he got all the man's money, and ≈øent him home with gits in lieu of it; but in ≈øome days having di≈øcovered the fraud, he complained to Dominick's father, and poor Dominick was turned out of doors for his pains: this was what Manus wanted in his heart, and as ≈øoon as he heard thereof, he returned to Cloncumber, a ≈øcrubby i≈øland in the bog of Allen ≈øurrounded with rivers and quagmire: At a ≈ømall di≈øtance from the i≈øland ≈øtands a wood, from which to the i≈øland there is a pa≈ø≈øage, but then a great part of it is commonly covered with water, and very difficult to find; and on the middle of the i≈øland there is a fort, whereon if a man ≈øtands, he may view the country round for ≈øome miles, and ≈øee every body that comes near it. Here he fixed his lodgings, ≈øo that when
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035355_0110_10049EE62F2C6698"/>any that he knew not came on the wood ≈øide, he commonly would take to the bog; but if on the bog ≈øide, to the wood; and here he carried on his game for a long time, never coming out but to make his bargains, and then only in ≈øure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to ≈øuch hou≈øes as he well knew.</p>
               <p>Andrew had given an item to Dominick where they intended to go, who being turned out as afore≈øaid, followed them in expectation of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his money returned; but Manus ≈øhewed him ≈øo many legerdemain tricks that he ≈øoon found it was but in vain to expect any ≈øuch thing, and ≈øo knowing he had no bu≈øine≈øs home without it, he became a di≈ø≈øolute young fellow, and joined his forces along with this new company.</p>
               <p>'Tis true he returned to Connaught, but then it was only as a decoy, and to make a prey of others.

               <head>The Life of James Mac-Faul.</head>
               <p>JAMES MAC-FAUL was born in Carrick-fergus, in the north of Ireland, in the time of the Iri≈øh ma≈ø≈øacre, wherein his father had a great hand, being forward upon all occa≈øions to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and de≈øtroy whatever he could meet with, and did not care what mi≈øchief he did, ≈øo he could but enrich him≈øelf; 'till at la≈øt he was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a detachment from the king's army, and hanged upon the next tree, as an example to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others from ≈øuch cruelties.</p>
               <p>His ≈øon James was brought up by his uncle, and put to ≈øchool under a popi≈øh prie≈øt, but he being very unlucky, could never be kept to his book, as he would run away for a month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'till his uncle not knowing what to do with him, determined to ≈øend him to England, and let him try his fortune, being certain that the boy had a≈ø≈øurance enough to live in any part of the world, and impudence enough to ≈øtick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet Jemmy would not be per≈øuaded to travel, unle≈øs his uncle would equip him with a ≈øword, a pair of dice, and a pack of cards, with which he thought he could do well enough.</p>
               <p>He made the be≈øt of his way to London, but
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035355_0119_10049F178DE1F868"/>found it ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary in his way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ≈øome pilfering robberies, for his better ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, for one of which he was well flogged at Bri≈øtol, and all his uten≈øils, dice and cards taken from him; when not knowing what to do, he had ≈øome thoughts of going to ≈øervice, which he did for a little while; but work not agreeing with him at all, he borrowed a ≈øilver ≈øpoon, and ≈øome other odd trifles, and marched off one evening without taking his leave, and went directly to one of his countrymen, who di≈øpo≈øed of his things, but was angry with him for leaving his place with ≈øo little booty, which James begged him not to take notice of, for another time he ≈øhould find he would do better.</p>
               <p>In a little time after, he got into a noble lord's family, where he behaved for twenty months very well, and got the love of all the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, particularly of Mrs. Betty the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, who was continually treating him with one good thing or other, and he in return, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øing a great deal of love and ≈øincerity; which made the girl grow ≈øo fond of him, that he in a ≈øhort time got all that was in her power to give, and then looked as cold on her as a ≈øinking trade≈øman does on a de≈øperate dun; which Betty perceiving, tried all manner of ways to endear her≈øelf to him, but all to no purpo≈øe, for the young ≈øpark was fallen in love with an ale-hou≈øe man's daughter, where the ≈øervants u≈øed to drink, and entirely for≈øook poor Betty; who, enraged at ≈øuch u≈øage, could not forbear expo≈øing her folly by upbraiding of him, which had no other effect',

               <p>The young tapla≈øh proud of her conque≈øt, that ≈øhe ≈øhould rival one of my lord's maids, ea≈øily gave up her≈øelf to his embraces, and denied him nothing that was in her power to grant, which put Jemmy quite on another footing from the re≈øt of his fellow ≈øervants; ≈øhe keeping the bar had the care of the money, ≈øo that Jemmy had his watch and what not, and appeared as great as ma≈øter any body, and neglected his lord's ≈øervice to follow his gaming tables and whores, for which he ≈øoon lo≈øt his place, and had nothing to depend on, but what he got from his ≈øweet-heart; who continually ≈øupplying his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, reduced her father to ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øities, that he was obliged to confe≈øs a judgment to the brewer, who, a little after, ≈øeized upon all he had, and turned him out of doors.</p>

               <p>This was very unplea≈øant news to the young gentlewoman, who had placed her affections en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon Mac-Faul, who had a very pretty way of addre≈øs, and in him≈øelf was a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable man; and what troubled her mo≈øt of all

               <p>The next time Mac-Faul came to the hou≈øe, the gentleman ≈øhewed him the letter, which he ≈øtifly denied, and prote≈øted it did not belong to him, and ≈øeemed to wonder who ≈øhould put ≈øuck a trick upon him; for he ≈øwore ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand oaths, that he knew no more of it than the man in the moon; but all would not avail, the gentleman civilly de≈øired him to forbear coming to his hou≈øe, till he ≈øhould be better ≈øatisfied from his friends in London, and in the mean time gave his word no man ≈øhould make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his ≈øi≈øter in the way of court≈øhip, till then.

               <p>Mac-Faul made the be≈øt of his way to the bogs and there ≈øheltered him≈øelf among a parcel of rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parees, till he met with an opportunity, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øe, to ≈øhip him≈øelf for England, which he did in the habit of a highlander, and he got ≈øafe to Brecknock in Wales, where he took a lodging at a widow woman's hou≈øe whom he gagged and robbed of about forty ≈øhillings, and bru≈øhed off in the night: from thence cro≈ø≈øed the country, till he came to Shrew≈øbury, where he ≈øtole a nag out of King's-land, and made the be≈øt of his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London, and about two hours after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a country farmer, who was going to pay re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>This unparalleled piece of villainy ≈øoon made a noi≈øe all over the kingdom, upon which a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was i≈ø≈øued out, promi≈øing a hundred pounds reward, to take him dead or alive, which made him fly into France, where he picked Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Richlieu's pocket as he was ≈øaying ma≈øs at St. Dennis's in Paris: which the king perceiving, Gilder Roy made motions to the king, not to take any notice, and he ≈øhould ≈øee good ≈øport; upon which the king let him alone; and after prayers going to the cardinal, he a≈øked him if he had an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> who mi≈ø≈øing his pur≈øe, fell into a great ≈øurpri≈øe; but the king knowing which way it went, fell a laughing; till being tired with laughter, he was willing the cardinal ≈øhould know what was become of it: For the king thinking the thief to be an hone≈øt man, was willing the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ≈øhould have his money again; but Gilder-Roy had more wit in his anger, than to come near either of them; which the cardial finding, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his laughter again≈øt the king, which made him ≈øwear it was the fir≈øt time that ever a thief made him his confederate. Upon this, flying out of France into Spain, he went upon a day of public entertainment to the duke of Medina Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ll's hou≈øe, where ≈øeeing ≈øeveral pieces of plate in a trunk, ready for the ≈øervants to attend their lords with, he dre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in a Spani≈øh habit, like the ≈øteward of the hou≈øe, and de≈øiring the ≈øervants to ≈øit off the trunk, he carried it away.</p>
               <p>By this time Gilder-Roy, thinking all the noi≈øe was over about him in his own country, re≈øolved
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035355_0136_10049F2E75DE5820"/>to go to Scotland again, where he ≈øoon became as notorious a highwayman, as ever was in the country before. He fir≈øt robbed the earl of Lith lingow of a gold watch, a diamond ring, and 80 pieces of gold; by which he became ≈øo terrible, that people were afraid to travel; and when he wanted money, he would go into Athol, Locha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Angeni, Mar, Baqueham; Murrey, Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all over the north, and drive away their cattle, unle≈øs they paid him contributions, which they did quarterly.</p>
               <p>One time Oliver Cromwell embarking at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naghadee, in the North of Ireland, landed at Port-Patrick, in Scotland, which Gilder-Roy hearing of, met him and two ≈øervants in the road to Gla≈øgow, bidding him ≈øtand and deliver; when, after the exchange of ≈øome pi≈øtols, Gilder-Roy made off, and they pur≈øued him, when Gilder-Roy turning ≈øhort, ≈øhot Oliver's hor≈øe, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down broke Oliver's leg; then he killed one of the ≈øervants, and gave the other quarter; which done, finding Oliver lame, he tied his legs under an a≈øs's belly, and ≈øent them both to ≈øeek their fortune.</p>
               <p>Three of his companions being taken, and ≈øent to Gla≈øgow goal, were ordered to be hanged in chains; which Gilder-Roy re≈øenting, he vowed revenge one time or other; and a little after, meeting the judge upon the road to Aberdeen, he ≈øtripped his coachman and two footmen, tied them neck and heels, and threw, them into a pond; he then robbed the judge and killed his four hor≈øes, and carried him to the tree where
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035355_0137_10049F300EEBD6E8"/>his companions hanged, (which in Scotland is like a turn ≈øtile) where upon the fourth beam he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the judge, ≈øaying, "By my ≈øol, mun, as this ≈øtructure, erected to break people's cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length, his villainies grew ≈øo intolerable, that he gloried not only in robbing, but murdering men, ravi≈øhing women, and burning hou≈øes. But a proclamation coming out with a reward of 1000 marks, to take him dead or alive, one Peg Cunnigham, a ≈øtrump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with whom he kept company, betrayed him; when finding him≈øelf ≈øurrounded with 50 men; he ran into her bed-chamber, and ripped up the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot's guts, and then killed 7 of his adver≈øaries, before they could take him; but at la≈øt being overcome, he was taken and carried to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh ca≈øte, where he was kept in irons three days, without victuals or drink, and then hanged without any proce≈øs, on a gibbet 50 feet high, in April 1658, aged 34 years; and afterwards hanged on another gibbet 40 feet high, on the road betwixt Leith and Edinburgh.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035355_0138_10049F3386D9C4D8"/>though in the fir≈øt attempt he had like to have been nipt in the bud; for meeting with a Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and demanding his money, he ≈øaid, "hur has no money of hur own, but has three≈øcore pounds of hur ma≈øter's which hur cannot part with." Quota Tom, you ≈øhall not cant me off thus; money I want, and money I mu≈øt have; hereupon the Welchman give him the money, ≈øaying, "What will you give but none of hur own? pray ≈øhot ≈øhur thro' the coat, that hur ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may ≈øee hur was robbed;" which Tom doing, cots ≈øplutter a nails, ≈øaith Tuffy, this is a pretty pounce; pray give hur another pounce for hur money; which he did; by St. Davy, ≈øaith the Welchman, this is a better pounce than the other; pray give her another; quoth Tom, I have no more; then ≈øaith Taffy, hur has one pounce left for hur, and if hur will not give hur hur money, hur will pounce hur through the body.</p>
               <p>After this, Tom was pretty ≈øucce≈øsful in his villany, for above five years. Once he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for 500 pounds to ≈øave a gentleman that was condemned; hereupon, when ju≈øt as the judge was about to pa≈øs the ≈øentence, he cried out to the bench that he had committed that robbery; upon which the gentleman was cleared and when they came to try him, the evidence not pre≈øuming to ≈øwear again≈øt him, they having ≈øworn po≈øitively again≈øt the other, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted al≈øo.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Tom attacked, on Sali≈øbury plain, the duke of Norfolk, who taking him, carried him to Sali≈øbury goal, where he was condemned; but for money got a reprieve, and at length his

After this he went to ≈øerve a lady in Ormond-≈øtreet, who having a niece coming out of the country, ≈øent Tom to meet her; whom he fir≈øt robbed of her gold watch, diamond-ring, &amp; jewels, and then tied her neck and heels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched her; which being di≈øcovered, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon pur≈øuit the Wedne≈øday following, at Hammer≈ømith, ju≈øt after he had robbed a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of three guineas, and committed to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; from whence he was removed to Bri≈øtol, where he received ≈øentence of death for this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid crime.
