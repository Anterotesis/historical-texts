            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO WHICH IS ADDED, THE GOLD-FINDER: Or, the Hiſtory of Manus Mac Oneil, who under the Appearance of a ſtupid, ignorant Country Fellow, (on the Bog of Allen, by the help of his Man Andrew) played the moſt notorious Cheats, and remarkable Tricks on the People of Ireland, that ever was known.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SO great a prevalence has cuſtom, that to ſee an Engliſh book without a Preface, is as ſtrange a ſight as a bull without horns, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of his defence. If this little Hiſtory of the Iriſh Robbers has any occaſion of a Preface, it can only be to obviate one objection that may be made by cavillers againſt it, viz. <q>Rogues merit no commendation; and therefore men ought to be cautious of introducing their actions in Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, leſt it ſhould be an encouragement to others to follow their example:</q> But I can aſſure the Reader, that my intention is quite different: I have wrote with no other deſign than to diſcourage young men from falling into ſuch company as may lead them into a ſhameful way of living, which often brings them to an ill end, and leaves a reproach upon their family, who may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. We may obſerve the great Redmond O'Hanlon, though he lived a merry life, yet it was but ſhort, and attended with ſuch dangers and fear, that he could have but little ſatisfaction, and at length he became ſuch an odium, that one of his own relations, for the lucre of a reward, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him out of the world as he lay aſleep. How ſafely, then can an outlawed rogue leave
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035355_0003_10049CABAEE2F1E8"/>his life in the power of another, when induced not only by the promiſe of a reward, but for the ſake of pardon to give information? And if a man has occaſion to diſtruſt his own comrades, with how much diſſatisfaction muſt he live? It is true, he may riot for a while, but let him take care, <q>leſt (according to the Pſalmiſt) he be cut off in his wickedneſs, and die in his ſins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope the following Hiſtory may alſo be of ſervice to honeſt men of all profeſſions, who may happen to have dealings, though at unawares, with ſuch kind of cattle as are here treated of.— By making ourſelves acquainted with their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and ways of management, we may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to know how to diſcover their wiles, and break their meaſures. When a man is forewarn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, if he does not ſore-arm himſelf, I believe all men will think him blame-worthy. I am ſure this is my opinion, who am a well wiſher to all men.</p>

After his parents had given him the beſt education the time and place afforded, they obtained for him a ſmall poſt in the army, where he ſerved a few years with pretty good credit, though very young, 'till the reduction of the Iriſh forces in this kingdom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which our Redmond was one.</p>
               <p>The nation being reduced by the Engliſh fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, ſeveral Iriſh families, who had a hand in the wars of Ireland were diſpoſſeſſed, and their lands forfeited; by which means a very great alterae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion was made in this family, and ſeveral of thn O'H—ns were obliged to travel, in hopes of retrieving their fortunes. But poor Redmond, in this unhappy condition, once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſafety, ſtaid abroad for a long time, ſtill refuſing to come to trial 'till he was outlawed, which put him to his ſhifts. But our hero ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received ſome inſtructions in the art of war, and being naturally of an undaunted courage,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035355_0006_10049CB6D3C6B6B0"/>was eaſily led into the ſecret of invading other men's properties, both on the highway, and by breaking open of houſes, till he had acquired as much money as might have put him in a way to live above the frowns of fortune, with good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, all his life.</p>
               <p>But ſeeming to reliſh this new courſe of life more than the former, he proceeded in his rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, 'till from an infancy in the art, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one of the moſt notorious and expert of that profeſſion that had ever been bred in the kingdom of Ireland. He had made himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the bye paſſages in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and he knew all the lurking places on the mountains of Newry and Sle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He was ſtrong and active, and as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, could perform his feats either on foot or on horſeback: but though he was ſo notorious a plunderer, he was naturally of a very generous diſpoſition, frequently giving ſhare of what he got from the rich to relieve the poor in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. His remarkable actions and ſurpriſing attempts, ſpread his character through all the country; and being joined by a great number of his former acquaintance (adventerous lads who became his aſſociates ſpontaneouſly) 'till his company was augmented to fifty effective men, moſtly his own relations, he then began to take upon a captain's command, and appointed a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035355_0007_10049CB8949666A8"/>to act in every province, who were always to return (barring accidents) four times a year to their general place of rendezvous and give an account of their ſucceſs, and as ſoon as the booty was regularly divided, each brigade was ordered to exchange poſts, and to march out on duty again. This was their conſtant practice for ſome years, by which policy they kept themſelves concealed much longer than they otherwiſe could have done. However, there was no robbery committed any where at all in the kingdom but was attributed to Captain O'H—n, though it is probable he might be an hundred miles diſtant at the ſame time: nay, ſo well was his character eſtabliſhed, and ſo notorious his actions, that it became a common proverb, when any man had a mind to brand another with infamy and ſcandal, for him to ſay, "You are as great a rogue as Redmond O'H—n."</p>

To whom the pedlar replied, "Teat damn'd rogue of a Redmond O'H—n has robbed me of above five pounds in money, which was all I had; and that would not ſatisfy him either, but he has taken my box away too; and becauſe I ſtrove to hold it, he knocked me down, and abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me like a dog." Redmond incenſed at ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035355_0008_1004997BB83A2A40"/>language, had hardly patience to hear him tell out his ſtory before he interrupted him, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a raſcal and a lying ſon of a whore.— 'How could I rob you you, (ſaid he) that never ſaw you before?

               <p>Redmond had a much greater antipathy to the Engliſh than to the Scotch or Iriſh; for he was always kind to his country men, and made a bargain both with them and the North country pedlars, and all ſuch as acknowledged his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction all over the kingdom; alledging for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that as he was a reduced gentleman, he hoped his country men would not refuſe to pay him tribute towards his maintenance, upon his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035355_0010_10049CC24F3DFA40"/>were ſure to pay for it. Such as made this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with him, had their names regiſtered in his pocket-book, and were ſo little afraid of loſing any of their goods by robbers, that they thought their effects as ſafe in the field as in the houſe; for if at any time they happened to have any thing ſtolen, upon application to Redmond, he would make the moſt diligent ſearch that could poſſibly be made through all parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till he found it and reſtored it to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and if he falled to find it, always allowed his benefactor two years ſalary to compenſate the loſs. But he had ſo many emiſaries, and ſuch good intelligence, and all other petty rogues were ſo much afraid of him and his party, that none of them dared diſoblige him; and beſides, every robber was ſerved with a copy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered names, and had ſtrict orders not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing that belonged to ſuch, but to aſſiſt the loſer in ſearching for their goods: ſo that his friends ſeldom ſuffered under his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Having once got cold, upon ſome deſperate occaſion, it threw him into a dangerous fever, of which he recovered; yet the place being damp where he lay, he loſt the uſe of his limbs, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035355_0011_10049CC406C9E270"/>continued a cripple or lame for ſome years: yet during this time he was preſerved among his friends, who had a great eſteem for him, and eſcaped from being taken, though he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a tory and a robber, and a reward of fifty pound was offered for taking of him, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned frequent ſearches after him. He likewiſe was punctually paid his ſalary or tribute by his benefactors or allies (except a few who broke the truce, but dearly paid for it after) though robberies were not ſo frequent during his illueſs as before, ſo that he was under a neceſſity of making his pay maintain him 'till he was able to go about again.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had recovered the uſe of his limbs, he took the field again, and ſcoured all the roads roads in the country, ſometimes alone, and ſometimes with company, and took ſpecial care to revenge himſelf on all thoſe who had neglected to ſend him his yearly penſion while he was out of order; but found himſelf ſo cloſely hunted, that he fixed his head quarters at or about the bog of Allen for a conſiderable time, where he committed ſuch a number of notorious robberies, that the country was obliged to keep under arms to guard their effects. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taking this into conſideration, a freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was iſſued out, offering a reward of two hundred and fifty pound for the taking of him; upon which ſeveral attempts were made to ſecure him, but to no effect: though he was once taken in bed near Clonbullock; but had the good fortune to be reſcued by his comrades, as his captors were leading him to Naas goal.</p>

Though he was very well acquainted all over the kingdom, yet he was loath to venture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any longer in this place, and among ſtrangers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Soon after his return, he was in company with ſome of his aſſociates beyond Armagh, where they met with cornet Montgomery's ſteward, who having received about 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> from his maſter's tenants on an eſtats he had in that country, was carrying it home to his own houſe near Killevan, in the country of Monaghan, where he dwelt. Redmond ſtood at a little diſtance all the time of the action, and obſerved the diſpute on both ſides, and the defence made by the ſteward, which tho' he maintained it with bravery for ſome time, yet he was overpowered by numbers, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to deliver his purſe to ſave his life. When the boots was divided, captain O'H—n made a preſent of his part to the cornet's young ſon, who was at nurſe in the ſame place, which he ſent by the ſteward, with ſtrict order to deliver it, and took his acknowledgment for the ſame payable on demand. This he did out of a pure regard that he had for the cornet, on account of ſome favour that he had done him formerly: and the cornet to make him a requital for ſo generous an action, made a promiſe that he would uſe his beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to obtain the king's pardon for him, in hopes of his forſaking his new trade; and was as good as his word, as by the ſequel will appear.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035355_0013_10049CCAAE8CEA78"/>
A little after this action, a merchant in Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk had a draught on a merchant in Newry for a large ſum, but was ſo much in dread of Redmond OH—n, that he was afraid either to ſend for the money, or to go for it himſelf: while he was thus conſulting with his wife how to get the money ſafely home, his apprentice, a lad about ſixteen years of age, overheard their diſcourſe, and as ſoon as he got an opportunity, deſired his maſter to tell him why he was ſo much afraid of ſending to Newry? The maſter having anſwered his requeſt, the boy aſked him whether he would venture to truſt him with ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? The maſter ſaid he did not doubt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, but on that occaſion he could not tell what to think of the matter: However, by many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, the boy prevailed on the maſter to let him go for the money, promiſing to forfeit his ears if he loſt one halſpenny of it. The boy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained privilege to go for the money, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet about prepating himſelf for the journey; and by his n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

They boy told him to Newry, 'Pray what buſineſs have you there? ſays Redmond. Why, ſays the boy, to receive about 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> for my maſter. And when do you think you'll be back? ſays Redmond. Why, ſays the boy, I believe about this time to-morrow. Well, my good boy, ſays Redmond, you had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter take care not to tell every body what year buſineſs is, for fear you ſhould be robbed. Oh, ſays the boy, I am ſure ſuch a gentleman as you would not too me; I don't intend to tell any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe.' Upon this Redmond made him a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a ducat to drink his health or to hite another horſe, if the one he had under him ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ld tire; and ſo they parted good friends for that time.</p>
               <p>Redmond was then under ſome neceſities for a little money; and as none of his companions were preſent at the dialogue, he was reſolved not to let them know any thing of the matter, that he might have all the booty to himſelf: And to make himſelf the more ſure of the prey, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his comrades to a different poſt the next morning, and waited himſelf alone on the road leading from Newry, 'till the boy returned.</p>
               <p>When they boy came in ſight Redmond rode up and ſaluted him, and, after ſome diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſk him the neceſſary queſtion about the money.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035355_0015_10049CCFA336E868"/>after a ſhort parley, the other began to demand with ſome authority, and would have taken hold of him had he not been ſomething afraid of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a kick from the mad horſe. Among other excuſes, the boy alledged that his maſter would think that he had made away with the money himſelf and deem him a rogue, for which reaſon he could not part with it; but at length, Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond threatning to ſhoot him if he refuſed any longer, the boy took his wallet, and caſt it over a ſlough by the road ſide, and told Redmond that if he muſt have it, he ſhould follow it. Upon this Redmond alighted from his horſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tied him to a tree, with ſome difficulty he got over the ſlough and thro' the hedge, to the place where the wallet lay. While he was upon this expedition the boy exchanged horſes much for the better, and rode home with ſpeed, having the money he had received at Newry ſafely quilted up in his waiſtcoat and tho' Redmond cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after him to ſtay, with all the cagerneſs in the world, yet he took no further notice of him, but left him to make the beſt hand he could of an old garren and a bag of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this Redmond was preſented with the king's protection for three year, on trial of his good behaviour, by cornet Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035355_0016_10049CD14810DD78"/>good behaviour for the term granted aforeſaid, he might have obtained a general pardon, yet this honeſt way of living did not reliſh well with him; he had an itch to be at the old game, and accordingly began it before the admitted time was expired, growing ten times more wicked and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortous than ever he had been before.</p>
               <p>In imitation of Oliver Cromwell, lord protector of the common-wealth, he took upon him either the title of protector of the rights and properties of his benefactors contributors, chief ranger of the mountains, ſurveyor general of the highroads of Ireland, or lord-examiner of all paſſengers, committing ſuch villainies, and barbarities on ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy travellers, as he called them as, were never heard of before; often driving away whole herds of cattle from ſuch in contempt of his protection and authority, had given offence by running in arrear; tho' he never uſed any ill that did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him.

                  </gap> he ſeldom robbed a poor man, but on the contrary was always generous to men in neceſſity or diſtreſs—'Tis ſaid that having once overtaken a poor man who had hardly any thing elſe leſt but one cow, which he was driving to a fair to be ſold, in order to raiſe the rent for his landlord, he aſked him ſeveral queſtions, 'till he found certainly that he was in want, and then lent him five pounds, which he was to pay him at an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>a few weeks after: The poor man prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly honeſt, went with the money accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to compact; which pleaſed Redmond ſo well, that he beſtowed it on him and five pounds more for ever.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035355_0017_10049CD785AD9530"/>
He was likewiſe very generous to a ſoldier, if he met him alone, and underſtood the art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, on diſguiſing himſelf, as well as any man; ſometimes appearing like an officer, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a country gentleman, and ſometimes like a footman, and could after the tone of his voice at pleaſure; ſo that the ſoldiers ſeldom knew him, tho' he often gave them money to drink, unleſs he diſcovered himſelf. The duke of Ormond, in his time, ordered out a ſmall party of foot and horſe, to purſue him, who being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med where he was, but not miſtruſting his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, went after him immediately. Redmond perceiving how it was, dreſſed himſelf like an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and went quietly along the high road, often looking cack wards, 'till he ſaw the red coats at a good diſtance behind him; then he haſtened to a gentleman's houſe near the road, and told him he was an officer who was ſent out with a party of men in purſuit of Redmond O'H—n, but being a little fatigued, made bold to call and red him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf 'till his men came up; then deſiring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the houſe to call him as ſoon as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, he ſtretehed himſelf down to reſt. The ſoldiers had not gone above an hundred yards paſt the end of the avenue, before Redmond went out in pretence of meeting them at a ſure by the road ſide a quarter of a mile off; but his intent was to make his eſcape another way, which he had for that time unperceived.</p>
               <p>Not long after he appeared in Armagh in the habit of a country gentleman, and requeſted of the commanding officer there to let him have a few men to guard him about eight miles further,

In this manner they followed him 'till noon, without giving him time to reſt, but at length, ſeveral of them begining to lag, the chace was only maintained by four, who kept ſo nigh him as to have him in view now and then the greateſt part of the day, notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they had to ſurmount in aſcending the hills. In the evening he hid himſelf in a knot of furze, about half a mile from a ſmall village, where ſeveral of his friends lived, intending to convey himſelf thither in the night expecting that the ſoldiers would have gone on, and have ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the village before it grew quite dark: but here he was entirely miſtaken, for his purſuers (tho' he had out ran them near half a mile) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on looſing ſight of him, ſuſpected that he had hid himſelf, and having fited a ſhot for a ſignal wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted near they place where they had miſſed him 'till the whole company came up and then made a very diligent ſearch, but to no purpoſe: upon this they held a freſh conſultation, not many yards from they place where Redmond lay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſit down and make a repaſt of what proviſion they had and to lie under cover 'till morning.

But Redmond looking behind him, tho' he was exceeding hungry, altered his courſe, &amp; the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit was renewed with great warmth, inſomuch that Redmond had not time to refreſh himſelf all day long and was obliged to hide himſelf next e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening in the top of a mountain, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained 'till break of day, and then, being almoſt famiſhed with hunger, went to one of his friend's houſes to get ſomething to eat.</p>
               <p>At his coming up to the door, one of the dogs began to bark, which alarmed the purſuers in the center, who lay not far off; whereupon they all came up in a body and ſurrounded the houſe, juſt as Redmond fat down with a cake of bread, ſome butter, and a can of milk before him. It was now the third day ſince he had got a morſel, and being almoſt ſpent for want of food, was juſt going to put the firſt bit in his mouth, when the captain of the little army appeared at the door with a very kind ſalutation, which Redmond, tho' under the greateſt ſurprize) returned with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like air, 'Mr. O'H—n, (ſaid the officer) I am glad to have overtaken you; we have been in purſuit of you near three days with the king's warrant, and at laſt are come up with you; now, ſir, you are the king's priſoner; get ready, for you muſt come along with us.' Redmond repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſir, I acknowledge that I am your priſoner and ſhall comply with your orders immediately; but,

The privilege was readily granted him, reſting on their arms, while the other twelve guarded the houſe on all ſides without, 'till Redmond had done; then he ſtarted up, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his blunderbuſs in his hand, and preſenting it to the officer, ſaid, 'Now you take me for your priſoner, and I don't deny it; but you muſt give me a little play, that the world ſhould not have it it to ſay that I was taken ſo ſilly; you bear the title of captain, ſo do I; if you refuſe to give me horſe room and car-room, I'll diſcharge my piece at you this inſtant, and you ſhall die with me.

This language ſurpriſed the officer, who ſeemed to give way a little, as tho' he had a mind to conſent; upon which Redmond forced out of the door, and ran for his life.

'till a writ of outlawry was iſſued out againſt him, ſo that he thought himſelf not ſecure in any public place. There had been ſome difference between him and his brother before that, and being ſomewhat diſguſted, his

He was at length prevailed upon to try his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on the highway, and had great luck; but was never obſerved to abuſe any travellers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they oppoſed him. Some offers were made for granting him his pardon; yet he was afraid to come in, and continued a ſurvey or of the roads till his death.</p>
               <p>After his refuſal of accepting the King's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a proclamation was iſſued out, and a reward offered for taking him; but he ſtill purſued his uſual courſes, till his character was thoroughly eſtabliſhed. It once happened that an enſign in Cork was informed that Captain P—r was drinking alone at an ion on the road leading from Kilworth, and hearing that there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of forty pounds offered for apprehending him, he went out within file or two of muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who all entered the houſe in the evening, before P—r was aware.

               <p>Capt. P—r made ſome advances after this, in Lienſter, where coming one evening to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure farmer's houſe, expecting to get a night's lodging, he obſerved that the man and his wife were in deep ſorrow, which occaſioned him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the cauſe of their grief. After many pauſes the farmer at laſt told him, that having run in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears with the landlord, he had cauſed him to be ſerved with an ejectment, and that in a few days he would be turned out of poſſeſſion, and all the effects he had taken from him; upon this P—r took compaſſion on them, and grew more and more ſolicitous, 'till he found out what day the landlord intended to take poſſeſſion. Then he aſk'd the farmer, "whether he had any friend at all that would endeavour to help him?" The farmer ſaid he knew of none. Then ſaid P—r, "If a friend ſhould be ſo kind as to lend ſo much money (which he underſtood to be about ſixty pounds) as would clear your landlord, would you repay it again of you could." "Indeed, ſaid the farmer, I would if I could." Well then, ſays P—r, here is the ſum; I'll be your friend ſo far as to lend it to you only upon our own note;" which he gave him, promiſing not to let his landlord know that he had any money 'till he had made all the excuſes that were poſſible, ſay even ſo far as to let him begin to drive the cattle and turn him out of poſſeſſion. This paſſed on very well till the landlord came with
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035355_0038_10049CEE8106A260"/>the Sheriff, in order to poſſeſs himſelf: and after the tenant delayed as long as it was ſafe, he at laſt told him, that a friend of his had left ſo much money with him to keep, and rather than be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a beggar, he would give it to his landlord and let his friend wait 'till he could riſe it.</p>
               <p>The landlord accepted the money; but was obliged to give an acquittance in full for all rent and arrears whatſoever, and then, after having abuſed his tenant and called him a rogue and a villain ſeveral times, becauſe he did not pay the money long before that, thinking it was his own, he mounted his horſe and rode home-wards, the Sheriff having taken another way.</p>
               <p>P—r in diſguiſe way-laid the landlord on the road, and took all the caſh, with a watch, and ſome other things of value, from him; and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his tenant two or three days afterwards, told him his money was unlucky, for he had loſt it, every penny, and a good deal more with it, on the road, being taken from him by an highway robber, whom he deſcribed as well as he could, not remembering ever to have ſeen him. In leſs than a week, P—r called at the farmer's houſe dreſſed as he was at firſt, in order to ſee how he fared. The farmer told him the whole ſtory, and how that his landlord was robbed (which he was little ſorry for) on the road. He entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed P—r very handſomely that night (not miſtruſting that he was the robber) and gave him a thouſand thanks for the uſe of his money, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to raiſe it for him as ſoon as he could. P—r ſeeing the man's intregrity, deſired him to be under no concern for it; then tearing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035355_0039_10049CF015CA6650"/>the note to pieces, bid the farmer adieu.</p>
               <p>We have but an imperfect account of the reſt of the actions of his life. However, by all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, he was very generous to the poor, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told the rich that he took their purſes to make a diſtribution among ſuch as were in want. He was at laſt betrayed, for a ſmall reward by his brother's ſervant maid, who ſeeming to be his friend, ſat drinking with him at an alchouſe near Cork, 'till the got an opportunity of pouring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the pans of his blunderbuſs and piſtols, and then ſent privately for the guards, who ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the houſe and made him apriſoner. He was taken to Cork bound, and being there tried and found guilty, was according executed, much about the time that Redmond O'H—n came firſt in vogue. He was only dubbed a captain, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his exploits, by the reſt of the ſociety.</p>

By woman (ſaid he) was I enticed to continue in ſin, and by a woman was I at laſt betrayed, tho' ſhe pretended to be my friend. Which ſpeech melted the ſpectators into tears.</p>

At about twenty years of age he arrived in England, and ſoon got into a gang of thieves, among whom he was known by a number of names, as Macquire, Ballie, Iriſh Teague, &amp;c. but in the firſt attempt which he made at houſe breaking, he diſcovered as great a capacity for that undertaking as ever the great Charles Dempſy did at horſe ſtealing.</p>
               <p>For having made a combination with three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rogues, they broke into a gentleman's houſe at Frentwood in Eſſex, and binding all the people, took away four diamond rings, a great quantity of plate, and about 600 <abbr>l.</abbr> in money; this was the firſt attempt, and tho' he had but three to aſſiſt him, they overpowered no leſs than ten men and boys, without making the leaſt diſturbance, and tied them every one in ſuch a manner that one could not relieve another: by which means Teague and his gang had ſufficient time to make off.</p>
               <p>After this Macquire, with one aſſiſtant, broke into chancellor Jeffreys's houſe at Weſtminſter, and ſtole the purſe and mace, which he made his comrade carry on his ſhoulder thro' the park to the houſe where they lodged, and then locked them up in a cloſet; but ſome of the jewels that were in the purſe happened to fall out in the chamber, and Macquire, being gone into the

When he arrived to man's eſtate he enliſted himſelf a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in lord Gal way's regiment, and went with the army to Spain, where they had not been long before he deſerted to the Spaniards, as his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So great was his fame at laſt, that he outwitted the famous Dr. Thornhill, who offered to be his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Andrew, upon condition that he would teach him his Iriſh aſſurance, but whether Thornhill did it to get rid of his ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While he was in this company, they had the good fortune one morning to meet with a fat, luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, medicant fryar whom they robbed, taking from him to the value of 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr> which he was going to carry to Modena for the widow of the late King James II. queen dowager of England; but the captain of the gang dividing the booty, ordered Butler but a ſmall part not half his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſtomached him ſo much that he left them, and went to Florence, and by this time had learned to ſpeak both Spaniſh and Italian. While he was at Florence, his curioſity led him to go and ſee a man executed, where he ſingled out a young gentleman, with whom he had ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabulation; and among the reſt of his diſcourſe, he ſaid, 'the man was a fool for ſuffering himſelf to be taken.' At theſe words, the gentleman taking him to be a man of reſolution, carried him to a tavern, and having ſounded him pretty well, offered him 500 pieces of gold to murder an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his, that he might enjoy his eſtate. B—r aſſented to the propoſal, and went immediately to one of the banditti, with whom he agreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter of the murder; and taking him along with him, about eleven o'clock at night, to the old man's houſe, they made a quick diſpatch of his life. This being done and the reward paid

               <p>But having thus committed three murders, the rumour whereof ſpread far and near, he grew a little afraid of his mother's calf-ſkin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>JOHN MULHONI was born in Connaught; but our author (not being willing to expoſe his family, which on his mother's ſide was of ſome repute) has concealed both his parents and the place of his birth.

Being out of employment in London he ſoon found out ways of exonera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his pockets of the pay he had received for his ſervice, and returned into Ireland to viſit his friends, in a very mean condition, which gave them a ſuſpicion of his ill management, and cauſed them to take but little notice of him. Diſguſted at ſuch treatment, he ſought new company, and ſoon became acquainted with one Cahoon, a game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and perhaps not much richer than himſelf, who furniſhed him with materials for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;

During the time of his familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with this gentlewoman, he picked up acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Smith, Butler, and Campbell, whom he afterwards aſſiſted in committing many robberis on Finchly Common and other places, 'till Smith and Campbell quarrelling about dividing the prey, Campbell was killed in the fray, which diſſolved the knot.</p>
               <p>Then Mulhoni and Carick picked up Daniel Carrol as a man fit and proper for making a third perſon, being of a daring ſpirit, and fit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any enterprize; and with his aſſiſtance they robbed Mathew Joncour, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on Epping forreſt, from whom they took twenty guineas, two dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond rings and his and his lady's watches.</p>
               <p>Soon after this they met with the Cambridge and Huntingdon ſtage-coaches, which they ſound pretty well filled with perſons of diſtinction, from whom they took a conſiderable booty, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

This put Carrick into ſo great a panick, that he reſolved to forſake ſo dangerous a way of living. and adviſed his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to do the like: 'till Mulhoni upbraided him with cowardice, ſaid. "Sink or ſwim, I'll go on with the game 'till I get money enough to make a figure in my own country," which occaſioned Carrick to alter his intentions, and make a new league with his comrades; ſo ſwearing upon the holy evangeliſts to be ever true to one another, they proceeded, and took poſſeſſion of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way once more. But to be more private than before they took a lodging at Wapping, where they had not continued ſong before they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have buſineſs in Scotland, and were ſeveral times making a ſham agreement with Adrian Van Stoken to carry them thither in his veſſel: But while this was in agitation, they took notice that a Norway maſter lodged a bag of 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> in their landlord's hands, who was a ſlopſeller, and having obſerved where he laid it, they ſet their heads together to contrive how to bring it off

               <p>But Jonathan Wild, who was likely to be a great ſufferer by this action, offered a reward of 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> to take them for the fact; upon which, not thinking themſelves ſafe here, they removed to Oxford, where Carrick happened to ſee Dr. Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a coffee houſe whom they had formerly robbed.

Carrol ſeemed poſitively bent to forſake his old courſes and go back to Ireland among his friends; but Mulhoni and Carrick over-ruled him, and perſuaded him to return with them to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don again, where they arrived in a little time: But the daily inſtances of the ſeizures of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way men, and conſtantly hanging them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſmall favour Iriſhmen were ſhewn by Engliſh juries. inſomuch that it became a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, "an Iriſhman's name is enough to hang him."

By and ſuch like ſtratagems, they ſeldom paſſed a week whenever they were in want, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſure of ſome conſiderable Prize.</p>
               <p>It was cuſtomary with them when they met a chair conveniently with any one in it, for two of them to ſtop the men that carried it, while the third robbed the gentleman; but when they made an attack on a coach with but one ſervant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, one was ordered to each ſide, and to have an eye on the footman, whiſe the third ſtopped the driver till the ſeat was performed. After this manner they robbed a Scotch gentleman, whom they had obſerved to receive a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in gold, from a banker near Hungerford mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; and after that a lady in a chair within three or four doors of her own houſe in Park place as ſhe was returning from paying the counteſs of Walſingham a viſit in St. James's palace, from

The next they took into the ſecret, as they called it, was an old cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who had been viſiting a young lady in Great Albemarleſtreet, from whom they took a diamond ring and a gold watch, but no money, the young lady having prevailed on him, to leave that with her.</p>
               <p>The ſixth adventure was at Marybone in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1721, where obſerving that a baronet with one ſervant attending him had received a large purſe of gold, they dogged him on his way home to a field, near the bordered houſe, and took above 200 guineas from him, with ſome ſilver, a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ring and a watch, then giving the ſilver to his man, they padded the hoof and made their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: However the gentleman advertiſed the robbery, offering a larger reward for the watch (in the news papers.) than it could be ſold for; upon which they ſent it privately to the place appointed for receiving it, and got the reward, without being aſked any queſtions.</p>
               <p>The next robbery they committed was in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember following (and as they fully propoſed ſhould be their laſt) when having moved their quarters nearer to Convent-Garden, in order to be leſs remote from the gambling tables, in and about the little Piazza, Bow-ſtreet, Charles-ſtreet, and

The firſt attempt they made afterwards was but in vain, having dogged two gentlemen in their chairs, from thence into Taviſtock-ſtreet, to no purpoſe: but agreeing to meet again at the Roſe the night following, they ſtaid there until it grew pretty late, and then went out in queſt of prey.

               <head>The Hiſtory of Charles Dempſey, alias Cahier na Cappul, the renowned horſe-ſtealer.</head>
               <p>THE father of this Cahier was a man of as great note among the rapparees, in the reign of King James, as any that ever eſcaped the gallows; tho' after the kingdom was reſtored to its former privileges by king William's forces, he left off that practice pretty much, and lived like the reſt of his countrymen. He had ſeveral ſons there whereof afterwards became very notorious, viz. Daniel, Charles and Luke. Daniel was put to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035355_0076_10049D967A0F4030"/>ſchool in his youth, 'till he obtained the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good ſcholar; but not being fond of going abroad to finiſh his ſtudies, choſe to ſtay at home and lead the life of his brother, rather than be put into orders, (for he was intended for a prieſt.) When he arrived to mans's eſtate, he was too eaſily drawn into be a clerk and regiſter to his his brother Cahier, who could neither read nor write; and at length, by following his pattern, was brought to the gallows, and executed along with him in Auguſt 1735. Their brother Luke would have had the ſame fate, only that he fled the country, tho' he never arrived to half the dexterity of Charles in the art of horſe hiding. They all underſtood the canting language pretty well, yet made no uſe of it but upon proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which made ſeveral of their neighbours think there was more laid to their charge than they deſerved, 'till time made the truth manifeſt. But as our deſign here is only to give the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Charles Dempſey, let us omit circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and proceed.</p>
               <p>This Charles Dempſey, alias Cahier na Cappul was born on the lands of Glenmalier, near Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librittas, in the Queen's County, and in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was kept moſtly at his foſter-father's, where he learned to ſpeak Iriſh, but little or no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. From his infancy, it was obſerved that he was much addicted to lying and defrauding his companiona, little children, out of their play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and was ſo extraordinary fond of horſes and riding, that before he arrived to the age of five years, be could ride and ſtick on a wild horſe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035355_0077_10049D98149ACBA8"/>better thau a great many men; a thing ſeldom known. 'Tis an old proverb, and commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, "that he that is born to be bang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will never be drowned." Nor has it been more apparently verified in the life of any perſon than in his, for at the age aforeſaid, being prompted by his natural inclinations to ride one three years old colt, he perſuaded a man, to put him on his back, tho' he had nothing but a collar on his head; but not being any way capable of managing the young beaſt, he ran headlong' with him into the Barrow, and ſwam it, tho' there was a very high flood, and the ſtream rapid: He held his grip by the mane very well till he got to the further ſide, but ſtriving to land at a bad place, the bank broke under the beaſt's breaſt, and ſunk with it under water for a moment, and poor Charles was waſhed off with the current, which carried them both down the river near 50 yards, till the colt found footing, and plunged out; yet he held a faſt grip of the collar till he got on dry ground, tho' he was ſhortly after taken up for dead, and with ſome difficulty recovered. After this he uſed frequently to ſay, in Iriſh, he would not fear drowning if he were to ſail in a turf kiſh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he afterwards any thing afraid of the Barrow water, for he made ſeveral dangerous adventures acroſs to eſcape the hands of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers.</p>
               <p>As he grew more cautious of pilfering publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than when he was young (not that he thought it any ſin, but in dread of the law) he managed his affairs ſo cunningly as to lay the facts always on others, becauſe he had an inveterate hatred to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035355_0078_10049D99AA03DFE8"/>the gallows and the court-houſe after Sir Toby's death.</p>
               <p>From a child he had an ill-favoured aſpect, and in his countenance betrayed a deceitful heart, that is, he always carried a rogue's face, tho' his brother Daniel was a handſome portly man, and of ſeemly behaviour. His Engliſh was but broken at beſt, and ſometimes he pretended to none at all, as will appear by the ſequel: And as the ſaying is, Save a thief from the gallows and he'll cut your throut, ſo it was with him; for his ingratitude was ſo great, and he had ſo tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fidelity, that he made no ſcruple of accuſing his neareſt relations, or even his landlord, nay perſons no ways guilty or concerned, to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>At the age of twelve years he began to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the art of decoying and catching horſes, in which he acquired ſo much ſkill, that he made no difficulty of laying hands on the wildeſt colt, and horſes that had been handled, ſeemed to fall into his clutches of their own accord. Perhaps ſome reader would expect that I ſhould give a particular account of his management in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, but as our intent in publiſhing this hiſtory, is only to put honeſt people on their guard againſt robbers and rogues, it can be no way neceſſary, neither it expedient to teach a thief how to catch a horſe, or to ſteal: If I can ſhew an honeſt man how to outwit a rogue, or put a trick on him, 'tis as much as can be expected; and verily that was my chief deſign in publiſhing this book.</p>
               <p>But it fame be true, it will be entirely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to mentionany particulars: the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035355_0079_10049D9B6B306968"/>will have and family do believe it was by a kind of witcharaſt, or charm, that he decoyed and entrapped horſes, and taught others to do ſo; and the affirm that he received this charm from a witch in the county of Monaghan, (with whom he was very intimate) for ſome ſingular ſervices he had done her. However, the following relation will make it ſeem probable that his father before him had the like charm; for which reaſon, I'm more than half inclined to diſſent from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar opinion, and conclude, that this magic was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the family, and runs in the blood.</p>
               <p>The ſtory was related by a gentleman thus:</p>
               <p>"In the beginning of queen Ann's reign, I went to ſee a friend of mine near Abbeleix, and having arrived at the place, I walked about the fields in the evening alone, and when I came near to the bog, I found I had occaſion to eaſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I choſe a convenient place under a hedge for that purpoſe, but before I had finiſhed the diſcharge of my office, there appeared thro' the hedge a man before me, driving ſome horſes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quietly into a corner, one whereof he took hold of him by the near foreleg, and held him faſt 'till he threw a ſhert rope about his neck, then he vaulted on him with more agility than ever I ſaw a miller do on his ſacks: In this poſture with a long ſtick in his hand, he drove the colt (he was never handled before) acroſs the bog, till he got out of my ſight, plunging and leaping to ſuch a degree all the way, that one would have thought if the old boy were on his back he had but a dull chance from coming off without a broken neck; and by the noiſe they made, I conjectured they
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035355_0080_10049D9FF3D0D0F8"/>might have gone a mile at the ſame rate before I left the place. I had no notion of rapparees being out at this time, and thought it might be ſome one that owned the colt that had made ſo free with him, till returning to my friends, I told the ſtory and then they all ſuſpected, as it really was, from the manner of catching the colt, that old Dempſy (tho he had been quiet a long time) had come to pay them a viſit." Thus the gentleman ended his ſtory, and now to preceed to Charles.</p>
               <p>His foſter father was a tenant under Major P—t, who once as he was riding out to take a review of his land, took notice of young Charles's activity in riding horſes; upon which he had him ſent home, to him, in order to be an attendant on his groom, and to learn him to ſpeak Engliſh; where he behaved tolerable well and modeſt for a month or two and then he began his waggiſh tricks. "The groom and another ſervant happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have ſome difference between themſelves, Charles was reſolved to wind it up to the higheſt, and bring a battle about if poſſible: they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been jarring and ſparing; and as the groom lay in a room under a hay loft, thro' which there was a private hole wide enough for a man to paſs through, the young rogue took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, in the groom's abſence, to drop a large ſur-reverence at the foot of his bed, not forgetting to beſprinkle it a little. When the groom was going to make his bed, what ſhould he lay his hand firſt upon but the t—, which all bedaubed him, and threw him into ſuch a fit of anger, that he vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ved to be revenged of his fellow ſervant in
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035355_0081_10049DA18AED0AF8"/>the morning, whom he ſuſpected and nobody elſe. He went not to bed that night, but ſat up, and as ſoon as the maſter came out the next day, made his complaint to him. His maſter could hardly forbear ſmiling at the joke, tho' it was a dirty one; yet he ſhewed a very great reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the other ſervant who was accuſed, tho' the fellow who was innocent, utterly denied that he knew any thing of the matter. All this gave the groom no ſatisfaction, but to logger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads he would and did go with the other, who proving too hard for him, the groom was worſted and obliged to give out; then the other, and all that took his part reported that the groom had S—t his own bed and that he laid it on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with no other view than to excuſe himſelf; which getting wind, he was ſo jeered about it, that he had no quietneſs, till he quitted his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and went away.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral young gentlewomen in the houſe, who were very glad of the groom's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe he was very ready in making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt themſelves to the old gentleman; from thence Charles took occaſion to let the young ladies into the ſecret, who approving of his management, employed him in ſeveral little affairs and about meſſages not proper to mention here. But it happened once in the fruit reaſon, that the young gentlewomen had a great deſire for ſome choice fruit out of the orchard, into which they were refuſed admittance by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor; upon this they employed Charles to rob the orchard, who getting up very early by break of day, the next morning and without ſtaying to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035355_0082_10049DA37B530300"/>put on his breeches, crept thro' a hole in the roof of the privy-houſe, adjoining the orchard, and went to pillaging the trees, where he filled a large chequer apron, with the choiceſt fruit, and was making ready to return. There was a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman that lodged in the houſe, who had got a touch of the country diſeaſe and was ſomewhat very much out of order, and having occaſion to give ſpeedy vent, had repared to the coffee houſe for that purpoſe while the boy was on his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. As the gentleman ſat on his ſeat, and was ſtooping forward, the boy came to the hole, where, without looking before him as he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, the apron untied, and all the fruit came tumbling down about his ears; and at the ſame moment Charles fell with his legs on each ſide of the clergyman's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>k, and by the weight of the fall, threw him on his face, in this poſture they lay wedged together in a nook, for near the ſpace of a minute, before Charles could diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and the clergyman's ſurpriſe being height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened more and more upon feeling nothing but naked ſkin about him he fainted quite away; and lay-ſtill on the ground; the boy thinking he had killed the gentleman, ran away with all ſpeed, and came back no more to his ſervice: But the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman who could not ſee him, and was as much terrified as the boy, (without ſuſpecting him in the leaſt) went in and told the ſtory: ſome pitied him, others could hardly forbear ſmiling; but nobody could find out the truth, but the boy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſſing two or three days, and the young gentlewomen knowing the apron that was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, called to mind the exploit they ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035355_0083_10049DA51374E948"/>and ſo conjectured that it could be none elſe but young Dempſey, who had affrighted the poor clergyman into a ſit.</p>
               <p>In days of his youth there was a miller, at the wind mill near Ballybritas, a fellow very fit for his purpoſe with whom he had picked an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Charles had often been tampering with him to come into his meaſures; but the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had imbibed ſuch ſtrange notions of a Judge, that he thought he muſt be ſomething more than mortal, to decide and give judgment on criminal cauſes; Nay, he imagined the Judge knew the truth of every complaint that was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, before he heard it; for which reaſon, he was afraid of entering into any affair that might bring him before one, 'till he was fully informed what kind of a thing a Judge is. Charles to remove theſe ſcruples, prevailed on the fellow, who was very deſirous of knowing, to go along with him to Mary borough aſſizes, where they heard ſome cauſes tried; which ſatisfied the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's curioſity ſo far, that he told Cahier, as they were returning home, that a Judge was like one of themſelves, and nothing elſe but a man, and that he would be nothing afraid of entering in the liſts with Charles as ſoon as he pleaſed; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the fellow was enliſted and put into employment by his maſter.</p>
               <p>By this time Charles had picked up acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in moſt parts of the kingdom for putting his deſigns into execution. He fixed five or ſix of his own relations in Upper Ormond and Oſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and as many in the counties of Leitrim, monag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, and Derry, beſides a vaſt number of receivers
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035355_0084_10049DAA213AC278"/>and aſſiſtants in almoſt every hole and corner in the country; ſo that nothing went amiſs with him. He had likewiſe never leſs than four ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices at a time, who were always bound for the term of ſeven years and paid a pretty round ſum of money for learning his art and myſtery, in which he had ſuch great ſkill, that boys were ſent to him all the way from the county of Kerry, to be bound. Perhaps he was the firſt Iriſh rogue that ever thought of ſuch a ſtratagem; for had he taken a thouſand pounds for teaching a boy to catch or disfigure a horſe or cow only, I queſtion whether he could be hanged by our laws for it; and by the ſequel, we may obſerve that he always acted in ſuch a manner as to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of evading the force of the law, if poſſible, though he was as great a rogue as has been hanged.</p>
               <p>He had beſides his Satyrs, receivers and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, a number of ſpies and ſetters, whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs only was to make obſervations, and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what cattle (and where they) might be moſt ſafely conveyed away; and theſe had no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Satyrs or drivers themſelves. Whenever ſuch notice was given to Charles, an expreſs was immediately diſpatched to ſome one or more of the Satyrs, with a deſcription of ſuch beaſt or beaſts, which, without any more words, was ſufficient to be underſtood. By ſuch means as this the downright thievery could never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Charles, tho' every body knew that he was receiver general, and that his ſervants were all paid by the piece, ſo much a beaſt for officiating;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035355_0085_10049DABB7F9B640"/>but how Daniel kept his accounts is a ſecret.</p>
               <p>He had private places for hiding ſtolen cattle of all kinds in; and at any time when he thought proper, would order ſuch horſes as came from Leinſter ſide or Munſter, down to his correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the North, who either would ſend them from Derry, Newry, on Donaghadee to Scotland, or otherwiſe ſwap them off in fairs or ſell them. Such horſes, as his correſpondents got in exchange, they made no ſcruple of ſelling publickly becauſe they could prove the getting of them; but thoſe that were ſtolen in the North were commonly ſent to different hands, and were diſpoſed of in Upper Ormond, Oſſory, or in Munſter. To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the reader's curioſity, I ſhall rehearſe one ſtory, being part of the confeſſion of one of the confederates while he lay in confinement, before he was executed in Kilkenny, which will give a more particular account of his management than the foregoing.</p>
               <p>He confeſſed to the people who came to ſee him, that one of Charles's ſetters come to him by night where he lived, and told him there were three horſes in a park near Clonegal; one was black, with a ſtar and one white foot, another a bay gelding, that padded, and the third, a white pad, with his mane and tail cut cloſe. He ſaid he underſtood the meſſenger's meaning very well and accordingly conveyed the three horſes down to Glenmalier in two nights after. After that he was pitched upon as the moſt proper perſon for diſpoſing of them, and purſuant to his orders took them down to the country of Monagham but as the white horſe was ſo very remarkable
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035355_0086_10049E9F1B77C4D0"/>they ſtained him all over with a fleſh coloured red, in order to diſguiſe him, which was done with Brazilet and allum boiled in water; but that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was ſoon waſhed off. This fellow was not ſo much as known in that country; ſo by the aſſiſtance of ſome of his Brother receivers, he put off the three horſe in a fair, being all ſightly cattle to good advantage, for two of them he got twenty pounds, and for the third a mare, that was afterwards ſold in the county of Waterford for ſix pounds. Some after the owner of the bay-horſe was directed to Charles, in expectation of getting ſome tidings of his breaſt: but Cahier would not undertake the inquiry, till he was paid two guineas in hand; upon which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſearch for the horſe. In about twelve days after the horſe was taken out of a ſtone park in the night, where the laſt purchaſer kept him and ſo conveyed down to Charles, who gave the right owner notice that they might find ſuch a horſe in the wood near the river Barrow; upon which the owner ſent his ſervant for him, and had him brought home without any compliments. Some time after, the owner was riding to the North to buy linen, and having his horſe with him, he was challenged and ſecured till the aſſizes; but the owner bringing ſufficient evidence that he bred him, and that he had been miſſing all the while the other had him, got the better of the diſpute, and took his horſe home again. On the other hand, the purchaſer could only prove, that he bought him in a fair, but could not tell from whom; ſo by that means the thief was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:035355_0087_10049EA0B4C08058"/>
By what has been related one may perceive how cunningly his affairs were carried on; and in the next place, I ſhall relate ſome of his own actions.</p>
               <p>There was an elderly gentleman in the King's County who had a particular humour of his own in ſeveral reſpects, and when he took a fancy to any thing was commonly ſo choice of it, that he would ſuffer no one elſe to uſe it. He had a dun horſe of great ſpirit, and a good hunter; which he was ſo choice of, that he would not ſuffer his ſon to ride him. The ſon knew the goodneſs of the horſe as well as the father, and had caſt a covetous eye upon him, but could not tell how to compaſs his deſire till he had adviſed with Cahier, who gave him proper directions. In conſideration of a handſome fee, Charles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided him with the ſkin of a horſe of the ſame colour, and with the like marks of his father's horſe, which was then at graſs. This ſkin was dipt in a bog-hole and preſented to the father by one of his tenants, as the ſkin of his gelding, which, they ſaid, was drowned in a bog-hole.— The old man, who had not all the wit in the world, nor any miſtruſt of the fraud believed his tenant's report, and took it for a matter of fact. However ſome time after the ſon, who had kept the horſe concealed, rode on him home, pretended he had bought him in a fair; as ſoon as his father ſaw him he cried out, "D—, I vow to G—d, only my horſe was drownded, I would take my oath that's he for he's as like as ever I ſaw any thing in my life," which expreſſion paſſed to a ſterling joke among the gentlemen of the county
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035355_0088_10049EA25236DB68"/>for a long time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cahier had occaſion once to pay his correſpon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dents in the county of Kilkenny a viſit and to examine how the affairs and accounts ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; where, as he was on his march in the evening, he went into a poor widow's houſe, and demanded a drink of milk, upon which ſhe brought him a large drink of butter-milk but diſliking it very much, he abuſed her to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, and bid her go for ſome of the new milk, which ſhe refuſed, and would not own to have any other than what ſhe brought; then he called her a bitch and a whore, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her over and over, withal ſaying ſhe ſhould pay for that ill uſage: And indeed ſo ſhe did, for before next morning her two cows being all ſhe had, were ſtolen from her, neither could ſhe ger any tidings of them after.</p>
               <p>Much about this time he was in his prime, and kept a place much like an office of intelligence, where his brother Daniel was regiſter, who kept an account not only of their correſpondents and place of abode, but likewiſe how and for what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very beaſt was diſpoſed of: By this means they were able to anſwer ſuch people as came in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of cattle: if they were to be had at all, he generally de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>anded a fee in hand, for putting the owner in the way of getting his beaſt, which fee was always proportioned according to the beaſt's value, or the difficulty that might attend the recovery of it; and if in happened that the beaſt could not be procured with any ſafety, he was to return ſuch a part of his fee as was agreed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035355_0089_10049EA3F9206B90"/>to before hand, which he ſeldom refuſed. Now we muſt obſerve, that Cahier never delivered to the owner any beaſt that had been ſtolen; all he did, was to direct him to go where he might find ſuch a one; and this ſtratagem was to prevent home proof being given againſt him. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he had the misfortune to be bit even in this reſpect, and catched in ſuch a trap, that it coſt him a ſummer's work to get loſe. This was in the year 1729, when the practice was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of killing ſheep in the night time, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away their ſkins, carcaſes, and fat, which they diſpoſed of in diſtant places. This practice was carried on moſtly by diſcarded ſhepherds (tho' not without Cahier's knowledge) who kept dogs trained ſit for the purpoſe, with other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</p>
               <p>A gentleman in the country of Kilkenny ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome cows ſtolen from him, employed a truſty ſervant to make enquiry from Cahier, who having received his fee, in a ſhort time gave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per directions, as he thought, where to find them. The gentleman managed ſo crattily, that he took up one of the men in whoſe cuſtody the cattle were ſound, and this perſon having accuſed Cahier, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier was taken and put into Naas goal, where on purpoſe to ſave his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k, he turned evidence for the king, and impeached ſix or ſeven people in that country. Cahier told the Judges that he could do the country a vaſt deal of ſervice, that he could inform againſt rogues in every county in the province, and was willing to do it, to bring them to juſtice. The judges were pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ty well informed of his capacity of doing ſo; but not in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he was releaſed, he catched his horſes, and made the beſt of his way home, for fear of meeting with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond diſaſter.</p>
               <p>Charles was ſhortly after indicted for ſeveral facts, and committed to Mary borough jail, with his comrade Jack; but the Landlord, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was afraid of loſing ſome arrears, if he loſt his tenant, made ſuch intereſt, and obtained ſo fair a character of him, that he was acquitted for that time, and his brother alſo, though it was very well known that they were pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But ſome little time after, the ſaid landlord to make ſure of his rent, ſeized on Cahier's ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and turned him off his land. This put him to his wit's end to meditate revenge, which he thought he could bring about no better way than by accuſing him, and bringing him in as a party concerned along with him.</p>
               <p>His former landlord had converted a large vault, that lay under an old caſtle, into a ſtable, which was large enough to hold ſeveral horſes; in this ſtable, and in a wood near to it (which ſome people ſay Charles did only through deſign) Cahier, when he had occaſion, had leave to put ſome of his horſes, and this was foundation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him to ground an accuſation upon: Nay, he made preparations for giving in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the whole country believed that the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035355_0093_10049EB33AD09460"/>ſaid gentleman was one of the managers in the confederacy.</p>
               <p>Mr. G—, the ſaid gentleman, who was upon ſetting up for a juſtice, being irritated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Charles, had examinations given againſt him, and after a very difficult purſuit, Cahier was taken and committed to Naas goal, in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1734<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While he was purſued, he ſwam ſeveral times acroſs the Barrow, tho' the flood was great, and his ſaid landlord's men followed him with as much reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, till they took him, in a haggard, where he had concealed himſelf.</p>
               <p>Things being now brought to this ſituation, he ſwore ſeveral examinations in Iriſh, while he was in confinement, againſt the gentleman and others, to put off his own trial, and told his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo plauſible, that ſeveral gentleman in the country took his part, and the gentleman was tried; and were it not for ſome of the leading men in the country, it is to be feared he might have ſuffered. It was with ſome difficulty that his trial was put off till Auguſt affixes, tho' Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier was the only evidence againſt him. But ſome others whom Charles accuſed, were tied up by the neck, particularly one Hickey, who owned that he had often tranſgreſſed, but denied the facts whereof he was then accuſed, at the gallows.</p>
               <p>We muſt now paſs on to Cahier's trial, at Maryborough, in Auguſt, 1735. He was firſt brought to the bar, and then ordered to hold up
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035355_0094_10049EB5E1D70660"/>his hand, which he did pretty quietly, time after time, 'till above thirty indictments were read againſt him: Then the judge ſaid, 'guilty or not guilty?' but Cahier ſeemed not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one word of Engliſh, till one behind him bid him in Iriſh to anſwer: then he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and aſked the other in the ſame language, what he ſhould ſay?

But all did not ſave him; he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſentence of death, and was executed in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1735.</p>
               <p>As he paſſed from the gaol to the gallows, he minded nothing but diſcourſing with the people, who came to inquire of him about cattle that had been ſtolen from them. To ſome he gave ſatisfactory anſwers, and directed them where to ſeek; to others, he made none. On the ladder he continued the like diſcourſe, till he was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, and even then, he was ſo loth to die, that he caught hold of it as it turned, and held faſt, till the ſheriff obliged him to quit his grip, by pounding his knuckles with the but end of his whip. Thus he went out of the world, without clearing any one that he had accuſed, and died according to the belief of every body, an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened villain.</p>
               <p>His brother Daniel, who was found guilty of the like facts, and executed along with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved in a quite different manner; he continued reading, on his way to the place of execution, very devoutly, in a Manuel, and repeated a great number of prayers before the ladder was turned.</p>

What province or country he was born in, I could never learn, tho' you may take it for granted, he was a downright Iriſhman; for he wore the brogue upon his tongue, as faſhionable as any rogue in the nation.</p>
               <p>At the age of ſixteen years, or thereabouts, he was bound apprentice to a Maſon, at Clone-bullock,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035355_0097_10049EBB4DC5DD18"/>in the King's county; but his maſter dying before he had time to learn the trade, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus was put under ſome difficulties; however, he made a ſhift to pick up acquaintance with an expert tinker, who had ſkill in running down metal; and upon occaſion, was not backward in coining a piece of ſilver and gold, to anſwer his neceſſities.</p>
               <p>This ſame tinker had been tried for his life, for facts of this kind, both in Naas and Armagh, and found means to get off in both places. The Indictment upon which he was tried in Armagh, was for making and uttering a bad piſtole; where ſeeming on his trial, to know nothing of the matter, he ſaid that not above three piſtoles had paſſed thro' his hands in his life, and that he could know every one again; at the ſame time he begged leave to ſee the piece he was charged with for uttering, and if he had paſſed it, he would not deny it; upon this, it was given into his hand to be examined. While he was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the piece, he pretended to bite it, but took an opportunity of drawing another out of his mouth inſtead of it, which he ſaid was the ſame piece he had paſſed, and would prove it to be right good gold; accordingly it was tried, and found good, by which ſtratagem he got clear.</p>
               <p>Manus having got a little inſight into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, grew ſick of Maſonry and immediately fell upon new ſchemes. By ſome means or other, he procured as much gold as made a ſmall ingot, which he uſed as a decoy.

I ſaw one plaas about ſo big as a door, ſtopped up wid the ſort of ſtones I wanted, and ſo I fell to work, ſtriving to get 'em out, and taak em along wid me to my comrade; but before I got de half of 'em out, I found there was ſteps up before me, going down like ſtairs, and I went in to ſee what ſort of a plaas there was there, and where ſhould the ſteps be after bringing myſelf to, but into a dark toom; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is a want you call it, and what ſhould I find there, but a parſhil of ſhets, and I thought they were coffins full of bones: but when I ſtruck my crow againſt one of 'em, I found it's iron they were made of; and upon that I went out and ſtopped the whole up again, for fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body would find it, and go in before night.

               <p>The Farmer hearing the fellow talk ſo ſimply, verily imagined that he was a mere ignoramus, and thought all that he told him was as true as the hearth mouey; however he kept his council as far as proper, and deſired Manus to have his treaſure in readineſs, and not to ſhew it to any body, for fear of loſing it, till he got an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of acquainting ſome of his friends, who, he was ſure, had a good deal of money lying by, and would purchaſe the whole. Manus's ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to make himſelf ſeem as fooliſh as
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035355_0100_10049EC4F1E072A8"/>poſſible, thereby to make his bait the more taking, yet he did not confine himſelf to hold the ſecret from all others; for he told the aforeſaid ſtory to as many as he thought he could make proper fools of, to further his deſigns, and behaved as much like a fool as poſſible, that no ſuſpicion of deceit might hereby ariſe: for which reaſon I ſhall give him the title of the Iriſh fool, let others call him what they pleaſe. By this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſice, the ſtory was whiſpered about very private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from hand to hand, among ſuch people as were ſuppoſed to have money, who were moſtly intent upon engroſſing the treaſure every one to himſelf, that for ſear of being prevented they even would not give their wives an item of it.</p>
               <p>At length, people that had money, came pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from all parts to ſeek Manus, in hopes of making their fortunes, but in fact it was only to loſe them. The firſt that he made a perfect maſter of the ſecret, was an innkeeper of the county of Kilkenny, who had brought a pretty handful of money with him, and a portmanteau, in order to purchaſe a large quantity of gold; but Manus, as great a fool as he pretended to be, was reſolved not to be caught in any trap, and abſolutely refuſed to ſell any of his ware under that denomination, for ſear of bringing himſelf into trouble, and gave ſuch reaſons for ſo doing, that the purchaſer ſeemed to have no miſtruſt of a bite. Says he, "I don't ſell you my ingots of gold, that would be the way to be found out by the lord of the manor, who has the firſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to every ſort of that kind that's found in
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035355_0101_10049EC6C653D3C8"/>his ground any way; and to be ſure he'd have the gold above any thing elſe. I tell you what I'll do wid you, give me ſuch monies as will buy tin good cows to maintain myſhelf, and I'll give you ſo much of the ſort I found in the Old Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey as ever you can carry way wid you in the leather bag behind you; but you muſt give me your oat firſt that you won't open it till you get home, nor tell any body how much gold you have, nor how you got it, and dis is ſome of the ſort I found (laying his ingot on a brick, and pointing to it with his finger.) Now, how much monies will you give me, and I'll ſill your bag?" The bargain was agreed to, and the purchaſer ſworn to ſecrecy; then Manus led him in the night to a convenient field for his purpoſe, pretending a great deal of fear, leſt any one ſhould ſee or hear them; and having blindfolded him, he took the portmanteau a little further, where he filled it with bricks, ſtones, and hay, and when he had locked it, he returned with the load. The inkeeper was overjoyed at his bargain, and having paid Manus about forty pound, earneſt money, he put the load up behind him, and rode home poſt haſte, promiſing to pay the remainder on delivery of the key, which the goldfinder was to give him in two days after at his own houſe, where he was to meet him and take an account of his ware. But the inkeeper waited two days, three times told before Manus appeared with the key, and might have waited till doom's day only his impatience prompted him to be fingering the gold; upon which he tipped open the portmanteau, and finding how

                  </gap>nfoundedly he was outwitted, he ſell ſick of a Plenetick fever, which had like to have coſt him his life. However he was ſo much aſhamed of his bargain, that he could not tell how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge the ſecret for ſome months after.</p>
               <p>The rumour of finding ſuch immenſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was ſpread about with ſuch artifice, that hundreds were apprized of it yet every man that had money and heard it imagined himſelf firſt in the baby-houſe, and ſtrove eagerly to make his market, before others knew any thing of the affair. I heard of a very reſponſible merchant's son in the county of —, that had juſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable fortune with his wife, who upon having notice thereof, made preparations for diſpoſing of all his effects, in order to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the whole treaſure, (crown, jewels and all) and to carry them to France, about the time the late French King was married, expecting to make a million of money by the bargain, and to be able at his return to purchaſe the whole country before him; but the gay man his father being a man of better experience in the world, ſuſpected ſome deceit, and (though with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) diſſuaded his ſon from engaging in ſo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a project.</p>
               <p>Manus had ſuch good fortune by his ſchemes, that in a little time he was able to make a new ingot of real gold, which weighed about twelve ounces, in the ſhape of a ſmall bar, and this he carried about for a decoy: Beſides he was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by one of his accomplices from Dublin-with braſs bars of the ſame ſize and form, gilded or covered over ſo that any perſon not well ſkill<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035355_0103_10049ECFB2986098"/>in metals might eaſily be deceived, and not know one from the other. He had likewiſe the luck to pick up an acquaintance with one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Farrel, an ill inclined young fellow, whoſe uſual employment was to carry meat from the butchers in Dublin to gentlemen in the country. He preſently found that this fellow would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit for his purpoſe, inaſmuch as that he was intimate with ſeveral people of good credit in Dublin, and ſo he let them into the ſecret. This Farrell told his ſtory concerning the treaſure with ſuch a ſeeming probality, that numbers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him, and treated him with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis really a wonder, that among ſo many as came from all parts in queſt of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that ſome of them did not blab out one to another, what their buſineſs was; but the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery lay here, thoſe that were in purſuit, kept council of neceſſity, and ſuch as were bit, were under theſe obligations, or ſo much aſhamed of their bargains, that they could not tell how to diſcover or expoſe their weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Their moſt uſual way of impoſing on cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, was this; after the buyers had been proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of the treaſure, and manner of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it and ſo wrought up into a firm belief of the certainty thereof, without ſhewing any token of miſtruſt; then Manus began to expoſe the gold bar which he call'd braſs, as a ſample of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035355_0104_10049ED14EC64D88"/>always prompting his chapmen to try it, let them call it what they pleaſed. When they had fully ſatisfied themſelves concerning the value of the metal, a bargain was commonly concluded upon; in the mean while Manus always took care, by one means other, to exchange the gold bar for another of braſs of which ſort be could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his cuſtomers with as many as they thought proper; then as it was cuſtomary with him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded either the money or ſufficient earneſt, which being laid down on the ſide of the table, and the ingits, as he called them on the other, "Now, ſays he, here is my ware, it is braſs I call it, and will fold it to you for braſs, and nothing elſe, but yourſelf knows the ſort beſt.

He frequently appeared to be in liquor, and by theſe kind of ſpeeches, which ſeemed to proceed from perfect ignorance, his cuſtomers only became ten times more earneſt than before, making no ſcruple to give an oath of ſecrecy, which being done, they ſeldom made any delay till they got home with the treaſure. But as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances may be more ſatisfactory, I ſhall relate two or three, to render him in more plain colours.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his proſpetity, in company
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035355_0105_10049ED2E165FCE0"/>with the ſaid Farrel, he took a jaunt down to Dublin, with the ingot of real gold in his pocket and ſeveral gits of braſs, as like it as could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be made. In the habit of a mean country farmer, he went to an eminent banker in Caſtle-ſtreet, and finding him alone, he drew out his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, and began to make his condition and caſe known in the moſt moving and pathetic manner. Says he. "God bleſs your worſhip. Sir, every body knows you have the beſt ſkill in the ſort of dis of any man in Dublin, (ſhewing his ingot in paper) becauſe you deal ſo much in monies: I believe it is the fort they make the guineas of.

The banker then would have been very willing to have purchaſed it at ſo moderate a price, but the other refuſed to ſell; end cot only ſo, but was for borrowing more upon it, and at a longer time than the banker approved
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035355_0106_10049ED487A94208"/>of; ſo Manus took the ingot, lhpped it up in the ſame paper, and went out, on pretence of ſeeking redreſs from ſome body elſe upon the ſame ſecur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ity; but he had not gone many ſleps from the door before he took an opportunity of putting a git of braſs in the place of the ingot, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it ſo lapped up to the banker again. Says he, (giving a ſigh, with a ſorrowful countenance, wringing his hands and dropping a few tears) "I muſt ſell dis or borrow ſome monies upon it, to ſlop my cattles, I believe you will give me ſo much as any body for it, and aſ I don't releaſe it againſt Chriſtmas day I won't aſb it any more." The banker then told him out what he offered before and a guinea over, thinking him a ſimple ignorant fellow, and then laid his bargain up in a drawer without examining it, thinking that it was worth about fifteen pounds more at leaſt. Some time after Chriſtmas the banker had ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at dinner with him, to whom he related after what manner he had bought a great bargain of gold from a ſill countryman. They were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſeeing it, and when one of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men viewed it, he ſaid it was not gold, upon which the banker held him a bottle of wine to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and had it tried over again: but to his mortification was obliged to yield the wager loſt, which put him entirely out of humour, tho' it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very good diverſion for the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to ſee a banker outwitted by a fool, who never intended to pay him another viſit.</p>
               <p>When he and his man Andrew had pretty well ſeduced and defrauded a great number of the Dublinians out of there money, for ingots of braſs
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035355_0107_10049EDAC8330F60"/>inſtead of gold, they grew enraged againſt him and began to dog Andrew to his lodgings, and to the country, thinking to take him before a juſtice; but he obſerving it, gave them the ſlip, and poſted away to his maſter, who had retired to the wood of Allen, where he uſually ſpent the moſt of his time. As ſoon as Manus underſtood that people endeavoured to take him, ſays he dar a nagh agus dat a neagh, we will go to Connaught: And their effects being eaſily carried, and affairs ſettled, after drinking a belly full of brandy, their common liquor, they began their journey, not in the direct-road, but thro' the Queen's County, where Manus was obliged to make a longer ſtay than he expected occaſioned by a misfortune that befel him. It happened that while he paſſed thro' this laſt county, a man of ſome figure purchaſed ſome of his ingots of braſs for which he paid Manus a pretty round ſum of money; in a few days after the gentleman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his bargain to a goldſmith in Dublin, with a deſign of converting part of it into plate for his family, and to make money of the reſt; but to his ſorrow, being thoroughly made ſenſible of the fraud, he poſted home, and upon ſearch, had the good fortune of ſeizing Manus, whom he got com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Maryborough goal, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under confinement 'till the next aſſizes. At length his trial came on, and a vigorous proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made againſt him, and to be ſure the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could have thought no better of him than he deſerved, only that when he was aſked what he had to ſay for himſelf, he aſked his proſecutor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral crooked queſtions, 'till he obliged him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035355_0108_10049EDF185C05E0"/>that Manus told him, at the time they made the bargain that his ware was braſs, and no other. 'What would you have din? And is it not braſs? Sure that's no ſheat for a man to ſell his guts by the right name. I will leave it to my lord judge, and the gentlemin of the the jury.' In ſhort he filled the court with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prime and laughter, to ſee how artfully he could evade the force of the law, tho in appearance he ſeemed like a fool: However the jury ſat upon it, yet they could not bring him in guilty of what he was accuſed; upon which he was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Now he thought every hour a day 'till he got into ſome remote place, and ſo haſted away with his man Andrew to Connaught, where having no acquaintance, they remained under ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before they got into a way of getting a livelihood, and ſo were under a neceſſity of making the former ſpoil of the Dublinians main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them (of which they had ſtill a good plenty left, drinking wine and brandy very profuſely) till at laſt Andrew got acquainted with one Dominick D—t, a rich farmer's ſon, and a ſharp inſinuating youth, who was very intimate with ſeveral gentlemen in that country. It was beneath a man of Emanuel's fortune to ſeek cuſtomers himſelf, wherefore Andrew was to manage that point, who thinking this young man would make a ſit bate for his hook, told him the whole ſtory concerning the finding of the treaſure, as before related, that for fear of the lord of the manor who heard of it, they fled,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035355_0109_10049EE14A638BC0"/>into that country to conceal it, and to be more private. They were over a cup of liquor at this time, and Farrel pretending to be drunk, called the other aſide and ſpoke very privately, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to let no body know but his neareſt friends, who on his account only ſhould get good bargains.</p>
               <p>Young D—t was overjoyed at the news, and returned in to talk to Manus, without delay or, ſuſpicion. Manus knowing his inclinations pulled out his ingot of gold. and ſwore the young man to ſecrecy, who was charmed with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the metal; and being very deſirous that his friends ſhould make their fortunes, he brought his uncle to Manus, who told him his uſual ſtory, (like an ignorant fellow, as he pretended to be) with great artifice and having charged him pretty high with liquor, he got all the man's money, and ſent him home with gits in lieu of it; but in ſome days having diſcovered the fraud, he complained to Dominick's father, and poor Dominick was turned out of doors for his pains: this was what Manus wanted in his heart, and as ſoon as he heard thereof, he returned to Cloncumber, a ſcrubby iſland in the bog of Allen ſurrounded with rivers and quagmire: At a ſmall diſtance from the iſland ſtands a wood, from which to the iſland there is a paſſage, but then a great part of it is commonly covered with water, and very difficult to find; and on the middle of the iſland there is a fort, whereon if a man ſtands, he may view the country round for ſome miles, and ſee every body that comes near it. Here he fixed his lodgings, ſo that when
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035355_0110_10049EE62F2C6698"/>any that he knew not came on the wood ſide, he commonly would take to the bog; but if on the bog ſide, to the wood; and here he carried on his game for a long time, never coming out but to make his bargains, and then only in ſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to ſuch houſes as he well knew.</p>
               <p>Andrew had given an item to Dominick where they intended to go, who being turned out as aforeſaid, followed them in expectation of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his money returned; but Manus ſhewed him ſo many legerdemain tricks that he ſoon found it was but in vain to expect any ſuch thing, and ſo knowing he had no buſineſs home without it, he became a diſſolute young fellow, and joined his forces along with this new company.</p>
               <p>'Tis true he returned to Connaught, but then it was only as a decoy, and to make a prey of others. He brought a collector with him from Eyrecourt, to Cloncumber, whom Mac O'Neil firſt ſwere to keep ſecrecy, and then ſold him ſome of his bars at a very good race, only with this liberty, upon his oath that if any one aſked what he had bought, to ſay it was braſs; and ſays, 'dar a nagh, a dan a negh, I believe it is, for I don't know gold.'

However, up he got, walked about, and called, and cried, and ſhouted and curſed, and kicked and danced with vexation, round the houſe, like a madman, till he made himſelf ſo weary, that he was forced to leave off.

               <p>The laſt ſtory that I ſhall be particular in, is, of a certain gentleman, well ſkilled in metal, a ſharp man, and one that was reſolved not to be impoſed on, as he had heard ſome others had been. He was introduced to Manus by one of his young men before mentioned, and after a good deal of diſcourſe over the liquor, he let him know that he would buy no metal, but ſuch as he would firſt try with ſomething he had in his pocket, pulling out a bottle of aquafortis.

Manus got up as if he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it; but ſtaggering about the room like one in liquor, he watched his opportunity and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hold of the bottle, "Arra, ſays he, what ſort is diſh" and as be was ſhaking it, a drop or two fell on his fingers and ſmoked: then ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be terribly affrighted, he cries out, as if in great pain. "O maver, O maver," and at the ſame time threw the bottle againſt the wall and broke it. Now farewel aquafortis. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman taking this for no other than the effects of drunkenneſs and ignorance, ſaid nothing at all
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035355_0116_10049F0BDDAD2B00"/>about the bottle, but laughed at the fellow for a bit of game. However he took care to aſk him for the reſt of the bars; then Manus told him, "that he had borrowed ſome money of a prieſt hard, by, with whom he had leſt the bars in pledge, and deſired the gentleman to lend him as much money as would releaſe them; to which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, provided that he and his men would go with him to the prieſt's houſe.

               <head>The Life of James Mac-Faul.</head>
               <p>JAMES MAC-FAUL was born in Carrick-fergus, in the north of Ireland, in the time of the Iriſh maſſacre, wherein his father had a great hand, being forward upon all occaſions to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and deſtroy whatever he could meet with, and did not care what miſchief he did, ſo he could but enrich himſelf; 'till at laſt he was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a detachment from the king's army, and hanged upon the next tree, as an example to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others from ſuch cruelties.</p>
               <p>His ſon James was brought up by his uncle, and put to ſchool under a popiſh prieſt, but he being very unlucky, could never be kept to his book, as he would run away for a month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'till his uncle not knowing what to do with him, determined to ſend him to England, and let him try his fortune, being certain that the boy had aſſurance enough to live in any part of the world, and impudence enough to ſtick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet Jemmy would not be perſuaded to travel, unleſs his uncle would equip him with a ſword, a pair of dice, and a pack of cards, with which he thought he could do well enough.</p>
               <p>He made the beſt of his way to London, but
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035355_0119_10049F178DE1F868"/>found it abſolutely neceſſary in his way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome pilfering robberies, for his better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, for one of which he was well flogged at Briſtol, and all his utenſils, dice and cards taken from him; when not knowing what to do, he had ſome thoughts of going to ſervice, which he did for a little while; but work not agreeing with him at all, he borrowed a ſilver ſpoon, and ſome other odd trifles, and marched off one evening without taking his leave, and went directly to one of his countrymen, who diſpoſed of his things, but was angry with him for leaving his place with ſo little booty, which James begged him not to take notice of, for another time he ſhould find he would do better.</p>
               <p>In a little time after, he got into a noble lord's family, where he behaved for twenty months very well, and got the love of all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, particularly of Mrs. Betty the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, who was continually treating him with one good thing or other, and he in return, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing a great deal of love and ſincerity; which made the girl grow ſo fond of him, that he in a ſhort time got all that was in her power to give, and then looked as cold on her as a ſinking tradeſman does on a deſperate dun; which Betty perceiving, tried all manner of ways to endear herſelf to him, but all to no purpoſe, for the young ſpark was fallen in love with an ale-houſe man's daughter, where the ſervants uſed to drink, and entirely forſook poor Betty; who, enraged at ſuch uſage, could not forbear expoſing her folly by upbraiding of him, which had no other effect',
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035355_0120_10049F1921DEE9E8"/>but making herſelf be laughed at, and hardened him in his impudence; who went on without controul in his amours with his new miſtreſs, and leſt his old one to learn more wit.</p>
               <p>The young taplaſh proud of her conqueſt, that ſhe ſhould rival one of my lord's maids, eaſily gave up herſelf to his embraces, and denied him nothing that was in her power to grant, which put Jemmy quite on another footing from the reſt of his fellow ſervants; ſhe keeping the bar had the care of the money, ſo that Jemmy had his watch and what not, and appeared as great as maſter any body, and neglected his lord's ſervice to follow his gaming tables and whores, for which he ſoon loſt his place, and had nothing to depend on, but what he got from his ſweet-heart; who continually ſupplying his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, reduced her father to ſuch neceſſities, that he was obliged to confeſs a judgment to the brewer, who, a little after, ſeized upon all he had, and turned him out of doors.</p>
               <p>Jemmy had nothing now to depend on but his own good fortune, and ſhe proving a jilt, as ſhe often does to perſons given to extravagance, he was ſoon reduced to very great wants, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arreſted and thrown into Marſhalſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſtill kept a correſpondence with his miſtreſs, and made her become as wicked as himſelf, ſhe turning ſhop-lifter and pickpocket, and he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing on the highway, by which they had got near a thouſand pounds, and then agreed to part, but upon condition of being ſerviceable to one another; and the town being too hot for him, he removed to Lancaſhire, a fortune hunting, and ſhe continued in town to ſee what would offer in her way, where ſhe got acquainted with Moll Flanders, who lodging in the ſame houſe with her, paſſed for a great fortune; ſhe perſuaded her to go down with her into the country, where ſhe might live much cheaper and with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at her brother's houſe, who was a gentleman of a very good eſtate in Ireland, or at her ſiſter's who lived near Liverpool, which Moll at length agreed to, not knowing well what elſe to do with herſelf, but that was more than the other knew.</p>
               <p>Upon the road ſhe treated Moll with all the civilities imaginable, and at Warrington her pretended brother met them in a gentleman's coach, and carried them to Liverpool, where they were entertained in a merchant's houſe three or four days very handſomely, and from thence they went to a gentleman's houſe about forty miles diſtant, where was a numerous family, a noble ſeat and good company, whom ſhe called cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins: Here they ſtayed about ſix weeks, and then came back to a village near Liverpool, where her brother, as ſhe called him, began to make love to Moll, ſetting himſelf out as a man of a thouſand pounds a year, and indeed talked as big of his ſeats and parks, as one would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035355_0122_10049F1AB58D7900"/>to think he had ſuch an eſtate, but it was all a ſham. Moll was not behind in putting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf off, although ſhe never plainly told them what ſhe had, yet ſhe did not contradict what her companion ſaid, who reported her to be a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow worth ten thouſand pounds; which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed 'ſquire Mac Faul, that he was ready to run mad at the bait, and plunged into debt over head and ears, for the expences of his courtſhip; and for fear his eſtate ſhould be looked into, he never ſo much as aſked about her fortune, but took upon truſt whatſoever his old miſtreſs told him, and promiſed his new one ſuch brave things, that ſhe imagined ſhe ſhould be a lady, when ſhe had got her eſtate.</p>
               <p>They were ſoon married, and nothing but love and kindneſs paſſed between them, he eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day telling her of the fine things ſhe was to have when they came to Ireland, and ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to improve his affections by her fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good behaviour; till at length he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcover her intentions of going to Weſt-Cheſter, in order to embark for Ireland, but aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wife if ſhe had no affairs to ſettle at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before ſhe went off; to which ſhe anſwering No; he ſeemed much ſurpriſed, and ſaid. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, what have we been a doing? I thought the bulk of your eſtate lay in the bank: Indeed, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I have no eſtate, nor did I tell you I had; I know not what your ſiſter might ſay to you, but I did never tell her of any ſuch thing; at which he ſtarted like a madman, and ſwore he had been impoſed on, to the laſt degree; and then calling his ſiſter, he aſked her haw ſhe could
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035355_0123_10049F1CABA9D370"/>ſerve him ſo? Very well, ſaid ſhe, and not half ſo much as you deſerved; how could you ruin my poor aged father, debauch me, and bring me into all the vices of life; and at laſt neglect me, and ſet up for a fortue in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? But, ſaid he, what had this gentlewoman done to you that you would ruin her? and then looking upon his wife, he fell down upon his knees and ſaid, you would indeed have been cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my dear, but you would not have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; for ten thouſand pounds would have maintained us both very handſomely in Ireland, and I reſolved to dedicate every groat to you; I would not have wronged you of a ſhilling, and the reſt I would have made up in my affection to you, and my tenderneſs of you as long as I lived; which he ſaid with tears in his eyes, and offered to give her a bill of fifty pounds, which he ſwore was all he had in the world; which ſhe aſſuring him was more than ſhe had, and that ſhe came into the country only to live cheap, her whole income not exceeding fifteen pounds a year; at which he ſhook his head, and remained ſilent for ſome time; and then ſaid, Come, my dear, though the caſe is bad, it is to no purpoſe to be dejected be as eaſy as you can; I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out ſome way or other to live: if you can but ſubſiſt yourſelf, that is better than nothing, I muſt try the world again: a man ought to think like a man: to be diſcouraged is to yield to the misfortune. And then going to bed, he promiſed a great many things, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could offer, when thore was nothing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with; 'till at laſt he fell aſleep; and roſe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035355_0124_10049F211E5B7048"/>betimes in the morning, and took his horſes and three ſervants, all his linen and baggage, and went away, leaving a letter on the table, with twenty guineas in it, adviſing her with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to make the beſt of her way to London; but a terror falling upon his mind, when he had rid about fifteen miles, he diſmiſſed his ſervants, ſold their horſes, came back, and told her he would accompany her in her way to London, which ſhe agreed to, and in two days time they ſet out from Cheſter, he on horſeback, and ſhe in the ſtage-coach, and came to Dunſtable toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where he told her it was convenient to leave her, for reaſons which were improper for her to know.</p>
               <p>She deſired him to ſtay with her there a week or two, which he agreed to, in which time ſhe told him how that ſhe had been in Virginia, and that ſhe had now a mother there; and that if her effects had come ſafe to hand, ſhe might have enough to have maintained them both very handſomely as long as they lived; and that if he had a mind to go there, ſhe believed ſhe could raiſe about three hundred pounds, which was ſufficient to eſtabliſh a plantation, upon which they might live very well; but he would upon no account agree to it; but ſaid ſuch a ſum of money as that would ſtock a farm in Ireland of an hundred pounds a year, on which they might live as handſomely as a gentleman of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred here, and that he had laid a ſcheme to go over and try: which if it did not ſucceed, he aſſured her, he would go with her to America
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035355_0125_10049EDD85E811D8"/>with her with all his heart; and then he let her into the ſecret part of his life, and gave her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he would not accompany her to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſo took his leave with a great deal of tenderneſs and affection.</p>

By my ſhoul, that is very good news, ſaid his ſiſter Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for we heard long ago, that you were turned a rapparee, and hang'd at London. No, you fool, ſaith he, there's no ſuch thing as hanging of Iriſhmen in that country. We borrow a little money from ſome good natured woman or other, as ſoon as poſſible, and turn gentlemen, marry half a ſcore, rather than not be obliging to the fair ſex; and when we have done, break their hearts as ſoon as we cap. In faith, ſays Nanny, I'll go over, and ſee if I can't have as many huſbands; for one may ſtay here all one's life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and never be married, and what then, and who has to do with that? So thou ſhalt, Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſaid be; but ſtay till I return, and I'll take thee along with me, which happened ſooner than he expected, for he having got acquainted with an Engliſh gentleman's family, pretended to great riches, and that he had a mind to ſettle there, was admitted to court his ſiſter, who had a thouſand pounds to her fortune, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged ſo artfully by his aſſurance and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſoon got the lady's conſent; and he preſented her with one of the gold watches and a diamond ring, that he had taken from the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen's

As ſoon as ſhe came home, he called her aſide, and ſhewed her the letter, adviſing her to return thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſhe had received from him, and have no more to ſay to him, which the young lady wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have heard an hundred ſtories of her, ſaid he, when I was laſt ſummer in England; and yet nobody can take her, altho' ſhe is playing her pranks in one diſguiſe or other every day.</p>
               <p>This was very unpleaſant news to the young gentlewoman, who had placed her affections en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon Mac-Faul, who had a very pretty way of addreſs, and in himſelf was a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man; and what troubled her moſt of all
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035355_0129_10049EF397EA8F00"/>was, to part with the gold watch and diamond ring, with which ſhe had made a figure among the ladies above a month; but if it muſt be ſo, ſaid ſhe, and then ſhe fell a crying, "Mac-Faul can never be a rogue, ſo fine a gentleman as Mac-Faul to be a thief, it can never be; this Moll Flanders is ſome ill woman, who has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived this letter, on purpoſe to min his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I will never leave him, I will die with him," and a great deal of ſuch ſilly ſtuff; ſo that with all the brother could do, he could ſcarce prevail with her to forbear marrying him, till he heard from England.</p>
               <p>The next time Mac-Faul came to the houſe, the gentleman ſhewed him the letter, which he ſtifly denied, and proteſted it did not belong to him, and ſeemed to wonder who ſhould put ſuck a trick upon him; for he ſwore ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand oaths, that he knew no more of it than the man in the moon; but all would not avail, the gentleman civilly deſired him to forbear coming to his houſe, till he ſhould be better ſatisfied from his friends in London, and in the mean time gave his word no man ſhould make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his ſiſter in the way of courtſhip, till then. Mac-Faul begged only to ſee her, that he might take his leave civilly of her; which upon no account would be granted, for the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was as diſconſolate as he, &amp; narrowly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that it was not poſſible for them to have any intercourſe, which ſo enraged Mac-Faul, that he ſent the gentlemen a challenge who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it, and the next morning was to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the juſtice of their pretenſions, when the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035355_0130_10049EF5500F34C0"/>gentleman going to a coffee-houſe, to look for another to be ſecond, happened to take up a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, which was over night come from England, wherein he found an advertiſement of the watch and ring his ſiſter had, and a reward of twenty guineas for taking the man, who by the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he knew could be no other than Mac-Faul; which he ſhewing to his friend and informing him how the whole matter ſtood, they reſolved to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him; but Mac-Faul having a ſecond with him, they reſiſted, ſo that Mac-Faul made his eſcape, and left his ill gotten goods behind him, and wrote a letter to his ſiſter to bring his money and cloaths to London, where he would meet her.</p>
               <p>Mac-Faul made the beſt of his way to the bogs and there ſheltered himſelf among a parcel of rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parees, till he met with an opportunity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, to ſhip himſelf for England, which he did in the habit of a highlander, and he got ſafe to Brecknock in Wales, where he took a lodging at a widow woman's houſe whom he gagged and robbed of about forty ſhillings, and bruſhed off in the night: from thence croſſed the country, till he came to Shrewſbury, where he ſtole a nag out of King's-land, and made the beſt of his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London, and about two hours after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a country farmer, who was going to pay re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035355_0131_100499809A7A03E0"/>he muſt ſaddles, for that he could ride no further on a piece of blanket; and ſo taking his, he found in it fourſcore pounds, which made his heart full glad, and much more than he expected, he having no other deſign but to ſaddle his nag, and never dreamt of any booty, till he came to take it off, and found by the weight there muſt be ſomething in it more than ſtraw, altho' by the outſide it did not ſeem to be worth a ſhilling; but he wanted a ſaddle, and a ſaddle he muſt have, to prevent his being ſuſpected of ſtealing the gelding.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner diſcovered his prey, but he rode for life, and that day came to a little houſe, four miles on this ſide Coventry, where being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted, he aſked if he could have any lodging for a man and horſe, which the hoſt told him very readily he might; and introduced him into the kitchen, where he ſaw the ſpit ſaddled with ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They told him a couple of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who they believed would be very glad of his company, which he was very well pleaſed with, and deſired the landlord to enquire, if a ſtranger might be admitted, which they readily agreed to. and Mr. Mac-Faul was admitted, with as much ceremony, as if he had been a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try juſtice of the peace, who behaved himſelf with ſo much courteſy, that after a bottle or two, a friendſhip ſeemed to be cemented amongſt them. The gentlemen were frank and open, and Mac-Faul as full of enquiry as was conſiſtent with his intereſt, till at laſt he perceived they were a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of graziers juſt come from London, whom he thought perſons worth his better acquaintance,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035355_0132_10049EFE32F5D278"/>and having informed himſelf which way they were to travel in the morning, he ſaid he ſhould be glad of their company, and accordingly ſetting out together, they had not rode above two miles, before he told them his buſineſs, and that he muſt have a little ready money, which was what they did not care to hear of; however for quietneſs ſake, they were forced to ſubmit, and gave him what they had about them, which amounted to about one hundred pounds, with which he rode off, and bid them take care what company they fell into for the future, which they very wiſely told him they would, and wiſhed him good luck with his bargain; but it ſeems it was done with a curſe.</p>

And now they frankly communicated to each other the danger they were in, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſafeſt, to make the beſt of their way towards Dunſtable, near which place they robbed two coaches, and ſome travellers of lace, which in all amounted to near five hundred pounds; but were

               <p>After this he robbed ſometimes with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and ſometimes by himſelf; but having got ſeven or eight hundred pounds, he did not run ſuch deſperate riſques as formerly, altho' he met with ſeveral hard and deſperate encounters on the road, by which he had received ſeveral wounds, and ſome very terrible ones indeed, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one with a piſtol bullet, which broke his arm, and another with a ſword, which run him quite thro' the body; but it miſſing his vitals he it cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The cure being pretty chargeable, and they lying about ſix months out of buſineſs, they made the beſt of their way to Hounſlow, where meet-with a coach and ſix, they robbed it of near two hundred pounds in money and jewels, and twogold

Upon this, flying out of France into Spain, he went upon a day of public entertainment to the duke of Medina Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ll's houſe, where ſeeing ſeveral pieces of plate in a trunk, ready for the ſervants to attend their lords with, he dreſſed himſelf in a Spaniſh habit, like the ſteward of the houſe, and deſiring the ſervants to ſit off the trunk, he carried it away.</p>
               <p>By this time Gilder-Roy, thinking all the noiſe was over about him in his own country, reſolved
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035355_0136_10049F2E75DE5820"/>to go to Scotland again, where he ſoon became as notorious a highwayman, as ever was in the country before. He firſt robbed the earl of Lith lingow of a gold watch, a diamond ring, and 80 pieces of gold; by which he became ſo terrible, that people were afraid to travel; and when he wanted money, he would go into Athol, Locha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Angeni, Mar, Baqueham; Murrey, Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all over the north, and drive away their cattle, unleſs they paid him contributions, which they did quarterly.</p>
               <p>One time Oliver Cromwell embarking at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naghadee, in the North of Ireland, landed at Port-Patrick, in Scotland, which Gilder-Roy hearing of, met him and two ſervants in the road to Glaſgow, bidding him ſtand and deliver; when, after the exchange of ſome piſtols, Gilder-Roy made off, and they purſued him, when Gilder-Roy turning ſhort, ſhot Oliver's horſe, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down broke Oliver's leg; then he killed one of the ſervants, and gave the other quarter; which done, finding Oliver lame, he tied his legs under an aſs's belly, and ſent them both to ſeek their fortune.</p>
               <p>Three of his companions being taken, and ſent to Glaſgow goal, were ordered to be hanged in chains; which Gilder-Roy reſenting, he vowed revenge one time or other; and a little after, meeting the judge upon the road to Aberdeen, he ſtripped his coachman and two footmen, tied them neck and heels, and threw, them into a pond; he then robbed the judge and killed his four horſes, and carried him to the tree where
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035355_0137_10049F300EEBD6E8"/>his companions hanged, (which in Scotland is like a turn ſtile) where upon the fourth beam he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the judge, ſaying, "By my ſol, mun, as this ſtructure, erected to break people's cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
