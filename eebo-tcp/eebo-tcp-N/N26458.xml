            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>PERMIT me to ſalute you upon our, joyful anniverſary. Since our laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, Maſonry has been placed before the world in unuſual, but impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, attitudes. In an age of revolutions, when jealouſy has all its power, and can violate what creates its fears, we could not expect that any aſſociation, much leſs a ſecret one, ſhould be heard of without anxious apprehenſions. Jealouſy, led by faction, will cut the knot it cannot untie. When it is the guardian of the public rights, it will claim to hold what may fall into the hands of a public enemy. It
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035180_0005_100105F901FC9350"/>always may be prompted by envy, which always hates ſucceſs. And thus the beſt inſtitutions have been ſacrificed, in all ages, to the jealouſy and the folly of mankind.</p>
            <p>MASONRY could not be forgotten. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to the whole ſocial character, it would be ſeen by every eye, which inquired for man. It would appear in every attitude in which man could be placed, ready to give him the counſels of its wiſdom. It is not then to be wondered, that it has been the ſubject of angry contention, and of vile miſrepreſentation. Beauty, while it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports innocence into love, fills the envious with miſery and death.</p>
            <p>BUT this has been remarkable in the preſent ſtate of Maſonry in this country. At the time, in which it would willingly have diſappeared from the jealous eyes of the world, every cauſe has contributed to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035180_0006_1001282E42799F08"/>force it upon the public notice. Succeſs gave an anxious ſolicitude to poſſeſs its ſecrets. They who have not hated it from prejudice, have therefore become friends from their curioſity. Its rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs has therefore rather aſked a check from its friends, than given any juſt fears from its pretended enemies. The ſuſpicions are, of themſelves, a powerful cauſe of the proſperity. In vain then do they impute to the worſt cauſes, what is the ſimple and natural effect of their own apprehenſions. The Brethren are tempted to view them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a new light, from their great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſtrength. They are tempted to defy thoſe, whom it will always be dangerous to deſpiſe. In ſuch a novel ſituation, Maſons have condeſcended to vindicate themſelves before the public, a tribunal at which they ought never to have been challenged. They have plead their innocence, and even promiſed to obey the laws. Their duty, and their love,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035180_0007_1001282FD0EC2740"/>has now become their public oath. By theſe meaſures, they make flow advances to the public favour. The world want not our promiſe; they wiſh to hold us in their power. They know not the means we poſſeſs to attain the worſt ends, or the beſt. It is then upon our public character we muſt at laſt depend; and upon this, in ſome circumſtances, the world would depend, with greater confidence, if we ſhould ſay nothing in our own vindication.</p>
            <p>BUT what is wiſe and ſafe in ſome, is not in all circumſtances. To expreſs a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to our adminiſtration, in common with our fellow citizens, was our right; and the form, in which we could moſt innocently expreſs our allegiance to the government, was in the public addreſſes, which public favour had patroniſed. The replies we have received are before the public; and how much they have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the reputation of the Craft, muſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035180_0008_100105FECFF897B0"/>be determined by thoſe who read them. The addreſs to General WASHINGTON, as a Brother, muſt have the beſt effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gives us his own teſtimony, that he is a ſtranger to any ill deſigns of our inſtitution. But the replies of Preſident ADAMS, ſuch as he was indeed obliged to offer, have only left us where he found us, if in ſo happy condition. His anſwers are candid, but he could know nothing. His anſwer to Maſſachuſetts Grand Lodge inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates his hopes. To Maryland, he ſeems to expreſs even his fears. To Vermont, he ſays, he believes the inſtitution has been uſeful. But while he expreſſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the American Lodges, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to hold our Lodges capable of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. His words are, Maſons "will beſt know whether any dangers are poſſible in other countries, as well as this." The preſent ſtate of France has afforded the plea for theſe inſinuations, eſpecially at a time, when that nation is held up to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035180_0009_1001061163F17638"/>world in the darkeſt colours. We have no concern with the true national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but there is a very important diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, in our favour, between the ſtate of France before the revolution, and after that event. We expreſs the greateſt affection to our own government unequivocally, now we are its lawful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: as Maſons and citizens we ought to do it, and we muſt do it. Why then ſhould not the French do the ſame to their own? If there were any errour, it muſt be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing the revolution in the Lodges; and that was never proved upon the Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in France, more than upon the Lodges in America, and never will be proved. They will never take the praiſe, or the blame. It is from the neglect of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, that our common cauſe is ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is the proof we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. It is of the greateſt conſequence to deny the laſt fact, but to the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Maſonry to learn that the Maſons
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035180_0010_100106036381A920"/>in France had early the ſpirit of their own government, whatever it might be. It would be a ſad complaint from the people, as well as from the king, that they were oppoſed by the Lodges. It is evident they were not enemies to the king, or to the people.</p>
            <p>THIS truth makes a well informed Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to view with concern, that ſo many are thoughtleſs of the deſign of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If they can only perſuade the people of our guilt in any place, their great point is gained. It is a common cauſe, and it muſt ſuffer. It is for this reaſon that a late Scotch profeſſor has thrown out his charges in an artful confuſion, ſo as to prove nothing, and yet imply every thing; to engage the public ſuſpicions, and yet not to ſuffer every man to ſee that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was ungenerous, and political, and his work deſtitute of truth. If, in any country, Maſons are detected, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035180_0011_100128315770D2F0"/>cauſe is deſperate. And it is to this preſumption the Preſident, in all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, juſtly directs our attention. A reply then to the Scotchman, is our ſalvation. It was ſo perceived in the Engliſh Lodges, as their numerous printed vindications will diſcover. And the exceptions made in favour of England and America, are only ſo many ſubterfuges to make us inſenſible of our common danger; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiate a general charge in the public mind, and then to ſtab the vitals of our inſtitution; when we, by a careleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Scotch profeſſor, had already ſigned our own death warrant.</p>
            <p>OF another artifice, the Brethren have not been ſufficiently aware. The ſimple Lodges, who are the ſoul of Maſonry, are to be involved in all the conſequences of the higher orders, when theſe are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juriſdiction of the ſimple Lodges, and cannot poſſibly originate in them, or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035180_0012_1001060B1F0B9220"/>be known by them. Legiſlators are ſuch, only when together. We ſhould confine our defence to the ſimple Lodges. The example which has given the public alarm is directly to our purpoſe. Where begins the errour in the French Lodges? It was imported from the interiour parts of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, from a German Lodge. What was that German Lodge? No Lodge at all. For when the founder of it was queſtioned, he has proved, ſays even his enemy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively, that he was not a Maſon when what is called his Lodge was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. It was no more a Maſon's Lodge, than our Marine Society, or the <hi>Phi Beta Kappa</hi> of the lads of Cambridge. The founder ſays, "I knew nothing of Maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, till years afterwards." We ſhould take the preciſe object, and make our defence upon the real inſtitution, and its eternal principles.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me then briefly to point out to you the important end of our inſtitution,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035180_0013_1001283514D4B3E0"/>conſidered as diſtinct from the national religion. Let me ſhew you the real expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of ſecret ſocieties, from the nature of man; and then let me expoſe to you briefly the want of internal evidence in the late attempts to faſten the charge of a conſpiracy upon our order. We may then paſs to the duties of this joyful anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
            <p>ON the preſent occaſion we ſhould not have troubled ourſelves with ſo needleſs a compariſon, as of the different ends of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry and Religion, and yet of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of both, had not a popular objection been formed from it. We might as ſoon have thought that there was no need of an account book, becauſe there was a bible; or no need of laws, the Congreſs, or Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe there was a religion, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and a God. But when trifles can ſeize the public attention, they can become important things in their conſequences.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035180_0014_1001060FB02397D8"/>The anſwers muſt then be adapted to thoſe, upon whom prejudice can have any power. And did Paul reap no benefit from Roman liberty, after he became a chriſtian? Can a man have no relief, but from a chriſtian? If a man can prove himſelf a profeſſed chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, need he no other claim upon charity? A Chriſtian is of a ſect, and of a ſeparate communion, every where, and from neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is one family which he chooſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and enters. It is a union with opinions, not with the world. Paul tells the chriſtians, that they are not of the world; but not that therefore they ought to go out of the world. There are friendſhips and ſocial duties with all mankind. Whatſoever things are lovely, and of good reputation; wherever there is virtue and praiſe, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are ſo practiſe ſuch things. We have our intercourſe of buſineſs, and our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of life, as well as of religion. We engage in the commerce of the world, and are obliged to ſee man, when we are to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035180_0015_100128369953A480"/>forget the prejudices of his heart and of his head. There is then no better reaſon that the ſame man ſhould not be a Maſon, and a Chriſtian, than that he ſhould not be clothed, becauſe he is fed; or that he ſhould not have an uncle, a benefactor, or a friend, while his father was living. The object of Chriſtianity and Maſonry never can be the ſame, becauſe chriſtianity has, as its immediate object, the advancement of perſonal virtue always above the ſtate of ſociety in common life. It propoſes its higheſt rewards in a future exiſtence, and directs all its aſſociations to this end. Our inſtitution provides immediately for the friendſhip of life and manners through the the world, when we overlook all the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in it, and regard only ſafety, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and our ſocial intereſt.</p>
            <p>FEW men, who think, and obſerve the different ends of life, will be content to dwell upon this objection. Another more
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035180_0016_100128381E641EF0"/>ſpecious is ready. What need can there be for any ſecret ſocieties? Why may not every thing be open, common, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal? This is language adapted to the unthinking. It ſeems ſocial, generous, and even great, while it is diſorganizing. It is what is to be wiſhed, but cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be obtained. But let us conſult the nature of man. What is the ſocial ſpring? Is it the knowledge or love of all men? Does man begin to act from himſelf, or from the whole? Is not the ſocial ſpring, preſervation, which he learns to employ? He then firſt looks to things near to him. As he riſes and ſurveys, he looks further on. But ſtill the proſpect is bounded, and diſtant objects are not diſtinct. Muſt he delay till all men agree? He might as well ſtop the tide of life, call the infant into man, and convert man into an angel. What would be his fate, if he regarded not any, till he could enjoy all? What world is provided to render him happy? The
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035180_0017_10010615F8670E70"/>principle of private aſſociations is then univerſal, and always employed. Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betrays it among ſavages. It is the privilege of every profeſſion, and of every art. The myſteries of Greece are in name immortal. They ſurvived, at Rome, the glory of Greece. They were indulged in the forms of the primitive Church. They belong to the uſual confidence of life. They aſſiſt in the nature of friendſhip, and form the excluſive right which makes of twain one fleſh. The diſciples of Jeſus dared not to blame the lovely confidence, which the character of John inſpired. It is then a privilege by birth right from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It is the choice boon of friendſhip. It is the right of common nature through the globe, and poſſeſſed by common law, and the conſent of nations, in ſome degree, through the world. It can be abridged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the loſs of rational liberty, and can be ſurrendered to no government, but as the laſt price to be paid for a miſerable
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035180_0018_10010643CE9D2278"/>exiſtence. This ark of God has been touched, when the ſalutary arts by which man conveys himſelf to man have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; when reading, writing and ſpeaking have been prohibited; when travelling abroad has been prevented; when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of foreigners have been reſtrained; when a change of condition has been refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to induſtry, to genius and to virtue. All theſe things have been the ſubjects of many laws, and have been taken from mankind, upon the plauſible pretences of public over private right. But laws ſhould have juſtice; and the greateſt good of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private character is that juſtice. We ſtand then in the liberty in which God has made us free.</p>
            <p>BUT no right can licence any abuſe. To prove this abuſe to be real, is the laſt effort of political ſtratagem. It is that by which the moſt innocent orders have been puniſhed with the guilty. The ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035180_0019_1001283A691D5848"/>are taught, that Maſonry is againſt Chriſtianity; the ignorant, that we are unſocial and narrow in our foundation. But the politician affirms, that our right cannot be ſafe to civil ſociety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot exiſt as a civil privilege. The abuſe in fact is neceſſary to ſupport the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to refuſe the privilege. It has been pretended. But we ought to be guarded againſt a ſword, which, when drawn, is againſt Maſonry throughout the world. We are firſt to be made hateful, and then we ſhall be abandoned to oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>BUT let us examine the internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the books which contain the proofs of the moſt dangerous abuſe; a conſpiracy againſt ſociety, law, and even of man againſt himſelf. Where was it diſcovered? In Germany. Where did it act? In France. France then was revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionized by Germany. This is news, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. Who began it? A man who ſays,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035180_0020_1001061A90A7C370"/>what he did, he did when he knew nothing of Maſonry; and his enemies acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it. Why then ſhould Maſonry ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it? But how did the French get it? They found it. When? After the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans dropped it. So futile is the whole hiſtory. But who believes it? Not one good writer among the forty millions of Germans, who knew the whole pretence. What ſay men abroad? That it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious work, without proper documents, and juſt evidence. Who publiſhed it? Men, who have taken up an evil report, who do not agree together. But who were the principal agents in the pretended miſchief? Of the chief, his many works ſpeak genius, love of order, and love of truth; and he is as quiet a man, and as uſeful, as ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has in it. The moſt active, has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed works before and ſince this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which prove him a zealous Chriſtian. Of the laſt, a man of the greateſt addreſs, and the greateſt traveller, and to whom is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035180_0021_1001283E3AEEAB80"/>charged the moſt miſchief, it is affirmed by himſelf, that he knew nothing of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatiſm but from the public prints. What kind of conſpiracy is this? But how do the accuſers agree? They were not on the ground, and do not agree in their own documents, and miſrepreſentations have been proved upon them all. But how have theſe accuſed men been puniſhed? The leading characters publiſh their works with applauſe, and have the public confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Were their deſigns ever made known? Yes, and patroniſed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Their meetings were at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and the Proteſtants had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; and the ſalutary meaſures were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in America. Whence then aroſe the trouble? The government changed its meaſures; till at length, from the freeſt political inquiries, the Emperour proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the extreme of prohibiting the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſuch books, of a ſize that a poor man could purchaſe. Were there any charges
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035180_0022_1001281D45693D18"/>of rebellion, or of public diſcontents, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe men? No; of ſpeculative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions only. Who then were theſe men of ſpeculation? Men of letters, living in and maintained by the ſtate; not diſaffected men. What were their ſpeculations? Any thing which ſlander and ſuſpicion could ſuggeſt. Was there no pretended evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Yes, from writings never ſigned, and abſolutely denied. Their worſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were confeſſedly filled with the pureſt morality; and all the papers of their proceedings were offered to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they offered to ſtand trial upon them. Who were the men? Chiefly cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen; four fifths of them were either of this order, or profeſſors in univerſities; and they had no livings from the people, but from the government. What end had they? The accuſation propoſes no end but wanton miſchief, in which they had every thing to loſe, and nothing to gain. Did the clergy of France or America deſert
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035180_0023_1001283FC4E111B8"/>their eſtabliſhments in this manner? It is well known that no men in public livings ever did. How did they conduct in their aſſociations? Profeſſed good principles, and were ſaid to be open in their opinions, even when charged with conſpiracy. The diſſolution of the order was from a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with particular members. The charges were brought, not againſt all, but a few of ſuppoſed higher grades. The accuſers before the public were convicted of ignorance, and as not belonging to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they accuſed. And it is confeſſed, that ejected religious orders were buſy with their reſentments in all the tranſactions. The characters are ſo grouped, that every man may ſee the abſurdity of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended concurrence. Such is ingenuouſly the ſubſtance of the whole evidence to prove the abuſe of Maſonry, and then to degrade the whole inſtitution. It has but one apology, and that ariſes from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the world. Alarm was every
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035180_0024_1001061E9C1F2C48"/>where. Phantoms and ſpectres became every where real beings. Men ſuſpected every thing. And this was the opportunity to accompliſh the purpoſes of a falſe zeal, of private reſentment, or of the moſt dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ambition of power. But it is too late. Free Maſons have long been in the quiet poſſeſſion of their ancient privileges. Theſe, from long indulgence, they conſider as their juſt liberty; and, as they have never forfeited it, they will continue to hold and to enjoy it.</p>
            <p>THE beſt purpoſes of life in civil ſociety have led men to ſuch aſſociations. The myſteries of Greece gave freedom to the ſpirit even of a Philoſopher in the days of ancient liberty. Rome conſented to accept the gift. Roman citizenſhip gave a rich value to aſſociation in civil ſociety; and the religious orders ſupported the cauſe of the church, by extending the ſame idea to the chriſtian religion. The Jeſuits made
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035180_0025_100128414999EA90"/>the bold experiment of its power, with unexampled ſucceſs, and might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in glory, had they not been pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by private ambition. Maſons have not made a bolder, but ſafer experiment. Without regard to forms of government, or private opinions, it embraces every where what is happy for man, upon the laws of his own conſtitution. It puts that as a law, which is found convenient. It takes up ſo much of the character of man, as agrees with his firſt duties. It was thus the old Abbe ST. PIERRE gave the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his project for a perpetual peace. It is thus KANT, in the ſame deſign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to reſtore confidence among mankind. Our principles are the ſober theory of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, which muſt bleſs the world.</p>
            <p>HAPPY then muſt we be in our ancient inſtitution. Its object is to find an home, wherever man is to be found. It bids eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brother to take the leſſons of his duty
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035180_0026_100106232EFCCF00"/>from his heart. There is no obligation of gratitude, but go, and do likewife. It is man it loves, and with God it unites to bleſs him in every clime.</p>
            <p>ON the preſent anniverſary, the ESSEX LODGE is not without the moſt pleaſing recollections. The ſame faithful Maſter, who firſt bleſſed our Lodge, and whoſe name is in all the Lodges, is yet with us, and contributed largely to adorn the new building we have raiſed. How indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, perſevering, and benevolent, have been his labours! Who, that taſtes the joy of this day, and is grateful for its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does not love the name of HILLER? <note n="*" place="margin">JOSEPH HILLER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Collector of the Port of Salem.</note> Let him reſt from his labours, in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the temple he has raiſed. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Lodge was ſincere, when our late Maſter, <note n="†" place="margin">EDWARD PULLING, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Attorney at Law.</note> in whom united our ut moſt confidence and affection, accepted the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035180_0027_100128445B892608"/>of his equal government, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous prudence. We have preſerved the harmony, which he gave to the Brethren. Often ſhall we lament the ſad indiſpoſition, which obliges his abſence, and which gives a two-fold bereavement to his ſpirits, when he thinks of the ſeparation. Infirmity may impair our own memory, but we may live in the memory of our friends. Time has never made the bold deſign of a palace rude, like the native quarry, by effacing the grandeur from the venerable ruins. But bleſſed be the power of good example. Our ſucceſſion is happy, though ſo often renewed. There are ready maſter builders for our nobleſt deſigns. The unanimity in our election of the preſent Maſter, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Captain DENJAMIN HODOIS.</note> is an honourable teſtimony to him, and a ſure proof that he has the richeſt materials in his hands. There is harmony in the work, induſtry in the taſk, and zeal for perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is no common honour to unite in ourſelves the afrections of the faithful. And
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035180_0028_100128475FE65608"/>the conſidence of Brethren exacts the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of duty. Happy are we in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that our own obligations will increaſe, and that we ſhall owe every duty to our cauſe, as the juſt and higheſt reward of a generous benefactor, who is conſecrated to our ſervice. Our pillars ſtand ſtrong. The ſame eye continues to watch over our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the ſame hand engraves our deeds on the tables we have prepared. We deſcend to the world by eaſy ſteps, and the door is ſhut in peace.</p>
            <p>THE character of human life uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, while we recount the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, that we ſhould with friendly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection admoniſh of growing evils; for, as the weeds, they will grow in the garden of God. While jealouſy ſtands ready to mark the leaſt errours, and while ſad experience may prove, that errours may every where exiſt; while we have artful men around us to miſrepreſent, and weak men to miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this is the time when ſuch admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035180_0029_10010627C7E681B8"/>are juſt. But it is a lovely reflection on the preſent occaſion, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leſs neceſſary; and it is the pureſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of my ſoul, for the honour of the Craft, that we may remain with the ſame glory which now diſtinguiſhes us. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity has not higher hopes. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted charity; the undiſſembled conſent of ſoul; the ready ſervice in our common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; the juſt reputation of the members; and the real virtues of their lives, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the pureſt congratulations. Their induſtry, ſucceſs, and hopes, inſpire the higheſt praiſe.</p>
            <p>LET us venerate our ancient inſtitution. Our conſent in this ſimple form, unites us with all nations. Our hearts are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the nobleſt duties. We can aſſiſt the world in its beſt hopes, and certainly concur in the beſt ends of civil ſociety. Aſſociation we learn from God.</p>

            <p>GREAT Light of Life! whom all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings love, becauſe they enjoy thee! In every thing thou art, and in us. We live in the light of thy countenance. We exiſt by thy ſtrength, and are harmony in thee. Bleſs us, even us, O our Father! Give us one ſoul. Influence us by the ſame zeal. Purify us by the ſame light of truth. In the joy of this day we praiſe thee. Joy makes our praiſe ſublime! Bleſs the Brethren, one in name and in heart. Bleſs the Elect, who ſtand near thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent thy power. May they proclaim alſo thy wildom and love. May the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be glorious and farm, like the arch of heaven, in which all the revolutions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are performed. May the Wardens be ſure as the poles of our globe. May the Deacons be conſtant as the hours. May the Treaſurer keep what time cannot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; and the Secretary record what eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth ſhall approve. May the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards be faithful, as the earth in its rich increaſe; and the Tyler be like the eye of a kind providence, which watches unſeen. All in thee, and each in all. To the great Light of Life be glory.</p>
