            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHOULD, perhaps, have had rather leſs need than I have at preſent, to apologize for the inaccuracy of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſes, had they been compoſed with any deſign to make them more public than by preaching them. However, it is, even now, almoſt needleſs to aſk Your candor towards One, who has ſo long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced it; and to aſk candor of ſome Others, would, I know, be in vain. Theſe Diſcourſes, ſuch as they are, were written and preached, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire to ſerve You in Your moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intereſt: I mean, to aſſiſt You in underſtanding ſome of the doctrines, and to excite You to practice all the duties, of the Goſpel. With the ſame view it is, that they are now publiſhed. I hope they will not be quite uſeleſs to You;
<pb facs="unknown:007488_0003_102B8F7DB92BF898"/>
or, indeed, to any who ſhall read them with a chriſtian ſpirit, inſtead of doing it in the antichriſtian, illiberal ſpirit, of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and party.</p>
            <p>THE doctrinal ſentiments running thro' them, are ſuch as I have been led into, and confirmed in, by a careful inquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truth, eſpecially in the HOLY SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES, without a zealous attachment to, or prejudice againſt, the opinions of Others. However, I pretend not to be exempted from miſtakes. There may poſſibly be errors in theſe Diſcourſes: If there are, I am very ſorry; and as heartily deſirous that thoſe who read, may diſcover and avoid, them. And if ſome perſon that is wiſer than myſelf, would point them out to Me, he would make me his debtor; eſpecially if he ſhould do it in the ſpirit of charity and meekneſs.</p>
            <p>IF there are any conſiderable, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errors in theſe Diſcourſes, I may venture to ſay, they are not diſguiſed by any kind of artifice: They do not juſt peep thro' the maſk of ſtudied, equivocal, and ambiguous phraſes; nor ſkulk in the dark, as it were from a conſciouſneſs of what they are, and a fear of being detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: They appear in open day-light, with all the naked boldneſs of truth and innocence. For I have conceived,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:007488_0004_102B8F7FEFBFEC38"/>
That the the end of ſpeaking, eſpecially of preaching, was to expreſs, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, a man's real ſentiments: Tho' I know that I, herein, differ from many of my own Order! This will be a great eaſe and advantage to any Perſon, who ſhall bring a charge of <hi>hereſy</hi> againſt me; and undertake to convict me of it, whether privately or publickly. But You are ſenſible, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> that there is ſome difference betwixt railing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; and, conſequently, betwixt a man's being ſcolded at, and refuted. I wiſh ſome other people knew this alſo! But I muſt now declare, once for all, That I will not be, even <hi>religiouſly</hi> ſcolded, nor pitied, nor wept and lamented, out of any principles which I believe upon the authority of Scripture, in the exerciſe of that ſmall ſhare of reaſon which God has given me: Nor will I poſtpone this authority, to that of all the good <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, even with that of the good <hi>Mothers</hi> added to it!</p>
            <p>THE only favour which I have, now, to aſk of You, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> and of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who may happen to read theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, is, That you would do it with an open, unprejudiced mind; and then either reject, or believe and practice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light and conviction of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:007488_0005_102B8F817687EE30"/>
your own conſciences. Religion is a matter of too great importance to be only ſlightly thought of: It demands Your firſt and laſt attention. And as I hope You are all too ſenſible of common human frailty, to be uncharitable bigots and party-men in religion; ſo I hope You are, on the other hand, too wiſe to be ſceptics: The two extreams, into which men of weak and wicked minds often run; ſometimes, indeed, out of the one, directly into the other, without ſtopping a moment at the golden medium.</p>
            <p>YOU have a juſt title, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> to my warmeſt good wiſhes, and to my prayers, by virtue of the relation in which I ſtand towards You: Theſe wiſhes and prayers are, That You may all <q>know the truth as it is in JESUS;</q> and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partake of that bleſſed life, and glorious immortality, brought to light by HIM, thro' the Goſpel. But, in the mean time, I will not forget to wiſh You all temporal and worldly proſperity; being, in all reſpects,</p>

               <hi>FIRST,</hi> I am to repreſent the obligation lying upon all Chriſtians in general to be <hi>Hearers</hi> of the Word and Goſpel of the Kingdom. I ſay, lying upon <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> becauſe it is to ſuch, that the apoſtle is here ſpeaking; not to uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to thoſe of the <hi>twelve Tribes ſcattered abroad,</hi> who were already proſelyted to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> as appears from the Epiſtle itſelf. However it is not meant, that this is the duty of Chriſtians, excluſively of others. Our Saviour having commanded, that the goſpel ſhould be preached <hi>for a witneſs</hi> to all People; all are accordingly required to hearken to it; and thoſe who refuſe to do this, are, in the language of ſcripture, ſaid to <hi>judge themſelves</hi>

               <hi>unworthy of eternal life.</hi> But ſeeing the apoſtle <hi>James</hi> here directs his Diſcourſe to profeſſed Chriſtians, I ſhall confine myſelf to ſuch.</p>
            <p>IT is not to be ſuppoſed, that when Perſons are once become Believers of the Goſpel, they need have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The apoſtle expreſſes himſelf in a manner that preſuppoſes it to be the known, acknowledged duty of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in common, to give conſtant and diligent Heed to <hi>the word which began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed by them that heard him:</hi> For his Exhortation chiefly reſpects the <hi>manner</hi> in which this word of Truth ought to be received; the duty of Hearing it <hi>in general,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather taken for granted, than directly aſſerted. And by his uſing the Expreſſion of <hi>hearing the word,</hi> repeatedly, as he does in the Context, it is at leaſt probable, that he had a ſpecial reference to hearing it preached <hi>in Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> at <hi>ſtated Times,</hi> by thoſe whoſe ſpecial <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> it was to <hi>teach,</hi> to <hi>reprove,</hi> to <hi>rebuke,</hi> and <hi>exhort, with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

whoever will be at the pains to look into the Chapter, will, if I miſtake not, find that St. <hi>James</hi> had a particular reference to the ſtated, and divinely inſtituted method of Chriſtian edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Aſſemblies and Churches of the Saints; wherein one Perſon, at leaſt, exerciſed the office of a Teacher; inſtructing the young and ignorant, ſtirring up the minds of the more knowing, and inculcating upon all, the practice of Chriſtian piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>THIS was one very conſiderable end, tho' not the only one, propoſed in the firſt inſtitution of Chriſtian Aſſemblies. And it is, in a great meaſure, by this means that Chriſtianity has been handed down from age to age, from generation to generation; tho' not with equal purity and advantage in all times and places. And one may venture to aſſert, that, upon the whole, great good has reſulted to the world from this practice; and that Chriſtians cannot, under any pretence whatever, <hi>forſake the aſſembling of themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> for the mentioned purpoſe, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly culpable. This is a Method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification, that is plainly of divine inſtitution, and therefore demands the regard and ſubmiſſion of all Chriſtians, at all times, and in all places, wherein it is practicable. Nor can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to this inſtitution, be uſeleſs and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to any, who aſſemble to hear the word with that <hi>meekneſs</hi> which the Apoſtle injoins: I
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007488_0013_102B8F910904F1D8"/>
mean, provided the Goſpel is preached to them in any tolerable degree of purity and integrity. To be ſure the upholding of theſe Aſſemblies muſt be very advantageous to all that frequent them, if the holy Scriptures are read therein from time to time, in a language that is underſtood by all. Which, by the way, ought, I ſuppoſe, to be one ſtated and conſtant part of the religious exerciſe in theſe aſſemblies: Nor is the Omiſſion hereof very conſiſtent with that regard Chriſtians in general profeſs, for theſe ſacred writings; and which they evidently claim, as being <hi>given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God;</hi> and the great rule of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> Theſe Scriptures at leaſt, are "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that every man and child of God may be perfect, and throughly furniſhed unto all good works." To them we ought ſurely to give "diligent heed, as unto a light ſhining in a dark place; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſure word of prophecy;" and graciouſly given us of God, to guide our feet into the paths of truth and peace, until the dawn of a more perfect day, "and the day-ſtar ariſe in our Hearts."</p>
            <p>NOR can it be reaſonably tho't, that the word preached even by fallible men, is altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unprofitable to them that duly attend upon it. On the contrary, this is very condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the good end mentioned; and, as was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007488_0014_102B8F933A751A68"/>
intimated before, claims our regard, as an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Saviour, the Head of the Church; Who when he aſcended up on high, gave not only Apoſtles, Prophets and Evangeliſts; but alſo "<hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of His body, 'till we all come in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt; that we be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine."</p>
            <p>HOWEVER imperfectly this buſineſs of public teaching and exhorting; of expounding the holy Scriptures, and urging the motives to evangelical obedience, may often be performed; yet it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably ſubſervient to very good ends; and ſhould not be contemned and diſregarded by any that call themſelves Chriſt's Diſciples. It will be no great compliment upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> (an order of men which I am not much diſpoſed to flatter) to ſay, that there are many perſons in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who are not ſuch proficients in Chriſtian knowledge, as to be quite paſt receiving any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from them; eſpecially from ſuch of them as "rightly divide the Word of truth." And ſome of thoſe perſons, who preſume this to be their own caſe, may after all be a little miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in themſelves; and think as much too highly of their own abilities, as they do too lowly of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007488_0015_102B8F951EB7E058"/>
thoſe of others. To be ſure, one ſhall hardly meet with more vain, ſuperficial, empty Creatures, than amongſt thoſe who take it upon them to run down that order of men; and to ſet them at naught, as tho' all their inſtructions were uſeleſs to the world, at beſt. And the Clergy muſt be very ignorant indeed, ignorant of the rudiments and firſt principles of Chriſtianity, were they not able to inſtruct a multitude of theſe bluſtering <hi>Sparks,</hi> and fooliſh, conceited <hi>Scoffers,</hi> who take it upon themſelves to run them down. But all compariſons are ſaid to be odious; and, perhaps, there can be none more ſo than ſuch an one as this—</p>
            <p>IT is not to be doubted, indeed, but that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Laiety,</hi> (I uſe this <hi>term</hi> merely for diſtinction ſake; not by way of reproach and contempt, as it has too often been uſed by ſome arrogant <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi>) It is not to be doubted, I ſay, but that amongſt the Laiety there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, from whom a great part of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy might be glad to be inſtructed, even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are more peculiarly their own province. But on the other hand, it is to be remembred, that there are great numbers of children and youth; and many perſons of adult age, that are either of mean education, or none at all; many poor, labouring people, who have no time for reading and contemplation; and many others ſo embarraſſed with a multiplicity of buſineſs, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007488_0016_102B8F97C6C74678"/>
the cares of this life, that they do not in fact ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the acquiſition of Chriſtian ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and I might ſtill add, great numbers of a low capacity, who after all their diligence and pains, can attain to but little knowledge; I ſay there are great numbers of theſe different ſorts or claſſes of people, that may ſurely receive ſome uſeful inſtruction even from the <hi>pulpit.</hi> Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the clergy only a common ſhare of natural underſtanding, (and it would ſeem hard to deny them this) it is very ſtrange if, with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a learned education, and ſeveral, perhaps many, years cloſe application to the ſtudy of ſacred ſcience, they are not qualified to be teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of babes; of raw, untaught, undiſciplined youth; of thoſe whoſe lot it is to labour almoſt inceſſantly for the <hi>meat that periſheth;</hi> of thoſe who have never given much of their attention to the ſubject of religion; and of thoſe who are not even capable of attaining to any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of this knowledge, for a certain reaſon already hinted at.—So that after we have excepted all thoſe, who have any, even the leaſt pretence to be excepted, on account of their ſuperior capacity and extenſive knowledge; there are multitudes in all Chriſtian countries, who ought to be <hi>Hearers of the word</hi> as publickly <hi>preached,</hi> were it only for the inſtruction in truth and righteouſneſs, which they may gain by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon this inſtitution. And how few
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007488_0017_102B8F994E54EE18"/>
there are, comparatively ſpeaking, who have any right to look upon themſelves as <hi>exceptions</hi> in the preſent caſe, upon the ſcore of their being <hi>wiſer than their teachers,</hi> I ſhall not preſume to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>BUT as to thoſe who are really too great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients in ſacred knowledge, to be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>inſtructed</hi> in this way; (let their number be greater or leſs) they ſhould remember that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, moſt properly ſo called, is very far from being the whole deſign of preaching, and of hearing the word. There are other good and important ends to be anſwered hereby, which are common to all Chriſtians in general; to the wiſe and learned, as well as to the ſimple and illiterate. Are not the minds and memories of the more knowing, to be ſtirred up and refreſhed; and their attention to the great doctrines and duties of the goſpel, awakened from time to time, as well as the minds of the ignorant to be informed? The preacher, tho' of no diſtinguiſhed talents whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural or acquired, may poſſibly edify the wiſeſt of his auditors, and ſuch as are much wiſer than himſelf; by putting them in mind of what they before knew, and were eſtabliſhed in. The Apoſtles themſelves did not always propoſe, in their preaching and writing, to afford new light and information to their hearers, and thoſe to whom they wrote. <q>I will not be negligent, ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to put you always in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007488_0018_102B8F9B8B168040"/>
of theſe things, altho' ye know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth. Yea I think it meet, as long as I am in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, to ſtir you up, by putting you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</q> Thoſe who conceive that the informing of men's underſtandings, either is, or ought to be, the ſole end of preaching; and who therefore excuſe themſelves from hearing, under a notion that they cannot be taught or inſtructed, are ſo far from being the wiſeſt of men, (unleſs it is in their own vain imaginations) that they want one to "teach them even the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the oracles of God;" and have much more need of that <hi>milk</hi> which they loath and deſpiſe, than of that <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> which their too forward and vitiated appetite ſo eagerly craves, and hankers after.</p>
            <p>MEN that are truly wiſe, are ſenſible that they need ſomething beſides ſpeculative knowledge, ſomething beſides the ſcience of religion, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the furniture of the head. They know they are but too apt to let ſlip many uſeful and ſalutary truths, which ought to be always preſent with them; and which may be again ſuggeſted to them, even by perſons that are every way their inferiors. Such Perſons alſo know, that old truths may be ſet in new and different points of light, ſo as to come better recommended to their underſtandings, and to take faſter hold of the mind and conſcience, than they have done before.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007488_0019_102B8F9D1385B9F8"/>
They are aware how apt good impreſſions on the heart, are to wear out, or at leaſt to grow faint and dim, if not frequently renewed. They know that the ſpirit of devotion, and the religion of the heart, is a fire which will inſenſibly languiſh and go to decay, in the damps and miſts and impure vapors of this world, if it be not often ſupplied with new fewel from heaven, and from that word of God which is ſometimes like a fire, to melt and inflame the heart, as well as, at others, like a ſword to pierce, or a hammer to break it in pieces. They are ſenſible how expedient and profitable it is, to have the great proofs of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity ſet before them from time to time; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great motives to holineſs of life; the majeſty and perfections of God; the love and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the vanity of this world; the excellency and happineſs of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the glories and terrors of the laſt day; the joys of the righteous, and the deſtruction and miſery of the wicked. Wiſe men do not think it uſeleſs, to be frequently reminded of ſuch things: but know the benefit hereof, and that even a weak man may prove a friendly monitor to them in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>IT is farther to be obſerved, that thoſe who are not directly able to inſtruct others, may yet be a means, in the hand of providence, of ſuggeſting and hinting ſome things to them, which they never happened to think of before; and which
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007488_0020_102B8F9F4DA2C8A0"/>
may naturally lead them into a long train of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reflection. And in this ſenſe, God does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſometimes <hi>ordain praiſe, even cut of the mouths of babes and ſucklings.</hi> In fine here, thoſe who really deſerve the character of wiſe men, (a character to which ſo many put in their claim, without any colour of right and juſtice) know, that it is folly for men to pretend to be wiſer than their maker; or to throw contempt upon any of his inſtitutions, from a vain conceit that they do not need them. They will therefore, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerves, <hi>hear, and increaſe learning.</hi> The moſt ſure and effectually means of <hi>growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is to walk in all his <hi>ordinances</hi> blameleſs; of which, hearing the word, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>one.</hi> Nor have any a right to be called the Friends of God and religion, who do not <hi>love the place where he recordeth his name,</hi> and <hi>where his honor dwelleth;</hi> the place where he <hi>commandeth the bleſſing, even life forevermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WERE it only for example-ſake, the more knowing part of Chriſtians ought certainly to countenance and encourage the publick religious exerciſes of the Lord's Day, by attending upon them. Otherwiſe they will naturally come to be diſregarded by that part of mankind who moſt need ſuch helps and aſſiſtances: I mean the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> people. And thus, <hi>thro' the knowledge</hi> of ſome, whether real or imaginary, <hi>the weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007488_0021_102B8FA4F81865B8"/>
               <hi>may periſh, for whom Christ died.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall come to be generally ſuppoſed, that the religious exerciſes here intended, are deſigned only for the benefit of the vulgar and illiterate; and when they ſhall accordingly be neglected by perſons of knowledge and capacity, it will ſoon be looked upon as diſreputable for <hi>any</hi> to attend upon them, as being a tacit confeſſion of their ignorance. And ſo every one, will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a ſort of obligation to abſent himſelf from the publick worſhip of his Maker, and from the place where his word is read and preached; in order to prove to the world that he is a man of <hi>wiſdom.</hi> And indeed there are many amongſt us who give no other evidence beſides this, of their ſuperiority to the bulk of mankind; tho' I cannot at preſent think it a concluſive argument.</p>
            <p>BUT to draw towards a concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: It is manifeſtly the duty of all Chriſtians in common to hear the word; particularly, to hear it in the public <hi>aſſembly of the Saints,</hi> upon the ſtated times for ſuch religious exerciſes. It is the duty of the young and old, wiſe and ſimple, male and female, bond and free, to come and <hi>ſit before God as his People ſitteth,</hi> (to uſe the language of Scripture); and conſtantly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the appointed means of inſtruction and edification. The goſpel injoins this upon all, without making any exception. The far greater part of Chriſtians are not paſt being taught and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007488_0022_102B8FA762BF5ED8"/>
inſtructed in this way: Some may have their pure, and others, their impure minds, ſtirred up: Some may be inlightned in their duty: Others may have known duties inculcated upon them to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and ALL may be furthered in the way that leads to eternal life, provided they hear the word with a ſuitable temper of mind. It is no ſufficient excuſe for neglecting the publick worſhip, that the Perſon who <hi>officiates,</hi> is not one of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed capacity and great learning; or that he is not even <hi>as one that has a pleaſant voice, and can play well upon an inſtrument.</hi> It is better to hear the great doctrines, duties and promiſes of the goſpel, from the mouth of a plain, illiterate man, than not to hear them at all: And the ſoul may be caught up to Heaven, altho' not wafted thither by muſic and harmonious founds.</p>
            <p>To conclude, therefore, let me beſeech all thoſe who claim the worthy and ſacred name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (for with others I am not now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) to be <hi>at leaſt</hi> hearers of the word. There are no excuſes for neglecting this, caſes of <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> being excepted, which will not ſhow either the ignorance, or the pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of thoſe who make them. And it a man is not ſo much as a <hi>hearer,</hi> we have ſurely no reaſon to think that he is a <hi>doer</hi> of the word, or will be bleſſed in his deed. Chriſtians ought doubtleſs to be left at liberty where, and with whom they will aſſemble for the purpoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007488_0023_102B8FA8ED0A2AA8"/>
And ſhould exerciſe their reaſon, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſcience in making the choice. But they are abſolutely inexcuſable if they do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the publick worſhip ſome where or other; even tho' there may be no ſect, church or deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Chriſtians, with which they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely fall in. It is one of the chief honours of the preſent age, that the principles of religion, particularly of religious liberty, are better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and more generally eſpouſed, than they have, perhaps been, ſince the days of the apoſtles. It were to be wiſhed, that practical Chriſtianity had made progreſs in the ſame proportion. But it cannot be denied, that many, together with ſome vulgar errors and ſuperſtitions, have in a manner thrown off even the <hi>form of godlineſs;</hi> laying no ſtreſs at all upon thoſe outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and inſtitutions, upon which too great a ſtreſs has doubtleſs been laid heretofore. This ſeems to be the caſe not only in other countries; but in our own. We are manifeſtly running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an extreme; at leaſt many amongſt us are, under a notion of a more rational religion; an extreme which, it is to be feared, may in time, leave ſcarce the outward ſhew and appearance of Chriſtianity amongſt us. Let not us, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, do any thing which may have a natural tendency to bring our holy religion into diſrepute. Remembring that we are <hi>not without law to God, but under the law to Christ;</hi> let us pay a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007488_0024_102B8FAA76C7D1A8"/>
due and ſacred regard to all his commands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; particularly that, reſpecting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, and hearing the word. In the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Apoſtle, with whoſe words I ſhall cloſe this diſcourſe, <q>Let us hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promiſed) and let us conſider one another, to provoke to love and to good works; <hi>not forſaking the aſſembling of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tegether, as the manner of ſome is;</hi> but exhorting one another; and ſo much the more, as we ſee the day approaching.</q>

            <p>THE duty of hearing the word, having been briefly ſhown in the foregoing diſcourſe; we are now to conſider with what temper it ought to be attended upon, and received. "Receive with <hi>meekneſs</hi> the ingrafted word, ſays the apoſtle, which is able to ſave your ſouls."

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007488_0026_102B8FAEA933CA60"/>
that <hi>pride, captiouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>wrangling</hi> diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are but too commonly found amongſt the profeſſors of Chriſtianity. However, I ſhall take the liberty to conſider the words in a greater latitude, as deſigned to injoin upon us all that care and reverence, that candor and love of truth, that ſimplicity and docility of mind, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſinful creatures, when the Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them; and which are ſutable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deſign of this diſpenſation of the Grace of God to the World. And the admonition may accordingly compriſe in it the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <p>THAT we hear the word with <hi>care</hi> and <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in oppoſition to ſloth, liſtleſneſs, and a lazy indifference:</p>
            <p>WITH <hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>due decorum,</hi> in oppoſition to indecent levity, and rudeneſs:</p>
            <p>WITH <hi>humility,</hi> and a <hi>teachable temper,</hi> in oppoſition to a ſpirit of pride, carping and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:</p>
            <p>WITH due <hi>caution,</hi> (when it is preached by fallible men) in oppoſition to a falſe humility, which diſpoſes many people to ſwallow down whatever they hear from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> tho' often very contrary to the doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:007488_0027_102B8FB0336CD738"/>
WITH <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>affectionate regard</hi> to the truth, altho' nothing <hi>new</hi> ſhould be ſaid upon the ſubject treated, in oppoſition to that vain curioſity and love of novelty, which we ſee in thoſe that have <hi>itching Ears:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH <hi>candour</hi> and <hi>impartiality,</hi> in oppoſition to all perſonal prejudice, and to the ſpirit of party:</p>
            <p>WITH <hi>ſelf-application,</hi> in oppoſition to that common humour of applying what is ſaid to the caſe of our neighbours:</p>
            <p>AND laſtly, With a ſingle view, and an hearty deſire, to receive chriſtian edification; and to obtain that which is the great end of the Goſpel-revelation, and of our Faith in it, <hi>even the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET me inlarge a little upon the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars hinted at above.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſhould hear the word with <hi>care</hi> and <hi>attention,</hi> in oppoſition to ſloth, liſtleſneſs, and a lazy indifference. Chriſtians ought not, at any time, to be <hi>ſlothful in buſineſs,</hi> but ever <hi>fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> But there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar impropriety in withdrawing our attention, and indulging to ſloth, when we are aſſembled to worſhip God, and to hear his word. The
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007488_0028_102B8FB1C08CF9D8"/>
coldneſs and careleſneſs, with which many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſit under the diſpenſation of this heavenly doctrine, is very ſurpriſing, and hardly to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. The Goſpel is not only the word of Him that ſpeaketh from heaven; but it is that wherein we are all particularly intereſted, and far more ſo than we are in any thing beſides. This is that Goſpel which contains the overtures of peace and reconciliation, which God is making to his ſinful Creatures; wherein "Life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality are brought to light"; which contains all the ſolid grounds of our hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of future bliſs; and which we ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to look upon as <hi>good news from a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> "a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation". With what raiſed attention? with what holy reverence? with what humble grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, does it then become us to hear and receive this ingrafted word, which is able to ſave our ſouls; and which is ſpoken to us ſolely for that end? But alas! were a trifling, unconcerning ſtory told us, from a remote part of the world, by ſome romantic traveller, many perſons would be at leaſt as attentive to it, and ſome much more ſo, than they are in our religious aſſemblies, to thoſe glad tidings which Chriſt, the true and faithful witneſs, has brought from Heaven to Earth. Altho' God, who "at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake to the fathers by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007488_0029_102B8FB39A0E5960"/>
the world by his Son"; yet many to whom this goſpel of the Kingdom is preached, and who profeſs to believe it, pay far leſs regard to it, than they would to an account of the <hi>Mogul-Empire;</hi> of the wars of <hi>Kouli Kan;</hi> and of many other things, if poſſible, both leſs intereſting to them, and leſs conſiderable in their own nature. They could not doze and ſlumber more, while the moſt idle, the moſt unintereſting tales were tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than they do, when the Goſpel of their Salvation is read or preached to them. Good God! what impiety? what infatuation is this? Is this to pay a due regard to thy overtures of peace and happineſs to rebellious mortals! Is this to give proper heed to the Revelation which thou haſt made of thy ſelf by thy Son! Is this to hear, and to receive with meekneſs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted word! Is it not rather to ſtop the ear againſt the voice of divine love and compaſſion! Is it not rather to throw manifeſt open contempt upon thy word, than to pay any honor to it!</p>
            <p>SOME of thoſe perſons whom I here intend, are ſo far from hearing the word with a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attention, that they do not hear it all; but deſignedly compoſe themſelves to reſt in the place of public worſhip, as tho' they <hi>had not houſes to ſleep in;</hi> or rather, as tho' they were determined to ſhow how much they <hi>deſpiſe the Church of God,</hi> and at once to caſt contempt both upon God and Man. For this is done by thoſe who
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007488_0030_102B8FB5D98A1DD0"/>
ſit in the ſeat of the <hi>ſleepers,</hi> as well as thoſe who ſit in that of the <hi>ſcorners.</hi> And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that few would be thus paſt <hi>hearing,</hi> were they not firſt <hi>paſt feeling, having their conſciences ſeared as with an hot iron.</hi> In ſhort, the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cuſtom of which I am now ſpeaking, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually an affront to God and man; an equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all piety, and good manners: Nor will any allow themſelves in it, who have not both a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> and a <hi>brazen front.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. CHRISTIANS ought to hear the word with <hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>due decorum,</hi> in oppoſition not only to a dull indifference and oſcitancy; but alſo in oppoſition to that indecent levity and rudeneſs, which we ſometimes ſee in our religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. The tidings which the Goſpel brings are too intereſting to be heard with coldneſs and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs; too ſerious, ſolemn and ſacred, to be heard with unholy mirth, and wanton gaiety. The important nature and ſubject of this meſſage from God to man, evidently demand a devout and reverential, as well as a diligent and fixed attention in the hearer. However ſome ſeem to indulge themſelves as much in unſeaſonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly levity of mind, as others do in an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious lumpiſhneſs, and a certain lifeleſs, ſpiritleſs gravity. Nor is the former of theſe, any more than the latter, a ſutable frame and temper with which to receive the ingrafted word. To hear it
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007488_0031_102B8FB7C1189FD8"/>
with merriment and laughter, is not ſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that <hi>meek</hi> receiving it, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined upon us. "To every thing there is a ſeaſon and a time to every purpoſe under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—a time to <hi>weep</hi> as well as a time to laugh." Let thoſe who are diſpoſed to be gay and jovial, be ſo in due time and place, and none but ſome gloomy, moroſe devotioniſts, or the hypocritical pretenders to extraordinary ſanctity, will blame them for it. But this, however innocent upon ſome occaſions, is very unbecoming, and even criminal, when we are aſſembled for the exerciſes of religion, and to <q>hear what God the Lord will ſay unto us,</q> reſpecting things of the greateſt importance. When we receive His meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Goſpel, the end of which is the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſouls, we ſhould not only abſtain from all external lightneſs of behaviour, from all thoſe mirthful airs, which might be harmleſs at other times; but alſo baniſh every idle thought, every vain imagination, that would intrude itſelf upon us ſo unſeaſonably. We ſhould abſtract our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as much as poſſible, from all terreſtial things in general; and compoſe ourſelves to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and holy reverence. It is only ſuch a grave, ſerious temper and deportment, that is ſuitable to the majeſty of that Preſence in which we are; and to the nature of that meſſage which is delivered to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007488_0032_102B8FB9A0FABBD8"/>
ONE would be almoſt ready to ſuſpect, from the countenance and air of many perſons in our religious aſſemblies, that they were aſhamed to have the leaſt appearance of a ſerious, devout mind, leſt they ſhould be looked upon either as ſuperſtitious, or hypocritical. But ſurely, if there is any ſuch thing as religion, there is a medium betwixt a ſuperſtitious, ſullen, or affected gravity at the public worſhip, and that tho'tleſs levity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ehaviour, which is here intended. There is a certain ſeriouſneſs of mind, and compoſedneſs of ſoul, which correſponds to the nature and deſign of religion; and which almoſt unavoidably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers itſelf wherever it is, even in the features of the face, and in a perſon's whole air and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. And altho' an affected hypocritical gravity is juſtly odious to God and man; yet to be really grave, and in earneſt in religion, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendable; nor is it proper, or reaſonable, to avoid the appearance of this; or to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which is the natural indication of ſuch a temper and frame of heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE ought to hear the word with a <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, teachable</hi> temper, in oppoſition to a ſpirit of pride, carping, and contradiction. And this, as has been already obſerved, is that which the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle more directly intends by receiving the word with <hi>meekneſs.</hi> Whenever we go to the place of worſhip, to hear the Goſpel read or
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007488_0033_102B8FBB295BB908"/>
preached, it ſhould be with a mind diſpoſed to receive inſtruction, and an ear open to diſcipline. The oracles of God in general, as well as the writings of <hi>Solomon</hi> in particular, were deſigned <q>to make us know wiſdom, to perceive the words of underſtanding, to receive the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wiſdom, juſtice, judgment and equity; to give ſubtlety to the ſimple, to the young man knowledge and diſcretion.</q> And with this view, with a humble, meek and teachable temper, we ought always to hear the word of God: not that we may obſerve ſomething to criticize upon, and cavil at; not that we may indulge our vanity, with the ſecret thought how much wiſer we are than the <hi>poor Parſon,</hi> as he goes along. However many that are far leſs wiſe than <hi>David</hi> do not ſcruple to adopt his Words—<q>I have more underſtanding than all my teachers: I underſtand more than the Ancients.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a temper of mind, which utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits perſons for receiving any benefit from the preached and ingrafted word: And were it heard forever, with no better, and more tractable a diſpoſition, it would not be the means of ſaving a ſingle ſoul. How contrary is ſuch a vain, proud and captious humour, to that meekneſs with which we are injoined to receive the ingrafted word? How inconſiſtent is ſuch a ſpirit, with that ſimplicity, and humble deſire of improvement,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007488_0034_102B8FBD90661AD8"/>
which <hi>St. Peter</hi> recommends in his <hi>firſt</hi> Epiſtle? <q>The word of the Lord, ſays he, endureth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and this is the word, which by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is preached to you. Wherefore laying aſide all malice, and all guile and hypocriſies, and envies, and evil ſpeakings, as new-born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thereby.</q> How contrary is this temper, to that which our Saviour repreſents as neceſſary to a due hearing of the Goſpel, ſo as to receive benefit therefrom? <q>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, ſhall by no means enter into it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LET none of us give way to a proud, cavilling, and wrangling ſpirit, when we aſſemble to hear the word; but keep our <hi>heart</hi> as well as our <hi>foot, with all diligence, when we go to the houſe of God.</hi> The meaneſt perſon may ſay ſomething which may be to our <hi>edification:</hi> Nor ſhould we be above receiving <hi>that</hi> from any one, even from the meaneſt. No one ſurely will think himſelf above this, who ſincerely deſires the ſalvation of his Soul. Nor are thoſe who hear the word with the oppoſite temper of vanity and haughtineſs, really the better, but rather the worſe for it; and ſo much the farther from the kingdom of heaven. And it is obſervable, that this ſcornful, diſdainful, ſelf-flattering humour, is generally found in thoſe, who have very little right to claim any ſuch ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007488_0035_102B8FBF8ADC8480"/>
over others—Receive with <hi>meekneſs,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ingrafted word, wherever, and from whomſoever, you hear it: Be willing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and admoniſhed of your duty, by any one; and more particularly by thoſe whoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial office it is to preach the word; <q>leſt (to uſe the words of the wiſeſt of Men; leſt) thou mourn at the laſt; and ſay, How have I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof! And have not obeyed the voice of my teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; nor inclined mine ear to them that inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me! I was almoſt in all evil in the midſt of the congregation and aſſembly!</q>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, do not imagine, my Brethren, that we are for <hi>lording it over God's heritage;</hi> and would put out <hi>your eyes,</hi> that you may ſee with <hi>ours;</hi> or rather follow us blindfold. No: it were extravagant pride and inſolence in us, to deſire this, and falſe humility in you to comply with ſuch a deſire. But this brings me to the next particular mentioned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHEN we hear the Goſpel preached by fallible men, we ſhould do it with due <hi>caution,</hi> in oppoſition to that exceſſive meekneſs, or rather ſtuped tameneſs, and unmanly ſervility, which diſpoſes people to ſwallow down every thing which they hear from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> right or wrong. There is a wide difference betwixt that vain, carping and contradictious humour, which I have
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007488_0036_102B8FC1727F98D8"/>
been ſpeaking of above, and the too eaſy creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here intended; betwixt the ſpirit of cavilling, and pertly finding fault with almoſt every thing, and the dulneſs of implicit believing. It is the rational and chriſtian part, to ſteer betwixt theſe extremes. Nor is it impracticable to keep the middle way in this caſe; to be neither too vain and oppoſite on one hand, nor too credulous and ſubmiſſive on the other.</p>
            <p>As we are Chriſtians, the inſpired ſcriptures are our rule of faith and conduct. Them we ſhould ever read and hear with an implicit faith; ſubmitting ourſelves wholly to their guidance and direction, after having exerciſed our beſt reaſon in finding out their true ſenſe and meaning. There is not, upon our own principles, any room left for objecting, or doubting, when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that theſe ſacred oracles deliver ſuch or ſuch a doctrine; or require us to do ſuch or ſuch a thing. Becauſe <q>it is impoſſible for God to lie;</q> to teach us falſhood for truth; or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join upon us the performance of any thing which ought not to be done. But too many teachers, excluſively of thoſe in the well-known church, which gives herſelf the courteous title of <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> have approached very near to the ſame inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and arrogance; putting themſelves almoſt, if not altogether, upon the ſame footing with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Yea, I wiſh they had not in effect aſſumed to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007488_0037_102B8FC415D5CC48"/>
themſelves an higher ſeat, and greater authority, than they allow to <hi>Moſes</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as tho' the ſervant were above his Lord, and the ſervant greater than his Maſter. For why elſe, in the name of God! do they diſparage the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by repreſenting them as an inſufficient rule of faith, and teſt of orthodoxy? Why do they practically deny them to be the only ſtandard and touchſtone of Chriſtian verity, by cramming us with their <hi>Creeds,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>trumpery?</hi> Why is all this lumber of Confeſſions and Formularies, laid upon us? a load which we are not <hi>able to bear;</hi> and, which ſome others would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been, had they not been originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for <hi>creatures of burthen?</hi> Why elſe are we told by many, that beſides believing the oracles of God, we muſt, before we can be orthodox, believe <hi>their</hi> oracles? oracles as uncertain as the old <hi>Delphian;</hi> or any others which the <hi>Pagan Fathers</hi> conſulted with gaping ſtupidity, and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh amazement? Why elſe, do many of our <hi>Pulpit-Performers</hi> demand at leaſt as great a def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be paid to their harrangues and dogma's, as to the ſacred writings, given confeſſedly by inſpiration of God? In fine, why elſe do they not preach Chriſt Jeſus the <hi>Lord,</hi> and themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſervants</hi> for Jeſus' ſake?—But however aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the clergy may be; yet ſurely thoſe who hear them ſhould not be ſo exceſſively tame and ſervile, as to receive what they advance,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007488_0038_102B8FC61B61C7E8"/>
without letting it paſs thro' their underſtandings; without ſeeing it to be conformable either to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ſcripture, or to both. Poſſibly the word ingrafted by them, may not be word of God, which is able to ſave the ſoul; but merely the word of man, and contrary to ſound doctrine; and ſo have a greater tendency to poiſon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, to miſlead and deſtroy, the ſoul, than to heal and ſave it.</p>
            <p>NOR is this an incredible ſuppoſition, when we reflect what abſurd, what inhuman, what blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous notions, have, from age to age, been ventilated for the great truths, and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant doctrines of the Goſpel, by the miniſters of it: Notions, to which we may apply what our Saviour ſays of falſe teachers, that they are "wolves in ſheep's cloathing;" Notions which worry and perplex the flock of Chriſt; notions which lead men to deſtroy the bodies and lives of their neighbours; but have no tendency to benefit their ſouls; notions which under the fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of exalting the grace, and promoting the honor of God, are really ſubverſive of both. In ſhort, ſince there is too much reaſon to think, that ſome lye in wait to deceive, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſlead others, for the ſake of carrying on their own worldly and ambitious deſigns; and ſince the wiſeſt and moſt upright men, are yet fallible, Chriſtians ought to be cautious and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in their hearing, and not blindly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their ſpiritual guides in any thing</p>

AND the caution which I am now recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with that <hi>meekneſs,</hi> with which we ought to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted word, that it is neceſſarily included in it. From a regard and reverence to the word of God, we are obliged to take heed what we hear and receive from men; leſt we ſhould be led aſtray, either by thoſe who may have an intereſt in deceiving us; or by thoſe who, thro' common human frailty, may run into error themſelves, and endeavour to lead others after them. The very ſame humility and meekneſs with which, we ought to receive the truths of God's word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to be upon our guard againſt the errors and deluſions of deſigning or miſtaken men; leſt, with them, we ſhould <hi>corrupt the word,</hi> by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it what is foreign and heterogeneous and contrary thereto: By which means we may come at length to have another Goſpel, ſo very different from the old, that we cannot apply to it the words of the apoſtle, that <hi>it is not another;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſyſtem of religion, in the general frame, contexture, and tendency of it, eſſentially and fundamentally different from that promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the world by Chriſt and his apoſtles. And is there not now evidently in the world, another Goſpel, in this ſenſe? a Religion, which, tho' it bears the name of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> does not in reality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble true primitive Chriſtianity, ſo much as it does ancient <hi>Paganiſm!</hi> From whence ſprang

theſe amazing corruptions, but from incautious credulity, and blind ſubmiſſion to the clergy?</p>
            <p>BUT to conclude this head: If we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word with due meekneſs; and with that reverence to the <hi>author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> which becomes Chriſtians; we are always to make a wide difference betwixt the ſcriptures of truth, and the doctrines and explanations of falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men. That which God has really revealed, cannot miſlead us; the words of men may. In reverence to the former, we ought to exerciſe caution with regard to the latter; and with the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> to <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures daily,</hi> whether thoſe things which are preached to us are conformable to them, or not. And though any man ſhould preach to us another doctrine, we ought to reject it with diſdain; and this, for the ſame reaſon that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word and meſſage of God with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reverence. Yea, <q>if an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould preach unto us another Goſpel,</q> not I, but the Apoſtle ſays, "let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed." Turn not aſide upon one hand, to <hi>vain jangling,</hi> and <hi>oppoſition of ſcience falſely ſo called;</hi> turn not aſide, upon the other hand, to ſlaviſh ſubmiſſion, and papal ſtupidity. Be men; be Chriſtians; be proteſtants. Uſe the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which God has given you, in ſeeking his will. Reverence the Revelation which he has favoured you with: Exerciſe your reaſon, and

the liberty you enjoy, in learning the truth, and your Duty from it. Make uſe of all proper helps in order to gain a right underſtanding of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; but ſubmit yourſelves blindly to none; leſt they ſhould "teach for doctrines the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men."

                     <q>ALL Chriſtians, (ſays he,) agree that we muſt be Believers: But ſome, taking Advantage of this, will not allow us to have a right Faith, or to be Orthodox Chriſtians, unleſs we come up to all thoſe Notions and Propoſitions which they eſteem Articles of Faith.

5. To hear the Word with <hi>meekneſs,</hi> may moreover comprehend the hearing it with patience, and an affectionate regard, altho' nothing <hi>new</hi> ſhould be offered upon the ſubject treated of; in contradiſtinction to that vain curioſity, and idle love of <hi>novelty,</hi> which is to be found in perſons who have <hi>itching ears.</hi> The deſign of Chriſtianity is not ſo much to pleaſe our fancies, and to gratify our curioſity, as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our minds and ſave our ſouls: Tho' there is

a great deal therein, which may contribute to the former, as well as every thing needful to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The things of which the Goſpel treats, are things <hi>which Angels deſire to look into:</hi> Nor is one deſire gratified, till new ones ariſe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place and ſcope given, in this diſpenſation of the grace of God, for alternate inquiry, and pleaſing admiration, 'till time ſhall be no more. And if we are deſirous to hear ſomething <hi>new,</hi> for our improvement as reaſonable creatures; if we are deſirous hereof, for our edification as Chriſtians, if we want that this glorious light ſhould beam upon us with a fuller ray; if we are deſirous to know more of the perfections of the great Father of our ſpirits; if to underſtand more of the myſtery of our redemption; if we want to be taught more perfectly the way that leads to eternal life, that we may walk therein without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Such a love of <hi>novelty,</hi> ſuch a kind of curioſity, ought certainly to be promoted and countenanced, rather than diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged; For a man that is truly wiſe, never thinks he is wiſe enough; and one truly good, is always ſenſible that he ought to be better.</p>

BUT if, on the other hand, you want to hear things that are <hi>new,</hi> merely for the ſake of <hi>novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> if your deſire to know more of God, does not ariſe from a deſire to love him better, and ſerve him more acceptably; if your deſire to know more of your <hi>Redeemer,</hi> is not accompanied with a deſire to live more to <hi>Him,</hi> who has died for you; if you want to be more acquainted with Chriſtianity, conſidered only as a ſcience, or the ſubject of ſpeculation, not as it is a <hi>doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godlineſs;</hi> in fine, if you want only to have your fancies pleaſed, and not the ſalvation of your ſouls promoted; this ſurely is a curioſity that is unworthy a Chriſtian. And the hearing of <hi>Novels</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> would turn as much to the account of perſons of this vain, trifling humour, as all the Sermons that have been, and ſhall be preached, from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the fall of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> I mean, unleſs ſuch people ſhould happen to be convinced by them, of the folly and abſurdity of hearing merely with this view; and be brought to reflect more ſeriouſly upon <hi>the things which belong to their peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are ſome perſons mightily diſguſted, if they hear a diſcourſe preached a <hi>ſecond</hi> time; tho' perhaps years after the <hi>firſt;</hi> and which was ſo wholly out of their minds, that they would not have known it to be the ſame, but for one or two ſentences, or ſome one particular word or phraſe. Now from what does this diſguſt ariſe?
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007488_0045_102B8FD6483D7F40"/>
From a ſincere deſire to be edified, as Chriſtians? or only from an affection for <hi>new</hi> things? from trifling curioſity? Is this an indication, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hear the word with a proper temper? Or does it betray an unbecoming levity and capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of humour? Or does it proceed from a jealouſy that the Preacher does not labour and toil enough for his reward? from a fear that he will not <hi>ſpend and be ſpent</hi> ſoon enough? I am pretty ſure it does not uſually proceed from any thing that is good and laudable, and which ſuch perſons would not be aſhamed honeſtly to confeſs.</p>
            <p>OUR Saviour's diſcourſes often bore a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear reſemblance one to the other. The Apoſtles did not always preach new doctrines; nor yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the old in different language. Yea, they profeſſedly deliver the <hi>ſame things</hi> over again; altho' the perſons to whom they wrote and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <hi>already knew them, and were eſtabliſhed in theſe truths.</hi> And in fine, when our Lord was inſtructing his Apoſtles in their miniſterial office, he tells them, that <q>every ſcribe which is inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man which is an houſholder, which bringeth out of his treaſure things <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>CAN it then be looked upon as blame-worthy, in thoſe who <hi>labour in the word and doctrine,</hi> that they do not always bring forth things that are <hi>new?</hi> The doctrines of the goſpel are, in a ſenſe, always new to thoſe who have a proper

reliſh for the heavenly <hi>Manna.</hi> Does the ſame food which we have often ſatisfied ourſelves upon heretofore, diſguſt us when we are hungry? Do we loath the wine when we are thirſty, becauſe we have often ſeen it <hi>giving its colour in the glaſs, and moving itſelf aright?</hi> You may perhaps think theſe ſimilitudes too groſs. However there is a real and true analogy, betwixt the cravings of the ſoul, and thoſe of the body: The ſincere Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, far from nauſeating the moſt familiar doctrines of the Goſpel, how often ſoever he has heard them, eſteems them as his neceſſary and daily food, without which, his ſoul would lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, pine away, and be in a manner famiſhed. It is his <hi>meat</hi> and his <hi>drink</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> as well as to <hi>do the will of his Father which is in heaven:</hi> Nor is the repetition thereof <hi>in his ear,</hi> more irkſome to him, than the continued practice of it <hi>in his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF ſo be then, we know the grace of God in truth; if we have taſted and ſeen that the Lord is gracious; if we truly hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; theſe old doctrines and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will be ever new and grateful to us. The fruit of that tree of ſacred, <hi>unforbidden</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which God has planted upon earth, will be always ſweet to our taſte; yea, <hi>ſweeter than honey and the honey-comb.</hi> The Goſpel in its greateſt ſimplicity, unadorned with the bloſſoms and flowers of rhetorick, is like the <hi>tree of life,</hi>

endeavoured to propagate amongſt their converts. And this illiberal, pernicious and antichriſtian ſpirit of party has deſcended from age to age, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all the pains which wiſe and good men have uſed to ſuppreſs it. Nor would you believe me, if I ſaid there was not a great deal of it to be ſeen amongſt us at this Day. A perſon under the influence and dominion of this ſpirit, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hear the truth as he ought to do.

inſtead of aſking their own hearts, how far they are chargeable therewith, they immediately fix upon one and other as the perſons to whom this belongs; tho' perhaps they are far more guilty themſelves. Strange abſurdity! that people will ſo readily ſee a <hi>mote</hi> in their brother's eye, and yet cannot, or rather will not, perceive the beam that is in their own. <q>Thou hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye; and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt the mote out of thy brother's eye</q>. Before we apply things to our neighbours, we ſhould think of our own Sins, which are perhaps, greater; and <hi>take the portion that falleth to us.</hi> How abſurd is it for him that commits <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> to fix his eye on him that <hi>ſteals?</hi> for him that commits <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> to keep in view him that offends, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in a <hi>leſs atrocious</hi> way? for him that <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God,</hi> to caſt a cenſorious look on him that <hi>regardeth not man?</hi> When we hear the word preached, our buſineſs is at <hi>home,</hi> with our own hearts and conſciences; and we ſhall probably find employment enough <hi>there,</hi> without wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus unſeaſonably abroad. We ſhould behold our own face and moral features, in the intellectual mirrour which is held up before us; in order to ſee our own ſpots and blemiſhes, and to wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtains which deform us. We do not hear the word as we ought to do, unleſs we thus bring it home to our ſelves; and aim at correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007488_0052_102B8FE5505628D0"/>
what we find amiſs in our tempers and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, upon a careful inſpection into our own hearts. The contrary humour of applying what is ſaid, to our neighbours, is owing to pride and ſelf-confidence: It proceeds from a ſpirit of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs, uncharity and arrogance; and ſo is the very reverſe of that meekneſs and humility, with which we ought to receive the ingrafted word. And indeed what good can we expect from hearing, unleſs we make the proper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to our-ſelves, inſtead of hearing only <hi>for others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LASTLY; and to ſum up all in one word: We ſhould hear with a ſingle view to our being edified as Chriſtians; and that we may, at length receive that which is the great end of the goſpel, and of our faith in it, the Salvation of our Souls. Whenever we go to hear, we ſhould ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect with ourſelves what is the grand ſcope and deſign of Chriſtianity, that ſo we may hear with a temper and diſpoſition correſponding thereto. This is the ſum of all that has been ſaid above up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject; the reſult and concluſion of this whole matter. Now we cannot but know, that this goſpel of the kingdom, which is, from time to time, preached to us, is a diſpenſation of the grace of God to a guilty loſt world; a revelation of his mercy to us by his Son, conſidered as ſinful periſhing creatures, juſtly liable to wrath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; a diſcovery of God's kind intentions
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007488_0053_102B8FE82A131A58"/>
towards us in general; and more particularly, of the method which his infinite wiſdom has pitched upon, and ordained, for our reſtoration to his favour, to true wiſdom, holineſs and happineſs; the end of all being the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>THIS is the manifeſt ſcope and aim of the Chriſtian revelation: And while we keep this in view, we can hardly fail of perceiving how, and with what temper this divine meſſage ought to be received. The nature of the thing will ſcarce permit one that attends to it, to be at any loſs in the preſent caſe. While we conſider the Majeſty of that God who is ſpeaking to us in his word, and our own ſinfulneſs and unworthineſs; while we conſider the ſubject matter of this revelation, and the glorious Dignity of that Perſon who, for us men and for our ſalvation, came down from heaven; while we conſider the glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which we are called and invited by the goſpel, and the deſtruction threatned to thoſe who obſtinately <q>reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves;</q> in fine, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that our immortal ſouls are at ſtake, and are either to be ſaved or loſt, according to the reception which we give to this heavenly meſſage; while we conſider theſe things, we cannot but know, that it becomes us to hear it with diligence, and the greateſt care; with ſeriouſneſs and gravity; with all meekneſs and humility; with caution and circumſpection, with affection and love; with
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007488_0054_102B8FEA0C0AF648"/>
candor, fairneſs and impartiality; with a deſire to inform and better our minds; and, in fine, with an earneſt deſire, that the end of it may be anſwered in the ſalvation of our ſouls. This is plainly the manner, this the way, this the temper and diſpoſition, with which we ought to hear and receive the ingrafted word. And if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it thus, it will by God's bleſſing, be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to the end and purpoſe for which it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If not, we ſhall in the language of ſcripture, "receive the grace of God in vain."</p>
            <p>BUT there is ſomething previouſly requiſite in order to our receiving the word in the manner deſcribed, which is, that we renounce all our groſs and ſenſual luſts; thoſe vicious habits which the light of nature condemns; which darken and pervert our underſtanding; and make us diſreliſh the pure truths and doctrines, as well as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the goſpel. We are to "lay apart all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs," before we can receive the ingrafted word in ſuch a manner as is neceſſary to the ſalvation of our ſouls. But of this in the next diſcourſe; concluding the preſent with the words of the apoſtle—<q>They received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved. And for this cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lye; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</q>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007488_0056_102B8FED1CC51108"/>
It is an undoubted truth, that every one that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth aright on the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved, in whatever age, in whatever region of the world, his lot is caſt: <q>But (in the language of the Apoſtle) how ſhall they call on Him, on whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in Him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a preacher?—So then, faith cometh by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and hearing by the word of God.</q> This is that word, that ingrafted word, which is <hi>able to ſave our ſouls;</hi> and which, <hi>laying apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> we ſhould <hi>receive with meekneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE already taken occaſion from this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſcripture, to ſhow the indiſpenſable duty lying upon all Chriſtians in general to be <hi>hearers</hi> of the word.</p>
            <p>I HAVE moreover ſhown, with what <hi>meekneſs</hi> the goſpel ought to be heard and received by all, from a conſideration of the nature and deſign of it; it being the doctrine of our ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; the word brought from heaven to earth, to be <hi>ingrafted</hi> into our hearts, that we might have our <hi>fruit unto holineſs;</hi> and the end, everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>I NOW proceed as was propoſed in the <hi>third</hi> place,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:007488_0057_102B8FEF410B9BD0"/>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> To ſhow the <hi>neceſſity of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning</hi> our groſs and ſenſual luſts, thoſe vices and evil habits which even the light of nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, in order to our receiving the Goſpel with due meekneſs; and in ſuch a manner as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in order to our ſalvation. This is the natural import and connexion of the apoſtles words—<hi>Lay apart all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> AND <hi>receive with meekneſs, &amp;c.</hi> ["All filthineſs."] The word denotes the more ſordid aud brutal vices; particularly thoſe ſins which in the language of ſcripture, go under the name of <hi>uncleanneſs;</hi> and <hi>fleſhly luſts,</hi> which are ſaid to <hi>war againſt the ſoul.</hi> [<q>Superfluity of naughtineſs</q>] The <hi>redundance</hi> and <hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of iniquity; the <hi>groſs, palpable</hi> violations of the law of nature; thoſe <hi>flagrant</hi> and <hi>enormous</hi> ſins, for which we could have <hi>no cloke,</hi> no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, altho' Chriſt had never come, and ſpoken to the world. The renouncing of theſe heinous immoralities, is, I ſuppoſe, what the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by <hi>laying apart all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs.</hi> And this we are admoniſhed to do, in order to our receiving the word with meekneſs; it being impoſſible for men wholly under the dominion of ſenſual luſts, to give that cordial reception to the Goſpel, which is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and which is neceſſary in order to its anſwering the deſign of it, in the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:007488_0058_102B8FF11FB72FB8"/>
BUT according to this interpretation, ſome will perhaps aſk, "whether we do not make the Apoſtle guilty of this abſurdity and inconſiſtency; <hi>namely,</hi> of ſuppoſing, that vicious men muſt be become virtuous and holy, in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the goſpel; whereas this is the very end which the Goſpel aims at? How can we attain to holineſs but by the goſpel? by receiving the word? And yet, according to the above inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, we cannot receive the word, till we are actually become holy? or 'til we have <hi>laid apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> which amounts to the ſame thing? Here is a manifeſt circle".</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, That the Apoſtle, by <hi>laying apart all filthineſs,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be here ſuppoſed to mean any thing more than a <hi>partial</hi> reformation of mind and manners; ſuch a one as does not come up to our idea of evangelical holineſs; but which is, at the ſame time, a ſtep towards it; as it prepares and qualifies a perſon for receiving the word as he ought to do; as it renders him a proper ſubject for the goſpel to work upon. And if we underſtand him thus, it will wholly remove all appearance of inconſiſtency. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we may ſuppoſe a vicious man reformed in ſome conſiderable meaſure: and yet deſtitute of that true principle of piety and holineſs, which it is the deſign of the Goſpel to beget in us. But in order to ſet this matter in as clear a light
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:007488_0059_102B8FF3A59DDE18"/>
as I can, I would premiſe two or three things more particularly, as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE is a real and manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a perſon, who is only free from thoſe groſs pollutions of the world; from that great depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of mind and manners, intended by a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtineſs,</hi> and a thorough Chriſtian; one who is already made meet for, and entitled to eternal life. If it may be ſaid of the former, that he is "not far from the kingdom of God;" the latter is actually in it, and a loyal ſubject of it. If one of them is not intirely under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin; the other is a <hi>ſervant of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> If one is in ſome meaſure delivered from the habits and practice of vice; the other has the poſitive principles and habits of virtue. If one has in part, "put off the old man with his deeds, which is corrupt according to deceitful luſts"; the other has "put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. If one is not wholly ſubjected to the devil, "the ſpirit that worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience"; the other has a divine nature implanted in him, being "renewed in the ſpirit of his mind". In fine, there is plainly a diſtinction to be made, betwixt one who has only ſo much ſenſe of religion and virtue, as to make him abſtain from thoſe heinous immoralities which the light of nature condemns; and one who is,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007488_0060_102B8FF52E17A308"/>
in the ſenſe of ſcripture, a righteous good man, "bringing forth good things out of the good treaſure of his heart."</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Goſpel is the great means which God has appointed for the raiſing of men to that new, ſpiritual and divine life, which conſtitutes the <hi>Chriſtian character.</hi> It is eſpecially in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of grace, that we have the things that "pertain to godlineſs". Hereby, and herein, are given to us "great and precious promiſes, that by them we may be made partakers of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, having [before] eſcaped the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the world thro' luſt."</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT the Goſpel may have this happy effect upon us, it is neceſſary that it ſhould be heartily embraced; that it ſhould be <hi>received in meekneſs.</hi> If it is not received at all, it can have no ſuch influence upon us; nor indeed can it, unleſs it is received with that temper of mind, which our Saviour and the Apoſtles always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to us.</p>
            <p>THESE things being premiſed, whoever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the thing, will eaſily ſee that a perſon who runs to every <hi>exceſs of riot</hi> and debauchery; one who <hi>commits iniquity with greedineſs;</hi> and ſays no reſtraints upon himſelf; that has no <hi>fear of God before his eyes;</hi> nor any awakened ſenſe
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:007488_0061_102B8FF76C26D758"/>
of religion; that ſuch a perſon, I ſay, is not in a <hi>preſent capacity</hi> for receiving the Goſpel, in the manner it is neceſſary it ſhould be received, in order to its being to him "the power of God unto ſalvation". There is a certain preparation, or previous qualification for entertaining this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly doctrine, of which he is deſtitute. Perſons who are all immerſed in ſenſuality and vice; thoſe in whoſe mortal bodies ſin reigns triumphant; and whoſe very "mind and conſcience is defiled," muſt be reformed in <hi>ſome degree,</hi> and brought to more ſober reflection, before they either will, or can in the nature of the thing, give ſuch a meek and cordial reception to the ingrafted word, as is requiſite in order to their being ſaved by it.</p>
            <p>THERE is a ſtrong antipathy in a man who is under the government of pride and ſenſual luſts, to the doctrines and precepts of the Goſpel: So that he cannot in a moment, bring himſelf to a proper temper of mind to receive it, tho' he were deſirous of it. He has that <hi>carnal mind</hi> which is <hi>enmity againſt God;</hi> which is not <hi>ſubject to his laws,</hi> neither indeed <hi>can be:</hi> So that they who are thus <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> are not in an immediate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> by receiving his word with meekneſs; much leſs, by the exerciſe of thoſe virtues and graces which good men are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of. They whoſe great concern it is, "to make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof"; they that do not "hunger and thirſt
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:007488_0062_102B8FF99F588D28"/>
after righteouſneſs"; they that have no concern for the ſalvation of their ſouls; but give full ſcope to their vicious inclinations; theſe perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſuch, cannot, by any means, be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be in a condition for receiving the word; they cannot receive it with that ſeriouſneſs, with that humility and meekneſs, with that love to the truth, with that hearty deſire of improvement, with which it is to be received by all, in order to it's grand deſign being anſwered upon them. No; 'til their conſciences are alarmed; 'til they ſee in ſome meaſure the folly and danger of ſin, 'til they find ſome inclination to turn from it to God, that they may obtain his favour, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, they will not truly <hi>receive</hi> the Goſpel into their hearts; tho' they may hear it with their ears from day to day.</p>
            <p>VICE, when indulged to a great degree, puts a ſtrong, tho' ſometimes an unperceived, unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, byaſs upon the human mind; ſo that ſome perſons who imagine they hear with all due candor, impartiality and meekneſs, are very far from it in reality; hearing with great prejudice, and a ſecret diſguſt, which prevents it's taking root in their hearts, and producing the good fruits of righteouſneſs. Any one that pleaſes, may ſee that this is a ſentiment which runs thro' the ſcriptures, and which often occurs in the new-teſtament more particularly. Thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, that "he that doeth evil, hateth the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:007488_0063_102B8FFB284D0C10"/>
light, and will not come to the light, leſt his deeds which are evil ſhould be reproved". Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he applies to the vicious and hardened <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, the emphatical words of the prophet—"In them, ſays he, is fulfilled the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, <hi>By hearing ye ſhall hear and ſhall not underſtand; and ſeeing, ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive. For this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's heart is waxed groſs; and their ears are dull of hearing; and their eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears; and ſhould underſtand with their heart; and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi>" Conformably hereto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of ſome, to whom the goſpel is <hi>hid;</hi> and tells us <hi>who</hi> they are. "If our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt; in whom the god of this world has blinded the eyes of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel—ſhould ſhine unto them." So in the well-known parable of the ſower, the <hi>good ſeed</hi> is repreſented as taking effect, and producing fruit to purpoſe, only when it fell upon <hi>good ground,</hi> adapted and prepared to receive it; <hi>i. e.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Lord's own explanation, the word ſown takes effect only in thoſe who receive it into an <hi>honeſt and good heart.</hi> There is a degree of integrity, honeſty and uprightneſs, previouſly neceſſary, in order to a cordial and effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the goſpel, according to our Saviour's
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007488_0064_102B8FFD33266410"/>
doctrine. Thoſe who are deſtitute of this, being wholly ſunk into vice and voluptuouſneſs, will not hear to purpoſe. Thoſe who have that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which our Saviour expreſſes by an <hi>honeſt and good heart,</hi> he elſewhere ſtyles <hi>his ſheep;</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to their actually believing in him; and aſſures us that they will <hi>hear his voice and follow him.</hi> And in conformity to this principle, we are to underſtand thoſe words of our Lord, which ſo often occur in his diſcourſes.—"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Let thoſe hear, who have in them the principles of recovery; thoſe who are not ſo loſt to all ſenſe of religion and virtue, as to be paſt it.</p>
            <p>IT is not much to be wondered at, if reſolved hardened tranſgreſſors; if thoſe who commit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with greedineſs, rolling it as a ſweet morſel under their tongue; if thoſe who are given up to all <hi>filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> it is not to be wondered at, if ſuch abandoned ſinners often hear the goſpel of the kingdom, without receiving any conſiderable benefit from it. They are not at preſent, proper matter for it to work upon. Tho' they hear the truth, and the doctrines of ſalvation, they cannot receive it in the love of it, <hi>having pleaſure only in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> They are ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the poiſonous draught, which they have taken. And the word is no ſooner heard perhaps, than it is forgotten, and ſnatched away from them, as it were by ſome evil, malicious ſpirit; ſnatched
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:007488_0065_102B8FFF47425A48"/>
away, like the <hi>ſeed</hi> which fell by the <hi>way ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mind that is carnalized, and depraved to the degree that is here intended, is moreover a very unfit habitation for the Holy Spirit of God; without whoſe bleſſed influences, the ſeed ſown in our hearts, does never take root and bring forth fruit. In the language of the book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> 
               <q>Froward thoughts ſeparate from God—[And] Into a malicious ſoul wiſdom ſhall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is ſubject unto ſin: For the Holy Spirit of diſcipline will flee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; and remove from thoughts that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding; and will not abide when unrighteouſneſs cometh in.</q> That pure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, which we do not love; that Spirit of grace and diſcipline, which we quench and grieve, by the habitual indulgence of our ſenſual appetites, cannot but be unwelcome gueſts to our ſouls, thus debaſed and imbruted. This <q>ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience;</q> throw a thick veil over the human mind; and unite in darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blinding it. They extinguiſh every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ray, 'ere it can pierce the gloom; and put out that candle of the Lord, which was originally lighted up in our hearts to guide us to Him. They deſtroy our natural ſenſe and feeling of moral and religious truths; and eſpecially all the mental faculties, however bright before. They hebetate and blunt all the noble powers of the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:007488_0066_102B900125043A10"/>
ſoul; and render it unſuſceptiable of good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. They deſtroy all reliſh of intellectual and ſpiritual enjoyments; and take away the heart from God; from his word and inſtitutions; and even from thoſe things which the light of nature ſtrongly recommends to the love and practice of all men, who have not thus abuſed and perverted their minds. And when the light that is in us, is thus turned into darkneſs, thro' long, invetrate habits of ſinning againſt the light, "how great is that darkneſs!"</p>
            <p>Is it very ſtrange, if ſuch abandoned ſinners do not receive with <hi>meekneſs</hi> the ingrafted word? Is it to be wondered at, if perſons ſo intirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of fleſhly luſts, and the God of this world; perſons thus loſt to all ſenſe of virtue and religion; ſhould have their minds blinded to ſuch a degree, that the Goſpel is hid from them; not being able to ſhine thro' ſuch a thick, groſs and impure <hi>medium,</hi> into their hearts, "to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt?" No ſurely; if they do not admit, but exclude this heavenly light, it is what might be expected. For it ſeems neceſſary in the nature of the thing, that men ſhould be awakened to ſome ſenſe of religion; that they ſhould be brought to ſober reflection; and deveſt themſelves, in ſome meaſure, of the groſſer habits of ſin and vice, previouſly to the word's being ingrafted into their hearts ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

as to transform them into the divine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and cauſe them to bring forth fruit unto God. The light of reaſon muſt be permitted to ſhine into our hearts, before the light of revelation can be cordially received; the voice of natural conſcience muſt be heard, and liſtened to, before the voice of God in his word will be duly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: We cannot be <hi>chriſtians</hi> in temper and conduct, without being firſt <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> in our lives, without firſt <hi>laying apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> and abſtaining from groſs vice and diſſoluteneſs. This is a neceſſary preparation for, and the firſt ſtep towards, our becoming <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in reality; and being "holy in all manner of converſation and godlineſs."</p>
            <p>IT is not only thoſe which are peculiarly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>ſenſual luſts,</hi> that ſtupify the conſciences of men, and indiſpoſe them for receiving the truth in the love of it. All other kinds of groſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral indulgence, have a ſimilar tendency to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heart callous; and inſenſible to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of evangelical truth and righteouſneſs. All kinds of vice in general, are contrary to that religion, which is <hi>pure and undefiled before God.</hi> So that thoſe who give the reins to any known and heinous ſin; thoſe who <hi>ſell themſelves to do any kind of iniquity,</hi> cannot reliſh <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi> Both the doctrines and duties of Chriſtianity, muſt needs be diſguſtful to their depraved and vitiated taſte: And it is at leaſt
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007488_0068_102B84A61EDDDB00"/>
morally, if not naturally impoſſible, that they ſhould receive the Goſpel into their hearts, 'till ſuch time as they renounce all groſs immoralities; 'till they come to be tho'tful and ſerious; and are heartily deſirous to know "the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their peace."</p>
            <p>No man can ſincerely and cordially embrace the goſpel, while he remains hardened in ſin; and is unconcerned about his ſalvation. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it with meekneſs, preſuppoſes that a perſon's conſcience is awakened; that he is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his ſins; that he is ſorry for them, willing to forſake them, and to become the ſervant of God and righteouſneſs. 'Tis prepoſterouſly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to think that any one can properly receive the ingrafted word; or "believe to the ſaving of his ſoul," before he is brought to ſuch a temper of mind; or while he perſeveres in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, with a ſeared conſcience, having no <hi>fear of God before their Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT will be objected, perhaps, that the profeſſed deſign of Chriſtianity, is to reform a vicious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate world: And if ſo, the moſt corrupt and abandoned men, cannot be ſuppoſed to be got beyond the reach of it; ſince God undoubtedly accommodates all means to the ends propoſed in them. Whereas in what has been ſaid above, the Goſpel is ſuppoſed to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ted and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated only to the ſtate of thoſe who are the <hi>leaſt corrupted</hi> and <hi>depraved;</hi> while thoſe who are the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:007488_0069_102B84A7A710A7F8"/>
               <hi>moſt</hi> abandoned, and who conſequently <hi>moſt need</hi> to be reclaimed from the error of their ways, are not in a capacity of receiving it in ſuch a manner as is neceſſary to that end. If only thoſe who have already put away <hi>all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> can receive the word with <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſo as to be ſaved by it; the Goſpel muſt be quite uſeleſs to a great, if not the greateſt part of mankind; and it is to no purpoſe to preach it to them.</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, that to ſay a man is not in a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> temper and diſpoſition to give that humble and meek reception to the goſpel, which is neceſſary in order to his being ſaved by it at laſt; is quite a different thing from ſaying, that he can receive <hi>no good</hi> at all from it; and that it muſt prove a <hi>uſeleſs, dead letter to him.</hi> Theſe things are very diſtinct; nor does the latter follow from the former, by natural deduction and inference. For altho' ſome perſons, by reaſon of their great wickedneſs, and hardneſs of heart, are not in an immediate and preſent capacity to embrace the Goſpel of Chriſt, with that ſincerity and humility, which is neceſſary before the deſign of it can be fully anſwered upon them; yet by hearing it from time to time, they may, with the ordinary bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and that grace of His, which always accompanies the word preached, be awakened out of their fatal ſlumber; and in the language of ſcripture, <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> ſo as to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:007488_0070_102B84A991F0E540"/>
inquiſitive, <hi>what they ſhall do to be ſaved?</hi> In other words, the goſpel may take hold of their hearts to ſuch a degree, as to convince them of the folly and danger of going on in their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; and make them heartily ſollicitous to <hi>fly from the wrath to come;</hi> and to obtain eternal life. And when perſons are thus ſtopped in their mad career; brought to think upon their ways; and made ſeriouſly inquiſitive about their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then it is, that they have the temper of mind with which the Goſpel ought to be received, tho' they had it not before.</p>
            <p>WHAT I intend, is this, That altho' no man who is groſly vicious and immoral; that is ſecure and unconcerned; that ſins with an <hi>high hand;</hi> boldly tranſgreſſing the laws of God, and violating the law of his mind; that tho' no ſuch perſon, I ſay, is now in a temper of mind for receiving the goſpel as it muſt needs be received, before the full deſign of it can be anſwered upon him; yet he may poſſibly hear it ſo as to bring him to that temper. In which reſpect, the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be beneficial to the worſt of men, as well as to the leſs abandoned: For ſurely it is ſo to all whom it rouzes from their lethargy in ſin, to ſober thoughtfulneſs and reflection; producing ſome reformation in them, tho' at preſent very imperfect. Our Saviour pronounces <hi>bleſſed,</hi> not only thoſe who are already <hi>filled with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but alſo thoſe who <hi>hunger and thirſt</hi> after
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007488_0071_102B84AB189601A0"/>
it; becauſe they are in a hopeful and probable way to be filled. By ſuch, the goſpel will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a manner ſutable to the deſign of it: They are prepared to have it actually <hi>ingrafted</hi> into their hearts; and it is to be hoped, that He <hi>who has</hi> thus, by his word and ſpirit, <hi>begun a good work in them, will perfect it unto the day of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS is the goſpel calculated for the good of all. Thoſe who are not depraved to a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, will of courſe receive it, and be truly good and virtuous by it. And even the more vicious and abandoned part of mankind, may be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and influenced by it to ſuch a degree as ſhall make them deſirous of relinquiſhing their former ſins, and <hi>turning their feet into God's teſtimonies;</hi> that ſo they may obtain the pardon and ſalvation offered to ſinners in it. And thoſe who are brought to this temper of mind, will then of courſe receive the ſpiritual and incorruptable ſeed into their hearts, as into <hi>good ground,</hi> into a ſoil prepared for, and adapted to it. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which they will "bring forth fruit, ſome thirty, ſome ſixty, and ſome an hundred fold."</p>
            <p>BUT alas! it was never ſuppoſed that the goſpel, however <hi>ſufficient,</hi> would prove <hi>effectual</hi> in the event, for the reformation and ſalvation of all thoſe to whom it is preached. Many of thoſe to whom it was preached of old, as it is to us now,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:007488_0072_102B84B678EEEF98"/>
it <hi>did not profit, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> There are ſome in every age, ſo reſolutely ſet and determined in the ways of folly and vice, given over to ſuch <hi>filthineſs,</hi> to ſuch a <hi>ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> that they <hi>will</hi> not give any heed or credit to this divine meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. <q>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world; and many love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs better than light, becauſe their deeds are ſo evil.</q> Our Saviour had occaſion to tell many, to whom he himſelf preached, that they <q>would not come unto him that they might have life.</q> And when he commanded his Apoſtles to <q>go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature;</q> he intimated to them, that they ſhould bear theſe glad tidings <hi>in vain,</hi> and to no purpoſe, as to many. For he then told them what ſhould be the portion of thoſe who <hi>believed not,</hi> as well as of thoſe who believed, and gave heed to their doctrine. The goſpel is publiſhed amongſt all nations, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a preſumption that all who hear it, will meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive it, and be ſaved: But it is preached for a <hi>witneſs,</hi> for a teſtimony to all; and they are all left to regard, or diſregard it, as they think proper; a day being appointed of God, in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs. Some have thoſe ingenuous principles remaining in them, which render them fit ſubjects for the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to operate upon; and theſe being Chriſt's
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007488_0073_102B84B8F3D19C18"/>
               <hi>ſheep,</hi> and <hi>given to him of the</hi> Father, will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hear his voice, and receive his goſpel with <hi>meekneſs;</hi> and he will <hi>give unto them eternal life.</hi> Others being <hi>incurable,</hi> and <hi>paſt recovery;</hi> (I mean in that way and method which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God has fixed upon for the reclaiming and ſaving of ſinners) they will accordingly ſtop their ears againſt this joyful ſound; and cloſe their eyes againſt the heavenly light; they will not heartily embrace the Goſpel; and ſo will at length receive the end of their wickedneſs, and incredulity, as others will <hi>the end of their faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS were the Apoſtles, tho' they preached the goſpel of peace to <hi>all indifferently,</hi> "the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life unto life" only to <hi>ſome;</hi> being to <hi>others,</hi> "the ſavour of death unto death"; And thus it will probably be, from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to the end of the world: Only we have great reaſon to conclude, from the oracles of God, that a glorious ſtate of things will hereafter take place upon earth, and be of <hi>long continuance;</hi> a ſtate, wherein the unrighteous, and unbelieving ſhall bear but a very ſmall and inconſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the true ſervants of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—<hi>Life and death, bleſſing, and curſing, are,</hi> from one age to another, <hi>ſet before</hi> All in general; "and whether they like is given to them". Nor will the perfections of God, be leſs conſpicuous in the perdition of ungodly men, who obey not the truth, but obey
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:007488_0074_102B84BA79763480"/>
unrighteouſneſs; than in the ſalvation of thoſe, who having laid apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, receive with meekneſs the ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word; and bring forth the fruits thereof with patience.</p>
            <p>LET me conclude this diſcourſe, with a few ſhort reflections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS ſubject ſuggeſts to us the wiſdom of applying ourſelves to the concerns of religion, and another world, in youth, before the habits of ſin and vice, are become ſtrong and inveterate. Perſons uſually wax worſe and worſe, 'til ſuch time as they begin to reform and grow better: The farther we proceed in the paths of iniquity, by ſo much more difficult will it be for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; to receive the goſpel of the kingdom into our hearts; and to become Chriſt's true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; his loyal ſubjects. Such is the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that it ſteals upon us unawares, and hardens us by inſenſible degrees; 'til in proceſs of time, it takes a deep and full poſſeſſion of us, ſo that it is as eaſy for "the <hi>AEthiopian</hi> to change <hi>his ſkin,</hi> or the <hi>Leopard his ſpots,</hi>" as for us, thus <hi>accuſtomed to do evil,</hi> to <hi>learn to do well.</hi> So that thoſe who do not in early life, remember their Creator, and receive the Goſpel of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer with <hi>meekneſs;</hi> may come at length to receive it with mockery and deriſion; "crucifying
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:007488_0075_102B84BC9E2EAB58"/>
to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to an open ſhame:" To whom there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin." And thus the goſpel which was <hi>ordained unto life,</hi> proves only <hi>the ſavour of death unto death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET us not conclude that we are true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and intitled to the ſalvation of the goſpel, merely becauſe we are not flagrantly immoral and vicious in our lives. For altho' we may, in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, have <hi>laid apart all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> we may yet fall ſhort of that <hi>holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> The goſpel has not anſwered it's deſign upon us, 'til we have ſo received the <hi>truth</hi> into our hearts, as to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> by it; 'til we are "transformed by the renewing of our minds, and the waſhing of the Holy Ghoſt," into the image of God and of our Saviour. This is the great end propoſed in the goſpel; in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it is to be meekly hearkened to from time to time; it muſt be <hi>ingrafted</hi> into our hearts; and incorporated, if I may ſo expreſs it, with our very ſouls and natures—But I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak more upon this point hereafter, in another diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SUFFER me to warn all who allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any vicious practices, eſpecially in ſuch ſins as the light of their own conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:007488_0076_102B84BE77605888"/>
immediately to renounce them; that ſo they may be in a capacity for duly receiving the doctrines of the goſpel; and may bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſs unto life eternal. Give heed to the divine admonition in my text; and <hi>lay apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> for then, and not 'til then, will you <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with meekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> Do not endeavour, I beſeech you, to ſtifle the convictions of your own minds and conſciences, which may perhaps tell ſome of you, that you are <hi>particularly concerned</hi> in this counſel. If your own hearts condemn you, as habitual tranſgreſſors of God's commandments, remember that "He is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things;" and that He "now commandeth all men every where to repent, for that he hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſs." We are apt to be partial to ourſelves; to make too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble allowances; to make the beſt of every thing, on our own ſide. But if, notwithſtanding this natural propenſity to think and judge favourably of ourſelves, our own hearts ſtill miſgive and condemn us; how much more ſurely will that God condemn us, who is greater than our hearts? Who is no reſpector of perſons? and whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is always according to truth?</p>
            <p>BE aſſured, that while you are knowingly and habitually guilty of any immoral practices, you
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:007488_0077_102B84C00271CF08"/>
are not only out of the kingdom of God, <hi>but far from it;</hi> ſo far that you are not even in a capacity, at preſent, to receive that goſpel, which is deſigned to bring you into it; and to make you the heirs of ſalvation. Let us therefore lay our hands upon our hearts, and aſk ourſelves as in the preſence of God, who will judge us another day, whether we have <hi>laid apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs?</hi> Or whether we live in known, wilful Sin? Is there no kind of profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſſoluteneſs; no kind of falſhood or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; no ſin againſt God, our neighbour or ourſelves, evidently contrary to the light and law of nature, which we indulge ourſelves in? What anſwer do your conſciences make? <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty?</hi> If you are not guilty, it may be rationably concluded, either that you have already <hi>received the ingrafted word</hi> into your hearts, or that you will ſoon do ſo; and gradually "cleanſe yourſelves from all filthineſs of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſpirit; perfecting holineſs</hi> in the fear of God." There is a good foundation laid, when perſons are become ſober and moral in their lives; tho' they may full f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll ſhort of that religion which is <hi>pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled before God and the Father.</hi> But if you ſtill live in <hi>filthineſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſuperfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs;</hi> you come ſhort, not only of the <hi>Chriſtian character,</hi> but even <hi>that</hi> of a ſober, virtuous <hi>Pagan.</hi> Nor is it to be wondered at, if perſons of this flagitious character, who daily ſin againſt
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007488_0078_102B8520E43A1BE0"/>
the light of natural conſcience, ſhould continue inimical in their hearts, to the doctrines of the goſpel; 'til, having filled up the meaſure of their iniquities, they receive the due reward of their deeds. However, the caſe even of ſuch profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſinners, (if there are any ſuch amongſt us) is not quite deſperate; tho' the longer they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in their evil courſes, abuſing the goodneſs and patience of God, which is deſigned to lead them to repentance; the leſs ground there will be to hope for their reformation. <q>Wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, to day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; as in the day of provocation—when your fathers temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me—Wherefore I was grieved with that generation; and ſaid, they do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. So I ſware in my wrath, they ſhall not enter into my reſt. Take heed, brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called, To Day; leſt any of you be <hi>hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>

            <p>IT is unqueſtionably the duty of all Chriſtians to be <hi>hearers</hi> of the word read and preached in the aſſemblies of the ſaints; this being a divine inſtitution: As was ſhown in the <hi>firſt</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>next,</hi> the duty of <hi>receiving</hi> the word with <hi>meekneſs</hi> was more particularly conſidered, and inforced.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:007488_0080_102B9003B3BCDF80"/>
IT was ſhown in the <hi>laſt</hi> diſcourſe, That in order to our receiving the word in a ſutable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo that the deſign of it may be anſwered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, it is neceſſary that we <hi>lay apart all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> or in other words, that we renounce vice and immorality in all its <hi>groſſer forms.</hi> It is not poſſible for thoſe who are regardleſs even of <hi>natural</hi> religion; and who are given over to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs; it is not poſſible for ſuch abandoned ſinners, continuing ſuch, to receive the <hi>revealed</hi> word of God with a proper temper of mind. They are not in a preſent capacity for giving a due reception to the Goſpel of Chriſt. There is ſomewhat previouſly requiſite, or preparatory, thereto; which is, that they relinquiſh their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal luſts, and all groſs immoralities; and are heartily deſirous of being taught the way that leads to eternal life: Then, and not before, are perſons capable of giving that cordial and meek reception to the ingrafted word, which is required in order to the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>THIS is a ſhort view of the ſubject, ſo far as it has been treated already: And the next thing in courſe, according to the method propoſed, is to ſhow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOURTHLY,</hi> The neceſſity of <hi>obeying</hi> the Goſpel, in order to our receiving the ſalvation of it. The apoſtle tells us, that <hi>the ingrafted word is</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:007488_0081_102B900542C25450"/>
               <hi>able to ſave our ſouls:</hi> But immediately ſubjoins, <q>But be ye <hi>doers</hi> of the word, and not <hi>hearers only,</hi> deceiving your own ſelves.</q> q.d. "God having revealed to you the way of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it behoves you carefully to hearken to this revelation, and meekly to receive it. But I warn you againſt ſo fatal an error as this, that barely hearing the Goſpel of the kingdom, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying it, will intitle you to that ſalvation which is revealed to ſinners therein. You will groſly and fatally delude your ſelves, if you expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon any other terms, than thoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming your tempers and manners to the rules of life contained in this revelation, which you hear, and profeſs to receive."</p>
            <p>IT will be apparent to every one who carefully looks into this Epiſtle, that St. <hi>James,</hi> the author of it, deſignedly combates ſome libertine notions of Chriſtianity, which began in thoſe early times, to creep into the church; which notions when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and wherever they prevail, muſt in a great meaſure, fruſtrate the deſign of the Goſpel; which is to make men truly good and virtuous here, in order to their being happy hereafter.</p>
            <p>IT is indeed ſtrange that all men, even upon the moſt ſlight and curſory view of Chriſtianity, as it is delivered to us in the <hi>new teſtament,</hi> ſhould not immediately ſee that it is <hi>a doctrine according to Godlineſs,</hi> not a doctrine of <hi>licentiouſneſs;</hi> that the great aim of it, is to make us fear and love
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:007488_0082_102B9006F7405538"/>
God, and work righteouſneſs; that it promiſes eternal life only to the pure in heart, and holy in all manner of converſation; and that it is ſo far from giving wicked men, continuing ſuch, any hopes of pardon and ſalvation, that it aſſures them of the contrary, in the moſt plain, ſtrong and emphatical terms. It is very ſtrange that every one ſhould not at once ſee that this is the real truth of the caſe; without attempting to evade the matter by any kind of diſtinctions or refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But alas! ſo devoted are ſome men to their luſts, and at the fame ſo loth to renounce all the hopes of a bleſſed immortality, that they will endeavour to make a life of ſin and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, no inſuperable obſtruction or bar, in the way of their ſalvation; ſpeaking peace to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves while they are walking in the paths of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the moſt certain, inevitable ruin. Thus it is that ſome perſons in every age and country, ſince the Goſpel has been promulgated to the world, have been <hi>deceiving their own ſelves;</hi> by imagining, that the being <hi>doers of the word,</hi> was not really neceſſary in order to the obtaining of God's favour, and future bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Now I am to ſhow in general in this diſcourſe, the indiſpenſable neceſſity of obeying the Goſpel in order to our being intitled to the ſalvation of it: leaving ſome of the moſt common miſtakes and errors concerning this important point, to be <hi>more particularly</hi> conſidered and refuted hereafter.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:007488_0083_102B9009D6483558"/>
And that all ſuch notions in general, are vain and deluſory; that the Goſpel muſt be <hi>obeyed,</hi> as well as heard and received; and that no incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible ſinner ſhall inherit the kingdom of God; appears, in the <hi>first</hi> place,</p>
            <p>FROM a general view of Chriſtianity, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>commandments,</hi> given for the regulating of our <hi>conduct,</hi> as well as <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>doctrines,</hi> for the regulating of our <hi>faith.</hi> Whoever looks into the new teſtament, will find <hi>there</hi> a ſyſtem of religion, which conſiſts partly of doctrinal truths to be aſſented to, and partly of commands, preſcribing to us what is to be done; the former being uſually called the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi> the latter, the <hi>Agenda</hi> of religion. It is not more plain and evident, that Chriſtianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains certain principles that are to be believed; principles reſpecting the nature and moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; the perſon and offices of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; a future exiſtence; the reſurrection of the body; a judgment to come; and a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments to ſucceed; (this is not more evident, I ſay) than that the ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion contains a great variety of precepts, injunctions and prohibitions, delivered to us as to creatures that have <hi>a part to act;</hi> precepts reſpecting our behaviour towards God, towards our Redeemer, towards our neighbour; and ſome that more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſpect the government of ourſelves. In other words, it is not leſs certain and obvious,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:007488_0084_102B900B5DDE6490"/>
that the goſpel conſiders us as active moral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whoſe hearts and manners are to be formed and regulated by the laws therein contained; than that it conſiders us as intellectual Creatures, who ought to receive and embrace the truths that are therein revealed to our underſtandings. It being evident then, from the moſt curſory view of Chriſtianity, that it is not only a rule of <hi>faith,</hi> but of <hi>practice</hi> alſo; it is as certain, that we are obliged to <hi>obey</hi> it, conſidered in the latter of theſe reſpects, as that we are bound to <hi>believe</hi> it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the former. No one can ſhow, that we are more ſtrongly obligated to believe what God has revealed, than we are to do what he has required. He is doubtleſs as juſt in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as he is true and faithful in his words and promiſes: Nor can his Authority be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called in queſtion in one caſe, than his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the other. From hence it appears, that we are no leſs bound to be <hi>doers of the word,</hi> than we are to be <hi>hearers</hi> and <hi>believers</hi> of it. All the laws which God has given us, were given that they might be obſerved; not that they might be broken. And indeed if they may be diſregarded with impunity; I ſee not why it is neceſſary, that we ſhould even be believers. For it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that tho' this is one of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>that we believe in him whom he hath ſent;</hi> yet it is not <hi>more truly one of them,</hi> than this, that we <hi>love</hi> Him, and <hi>love</hi> our neighbour.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:007488_0085_102B900D43D40E88"/>
And why that command, by which <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined upon us, may not be diſpenſed with, and ſet aſide as being of no conſequence; as well as ſome other commandments of the Goſpel, no one can aſſign a reaſon. So that if we may be ſaved without <hi>doing the word,</hi> I am bold to aſſert we may be ſaved without <hi>believing</hi> or <hi>receiving</hi> it. God requires the latter no more plainly and peremptorily than he does the other. And as ſoon as any one will ſhow how we may be intitled to ſalvation, without obedience; I will ſhow, at leaſt by ſimilar, if not by the ſame Arguments, how we may be intitled thereto, without believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſyllable of the Chriſtian revelation, with whatever evidence of its truth it may come to us.</p>
            <p>WE may conſider, the matter in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent point of light, which will bring us to the ſame concluſion at laſt.—We are the profeſſed <hi>diſciples</hi> of Chriſt, acknowleding him for our <hi>teacher, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>lord.</hi> We are therefore to conſider what ſort of <hi>teacher</hi> he was; what he undertook to inſtruct men in in; order to know whether we really come up to the character of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or fall ſhort of it. There have been differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of teachers in the world; and ſtill are. Some inſtruct in one art or ſcience, ſome in another. Now our Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, came into the world, as a teacher of true religion. He came to make known to us many divine truths; thoſe things that belong to our peace;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:007488_0086_102B900EDCED4600"/>
and to inſtruct us how to ſerve God in this World, in order to our being happy in his favour in the world to come. Here his teachings and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all terminate, as to the end of them. Now a <hi>diſciple</hi> of any one, is he that learns of him that ſcience, art or buſineſs, of which he is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed teacher. He that does ſo, is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a diſciple; otherwiſe he is only a nominal one. A perſon, in ancient times, would not have been deemed a diſciple of <hi>Socrates,</hi> while he lived after the principles and maxims of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> altho' he frequented the ſchool of the former, and not of the latter. Let him have called himſelf by what name he would, others would reckon him a diſciple either of one or of the other, according to the principles which he embibed, and the maxims of living, which he embraced and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. How then, does <hi>he</hi> come up to the character of Chriſt's diſciple, who does not learn of him, that temper and behaviour, that art of holy and virtuous living, which Chriſt came to teach; and which is indeed the ſame thing with that practical obedience to the word, the neceſſity of which I am now endeavouring to ſhow? Thoſe who live and act according to other rules and maxims, than thoſe of our divine maſter, Jeſus Chriſt, cannot, with truth and propriety, be ſtyled his diſciples and followers, any more than an <hi>Epicurean</hi> Voluptuary could be called a diſciple of <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:007488_0087_102B9010BAAF6C18"/>
INDEED if the whole, or principal deſign of our Saviour, in taking upon himſelf the character and office of a teacher, had been <hi>to give us a Creed;</hi> or to inſtruct us in certain religious notions and principles, without referring them to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; we might, in that caſe, be called his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if we embraced thoſe principles, however flagitious we might be in our lives and manners. But when we reflect, that the leſſon which Chriſt came to teach us, reſpects the regulation of our hearts, tempers and behaviour; that the great aim of all his inſtructions, is to reclaim men from their evil and vicious courſes; and to bring them to a reſemblance of the divine purity, goodneſs and holineſs, in order to their being happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; when we reflect, I ſay, that Chriſt's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and inſtructions all terminate in this point, it is manifeſt that thoſe who call themſelves his diſciples, without departing from iniquity, and living as he has taught them to live, compliment themſelves with a name, which does not belong to them; and have no neaſon to expect any good will finally accrue to them from his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are deſtitute of the main, the moſt eſſential characteriſtic, of Chriſtians; which is a temper and behaviour correſponding to the maxims and precepts of Chriſt's religion; and to that example which he has left us, <hi>that we might follow his ſteps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGREABLY to what is here ſaid, we often find
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:007488_0088_102B901348FCACA8"/>
our Saviour reproving the inconſiſtency and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of thoſe, who, while they acknowledge him for their Lord, do not walk according to his injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. "Why call ye me, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> ſays he, and <hi>do not</hi> the things which I ſay." q. d. "With what propriety, with what modeſty, can you own ſuch a relation to me, as that of diſciples to a maſter and Lord, while you do not demean yourſelves anſwerably thereto? While you give no heed to my words and counſels; but ſet them at naught? Either live according to theſe rules which I teach and preſcribe; or ceaſe to mock me, and to delude yourſelves, by calling me your Lord"</p>
            <p>AT another time, when our Saviour was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf as one divinely authoriſed to draw diſciples and followers after him; and accordingly invited people to <hi>come unto him,</hi> and to <hi>learn of</hi> him; this was not ſo much, that they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in certain ſpeculative truths, as that they might learn the art of governing their tempers, and living well. "Come unto me, ſays he,—take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls." We here ſee, that tho' by coming to Chriſt, is intended receiving him in the character of a divine teacher; yet this is in order to a farther end; which is, ſubmitting to be directed by him in the way to happineſs. There is no <hi>coming,</hi> or <hi>going</hi> to Chriſt, to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:007488_0089_102B9014D2A7BDD8"/>
without <hi>taking his yoke</hi> upon us, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to be <hi>meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole then, Chriſtianity appears to be a practical ſcience; the art of living piouſly and virtuouſly. The drift and ſcope of our great maſter's doctrine and preaching, was to make us abandon our ſins and luſts of every kind; and to form us to a reſemblance of himſelf, who is <hi>the image of the inviſible God.</hi> Thoſe who do not learn of him to be ſincerely good, learn nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and <hi>know nothing as they ought to know it.</hi> We cannot be called his true diſciples and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without putting on that temper and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which his laws and example recommend to us, or rather injoin upon us. And if we are not <hi>really</hi> his diſciples, but are ſo in <hi>name</hi> only, certainly we cannot hope for ſalvation by him. So that conſidering the matter in this light, it is evidently neceſſary that we <hi>obey</hi> the word, as well as hear and believe. And we do but <hi>deceive our own ſelves,</hi> if we expect to be ſaved upon any eaſier terms.</p>
            <p>BUT for the farther confirmation of the point before us, let me produce two or three paſſages of ſcripture, wherein the end of Chriſt's coming into the world, and of the goſpel diſpenſation, is more explicitly declared. Our Saviour tells us, that he came "to call ſinners to repentance." <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſays, that he "gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:007488_0090_102B901747748220"/>
unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works." The ſame apoſtle tells us, that the grace of God has appeared unto us, "teaching us that, denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world." <hi>St. John</hi> tells us, that whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin, is of the Devil; and that "for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil." And we know, that our Lord was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he was to "ſave his people from their ſins." From theſe and ſuch-like paſſages of ſcripture, the neceſſity of departing from iniquity, and of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel, is manifeſt. Surely that cannot be looked upon as unneceſſary, which is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be one great end of our Lord's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation in the fleſh. But how is this declared end of the goſpel, and the grace of God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, anſwered upon us, if we perſevere in our evil ways, inſtead of being led to repentance? If we indulge to ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, inſtead of denying them? If we are zealous of bad works, inſtead of good? If the works of the Devil are practiſed by us, inſtead of being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us? If we remain under the dominion and power of ſin, inſtead of being made free from it, and becoming the ſervants of righteouſneſs? Can any one imagine that the true intent and deſign of Chriſt's goſpel is anſwered upon them, before they "ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well?"
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:007488_0091_102B901976C43F98"/>
Certainly no vicious, unrighteous man, is what the Goſpel is intended to make him: No perſon of this character, has complied with the true and declared deſign of this diſpenſation of the grace of God. And if not, is it not manifeſtly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſuppoſe that ſuch a one, can be intitled to the ſalvation revealed therein? Why may not a vicious <hi>Heathen,</hi> who never heard of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, be intitled to the bleſſings of it, as well as a vicious <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> on whom it has had no effect? and who is as wicked, perhaps, if not more wicked, than he would have been, if this grace had never appeared to him? Will not a profeſſed Chriſtian, who has not really complied with the great deſign of the goſpel, any more than a <hi>Pagan,</hi> be as certainly condemned hereafter, as if he had been a <hi>Pagan</hi> himſelf? It does not appear from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that any good ſhall finally reſult to thoſe who hear the goſpel, but in proportion as they are made really better by it; having fallen in, and concurred with the deſign of God's grace revealed to us therein.</p>
            <p>WE may conſider this matter ſtill in another light; which will farther evince the neceſſity of obeying the word. The Goſpel informs us, that in order to our ſalvation, it is neceſſary that we ſhould be <hi>born again; born of God; born of the ſpirit;</hi> that we <hi>put off the old man with his deeds;</hi> that we <hi>put on the new man;</hi> that we <hi>walk in the ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit;</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:007488_0092_102B901B04D66358"/>
and the like. Now I would aſk, what is the meaning of all theſe phraſes? What is the true import, and real amount of them? Is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, this, that ſinners muſt, by the goſpel, and the co-operation of the ſpirit and grace of God therewith, be turned from ſin to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? that their hearts which were before corrupt, and eſtranged from God, muſt be purified, and turned to him? And that, in conſequence hereof they "walk in all his commandments and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances blameleſs?" This is manifeſtly that <hi>new birth,</hi> or <hi>regeneration; that putting off the old man with his deeds,</hi> and <hi>putting on the new man,</hi> of which the ſcriptures ſpeak: And the thing is in itſelf very plain and intelligible, how great a <hi>myſtery</hi> ſoever, either the ancient or modern <hi>Nichodemus'</hi>s and <hi>maſters in Iſrael,</hi> have made of it. If therefore, it is neceſſary that a man be born again, in order to his ſalvation; and if this is the proper notion of regeneration; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is neceſſary to obey the goſpel, in order to that end. For ſuch a change of heart and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as is denoted by the terms <hi>born again,</hi> and <hi>born of the ſpirit,</hi> implies and involves in it, the obedience here intended.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible, that ſome perſons have invented another ſort of <hi>regeneration,</hi> which leaves the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it much as it found him,—"to every good work r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bate;" and which a man may <hi>experience,</hi> without being really any better than
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:007488_0093_102B901D912D7DD0"/>
he was before; any more like to God; any more obſervant of his laws. Yea, I wiſh there was not reaſon to ſay, that <hi>that</hi> which many have taken to be their <hi>regeneration,</hi> and a being <hi>filled with the ſpirit,</hi> might be more properly called a <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> leaving them much worſe than it found them; leſs careful to "order their converſation aright;" leſs juſt, ſober, humble and charitable, than they were in what they called their carnal, unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, unconverted ſtate. According to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of regeneration, I acknowledge that a perſon may be born again, and yet not become a <hi>doer of the word.</hi> But the ſcriptures know of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, beſides that which conſiſts in a real change of heart and manners, from ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs to holineſs; a regeneration, from which obedience to the laws of Chriſtianity is inſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arable; and with which, habitual ſinning is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconſiſtent. "Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God." So that while we keep to <hi>this idea</hi> of regeneration, to ſay that it is neceſſary we ſhould be born again, is, in effect to ſay neither more nor leſs than this, that it is neceſſary we ſhould become holy in heart and converſation, by God's aſſiſtance and grace; which is the ſame thing, in other words, with being <hi>doers of the word,</hi> or yielding a practical obedience to the goſpel of Chriſt. It is, therefore, to be hoped that none who aſſert
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:007488_0094_102B901F194A5D80"/>
the neceſſity of the former, will call in queſtion the neceſſity of the latter.</p>
            <p>IT may be added here, that the <hi>repentance</hi> of ſinners is always ſuppoſed in the new teſtament, to be an indiſpenſible condition of, and a meet qualification for, their receiving pardon and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. But what is the proper notion or idea of evangelical repentance? of that repentance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which ſinners cannot be ſaved? Is it only a flaſhly, ſuperficial ſorrow for ſin? ſuch a ſorrow and contrition, as is conſiſtent with perſevering therein? Surely no. It involves in it a turning from ſin, to God and righteouſneſs. It is the active principle of a new life; a life of holineſs, and obedience to the divine commandments. The repentance which falls ſhort of this; which leaves the heart unſubdued to God; the repentance which leaves a ſinner as it found him; and is not accompanied with a reformation of mind and manners; is not that <hi>repentance unto life,</hi> which is intended in the goſpel: It is a vain, ineffectual ſorrow; and ſcarce better than that "ſorrow of the world which worketh death." Now if this is the proper notion of repentance; or if repentance implies in it, a forſaking of our paſt ſins, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon a new courſe of life; and if ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is neceſſary in order to ſalvation; then certainly the <hi>hearing</hi> of the word, without <hi>doing</hi> it, cannot intitle us to eternal life. Evangelical repentance is, in ſhort, goſpel-obedience in its <hi>root</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:007488_0095_102B9020F59A1F48"/>
and <hi>principle;</hi> and wherever it is, it will bring forth the <hi>fruits</hi> that are <hi>meet</hi> for it. So that to aſſert the neceſſity of repentance, and yet to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we may be ſaved without obedience and righteouſneſs, is a manifeſt abſurdity and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>BUT let us conſider a little more particularly, to whom it is that the goſpel itſelf promiſes eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; and whether theſe promiſes are not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſtrained and confined to obedient Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; to the <hi>doers</hi> of the word. Now the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tells us, that Chriſt, "being made perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the author of eternal ſalvation to <hi>all them that obey him.</hi>" Is there not here a plain limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſalvation of which Chriſt is the author, to thoſe who do his commandments? Does not the form of expreſſion uſed, manifeſtly imply, that ſuch as do not practically conform to the laws of Chriſt, as well as believe and truſt in him, ſhall not finally ſhare in that redemption which he has wrought out? Again, our Saviour ſays, that the <hi>righteous</hi> "ſhall go away into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;" and that the <hi>righteous</hi> ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father." Is the ſame ever ſaid in ſcripture, of the wicked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient? Or of all men in common without any diſcriminating mark? Again, our Lord likens thoſe who hear his ſayings, and <hi>do them,</hi> to "a wiſe man that built his houſe upon a rock," which would not fall. But does he make uſe of the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:007488_0096_102B902329DF7798"/>
ſame ſimilitude, when he ſpeaks of thoſe who hear his ſayings, and <hi>do them not?</hi> Thus He tells us, that they which "do the will of his Father which is in heaven," ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven hereafter. Is the ſame ever ſaid of thoſe who perſevere in their diſobedience to God's will? So we are told, that "to them who by patient continuing in well-doing, ſeek for glory, honor, and immortality, God will render eternal life." Is the ſame promiſe made, in any part of the Goſpel, to thoſe that perſevere in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil? In ſhort, nothing can be more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, than that the ſcripture-promiſes of ſalvation, are uniformly reſtrained and limited to ſuch as obey the goſpel; to ſuch as having <hi>received the word with meekneſs</hi> "into good and honeſt hearts," bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſs with patience.</p>
            <p>BUT, that no doubt may be left upon the minds of any, with reference to ſo important a point, I ſhall now ſhow that all incorrigible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in general, are ſo far from having any title to the ſalvation of the goſpel, that they are excluded herefrom, and ſentenced to future woe and miſery, by the moſt expreſs and poſitive declarations of the Goſpel itſelf. Thus the apoſtle tells us, that "to them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, God will render indignation and wrath; tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil:"
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:007488_0097_102B90250E639030"/>
That "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs:" And that "the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that <hi>obey not the Goſpel</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with an everlaſting deſtruction."—Hear the expoſtulation and admonition of the ſame Apoſtle in another of his epiſtles. "Know ye not, ſays he, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor whoremongers, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, &amp;c. ſhall inherit the kingdom of God." Has not our Saviour plainly told us to the ſame purpoſe, that the wicked "ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment?" Has he not told us, that in the judgment of the great day, he will ſay even to many who have <hi>eaten and drank in his preſence,</hi> "Depart from me, I know you not, all ye that work iniquity?" And not to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply paſſages of ſcripture in ſo plain a caſe, only call to mind the ſolemn words of our Saviour, in his laſt meſſage to the Churches, in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>St. John,</hi> towards the end—"I am Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega, the beginning and the end—He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things.—But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:007488_0098_102B902746F4DE58"/>
liars, ſhall have their part in the lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death—Bleſſed are they that do his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have right to the tree of life; and may enter in thro' the gates into the city: For without are dogs, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye. I Jeſus have ſent mine Angel to teſtify theſe things in the Churches."</p>
            <p>YOU now ſee what the plain, expreſs, repeated declarations of the Goſpel are; how they limit the ſalvation revealed in it, to them that obey the truth; how they cut off from all hope of eternal life, and conſign over to future puniſhment, all the irreclaimable workers of iniquity. God, who has the ſole right of ordaining and fixing the terms upon which his ſinful creatures ſhall be received into favour again; and enjoy the bleſſings of his preſence in the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: God himſelf, I ſay, has declared, that the hardened, irreclaimable tranſgreſſor ſhall never <hi>enter into his reſt;</hi> and that only the pure in heart ſhall ſee him, and be happy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. Nor are we to conceive of theſe terms as <hi>arbitrarily</hi> fixed, by him whoſe will none can reſiſt, whoſe hand none can ſtay, and who is not accountable to any one for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. No: We are to conceive of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Sovereign of the world. It would have been inconſiſtent with his infinite wiſdom, and perfect goodneſs and holineſs, to have accepted ſinners to his favour, and promiſed eternal life to them, but upon condition of their returning to Him, and keeping his commandments.</p>
            <p>AND if we duly attend to the thing, we ſhall ſee that ſuch a temper and practice as the Goſpel requires of us, is neceſſary not only as a <hi>condition,</hi> but as a <hi>qualification</hi> for future happineſs. Altho' this world is much better adapted to the depraved taſte and temper of wicked men, than the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven; yet they cannot be happy even here. God has conſtituted us in ſuch a manner; He has given us ſuch a nature, that vice is an irreconcileable enemy to our happineſs; and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone, friendly to it. "The way of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors is hard:" and "the wicked are like the troubled ſea which cannot reſt." Thus it is in this preſent ſtate; and thus it muſt needs be, in any other. A foundation muſt be laid for happineſs, in the purity and moral rectitude of our minds. Were a wicked man to be this day tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to heaven, with all his luſts and unholy paſſions about him, there is nothing there which would correſpond to his taſte and reliſh, ſo as to make him truly bleſſed in the enjoyment. Could the ſociety of juſt men made perfect? could the fellowſhip of holy angels, be delightful to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, brutiſh creature? What fellowſhip hath light with darkneſs? And what concord hath
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:007488_0100_102B902B07396168"/>
Chriſt with Belial, or the ſons of Belial? What happineſs can one who is every way unlike to God, and whoſe carnal mind is enmity againſt him, have in being in his glorious preſence? or how is ſuch a one capable of enjoying him? Wicked men, inſtead of expecting any felicity from the preſence and viſion of God, might adopt the language of the apoſtate angels, "Fartheſt from him is beſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>IF then we are not even in a capacity for enjoying the happineſs which the Goſpel reveals, in the kingdom and preſence of God, while we retain our luſts and vices, how vain and abſurd is it to imagine we can be intitled to it? We muſt obey the goſpel, and have our tempers conformed to the holy maxims and precepts of Chriſtianity, before we are capable ſubjects of that felicity which is brought to light thereby. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that God would promiſe this future, heavenly bliſs to any, except thoſe who have the qualifications neceſſary to a participation in it. <hi>That heaven</hi> which God has already prepared for good men, and which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in his word, is every way unſuitable for all beſides the good. So that wicked men muſt either not go to heaven at all, or they muſt have <hi>another</hi> prepared on purpoſe for them; and one more accommodated to their genius and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: Tho' when they came together there,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:007488_0101_102B902C92DE17E8"/>
they would ſoon turn their new heaven into a real hell; and the place of their expected bliſs, would prove only the place of their torment. For wherever the wicked are; in whatever region, in whatever world, they cannot but be miſerable in a greater or leſs degree. So the God of nature, ſo the all-wiſe governor of the world, has ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>His counſel ſhall ſtand</hi>—</p>
            <p>UPON laying together the ſeveral things that have been ſaid above, I think it plainly appears, that obedience to the goſpel is not only a thing that is <hi>fitting, reaſonable,</hi> and <hi>very proper,</hi> for thoſe that <hi>believe;</hi> (as ſome would repreſent it) but that it is abſolutely and indiſpenſably <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in order to our obtaining eternal life; neceſſary, both as the condition upon which God offers ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us, and as the qualification for future glory and happineſs. This is ſo clearly, ſo often, ſo emphatically declared in the holy ſcriptures, that one need not ſcruple to ſay, that whoſoever is not a <hi>doer of the word,</hi> as well as a <hi>hearer,</hi> has no more ground to expect ſalvation by Chriſt, than the fallen <hi>angels;</hi> altho' he took not upon him <hi>their</hi> nature, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> It is to impreſs this important truth upon our minds the more effectually, that our bleſſed Saviour has, in ſome of his diſcourſes, introduced wicked <hi>believers,</hi> as making their ſeveral excuſes, and pleas for mercy in the day of judgment; all which he rejects as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and vain. In theſe repreſentations of the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:007488_0102_102B902E2AF67D48"/>
laſt day, we ſee the formaliſts in religion, I mean theſe <hi>who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> ſtanding before their righteous Judge; we hear them ſaying, "We have eaten and drank in thy preſence; and in thy name caſt out devils; and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets;" and pleading, upon this foundation, for admittance into the kingdom of heaven. And at the ſame time we hear this juſt, and merciful Saviour of men, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, "Depart from me, ye that work iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!" So that this matter is repreſented to us in the ſtrongeſt light poſſible. And can any, after this, hope for mercy in the day of Judgment, tho' they indulge themſelves at preſent in impiety and vice? They cannot, without making Chriſt a liar, and his Goſpel a fable:—</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE to conclude: As we deſire to have a part in the reſurrection of the juſt; as we have any dread of falling under the condemnation of the wicked; as we have any regard to the words of our Redeemer, to the will of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, to the honor of our religion, to the ſalvation of our ſouls; let us hearken to the Admonition in the text, "Be ye doers of the word; and not hearers only, deceiving your ownſelves." Let us apply ourſelves in earneſt to the regulating of our tempers and manners; in which attempt we cannot but prove ſucceſsful, ſince it is God that worketh in us and with us. It is not more ſure that there is an heaven, than it is, that they who
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:007488_0103_102B9030B6E35C70"/>
obey not the goſpel, ſhall never enter into it. It is not more certain that there is an hell, than that all the impenitent workers of iniquity ſhall ſuffer the pains of it. And amongſt all the Wicked, none will be ſubjected to ſorer puniſhment, than the hypocritical profeſſors of religion, who pretend to know God, but in works deny him; who call Chriſt their Lord and maſter, but diſobey his commandments. To ſuch, the ingrafted word is ſo far from being, in the event, the power of God unto ſalvation; that it is in ſome ſort, <hi>the miniſtration of death,</hi> as the apoſtle terms <hi>the Law;</hi> binding them over to a heavier, and more inevitable puniſhment.</p>
            <p>DO you really deſire the ſalvation of your ſouls? Would you be indeed heirs of that glorious inheritance which Chriſt has purchaſed for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Surely you do. Why then, my brethren, be at the pains to comply with thoſe terms on which it is offered to you. Give up your pride and coveteouſneſs; give up your malice and envy, give up all your worldly luſts. "If your right hand offend you, cut it off; if your right eye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, pluck it out. For it is better to enter into life thus, than having two hands and two eyes to be caſt into hell fire, where the worm dieth not. The Goſpel itſelf cannot give life to you, unleſs it is ingrafted into your hearts; ſo that your tempers and manners are formed to a reſemblance of the divine author of it. Let your
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:007488_0104_102B903297290BF0"/>

faith purify your hearts, and work by love. Do your duty to God, love and obey your Redeemer; do unto all men as you would that they ſhould do unto you; be ſober and temperate in all things, as thoſe that ſtrive for the maſtery: And "hope unto the end for the grace that ſhall be brought unto you, at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, as obedient children, not faſhioning yourſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your former luſts."—I cannot cloſe this diſcourſe better than with the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following my text—"If any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glaſs: For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth himſelf, and goeth his way, and ſtraitway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But who ſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed."</p>

propoſe to conſider ſome of the common miſtakes and deluſions which Chriſtians fall into, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this important point; and to ſhow the vanity and abſurdity of them, leſt any of us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               </gap> carried away with the error of the wicked, and a deceived heart ſhould turn us aſide.</p>
            <p>MANKIND are liable to many errors and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, even tho' they take pains to be rightly informed. They are ſtill more liable to err, in thoſe caſes where they are not cautious and wary, but almoſt indifferent whether they are deceived or not. But moſt of all are they in danger of falling into miſtakes, when they have a ſecret prejudice againſt the truth; and are more diſpoſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the wrong ſide of a queſtion than the right, by reaſon of ſome wrong byaſs upon their minds. For men are not only liable to be impoſed upon and deceived by others; but in ſome caſes, they impoſe upon, and <hi>deceive their ownſelves.</hi> And hence it is that we are as frequently cautioned againſt ſelf-deception in ſcripture, as we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to take heed that we are not deceived by others. This caution is never more neceſſary, than when we are inquiring into the terms of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and ſalvation, propoſed to us in the Goſpel; whether we conſider the importance of forming a right judgment in this matter, or the natural propenſity and inclination which there is in us, to make thoſe terms as eaſy and agreable to ourſelves as poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:007488_0107_102B9038D9CDA2F8"/>
ALL men would be happy hereafter; but with as little difficulty to themſelves as may be; as little ſelf-denial; as little labour; as little care to work out their ſalvation. This I doubt not, is the true ſource of many licentious, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine doctrines, tending to reconcile a vicious immoral life, with the hopes of God's favour, and future bleſſedneſs; altho' nothing can be more repugnant to ſober reaſon, and the whole current of the Chriſtian revelation Vicious men are loth to give up their beloved luſts, and to live that pious and holy life which the goſpel injoins upon us. And therefore they perſwade themſelves to believe that there is no ſuch abſolute neceſſity of it as ſome pretend; and endeavour to evade the force of all thoſe arguments which are brought to evince it. However wicked they are, they are not willing to think themſelves ſuch perſons as the Goſpel excludes from that life and immortality, which are brought to light thereby. Hence it comes to paſs, that the ſcriptures, however plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peremptorily they ſpeak as to this point, are often tortur'd and wreſted; and made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no, to favour men's luſts, and ill-grounded hopes. The mere ſound of a word or phraſe, ſhall often carry more conviction in it, in the apprehenſion of men who would fain be happy without being good, than in the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of revelation: And drowning men, we know, will catch at ſtraws. For example; how
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:007488_0108_102B903AB6F8B930"/>
greedily do many perſons of licentious practices lay hold on ſuch expreſſions as theſe, that we are "ſaved by grace;" that we are "juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law;" that we muſt be "found in Chriſt not having our own righteouſneſs;" and the like? Many vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons think they find great ground of peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and hope, in ſuch-like expreſſions; and conclude from them, that the goſpel-covenant of grace in Chriſt Jeſus, is of ſuch a nature, as not to require repentance and new obedience as the indiſpenſable condition of ſalvation; but ſuch as will admit of the ſalvation of habitual ſinners, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they believe in Chriſt, and rely wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his righteouſneſs. This, in general, I ſuppoſe, is the error which <hi>St. James</hi> aims at refuting more particularly in the ſecond chapter of his epiſtle: An error which very early appeared in the church; and in the ſupport of which, <hi>St. Paul'</hi>s doctrine had been alledged. And if there is any ſuch thing as a fundamental error of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is doubtleſs one. It is a miſtake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>general nature</hi> of that covenant of grace and mercy, which is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, for the reſtoration and ſalvation of ſinners. It is moreover an error of ſuch a ſort, as naturally tends to confirm men in their wicked courſes; ſince, according to this notion, it is needleſs for them to forſake thoſe courſes; and to obey the commandments of Chriſt, in order to their future
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:007488_0109_102B903C46E5D2C8"/>
happineſs. So that perſons who are fallen into this deluſion may ſin, as it were, upon principle; at leaſt they may ſin, without hazarding their ſalvation, according to their own notion of the terms on which it is offered.</p>
            <p>BUT before I proceed particularly to lay open the vanity and abſurdity of this notion, I would premiſe one thing in order to prevent miſ-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; eſpecially to guard againſt the charge of cenſoriouſneſs and uncharity. And that is, that how much ſoever any man may be miſtaken in opinion concerning the terms of ſalvation; yet if he is practically in the right, there is no doubt but he will be accepted of God, who conſiders our frame, and knows our weakneſs. Poſſibly many perſons, according to whoſe principles obedience to the Goſpel is not neceſſary, may yet be as truly <hi>doers</hi> of the word, as thoſe whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents concerning this matter, are more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to reaſon and ſcripture. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſuch perſons ſhall not be excluded from ſalvation, merely on account of their erroneous opinion It is infinitely diſhonourable to the all good and perfect Governor of the world, to imagine that he has ſuſpended the eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men upon any niceties of ſpeculation: Or that any one who honeſtly aims at finding the truth, and at doing the will of his Maker, ſhall be finally diſcarded becauſe he fell into ſome erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions. He whoſe heart is right with
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:007488_0110_102B903E242D5E28"/>
God; he who ſeeks his will in his word, with an unbiaſſed mind; and he who conſcientiouſly obeys the goſpel, can be guilty of no error for which an infinitely good and merciful Being will condemn him.</p>
            <p>I ADD, that altho' ſuch a ſincere inquirer after the truth, ſhould embrace opinions which give countenance to vice and libertiniſm, in a natural and fair conſtruction; yea, altho' the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſhould, by being acted upon, prove the deſtruction of other perſons; yet ſurely he, whoſe practice is not influenced by them; but is conformable to the ſtricter maxims of piety and virtue laid down in the Goſpel, will reap the fruits of righteouſneſs in the end. And altho' moſt men are not ſo good as their principles oblige them to be; yet it is certain that ſome men are better: Which I take to be the caſe of many, who place the whole of religion in faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: For many ſuch, doubtleſs live ſoberly and righteouſly and godly in the world.</p>

ſuch errors muſt be fatal in their <hi>conſequence;</hi> tho' not neceſſarily ſo, conſidered in themſelves. How inconſiderable any error may be in itſelf; if the effect of it is either the making a man vicious, or keeping him ſo, to him it is and muſt be fatal in the event: Tho' to others it may not prove ſo; becauſe it may not have the ſame effect upon them. Nor, indeed, is there any ſpeculative er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, however great, which can exclude a good and upright man, who obeys the laws of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, from the kingdom of heaven: Tho' it may probably prove, in ſome degree, prejudicial to his virtue; retard him in his progreſs towards Chriſtian perfection; and ſo prevent his obtaining ſo bright a crown of glory, at the end of his race, as he might otherwiſe have done. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we read of ſome that build <hi>wood, hay, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> i. e. falſe, abſurd, and hurtful doctrines, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the baſis of Chriſtianity, who yet ſhall be ſaved at laſt, tho' "ſo as by fire."</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations ſhould, on the one hand, keep us from being cenſorious towards our fellow Chriſtians; and from dealing out our <hi>anathema's</hi> againſt thoſe that are in error. On the other hand, they ſhould make us ſincerely inquiſitive after the truth ourſelves, and zealous in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it. It is, by no means, an indifferent thing, whether people have juſt conceptions of Chriſtianity or not; tho' all parties have perhaps laid too much ſtreſs upon their own peculiar ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:007488_0112_102B90423B42E218"/>
and been wanting in candor and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance towards others. The more juſtly people conceive of the doctrines of the Goſpel, the more likely they are, humanly ſpeaking, to live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their profeſſion. Miſtaken notions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, eſpicially ſuch as evidently diſannul the obligations to obedience, rendering the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God of none effect, ſhould certainly be oppoſed and refuted; altho' they ſhould not be abſolutely inconſiſtent with a good life, and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical righteouſneſs. If we ought to "contend earneſtly for the <hi>faith</hi> once delivered to the ſaints;" we ought certainly to contend with as much earneſtneſs at leaſt for that practical piety and virtue, without which no one can be a ſaint; and which is, in fact, the end of all faith.</p>
            <p>IT is not very ſtrange if thoſe, whoſe principles allow them to live wickedly, ſhould <hi>allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> in it: Eſpecially when we conſider how many there are, who allow themſelves to do ſo, contrary to their principles.—There are great numbers of perſons in the Chriſtian world who, altho' they acknowledge the neceſſity of obedience to the goſpel, yet practically deny it, led away by their own luſts and enticed. What then can be naturally expected of thoſe, who imagine they have a diſpenſation for ſinning? and that good works are of little or no account in the chriſtian religion! It is rather to be wonder'd at, that any of theſe deluded perſons ſhould be good, (as it is
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:007488_0113_102B9043C9C71510"/>
to be hoped they are) than that ſo many of them ſhould be wicked, as there is reaſon to fear. For it is very unuſual for men to be better than their own principles oblige them to be: tho' it is very common for them to be much worſe than they can be, in conſiſtancy with them.</p>
            <p>THE deluſions to which I had a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference above, may all be reduced to one grand, capital error; which is this, That the merits of Chriſt's obedience and ſufferings, may be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied or imputed to ſinners, as to be available to their juſtification and ſalvation, altho' they are deſtitute of all perſonal inherent goodneſs. This grand miſtake is variouſly modified; it puts on different forms and appearances; and ſcripture-terms and phraſes are brought to ſupport it. When it is cloathed in ſcripture language, it is expreſſed thus; that we are <hi>ſaved by grace;</hi> that we muſt be <hi>found in Chriſt not having on our own righteouſneſs, which is of the law;</hi> that we are <hi>juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the phraſes which, I ſuppoſe, have been the moſt commonly abuſed and perverted to ſerve ſo bad a purpoſe, as that of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men believe they may be in a ſtate of favour with God, while they live in diſobedience to his commandments. They all amount to much the ſame thing, both in their natural and true ſenſe as they are uſed by the ſacred writers, and in the opinion of thoſe who wreſt and pervert
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:007488_0114_102B90464FDDF360"/>
them. However I ſhall conſider them diſtinctly; and endeavour to reſcue them from the falſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd gloſſes which have been put upon them, greatly to the prejudice of pure and undefiled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And I hope it will ſufficiently appear, that thoſe who uſe theſe phraſes in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage good works, and evangelical obedience; or in order to ſhow that we may be juſtified and ſaved without being <hi>doers of the word, deceive their ownſelves,</hi> and delude thoſe who believe them. For they cannot poſſibly be tho't to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo licentious an opinion, 'til they are miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p>IT is only the firſt of them, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That we are <hi>ſaved by grace,</hi> that will be conſidered in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Now that we are really ſaved by grace, no one who believes the ſcriptures will deny; this being not only a doctrine of ſcripture, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the the very words of ſcripture. But thoſe who imagine that, becauſe we are ſaved by grace, obedience to the goſpel is not neceſſary, as the condition on our part, in order to ſalvation, draw a concluſion which is very unnatural. If theſe things are reconcileable one with the other; if it <hi>may</hi> be true that we are ſaved by grace, and yet true that we cannot be ſaved without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: then certainly the ſuppoſed neceſſity of obedience, does not at all militate againſt the doctrine of our ſalvation by grace. For if there be no real repugnancy betwixt theſe principles,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:007488_0115_102B9047D7278550"/>
they may be both equally true; nor can the falſhood of one be inferred from the truth of the other.</p>
            <p>MY buſineſs here therefore, is, to ſhow that there is no inconſiſtency betwixt theſe doctrines; that tho' we are ſaved by grace, yet we are ſaved in the way of obedience, and conſequently, that it is a perverſion and abuſe of the ſcripture doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of grace, to infer from it, that obedience to Chriſt's Commandments, is not the goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our acceptance with God, and obtaining eternal life by him.</p>
            <p>NOW, that to be ſaved by grace, in the ſenſe of ſcripture, does not imply that we are ſaved without, or independently of, obedience and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs, is very evident in general from hence, That <hi>that</hi> grace of God which has appeared unto us, teaches us, not that we may hope for ſalvation while we continue in ſin; but that <hi>denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world; looking,</hi> in conſequence of our living thus, <hi>for the bleſſed hope.</hi> If even the grace of God which is revealed to us, teaches us that we are to turn from our ſins to God; it muſt be an abſurd inference, that we need not turn from ſin to God, becauſe this grace is revealed to us, and we are ſaved thereby. This is, in effect to ſay, that becauſe God in the goſpel of his grace, has taught us that we muſt deny our worldly luſts,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:007488_0116_102B904A35876650"/>
and ſerve him, therefore we need not do ſo; but may obtain his favour without! St. <hi>Paul</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly caution'd us againſt ſuch an abuſe of the doctrine of God's grace. "Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, ſays he, for ye are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, but under grace. What then! ſhall we ſin, becauſe we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>. 14, 15.</note> The apoſtle, in this paſſage, not only repreſents our being under a diſpenſation of grace, as conſiſtent with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our forſaking every ſinful practice; but he repreſents this as an additional obligation laid upon us to do ſo. He draws his argument for obedience and righteouſneſs of life, from this very conſideration, that we are under a gracious diſpenſation. "Sin ſhall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace." Thoſe muſt therefore reaſon very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly, in a manner quite contrary to the apoſtle, who would go about to prove from the gracious nature of that covenant which we are under, that obedience is needleſs; or that we may continue in ſin, becauſe we are ſaved by grace. They draw an inference the very reverſe of his, from the ſame principles. His inference is, that becauſe we are under grace, therefore we <hi>may not</hi> continue in ſin: Their's, that we <hi>may</hi> continue in ſin, becauſe we are under ſuch a diſpenſation. And now whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> is in the right, or thoſe who contradict him, judge ye.</p>

               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:007488_0117_102B904BC4F43FE0"/>
THIS is, I think, ſufficient to ſhow in <hi>general,</hi> that all thoſe miſunderſtand the ſcripture doctrine of our ſalvation by grace, who infer from it, that our ſalvation is not ſuſpended upon our obedience to God's commandments. But let us be a little more <hi>particular</hi> in conſidering the ſeveral ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the term <hi>grace,</hi> in the new teſtament; that ſo we may ſee whether either of them mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates againſt the ſuppoſed neceſſity of obedience and good works.</p>
            <p>AND let us begin with the primary and moſt general notion hereof; which is <hi>favour;</hi> or ſome act of <hi>goodneſs, generoſity</hi> or <hi>bounty,</hi> as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from thoſe acts which come within the known laws of common equity and juſtice. In conformity to this firſt and moſt general ſenſe of the term, when it is ſaid that we are ſaved by grace, the meaning is, that we do not merit ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that we cannot demand it upon the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of natural juſtice; but it flows from another fountain, even from the abounding goodneſs and mercy of God. It proceeds wholly from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved favour; and is to be acknowledged as <hi>his gift,</hi> not claimed as <hi>our due.</hi> And that our ſalvation is of grace in this ſenſe, I as firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and am as ready to aſſert, if not ſo able to prove, as any other perſon whatever. Our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation took its riſe in the mere bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. And the ſame over-flowing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which it had it's origin, is conſpicious in
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:007488_0118_102B904EB79B0BE0"/>
every part of it, 'til it is, or rather ſhall be, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated and perfected in the regions of immortal bliſs. But does it follow from hence, that this ſalvation does not accrue to us in the way of obedience to Chriſt's commandments? May it not be true, that God requires this obedience of us, as what is indiſpenſably neceſſary in order to our ſalvation; and yet be true, at the ſame time, that He manifeſts his favour, and great goodneſs to us herein? Certainly our obedience, however neceſſary it may be, is not ſo valuable and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, as to be an adequate conſideration for the ſalvation and eternal happineſs of our ſouls: So far from this, that we ought to look upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> even tho' we had done all thoſe things that are required of us. How then could it ever enter into the heart of man to imagine, that if obedience to the goſpel is neceſſary in order to our ſalvation, then it could not be true that we are ſaved by grace; as if ſuch obedience excluded grace; and left no room for the exerciſe of it? Thoſe perſons muſt ſet a very undue and diſproportionate value upon our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect obedience, who imagine it leaves no place for the manifeſtation of divine grace or favour in our ſalvation; and that whatever God is pleaſed to confer upon us in conſequence hereof, is only the paying of a debt, or rendering the labourer the reward, to which he has intitled himſelf, on the footing of common equity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:007488_0119_102B905098ECB108"/>
THE reaſoning of ſome perſons upon this point are very ſtrange and unaccountable; and, I think quite inconſiſtent. For one while they tell us, that our obedience, and beſt good works, are only as <hi>filthy rags;</hi> ſo very mean and contemptible, that they cannot be truly acceptable to God, or fit to be rewarded by him: Yea, that they are attended with ſo much ſin and imperfection, that they muſt be odious to him; and rather need a pardon, than entitle us to a reward. But, in the next, if not the ſame breath, we are told, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>abominable</hi> good works, if ſuppoſed neceſſary and conducive to our ſalvation, would ſubvert the doctrine of our being ſaved by grace: Which is to ſay in other words, that imperfect and ſinful as they are, they are yet ſo valuable, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſo meritorious, that they leave no room for God to exerciſe grace in our ſalvation! But if our works of righteouſneſs are all ſo imperfect, not to ſay ſo <hi>filthy,</hi> as they are ſometimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be, one would think there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of excluding divine grace, by ſaying that obedience to the Goſpel is made the condition of our ſalvation. Tho' obedience is required in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our ſalvation, it cannot be tho't meritorious of it. The truth lies betwixt the two extremes mentioned above. Our obedience and good works are really acceptable to God in ſome degree; otherwiſe he would not have required us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, and promiſed to reward them; as he
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:007488_0120_102B905221DF2480"/>
has moſt certainly done. But yet they are not ſo valuable in their own nature, as to merit eternal life for thoſe who perform them. God is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious, in accepting this imperfect obedience thro' Chriſt, and in beſtowing eternal life upon the ſubjects of it. This is therefore a reward, not of merit on our ſide, but of grace on God's part. How unjuſtly then, are thoſe who hold the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of perſonal righteouſneſs; and believe that God will graciouſly reward our obedience, thro' Chriſt, charged with maintaining the doctrine of merit, in oppoſition to grace? This is but too common a ſlander, made uſe of by captious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable men, to bring a reproach upon thoſe whom they diſlike.—</p>
            <p>IT is readily acknowledged, that the moſt perfect man does not work out a righteouſneſs, ſtrictly legal. Salvation therefore cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but upon the footing of grace or favour. Yea, I may add, that altho' our obedience were perfect, it would ſtill be favour and bounty in God, to beſtow eternal life upon us in conſequence of it. We might indeed, upon this ſuppoſition, claim an exemption from puniſhment and miſery, according to the immutable laws of right and equity. But to aſſert that the moſt perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and obedience of a creature, would, in it's own nature, on account of it's inherent worth, and independently of any promiſe of God, intitle that creature to endleſs happineſs, is to aſſert
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:007488_0121_102B905467A8E0B8"/>
more than any man can prove. It would evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be grace in God to confer endleſs immeaſurable bliſs, upon a creature, who had in no inſtance violated his laws. The reward would be more, infinitely more, than adequate to the ſervice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Who can preſume to ſay, that the holieſt angel in heaven, has by his obedience, ſtrictly ſpeaking, merited everlaſting happineſs? or, that it is not grace in God, to confer this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any creature whatever? If God makes a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happy during his obedience, it is the utmoſt that juſtice requires. Such a creature might, without receiving any wrong or injury, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his exiſtence and happineſs together, after perſevering in his obedience for any given time. The Author of his being, is not that I know of, abſolutely obliged to preſerve him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, becauſe the creature has not ſwerved from his duty. And if God is not bound in juſtice to make ſuch a creature eternally happy, it muſt be grace in him to do it; for betwixt juſtice and grace, there is in this caſe no medium. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, it is grace in God to beſtow endleſs happineſs upon thoſe who have violated his laws, however penitent and reformed they are. And this, I hope, is ſufficient to ſhow, that altho' we cannot be ſaved, without obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and altho' this is, properly ſpeaking, the condition upon which pardon and eternal life are offered to us; yet it may be ſtill equally true, that
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:007488_0122_102B9056CEC9DBB0"/>
we are ſaved by grace, as that ſignifies favour and unmerited goodneſs in the Creator and Lord of all.</p>
            <p>It will come to the ſame thing at laſt, if by grace we underſtand more particularly the goſpel diſpenſation. The term is often uſed thus in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and indeed this is the moſt common ſenſe of it. And the Goſpel is called grace, by a u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual figure, in reſpect of the ſubject of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a declaration and manifeſtation of God's grace or favour towards ſinners. Hence we read of <hi>the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi> And this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of mercy, is ſometimes ſtyled grace more eſpecially in contradiſtinction from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic,</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> diſpenſation. So it is ſaid, that "the <hi>Law</hi> was given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but <hi>Grace,</hi>—came by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in general, where-ever law and grace are oppoſed to each other in the new teſtament, grace means the Goſpel, the good news of pardon and eternal life, brought from heaven to earth by the Son of God, and preached to the world by his apoſtles.</p>
            <p>NOW if we underſtand the term in this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate ſenſe, when we are ſaid to be ſaved by grace, the meaning will be, that we are ſaved by the Goſpel, or in the way which the Goſpel reveals to us; which is a declaration of God's favour and mercy to ſinful creatures; a declaration of his gracious purpoſe to forgive and ſave tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, upon certain terms therein marked out;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:007488_0123_102B9058AF5F7CB8"/>
and which does not inſiſt upon perfect Obedience, as the Law of MOSES ſeems, according to the letter of it, to have done. For, ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the Man which doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them.</q>

            </p>
            <p>IT may be here aſked again, how our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved by grace, in this ſenſe, militates againſt the ſuppoſed neceſſity of repentance from dead works, and ſincerely obeying that Goſpel, by which we are to be ſaved? What tho' we are not, neither can be, ſaved upon the footing of mere law, whether the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the law of nature? What tho' we are ſaved by, or in the way of, a new and merciful covenant eſtabliſhed in Chriſt Jeſus? a covenant of Grace, wherein proviſion is made for the reſtoration of ſinners to the divine favour? Will it follow from hence, that we are ſaved without any kind or degree of obedience? It is not inconſiſtent even with a covenant of grace, that it ſhould propoſe to us certain terms and conditions for our acceptance, in order to our obtaining the bleſſings thereof. And tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe, that the terms on which the goſpel offers ſalvation to us, are thoſe of faith and new obedience, would this make it ceaſe to
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:007488_0124_102B905A93CCB5D8"/>
be a covenant of grace? Surely, the covenant may be very gracious, tho' it promiſes pardon and eternal life, only to penitent, obedient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, to be ſaved by grace, meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the goſpel of God's grace, is to be ſaved in that way, in that method, which the goſpel opens, provides for us, and preſcribes to us. To know particularly what that way is, we muſt look into the goſpel itſelf: And if we do ſo, we ſhall find that it is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that obedience to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it is neceſſary; that this is the very thing which it makes neceſſary; the great, or rather the only, condition upon which it offers ſalvation to us. For in this diſpenſation of the grace of God, it is, that we are aſſured, that Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him; and that thoſe who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, ſhall fall under condemnation hereafter. Since, therefore, to be ſaved by grace, is to be ſaved in the way which the goſpel reveals to us; and ſince the goſpel itſelf expreſsly requires repentance and ſincere obedience in order to our ſalvation; it is a very abſurd inference, that becauſe we are ſaved in this method of grace, therefore we are not ſaved in the way of obedience; which is indeed the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way that the goſpel knows of: Unleſs by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved in the way of obedience, you mean
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:007488_0125_102B905C1D3B0458"/>
obedience that is perfect and ſtrictly legal; for if that is what is intended hereby, it is certain that no one is ſaved in that way, no one having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſuch obedience. But it will not follow, that becauſe perfect obedience is not neceſſary in order to our ſalvation, therefore no obedience at all is neceſſary to that end: Nor are we charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with turning the goſpel of God's grace into a covenant of works, in repreſenting all the bleſſings of it as confined to thoſe who, "having believed in God, are careful to maintain good works."</p>
            <p>TO proceed, the term grace is ſometimes uſed to expreſs a heavenly, divine principle in the hearts of thoſe who are born again. I am not certain, indeed, that the ſcripture ever uſes the term in this ſenſe; tho' this being now common with theological and practical writers, we will take the propriety of it for granted. And if we are ſaved by grace in this ſenſe, it is the very thing which I would prove, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we are ſaved by holineſs, righteouſneſs, and evangelical obedience; not without it. For what do we mean by this divine principle, this grace in the hearts of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, but a principle of goodneſs, or holineſs? a principle, which makes us reſemble God, and prompts us to live in obedience to his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? To be ſaved by grace, underſtanding thereby a principle of real ſanctity in the heart, and ſuch a one as is always productive of good
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:007488_0126_102B905EC6210BC8"/>
fruits in the life, is ſo far from being repugnant to the ſuppoſed neceſſity of evangelical obedience, that it is the very ſame doctrine, only expreſſed in different words. For when it is ſaid, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the goſpel is neceſſary in order to our ſalvation, or that we are ſaved by ſuch obedience; nothing more is intended, than that it is neceſſary we ſhould be poſſeſſed of ſuch a gracious principle as was ſpoken of above; a principle of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which manifeſts itſelf in a good converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that whoſoever is endowed therewith, has the promiſe of eternal life. So that they who aſſert we are ſaved by grace, in this ſenſe of the term, are ſo far from contradicting thoſe who maintain the neceſſity of obedience, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it, that they aſſert the ſame thing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>IT will make no material difference, as to the point now before us, if by grace we underſtand, not a principle of goodneſs and holineſs in the heart, but thoſe influences and operations of the ſpirit of God upon the heart, by which that good principle is produced therein. This, if I miſtake not, is what people often mean by the term grace. Let us therefore underſtand it thus, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and conſider whether our being ſaved by grace, militates againſt the other ſuppoſition, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we are ſaved in the way of obedience to Chriſt's commandments. And now, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the term thus, when it is ſaid we are ſaved by
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:007488_0127_102B9060A36C0228"/>
grace, the meaning muſt be, That God ſaves us by begetting or producing in us, a principle of holineſs and righteouſneſs; and that we could not be ſaved, did He not thus give his holy ſpirit to renew and ſanctify us: Or this may be expreſſed more in the phraſe of ſcripture, thus, That God ſaves us by "working in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure": Or thus, that He "ſaves us by the waſhing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt:" Or, "thro' ſanctification of the ſpirit unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience." Very well: it is readily acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that it is by the operations of the ſpirit of God upon our hearts, that we attain to true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that we cannot be ſaved without his bleſſed influences, in turning us from ſin to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. But what does this make againſt the ſuppoſed neceſſity of obedience? The being ſaved by grace in this ſenſe, pre-ſuppoſes the neceſſity of holineſs, of perſonal purity, and ſanctity of heart and manners. For the grace of God, or the gracious influences of his Spirit, in turning us from unrighteouſneſs to obedience, would not be neceſſary in order to our ſalvation, where not obedience itſelf neceſſary to that end. The neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the former, ariſes only from the neceſſity of the latter. For if you ſuppoſe that righteouſneſs and obedience, are not neceſſary to the end men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and that we may be ſaved without them; certainly that grace of God, by which we are
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:007488_0128_102B90622A1C7CB0"/>
made righteous, is unneceſſary alſo. The grace of God, meaning thereby the gracious influences of his ſpirit, contributes to our ſalvation, only as it produces in us that holineſs which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our being ſaved, and by which we are made meet for the kingdom of Heaven. So that to ſay, we are ſaved by grace, in this ſenſe of the term, is in effect to ſay, that we are ſaved by that divine and heavenly principle which is wrought in us by the good Spirit of God, co-operating with the goſpel of his Son; and that we could not be ſaved, unleſs we were thus <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> And this, ſurely, is very conſiſtent with the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we are ſaved in the way of obedience to the Goſpel, or by our being <hi>doers of the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE mentioned are the moſt uſual ſenſes of the term grace: Nor can I readily think of any other or different meaning, that can be affixed thereto, when we are ſaid to be ſaved thereby. The ſenſe of the propoſition, muſt be either (1) in general, that we are ſaved by the favour and bounty of God to us, in oppoſition to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of merit; or (2) that we are ſaved by the Goſpel of Chriſt, as contradiſtinguiſhed from the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> or (3) that we are ſaved by being truly holy; by what ſome call a principle of Grace in the heart; or (<hi>laſtly</hi>) by God's produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch a principle in us, by the gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his Spirit; which comes to the ſame

thing, with reſpect to the point now in hand. And the doctrine of our being ſaved by grace, in any, or in all of theſe ſenſes, does not militate in the leaſt degree againſt the doctrine of our being ſaved by obedience to the Goſpel; and of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, in this way an intereſt in God's peculiar love here, together with an inheritance hereafter in the kingdom of heaven. The neceſſity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is rather eſtabliſhed, than overthrown and refuted, by the ſcripture doctrine of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Grace.</p>
            <p>TO conclude this diſcourſe, therefore, let us take heed, while we acknowledge our ſalvation to be of grace, that we do not pervert this doctrine to the encouraging of licentiouſneſs, either in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others. To the honor of God, and the goſpel of his Son, we are bound to confeſs, that we are ſaved by Grace. But ſurely it is not to his glory, nor to the honor of the Chriſtian reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to imagine that we are ſaved by grace in any ſuch ſenſe, as would render obedience to our Saviour's commandments unneceſſary. On the contrary, it would be highly diſhonourable to both, to conceive thus. Such an imagination does, in effect, deveſt God of his holineſs, and all his moral perfections. It is to repreſent him as giving men a diſpenſation for indulging their luſts, by an expreſs revelation from heaven. For, in truth, what elſe is it, to aſſert that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:007488_0130_102B90661F5AA068"/>
is a diſpenſation of grace, in ſuch a ſenſe, that even thoſe who live and dye in their ſins, are not excluded by the terms of it, from the hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal happineſs? And that the gates of heaven are ſet open to all thoſe who believe, whether they work righteouſneſs or work iniquity? If this is not to repreſent God as being indifferent to virtue and vice; if it is not to abuſe his grace, and turn it into laſciviouſneſs; if it is not to make Chriſt the miniſter of ſin, rather than the Saviour of men from it; it will be impoſſible to ſay what is really ſo; yea, that any thing can be ſo. Nor can there be a greater diſhonor done to Chriſtianity, than is done to it by thoſe who repreſent it in this light.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE one of the wiſer ſort of <hi>Pagans,</hi> who had as yet never heard any thing concerning the goſpel of Chriſt, ſhould have an account given thereof to this purpoſe; <q>That it was a very <hi>gracious</hi> diſpenſation, inaſmuch as it did not require in its profeſſors, ſincere piety, and the practice of virtue, as abſolutely neceſſary to their being happy after death; but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended theſe things as being decent, and a proper way of expreſſing our gratitude to God; and that the moſt vicious men, provided they hear and believe this revelation, truſting intirely to the righteouſneſs and obedience of Him whoſe name it bears, ſhould certainly obtain eternal life:</q> What would ſuch an intelligent <hi>Pagan</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:007488_0131_102B9067A92A8F18"/>
naturally conclude? Certainly that this preacher of <hi>free Grace</hi> was beſide himſelf; or, which is ſtill worſe, that he was a very abandoned man, and not only vicious himſelf, but deſirous to corrupt others by his licentious doctrine. He would not believe that the religion, of which ſuch an account was given him, was really a revelation from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but would very naturally and juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was the invention of ſome wicked man, or, at beſt the dream of a weak one. But yet I am bold to ſay, that this is, and muſt be, the account given of Chriſtianity, by all thoſe who deny the neceſſity of obedience thereto, and of perſonal righteouſneſs; and who infer from the doctrine of our being ſaved by grace, that we may be ſaved without goodneſs. Take heed therefore, my Brethren, leſt any man deceive you, and leſt you deceive your ownſelves, with vain empty words, and falſe hopes. "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only." And reſt aſſured, that <hi>That</hi> doctrine which teaches that men may obtain ſalvation, without <hi>ceaſing to do evil, and learning to do well;</hi> without yielding a ſincere obedience to the laws of Chriſtianity; (that <hi>That</hi> doctrine, I ſay) is not ſo properly called a DOCTRINE OF GRACE, as it is, a DOCTRINE OF DEVILS.</p>

            <p>AMONGST other Things, the neceſſity of our being doers of the word, and not hearers only, in order to our obtaining the ſalvation revealed in the goſpel, has been diſtinctly ſhown from this paſſage of ſcripture. But becauſe St. <hi>James</hi> here ſpeaks as if there was at leaſt ſome danger of our deluding ourſelves
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:007488_0133_102B906BC1809908"/>
with an imagination, that obeying the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is not really neceſſary to the mentioned end, in the preceeding diſcourſe I entered upon a conſideration of thoſe miſtakes reſpecting this important point, into which many Chriſtians have fallen, even from the early days of Chriſtianity; and to which the Apoſtle refers in ſome parts of this epiſtle. The errors and deluſions which I here intend, reſpect the general ſcheme of our ſalvation by Chriſt, and the nature of that covenant of grace, which is eſtabliſhed in and by Him. Which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and deluſions, have, I ſuppoſe, chiefly proceeded from a miſconſtruction of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expreſſions in the writings of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And indeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> obſerved long ſince, that in the epiſtles of this his beloved Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there were "ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unſtable wreſt—unto their own deſtruction."</p>
            <p>THE expreſſions which ſeem at leaſt as likely to be thus wreſted by the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi> and <hi>unſtable,</hi> as any other in thoſe epiſtles, are ſuch as theſe; That we are <q>ſaved by grace; That we muſt be found in Chriſt, not having our own righteouſneſs; and that we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith, without the deeds of the law.</q> For from theſe, and ſuch-like expreſſions,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:007488_0134_102B906D5A6BC758"/>
ſome have in fact imagined, that perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs, inherent holineſs, or obedience to the Goſpel, (call it which you pleaſe) is not really neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our acceptance with God, and to our obtaining the ſalvation revealed to us, and purchaſed for us, by Chriſt: And it is to be feared, that many, from age to age, have thus deceived themſelves to their own deſtruction. Theſe ſcripture expreſſions which have been perverted, ſo as to render the commandments of God of none effect, and to annul the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to evangelical obedience, terminate nearly in the ſame point at laſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was propoſed to conſider them diſtinctly; and to ſhow how far they are from countenancing any ſuch licentious doctrines as have been grounded upon them. The former of them, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we are "ſaved by grace," was conſidered in the laſt diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>LET us now proceed to a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſecond, reſpecting our being <hi>found in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. The paſſage at large ſtands thus in the epiſtle.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <q>But what things were gain to me, theſe I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted loſs for Chriſt; yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:007488_0135_102B906F99BA4DC0"/>
the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt: And be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith: That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS paſſage having been made great uſe of, in order to ſhow, that our own perſonal righteouſneſs is of little or no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the ſight of God; and that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed to us, and received by faith, is the ſole ground of our acceptance with Him, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it the more carefully and diſtinctly. I will give ſome ſhort and general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s deſign here: And then point out more particularly, both what that righteouſneſs is which he here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims and renounces, and what that is which he builds his hopes upon, and glories in. From whence, I doubt not, it will appear, that he is ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting any thing which has been ſaid upon this ſubject, concerning the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obedience to the Goſpel, that he, in effect, aſſerts the ſame thing himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:007488_0136_102B90717771A250"/>
NOW it is to be remembred, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerved, for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this paſſage, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, both by birth and religion, a <hi>Jew:</hi> He had been educated in the principles and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as he himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. He had been ſo zealous in this way, as to become, very early, a bitter enemy to the name and religion of Chriſt; and thus he continued to be, 'til he was miraculouſly converted to the Chriſtian faith, in his journey to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> And the paſſage quoted above, repreſents to us in general, how entirely his ſentiments concerning religion, and the way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, were changed from what they had formerly been:—how contemptibly he now tho't of many things, in which, while he was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> he gloried in, and depended upon, as a ſufficient and acceptable righteouſneſs:—how highly he now accounted of Chriſt, whoſe name he was wont to blaſpheme; and whoſe diſciples he had perſecuted:—how ſollicitous he was to attain to that righteouſneſs which the goſpel preſcribes, and to that Salvation which is therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to ſinful Men. This is the general deſign and ſcope of the paſſage we are conſidering. And ſurely a perſon newly converted from <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:007488_0137_102B9073703F6120"/>
from a perſecuting <hi>Phariſee</hi> to a diſciple of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> may well be ſuppoſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value all his former attainments in religion, and to renounce all dependance upon them for ſalvation, without being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to undervalue that obedience which the goſpel requires, or to renounce all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence thereupon in the grand affair of his acceptance with God, and obtaining eternal Life. My meaning is, that it does not follow from the Apoſtle's diſclaiming, and depreciating the former righteouſneſs, that he muſt diſclaim and depreciate the latter alſo. For tho' one may be really worthleſs and inſignificant, the other may be truly valuable, and acceptable in the ſight of God. The righteouſneſs of a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> may be contemptible, and yet the obedience of a Chriſtian be of great price, and great efficacy with God. Unleſs it can be ſhown that the Apoſtle here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces ſome other righteouſneſs than a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> one, as that is oppoſed to the obedience and good works of a ſincere Chriſtian, this paſſage is not to the purpoſe of thoſe who alledge it in order to prove, that a Chriſtian's obedience is not that which entitles him to the ſalvation which Chriſt has wrought out, and which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in his goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:007488_0138_102B9075F926BCC0"/>
LET us, therefore, as was propoſed inquire a little more particularly, what righteouſneſs that is, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces? whether it is only the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or the obedience and good works of a Chriſtian? And for the reſolving of this point, let us go to the preceeding context, where he gives us an account of what, as a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> he had formerly valued himſelf upon.</p>
            <p>IN oppoſition to the unconverted <hi>Jews,</hi> who relied upon their external privileges, upon their circumciſion, and other ritual obſervances, he ſays—<hi>We are the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh, ver.</hi> 3. As if he had ſaid, "The <hi>Jews</hi> vaunt of their being circumciſed: But we Chriſtians, altho' we may not have externally received that rite, are yet the true ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being circumciſed in heart, which is the thing ſignified by that outward ſign. We are more truly the circumciſion, according to the ſpiritual meaning of the law, than they who glory only in the viſible ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of internal purity: For we ſerve God in ſpirit and in truth; and glory in our relation to Jeſus Chriſt, who is the end of the law; having no dependence on
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:007488_0139_102B907785137040"/>
thoſe carnal ordinances, and weak and beggarly elements, which they who are ſtill zealous of the law, value themſelves upon." <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh. If any man thinketh he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>q. d.</hi> "Think not that I ſpeak with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of theſe fleſhly ordinances, from a principle of envy; or becauſe I could not glory in the obſervation of them as well as others, if I judged this was any juſt ground of confidence. No: If ſuch things might juſtly be truſted in; if any man whatever can, with reaſon, place his dependence upon things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I am bold to ſay that I myſelf can do it with as much juſtice and propriety, as any other perſon; yea with more than the greater part of thoſe that do ſo." The Apoſtle proceeds to explain himſelf in the next words—<hi>Circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Phariſee.</hi>" ver 5. <hi>q. d.</hi> "You may judge by what follows, with how much more juſtice I could glory in <hi>Jewiſh</hi> privileges, and legal, ceremonious obſervances, than moſt other perſons, did I value myſelf upon them. For I was circumciſed exactly on the eighth day, according to the very letter of the law;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:007488_0140_102B9079B8BC17F8"/>
which is more than every Jew can boaſt. I deſcended directly from the loins of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and am one of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who was ſo peculiarly beloved of our common Father: I am not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte, nor the ſon of a proſelyte, but a natural born <hi>Jew,</hi> a branch ſprung up from the original ſtock of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> And I was moreover one of that ſect, which is of the greateſt note and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſect of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>" The Apoſtle proceeds with the catalogue of his privileges, &amp;c. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning zeal, perſecuting the church; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteouſneſs which is in the law, blameleſs.</hi> ver. 6. <hi>q. d.</hi> "Nor was I one of the cold, lifeleſs profeſſors of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religion: So far from it, that I diſtinguiſhed myſelf by my zeal for it; yea, ſo warm and ſanguine was I in the cauſe, that I exerted myſelf to the utmoſt, to beat down all that did, or ſeemed to oppoſe it; and accordingly became a violent perſecutor of the church of Chriſt. And, to ſum up all in one word, I was ſo ſtrict an obſerver of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common way of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, that no perſon, however critical and zealous, could blame me, or tax me with deviating from the righteouſneſs of it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:007488_0141_102B907B46678E90"/>
NOW theſe are the things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, gave him greater ground of confidence, and glorying in the fleſh, than moſt of his countrymen, who ſtill adhered to the law in oppoſition to the goſpel, could pretend to: Upon which, however, he renounces all dependence for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and acceptance with God. But it will be proper to inquire more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into the Apoſtle's meaning, in the laſt words quoted above, where he ſays that he had been <hi>blameleſs, touching the righteouſneſs that is in the law;</hi> this being, as I apprehend, a point of conſiderable importance. By this, then, I think he muſt intend one or the other of the three things following: Either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT he had been, in the moſt ſtrict and proper ſenſe, perfect and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT he had been blameleſs and perfect in a lower and leſs proper ſenſe; as other good men under the law were ſaid to be, notwithſtanding ſome deviations from their duty: Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT he had been blameleſs with relation to the ceremonial part of the law; which it ſeems, the Jews of that corrupt, degenerate age, generally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt excellent, and chiefly gloried in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:007488_0142_102B907D40404520"/>
THE righteouſneſs which the apoſtle here intends, whatever it be, he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclaims as an inſufficient ground of truſt and dependence, in the next words.—<hi>But what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</hi> The connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plainly ſhows, that he contemned and diſpiſed all his former righteouſneſs, in compariſon of that which is of God by faith.</p>
            <p>NOW we may be very certain that the Apoſtle is not to be underſtood in the firſt ſenſe mentioned: He does not mean, that he had perfectly kept the whole law of MOSES, in its greateſt extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. For (1) it is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Chriſtians, that that law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the law of nature, as well as the law of ceremonies, and carnal ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: In which latitude, our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expounds it. (2) St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſays expreſsly, in his epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that all, <hi>Jews</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles, have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi> that all the world is become guilty before God; and that every mouth muſt be ſtopped. In which places he cannot be ſuppoſed to ſpeak excluſively of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. (3) We divers times find him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the ſins which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, while he was in his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate; particularly that of perſecuting the church
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:007488_0143_102B90803B18E030"/>
of Chriſt. (4) If he had been perfect in this ſenſe, he could not have undervalued ſuch a righteouſneſs, or needed any other. For a perfect righteouſneſs is undoubtedly ſufficient for any man: And the language of the law itſelf is, "That the man that doth theſe things, ſhall live in them." From theſe conſiderations, not to mention any more, it is evident that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by his having been <hi>blameleſs touching the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is in the law,</hi> could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that he had perfectly obeyed the law in its utmoſt latitude and rigor.</p>
            <p>IT remains, therefore, that he is to be underſtood either in the ſecond or third ſenſe mentioned: i. e. That he had been blameleſs and perfect, as other good men under the law, were ſaid to be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome deviations from it: Or that he had, with the greateſt punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, obſerved the ritual part of it, as contradiſtinguiſhed from the moral. Let us conſider, which of theſe things he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. And that he is to be underſtood in the laſt mentioned ſenſe, will, I think, appear very probable at leaſt, from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT does not appear from St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s ſtory, as we have it in the new teſtament, that he was really a good man, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to his converſion to the faith of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:007488_0144_102B9081C70378A0"/>

Chriſt; or that he had any righteouſneſs beſides that which was proper to his ſect, as a <hi>Phariſee.</hi> And how much this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs conſiſted in outward formalities, and ceremonious uſages: how little of good morality went into the compoſition of a <hi>Phariſee'</hi>s righteouſneſs; how far it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell ſhort of that ſincere piety and undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled virtue, which was eſſential to a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous character, even under the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> no one can be ignorant, who has read the <hi>goſpel,</hi> with due attention. That which our Saviour terms, <hi>The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſcribes and Phariſees,</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it real ſanctity of heart and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſuch as good men under the law were the ſubjects of. If it had, he would not ſurely have told us, that except our righteouſneſs <hi>exceeds</hi> it, we cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven: For it will not, I preſume, be doubted but that all truly pious and holy men, whether under the legal or evangelical diſpenſation, ſhall not actually be admitted into that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hereafter. How does it appear, that the Apoſtle was a better man than thoſe of his ſect generally were; who, as is plain from our Saviour's account of them, were not only imperfect, as the beſt men are in this world; but deſtitute of that righteouſneſs which is attainable; and of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:007488_0145_102B908376018020"/>
which many good men under the law were actually the ſubjects? It is not very eaſy to reconcile the ſuppoſition of <hi>Saul'</hi>s being a good man, with the known fact of his being ſo bitter a perſecutor of the church; and his continuing to breath out threatenings and ſlaughter againſt it, for ſo long a time together. To deſire to do the will of God, is eſſential to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a good man: And our Saviour had ſaid, That <q>if any man would do his will, he ſhould know of his doctrine whether it were of God, or whether he ſpake of himſelf.</q> Can it eaſily be ſuppoſed, then, that <hi>Soul,</hi> had he been really a good and upright man, could have been, for ſo long a time, under a miſtake in this matter; and been ſo outrageouſly zealous as he was, to extirpate the religion of Chriſt? I will not abſolutely deny the poſſibility of this; but yet think it is very improbable. Beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems, in ſome of his epiſtles, to attribute his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a good man, to his becoming a diſciple of Chriſt; particularly where he ſays, that it was "the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, that had made him free from the law of ſin and death." Now if his converſion from ſin to God, was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with his converſion from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> (which is probable

from the account he gives of himſelf) it follows, that by the righteouſneſs which is in the law, he muſt mean only that external, <hi>phariſaical</hi> righteouſneſs before-mentioned; not that internal and ſanctity, of which good men were the ſubjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>moſaic</hi> diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>IT will perhaps be objected, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares he verily tho't with himſelf that he ought to do thoſe things which he did, contrary to the name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> that he had lived, before his becoming a Chriſtian, in all good conſcience towards God: And that this ſuppoſes him to have been a righteous man, in the qualified ſenſe of ſcripture, antecedently to his converſion to the faith of Chriſt. However this ſeems not to be concluſive and ſatisfactory: For there are doubtleſs many wicked men who act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly, eſpecially in the buſineſs of perſecution, when their heads are heated with religious, party-diſputes, and their hearts burn with a falſe zeal. Men may act conſcientiouſly, for the time, in things of this nature, and indeed in almoſt all others; and yet not be truly good and virtuous. When our Saviour tells his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that <q>the time would come, when whoſoever killed them, would <hi>think that he did God ſervice;</hi>
               </q> I ſuppoſe none
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:007488_0147_102B9087CE33AA78"/>
imagine that he means good and virtuous men would do thus, merely becauſe they are ſuppoſed to act conſcientiouſly towards God, thinking they do ſervice to him. No; The obvious ſenſe is, that men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth, would be ſo infatuated, ſo blinded with bigotry, and enmity againſt the goſpel, that they would perſecute even to death, the preachers and profeſſors of it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without pity and remorſe, but even with a firm perſwaſion that they were diſcharging their duty to God; i. e. with a good conſcience towards Him. It is not therefore implied in what the Apoſtle ſays of himſelf, that he had been a truly right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, good man. It does not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, or naturally, amount to any thing more than this, all circumſtances being conſidered; <abbr>viz.</abbr> That he had been zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the religion he profeſſed; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious obſerver of the law, as interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and that when he was embruing his hands in the blood of the innocent, he was ſo far from doing what he knew to be ſinful, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the dictates of a miſtaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. All which is rather an evidence, that the light within him was then dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that he was depraved to great degree, than that he was really the pious
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:007488_0148_102B84A451B93B40"/>
man, and <hi>ſtrict moraliſt,</hi> which ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to have been.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT the Apoſtle is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as aſſerting that he had been a careful obſerver of the moral part of the law, appears from hence. He is here arguing againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> and evidently ſpeaks of the righteouſneſs which is in the law, according to the notions and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations thereof, which generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed amongſt them: He reaſons with them, or rather againſt them, upon their own principles, in order to confute them the more effectually. And is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the new teſtament, that the righteouſneſs which the <hi>Jews</hi> of this time, eſpecially the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> laid the greateſt ſtreſs upon, and chiefly gloried in, was a mere ceremonious, or ritual righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? a righteouſneſs, which had little or no concern with their hearts and morals? This was evidently the caſe. And it is much the moſt natural ſuppoſition, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here uſes theſe terms, [the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs which is in the Law] in the <hi>jewiſh</hi> ſenſe of them; intending ſuch a righteouſneſs thereby, as theſe words would have ſignified in the mouth of a common <hi>Phariſee.</hi> It was not directly to his purpoſe, to uſe them in any higher, or more exalted ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:007488_0149_102B9089AE5A8FD8"/>
3. THIS is farther evident, <q>Becauſe he ſpeaks of ſuch a righteouſneſs as was reckoned matter of <hi>confidence in the fleſh;</hi> which is his way of deſcribing the poſitive part of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> law, which was of a carnal nature, related to, and affected the fleſh; whereas the moral righteouſneſs therein required was not <hi>fleſhly;</hi> nor is it, that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ever ſpoken of as ſuch.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. <hi>Peirce'</hi>s notes <hi>in Loc.</hi> How much, or how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I have been beholden to this learned Commentator, in other parts of this diſcourſe, where I have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned him, may be eaſily ſeen by thoſe who think it worth while.—</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. THE particular things which the Apoſtle enumerates in this paſſage, as giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him greater reaſon of confidence and boaſting, than many others could pretend to, are all relative to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>moſaic</hi> oeconomy;—his lineal deſcent from <hi>Abraham, circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. He does not ſo much as hint at any particular branch of true moral righteouſneſs, which he could juſtly lay claim to, unleſs his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting zeal can be looked upon as ſuch. Now if the Apoſtle had really intended to repreſent himſelf as a pious, virtuous man, antecedently to his becoming a Chriſtian, can it be ſuppoſed that he would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced only in his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> privileges, and
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:007488_0150_102B908B38E66BE8"/>
things of a ceremonious, external nature? Is it not much more natural to ſuppoſe, that he would, in this caſe, have inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the great and important precepts of the moral Law, which he had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved? He certainly knew, at the time of his writing this epiſtle, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did before, that the keeping of theſe latter commandments, was much more commendable, and acceptable in the ſight of God, than the things of which he ſpeaks; but yet wholly omits them. This is, I think, a plain demonſtration, that by his having been blameleſs touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteouſneſs which is in the law, he means no more, than that he had kept the ceremonial law with the utmoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and exactneſs; ſo as to ſtand, in that reſpect, at leaſt upon an equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any of his countrymen.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IF by the righteouſneſs that is in the law, the Apoſtle had intended the moral purity and good works required thereby; it is not ſuppoſeable that he would have ſpoken of it, in the verſes immediately following, in ſuch ſtrong terms of contempt as he does; ſaying that he counted it <hi>loſs</hi> and <hi>dung.</hi> Indeed he often ſpeaks, in other places, of the moſt compleat righteouſneſs of the beſt men, as imperfect; as attended with ſome faults and failings; and therefore
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:007488_0151_102B908DA63A77F0"/>
inſufficient to juſtify them before God, according to the rigor of law: But this is a very different thing, from ſtyling ſuch a righteouſneſs <hi>loſs</hi> and <hi>dung:</hi> Nor do the ſcriptures any where authoriſe our ſpeaking of the moral virtues of good men in ſuch contemptuous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. This is inconſiſtent with the whole ſpirit, and the conſtant language of ſcripture; wherein the moral virtues of good men are always mentioned with honor, and the higheſt epithets of commendation. But if we ſuppoſe the Apoſtle intends only thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and that ceremonious righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein the <hi>Phariſees</hi> chiefly truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any reference to the <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters of the law;</hi> it will be eaſy to account for his ſpeaking of ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the manner he does. This righteouſneſs, not containing in it any thing truly good, but conſiſting merely in the <hi>form of godlineſs</hi> without the <hi>power,</hi> might be fitly enough compared to <hi>dung,</hi> or to <hi>filthy rags;</hi> and renounced as a worthleſs thing. But to ſpeak in ſuch reproachful language of the moral virtues, which conſiſt ſummarily in the love of God and man, and an imitation of the divine perfections; is, in itſelf ſo abſurd, and approaches ſo near to profanity and
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:007488_0152_102B908FE3AB2A20"/>
blaſphemy, that I cannot think ſo wiſe and good a man as St. <hi>Paul</hi> could ever be guilty of it. He always ſpeaks in quite a different ſtrain concerning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the moral part of the law; tho', as was ſaid before, he aſſerts that no man has ſo exactly and perfectly obeyed the law, as to be juſtified thereby; and therefore admoniſhes us to rely upon the grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, as revealed in the Goſpel, for acceptance with him.</p>
            <p>FOR the ſeveral reaſons mentioned, I think we may conclude, with a good degree of certainty, that when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declares he had been "blameleſs touching the righteouſneſs that is in the law", his meaning is not, that he had been ſinleſs; nor even that he had been a ſtrict obſerver of the moral part of the law, ſo far as is conſiſtent with common human frailty: But only, that he had been righteous in the <hi>phariſaical</hi> ſenſe of the word; that he was poſſeſſed of the righteouſneſs which that ſect truſted in; which gave them confidence in the fleſh; and which conſiſted almoſt wholly in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain external privileges, and ceremonious uſages; as appears fully from the new-teſtament, particularly from the following paſſages—"The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and all the Jews except they waſh their hands eat
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:007488_0153_102B90916B882270"/>
not—And many other things there be, which they have received to hold; as the waſhing of cups and pots, and brazen veſſels and tables"—"Woe unto you, Scribes and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> hypocrites; for ye tythe mint and aniſe and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the law"—"Ye make clean the out-ſide of the cup and the platter; but within are full of extortion and exceſs—Ye are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whited ſepulchres, which indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear beautiful outward; but are within full of dead mens bones and all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Even ſo ye appear righteous unto men; but within ye are full of hypocriſy and iniquity"—"Ye make void the law of God thro' your traditions."—Theſe paſſages give you a true Idea of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion chiefly in vogue, in the days of our Saviour and his Apoſtles; I mean a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the ſect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that <hi>ſtrait ſect,</hi> to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays he belonged. And this is manifeſtly the righteouſneſs which this Apoſtle intends in the paſſage we are conſidering; which he calls <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in the law;</hi> and <hi>his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> This is that righteouſneſs which he once depended upon, accounting it <hi>gain</hi> to him; and which he afterwards renounced, accounting it no better than
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:007488_0154_102B9093555699C8"/>
               <hi>loſs</hi> and <hi>dung,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> Nor can there well be a greater perverſion of his meaning, and true deſign, than to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as ſpeaking in this manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that real holineſs and moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by which men are made like to the bleſſed God himſelf.</p>
            <p>LET me make one ſhort reflection here before I proceed any further. Since it is plain that the Apoſtle, by <hi>his own righteouſneſs,</hi> which he renounces in ſuch ſtrong terms of contempt, means only his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> priviledges, and an external <hi>phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> righteouſneſs; this ſhows the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of applying what is here ſaid to the virtues and good works of Chriſtians; of thoſe Perſons who live under the Goſpel-diſpenſation, and practically conform themſelves to it. Such perſons, are often told, that they muſt have no dependence upon <hi>their own righteouſneſs,</hi> their virtues and good works; that this righteouſneſs, is no better than <hi>dung,</hi> &amp;c. And all this looſe, irrational kind of talk, is pretended to be grounded upon, and ſupported by, the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> particularly in the paſſage now under conſideration. Whereas it is very manifeſt, that this great Apoſtle had not the leaſt reference to the good works of Chriſtians; nor even to
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:007488_0155_102B909590BF00A8"/>
the moral duties required by the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but only to that ſuperficial, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious righteouſneſs, in which the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> were wont to truſt and to glory; a righteouſneſs altogether different from, and inferior to, that which is intended by thoſe, who ſo zealouſly warn us not to have any dependence upon our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt's commandments; ſo total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from it, that no argument can be drawn from one to the other. And how well ſoever thoſe may mean, who apply what the Apoſtle ſays concerning his own righteouſneſs, while he was a perſecuting <hi>Phariſee,</hi> to evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it is demonſtrable that they groſly wreſt his meaning; and inſtil very falſe and pernicious notions of religion into the minds of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed: Having ſeen what the apoſtle here intends by his <hi>own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> the righteouſneſs which is <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>of, the law;</hi> and which he diſclaims as being of little or no value; let us now inquire what it is which he oppoſes thereto; and in which he truſts and triumphs.</p>
            <p>NOW he tells us, that he deſpiſed his own former righteouſneſs; and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as loſs and dung, for [or in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of] <hi>the excellency of the knowledge of
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:007488_0156_102B909824DA5380"/>
Chriſt Jeſus his Lord:—that he might win Chriſt, and be found in him—having the righteouſneſs which is thro' the faith of Chriſt; the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith; that he might know him, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his death</hi>—The ſeveral things here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the Apoſtle oppoſes to his former righteouſneſs, while he was a <hi>Phariſee.</hi> Let us conſider them diſtinctly, that we may ſee, whether they do not compriſe in them obedience to the goſpel? and conſequently, whether the Apoſtle does not rather oppoſe his <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> which was of the <hi>law,</hi> to <hi>evangelical pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> than to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt <hi>imputed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt thing he mentions is, <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord.</hi> By which knowledge, if he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly intends nothing more than a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpeculative knowledge of Chriſt, and the goſpel-diſpenſation; yet this will make nothing againſt the worth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of evangelical obedience. But if, as it is moſt probable, he means what ſome call a practical experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt; or ſuch a knowledge as is productive of obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; then this is not only no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:007488_0157_102B9099ABC97900"/>
againſt, but a direct confirmation of, what has been ſaid upon this point. For the Apoſtle's ſenſe will then be, that he contemned his former, <hi>phariſaical</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as worthleſs, in compariſon of that real purity and ſanctity, of which thoſe are the ſubjects, who truly know Chriſt. And in this complex ſenſe, the knowledge of Chriſt is often to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the new teſtament: <hi>i. e.</hi> it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends both a ſpeculative knowledge of him, and a frame of mind, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal behaviour, conformable thereto. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Hereby do we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a Lyar and the truth is not in him.</hi> So it is ſaid to be <hi>life eternal, to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent.</hi> This muſt mean, to know God, and his only begotten Son, ſo as to love and ſerve them, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the goſpel requires us to do. For ſurely it is not <hi>life eternal</hi> to know God, if <hi>in works we deny him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle adds—<hi>That I may win Chriſt</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <q>St. <hi>Paul</hi> here carries on a very handſom and agreable allegory, in which all the metaphors are taken from traders or merchants—He ſeems here to conſider Chriſt, as the moſt important and valuable thing, which he was therefore ſollicitous to ſecure to himſelf.</q>—Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rce.</hi>
               </note>. His meaning is, that he might
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:007488_0158_102B909B8EB06BF8"/>
have Chriſt for his Saviour; that he might be intereſted in the redemption wrought out by him, in conformity to that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and to thoſe terms of acceptance with God, which the goſpel reveals. The expreſſion here uſed is ſo general and indeterminate, that no argument can be drawn from hence, either for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, what I am now more particularly endeavouring to ſhow.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle ſubjoins—<hi>and be found in him.</hi> The phraſe [being <hi>in Chriſt</hi>] is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a twofold ſenſe in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sometimes it intends no more than an outward profeſſion of his name and religion; or being a member of his viſible Church, which is his body. At other times it means being in him as his true diſciples and followers: and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by faith and ſincere obedience, in that ſalvation which he has purchaſed for all ſuch. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> explains it; "He that <hi>keepeth his commandments,</hi> dwelleth <hi>in him.</hi>" And St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf; [<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.] "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who <hi>walk not after the fleſh,</hi> but <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit.</hi>" Agreably hereto, it is ſaid in the <hi>apocalypſe,</hi> that bleſſed are the dead which die <hi>in the Lord</hi>—; for they reſt from their labours, and <hi>their works do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:007488_0159_102B909D6C764F18"/>
them.</hi>" From theſe ſeveral paſſages it appears, that to be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> in the moſt eminent and important ſenſe of the Phraſe, is to be intereſted in the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation which he has wrought out, by <hi>keeping his commandments;</hi> by <hi>walking after the ſpirit;</hi> or by doing thoſe good <hi>works,</hi> which are ſaid to <hi>follow</hi> the righteous into another world, when they depart out of this.</p>
            <p>NOW when the apoſtle expreſſes his ardent deſire, that he might be found <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> it ſeems moſt natural to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him in this latter ſenſe, i. e. as wiſhing to be found and acknowledged at laſt, as one of Chriſt's faithful ſervants; one of thoſe, to whom the great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of the goſpel are made. We can ſcarce ſuppoſe that he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſo great a ſollicitude as he here does, to be found in Chriſt, only by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and formal profeſſion of his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or by faith alone, as it is oppoſed to evangelical obedience. To be found in Chriſt in this ſenſe only, he certainly knew would avail him nothing at the laſt day. And if we underſtand him in the other, as we ought undoubtedly to do; ſurely there is nothing here which looks like diſparaging, or undervaluing, the virtues and good works of Chriſtians; or which
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:007488_0160_102B909EF3876BE8"/>
intimates that the Apoſtle diſclaimed all truſt and dependence upon his living in obedience to Chriſt's laws. His words imply the direct contrary: <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that he earneſtly deſired to be a faithful and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient ſervant of Chriſt, as the only way of obtaining ſalvation by him.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle goes on—<hi>Not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the law; but that which is thro' the faith of Chriſt; the righteouſneſs of God by faith.</hi> What he means by his own righteouſneſs, which was of the law; has been particularly ſhown above; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and his ſtrict adherence to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial part of the law, according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> So that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry now is only, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends by the righteouſneſs which is <hi>thro' the faith of Chriſt,</hi> the righteouſneſs which is <hi>of God by faith;</hi> and which he oppoſes to that righteouſneſs of the law, on which he had formerly relied.</p>
            <p>NOW by this he may poſſibly mean, that real holineſs of heart and manners, which is the genuine effect of faith, of faith in Chriſt, and in God thro' him. Agreable to this interpretation, we read of faith that <hi>worketh by love,</hi> that <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world,</hi> and the like. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical righteouſneſs, or that holineſs,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:007488_0161_102B90A12B0FF4D0"/>
the root and principle of which is faith; as it might be properly enough termed the righteouſneſs which is thro' the faith of Chriſt, or the righteouſneſs of God by faith; ſo it might, with equal propriety, be oppoſed to <hi>Jewiſh</hi> priviledges, and an external, <hi>phariſaical</hi> conformity to the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this righteouſneſs might be ſaid to be <hi>of God,</hi> in contradiſtinction to the other, either becauſe it is that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which He has preſcribed and required, and promiſed to accept; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is attained by grace and help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Him. And if we underſtand the Apoſtle thus, as many do, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome appearance of reaſon; this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage will ſurely make directly againſt thoſe, whoſe practice it is to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> obedience; and to repreſent it as being of no efficacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards procuring Acceptance with God, and eternal life. Nor does this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation render the obedience and atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt needleſs; for it is only thro' him, that our imperfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is accepted and rewarded.</p>
            <p>However, there is another interpretation, which ſeems rather more agreable to the doctrine and language of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in other places; and which is, I think, to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accordingly. By <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> here, I
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:007488_0162_102B90A31863C640"/>
underſtand not any holineſs or good works of men; any obedience which Chriſtians perform; but pardoning mercy, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and juſtification, with God; as the ſame word is ſometimes uſed.<note n="‡" place="bottom">In this ſenſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in particular, ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to uſe this term. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21,—26. <hi>But now the righteouſneſs of God without the law is manifeſted, being witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the law and the prophets; even the righteouſneſs of God which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> &amp;c.</note> Of ſuch pardoning mercy, or juſtification unto life, we become the objects, by faith in Chriſt, or by the goſpel of Chriſt, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the law. For it is elſe-where ſaid, that <hi>by the deeds of the law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified;</hi> becauſe <hi>all have ſinned.</hi> God has graciouſly ordained another way, in which tranſgreſſors may be accepted and juſtified of him; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> thro' faith in his Son, who is the propitiation for Sin. And the mercy of God thus revealed to ſinners in the Goſpel, is here called <hi>His righteouſneſs thro' faith.</hi> And God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſinners in this way, is what the Apoſtle elſe-where expreſſes by his<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot but juſt obſerve here, that the ſcripture teaches no ſuch doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that of God's <hi>imputing the perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt to ſinners for juſtification.</hi> If we have recourſe to <hi>Romans</hi> 4th, where the <hi>imputation of righteouſneſs</hi> is mentioned; and which is, I think, the principal paſſage, on which the Advocates for this doctrine build, it is very evident that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of righteouſneſs</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>marking of iniquity;</hi> and ſignifies the ſame thing preciſely, with <hi>forgiving iniquity; covering ſin;</hi> or <hi>not imputing ſin.</hi> For thus it is that <hi>David</hi> is there introduced as <hi>deſcribing</hi> the bleſſedneſs of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works, ſaying, <q>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered: bleſſed is that man unto whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</q> I would not be underſtood to mean, that it is not in conſideration of Chriſt's becoming <hi>obedient unto death,</hi> that thoſe who believe, are pardon'd, accepted, and treated of God as tho' they were righteous: For this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the doctrine of the Goſpel; and is, I ſuppoſe, what is intended when it is ſaid, That "by the obedience of One, many ſhall be made righteous." (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19.) Poſſibly ſome who ſpeak of Chriſt's righteouſneſs as being <hi>imputed</hi> to us, may intend no more hereby than what is expreſſed above:—with whom I have the happineſs to agree, except as to the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this way of <hi>expreſſing</hi> the matter. This, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is a miſapplication of the ſcripture phraſe, <hi>imputing righteouſneſs;</hi> and almoſt unavoidably leads many people into a miſapprehenſion of the ſcripture-doctrine of our pardon and acceptance with God, thro' what our Redeemer has done and ſuffered for us.</note>

righteouſneſs</hi> without works; and his <hi>counting faith for righteouſneſs.</hi> But then it is to be particularly obſerved, that tho' faith is here, and in other places, oppoſed to the works and righteouſneſs of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> law, properly ſo called; yet it is not oppoſed to evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as if it was by believing in Chriſt, excluſively of ſubmitting to his will and commandments, that we are accepted with God, and intitled to eternal life. For throughout the new teſtament, when the bleſſings of pardon, acceptance with God, and eternal life, are annexed to
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:007488_0164_102B90A6D2D65B70"/>
faith; faith either means the goſpel-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in general, as oppoſed to the <hi>moſaic,</hi> or elſe it is to be taken in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex ſenſe, and intends both believing the goſpel, and an hearty ſubmiſſion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereto. Nor can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtood, without making the ſcripture contradict itſelf; as will appear more particularly in the two following diſcourſes, concerning <hi>juſtification by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole, the ſenſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here, where he expreſſes his deſire to be <hi>found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſs; but that which is thro' the faith of Chriſt; the righteouſneſs of God by faith;</hi> may be taken in the following para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe: <hi>q. d.</hi> "It was, and ſtill is, my great concern to be found a true diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt; intereſted in the mercy of God thro' him, and intitled to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation purchaſed by him:—Not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my privileges as a <hi>Jew;</hi> nor deſiring to appear in that legal ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous righteouſneſs, of which I once tho't ſo highly; but relying wholly upon the pardoning mercy and goodneſs of God; which He has now clearly revealed and promiſed to thoſe who believe in his Son, and obey his Goſpel, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi>" This I take to be the true ſenſe and ſpirit of St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s words.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:007488_0165_102B90A909D38C78"/>
And if it is, it is perfectly conſiſtent with all that has been ſaid in the preceeding diſcourſes, concerning the neceſſity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical holineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT the Apoſtle goes on—<hi>That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection, ver.</hi> 10. the former part. It is needleſs to add any thing here, concerning what the Apoſtle means by <hi>knowing</hi> Chriſt; this being no more, in effect, than a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he had ſaid before, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord.</hi> But what does he intend by <hi>knowing the Power of Chriſt's reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> This may be explained by ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages as theſe: That Chriſt was <hi>raiſed for our Juſtification;</hi> that God has <hi>begotten us unto a lively hope by his reſurrection from the dead;</hi> and, that <hi>every one that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. The reſurrection of Chriſt is the great argument, by which the truth of the goſpel is eſtabliſhed:—that goſpel, which is the baſis of all our hopes; the charter of all our privileges as Chriſtians; of our pardon, and title to eternal life. And the reſurrection of Chriſt being conſidered in this light; and in connexion with his ſubſequent exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to glory, <hi>to appear in the preſence of God for us;</hi> has a natural tendency to quicken us in running the race of piety
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:007488_0166_102B90AA94A57238"/>
and virtue ſet before us; to raiſe us from the death of ſin, to newneſs of life; and to exalt our tho'ts, to thoſe things that are above, <hi>where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Sentiments of this kind fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occur in the new teſtament. And when the apoſtle expreſſes his deſire to know the power of Chriſt's reſurrection, the obvious ſenſe thereof is, that he might experience the full and proper efficacy of this great doctrine upon his own heart, in the confirmation of his faith in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine promiſes; in the elevation of his hopes above this world, and fixing them on things unſeen and eternal; and ſo in inſpiring him with zeal and fortitude and patience in doing the will of his riſen and aſcended maſter:—So that this is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Apoſtle's making little or no account of perſonal righteouſneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; but an evident proof of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>ST. <hi>Paul</hi> ſubjoins—<hi>And the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death.</hi> The ſenſe in general, may be this: The Apoſtle, we know, lived in times of great trial and perſecution, being <hi>in jeopardy every hour,</hi> and <hi>dying daily.</hi> And his deſire was, that, in all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and tribulations, he might ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner that Chriſt did, in the ſame
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:007488_0167_102B90AC4A0B0F68"/>
glorious cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs, and with the like patience and reſolution; that ſo he might have a ſort of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowſhip and participation with him in his ſufferings, and even in death, as well as in life, be conformed to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maſter. A paſſage in his epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> may, perhaps, illuſtrate his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here—"Therefore, ſays he, I endure all things for the Elects ſake, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may obtain the ſalvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus, with eternal glory. It is a faithful ſaying; if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him: If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign, with him." Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hereto, he tells the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. ver. 24.</note> "That he now rejoiced in his ſufferings for them, and filled up what was behind of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Chriſt, in his own fleſh."—</p>
            <p>BUT thoſe words, <hi>being made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his death,</hi> will bear another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The Apoſtle's meaning may be, that he might <hi>die unto ſin.</hi> Which interpretation is countenanced by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages of ſcripture; particularly <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 6 ver. 4, and onwards. And becauſe this paſſage may poſſibly be the beſt comment, both upon theſe words, and thoſe preceeding, concerning the <hi>power of Chriſt's reſurrection,</hi> I ſhall beg leave to give it at large—"Therefore we
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:007488_0168_102B90AF3A0A2780"/>
are buried with him by baptiſm into death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death: we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. For he that is dead, is freed from ſin. Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him. For in that he died, he died unto ſin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewiſe reckon ye alſo yourſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin; but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof."</p>
            <p>THUS I have endeavoured to explain this paſſage of Scripture, wherein the Apoſtle, renouncing his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was of the law, as inſufficient to juſtify him, and give him a title to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, betakes himſelf to the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy and grace of God, revealed in
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:007488_0169_102B90B0C5E53378"/>
the Goſpel of his Son, thro' faith. And I think it appears that thoſe who apply it to the controverſy amongſt Chriſtians at this day, concerning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith and works, as if it favoured the <hi>modern notion</hi> of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thro' the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed to us, and received by faith alone, intirely miſtake the ſcope, and true ſpirit of the paſſage. It relates to an old diſpute betwixt the unchriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized <hi>Jews,</hi> who boaſted of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and depended upon an external, ceremonious righteouſneſs; and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, who aſſerted the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſuch a righteouſneſs, and the neceſſity of having recourſe to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy of God, as revealed to Sinners thro' his Son. And that which the apoſtle here expreſſes ſo ardent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after, is neither more nor leſs than this, that he might be, both in faith and practice, a Chriſtian, in order to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intitled to the divine acceptance, and life eternal. It is a groſs perverting of ſcripture, to interpret this paſſage, as if the Apoſtle had been ſpeaking of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> in the <hi>modern</hi> ſenſe of thoſe terms, oppoſing one of them to the other; and repreſenting the former, excluſively of the latter, as what intitles us to the Salvation purchaſed by
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:007488_0170_102B90B24F498748"/>
Chriſt. Nothing could well be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from his true deſign; or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the general tenor of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It may be added, that giving this turn to the paſſage has a natural and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to make Chriſtians leſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and circumſpect, leſs careful to live up to their profeſſion, than they ought to be.</p>
            <p>ALAS! could ſorrow enter the manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the bleſſed, how would it affect this holy Apoſtle to ſee his doctrine abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the encouraging of Vice and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, to the deſtruction of thoſe ſouls, for which Chriſt died! We cannot be ignorant how ſollicitous he was, while he was fulfilling the miniſtry which he had received of the Lord, that Chriſtians ſhould adorn their lives with a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becoming their high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus; and how much he was grieved when he ſaw any contradict their profeſſion by their behaviour. In this very epiſtle, yea in this very chapter, a part of which we have been conſidering, he has left us a proof hereof. "Many walk, ſays he, of whom I have told you oft, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:007488_0171_102B90B4D3FD8DC0"/>
ſhame; who mind earthly things." Nor was he leſs careful to live piouſly and virtuouſly himſelf, leſt he ſhould fall ſhort of ſalvation at laſt, than he was to inculcate the practice of religion upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Both his manner of preaching, and his manner of living, with the great motive of it, may be judged of by the following paſſage in his firſt epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>—"Know ye not that they which run in a race, run all; but one receiveth the prize: So run that ye may obtain. And every one that ſtriveth for the maſtery, is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo run, not as uncertainly; ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I myſelf ſhould be a caſt-away." This, ſurely, is not the language of One, who thought his Salvation ſecured by faith in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Another, without holineſs, and perſeverance therein to the end. But it is the language of One, who looked upon his future well-being, as ſuſpended on the condition of his being righteous himſelf, and <hi>continuing patient in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:007488_0172_102B90B6E0C79DE8"/>
IF it ſhould be objected, that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine leads men to <hi>truſt to their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> I anſwer it is very reaſonable they ſhould do ſo, in one ſenſe; and the holy ſcriptures ſufficiently warrant it. God has aſſured us, on one hand, that the <hi>unrighteous ſhall not inherit His kingdom;</hi> and on the other, that the <hi>righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Certainly then good men may ſo far truſt to their own righteouſneſs, as to believe it will be available with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, thro' the Mediator; ſo as to procure eternal life for them. Thus far to truſt thereto, is not to be <hi>ſelf-righteous,</hi> in the bad ſenſe of the term; nor to put a greater value upon our ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that God himſelf is pleaſed to put upon it in his Word. And thus far it is evident St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf truſted to his own righteouſneſs, <hi>which was of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> when he ſaid, "I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; Hence forward there is laid up for me a crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day."</p>
            <p>INDEED, ſince we cannot be <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God,</hi> it is manifeſt that we cannot <hi>merit</hi> any good from him. This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, not only for ſuch imperfect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:007488_0173_102B90B917853D80"/>
creatures as we are; but for thoſe of the higheſt and moſt perfect order. The very notion of <hi>merit</hi> with regard to God, is a groſs abſurdity and contradiction. It proceeds from a fooliſh imagination, that the ſervices of his creatures are, ſome way or other, really beneficial and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him. If we conceive thus, it is very natural then to think, that we may make Him our debtor; and merit ſomething of him in return. But, to uſe the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> "Who hath firſt given unto him; and it ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced to him again? For of him, and thro' him, and to him are all things." Whenever we come to have juſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, and of ourſelves, and of the relation in which we ſtand towards Him; when we conſider Him as a Being abſolutely independent and ſelf-ſufficient, whoſe goodneſs alone prompted him to give us exiſtence at firſt; and who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns us, not for his own ſake, but only that we may be happy in loving him, and doing his will; theſe ſentiments will effectually root out all that pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of heart, from whence the notion of <hi>merit</hi> ſprings. We ſhall then be fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that we are with relation to Him, <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> even tho' we ſhould <hi>do all thoſe things that are required of us;</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:007488_0174_102B90BAA3C3E628"/>
and conſequently, that we are indebted to his goodneſs, bounty, and free grace, for all the happineſs we receive from Him, whether in this world or another.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="unknown:007488_0176_102B90BF503429B0"/>
notwithſtanding all theſe Things, I ſay, it is very hard to convince ſome people, that they cannot be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God thro' Chriſt, upon other and eaſier terms than ſuch expreſſions ſeem, at firſt view, to imply in them.</p>
            <p>IN the two laſt diſcourſes, I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and endeavoured to refute, two miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notions reſpecting this important point; which notions are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a miſconſtruction of thoſe expreſſions of ſcripture, that we are <hi>ſaved by grace;</hi> and, that we muſt be <hi>found in Chriſt, not having our own righteouſneſs.</hi>—</p>
            <p>THERE is another ſcripture-expreſſion, which has not been leſs abuſed, to ſerve the cauſe of licentiouſneſs, than either of the former. The expreſſion I intend, is that which occurs divers times in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That we are <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith.</hi> This ſeems to have been the <hi>ſheet-anchor,</hi> with many: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall examine the <hi>weight</hi> of it the more carefully, in this and the enſuing, diſcourſe: not doubting but it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too light for their purpoſe. The doctrine of the goſpel undoubtedly is, that we are <hi>juſtified by faith;</hi> but it is a great miſtake to infer from hence, that we are accepted to the divine favour, and entitled to eternal life, without unfeigned
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:007488_0177_102B90C0D89DBA30"/>
repentance, and new obedience. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever notions we may entertain of <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> it is ſtill evident that every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Sinner, every one who hears the word, and does it not, is the object of God's wrath; and cannot become an heir of eternal life, but by being <hi>made free from ſin,</hi> and <hi>having his fruit unto holineſs.</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may amuſe themſelves with <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> as long as they pleaſe; and aſcribe their juſtification to whatever they will: But after all, the ſcripture is plain, that every wicked man is out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's favour; and muſt continue ſo, till he ceaſes to do evil, and learns to do well.</p>
            <p>BUT in order to my ſpeaking with as little ambiguity as may be, upon the point before us; and to prevent miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I would premiſe a few things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of juſtification. A ſhort account hereof, will open the way for what is to follow, concerning the manner in which, and the terms upon which, we are juſtified before God.</p>
            <p>THAT which is intended by juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the new teſtament, may be better underſtood by a brief deſcription, than by any formal definition of the thing.</p>
            <p>NOW evangelical juſtification may be conſidered with relation to the Author of it; who is almighty God. For, ſays the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:007488_0178_102B90C260D21598"/>
apoſtle, "It is God that juſtifieth." And if we conſider it under the notion of an<note n="*" place="bottom">Tho' we ſometimes ſpeak of juſtification as an <hi>Act</hi> of God; yet it can hardly be conceived of as any thing really diſtinct from his written word, or the gracious promiſes and declarations of the goſpel. The terms upon which we are accepted to favour, pardoned and juſtified, are already laid down in the holy Scriptures: So that thoſe who comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, are juſtified of courſe, upon ſuch compliance. Theſe terms are ſtable and fixed; ſo that every one who comes up thereto, is intitled to the mercy revealed; thoſe who do not, are ſtill under condemnation. There is nothing arbitary, or capricious, in the juſtification of one, and the condemnation of another. But God juſtifies one, and condemns another, by, and in his word; according as men do, or do not comply with his will there made known.

                  </gap> juſtified, but whom the Goſpel juſtifies. We do not, ſurely, imagine that there is any ſentence of abſolution, or juſtification, formally pronounced in heaven, when a man is juſtified; tho' we ſometimes expreſs ourſelves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. No: God's ſentence of abſolution, or juſtification, is in his revealed word; not any thing diſtinct from, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of, what he has there declared; but this is the very thing itſelf. There is no <hi>Act</hi> of juſtification to be conceived of, either as prior, or ſubſequent to, or different from, the goſpel-declarations of mercy. In them it is that we have our pardon and juſtification. God is to be conſidered as ſpeaking to us in his word, and as pronouncing the ſentence which <hi>that</hi> pronounces, whether of pardon and life or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and death: Which ſentence will be ratified, be put into execution, and will fully take effect, in the judgment of the great day. To ſay a man is juſtified, or that he is under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, expreſſes the relation in which he ſtands to God's word and law: The former means, that he is One, to whom the gracious promiſes of the goſpel belong; the latter, that he is One, againſt whom a curſe is denounced.

grace and favour, in contradiſtinction from his juſtice: For, ſays the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> we are "juſtified freely by his grace." The truth, and the ground, of which aſſertion will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider juſtification with regard to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it; or who it is that is juſtified; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> a tranſgreſſor of the law of God, or a ſinner: For ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> "God juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the ungodly." All having ſinned, juſtification muſt neceſſarily be of grace, entirely unmerited. God juſtifies no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under the notion of his being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or perfectly righteous, whether <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently</hi> or <hi>imputatively.</hi> Nor would the juſtification of ſuch a one, be an act of grace; it would be only an act of juſtice.</p>
            <p>IF we conſider evangelical juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with relation to the great Mediator; it is his purchaſe, the fruit and effect of his Death. In other words, He, by what he has done and ſuffered for us, has laid the foundation for our being juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; according to God's appointment, and the oeconomy of the goſpel. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it ſaid, that we are juſtified by the grace of God, <hi>thro' the redemption that is in Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

LET us for the further illuſtration of the ſcripture notion of juſtification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what benefits are implied therein; and what privileges accrue to the ſubjects of it. Now that which is primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hereby is, pardon, impunity, or exemption from the puniſhment due to ſin, according to the law of God. That this is the firſt and moſt proper notion of evangelical juſtification, appears from the account and deſcription which the apoſtle gives of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5,—"To him that—believeth on Him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Even as <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works; ſaying, Bleſſed are they whoſe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered; bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord will not impute ſin." From this paſſage it is obvious, that to <hi>juſtify,</hi> to <hi>impute righteouſneſs</hi> without works, to <hi>forgive iniquity,</hi> to <hi>cover ſin,</hi> and <hi>not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſin,</hi> are expreſſions nearly ſynonimous, ſignifying in general the very ſame thing, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the remiſſion of the penalty denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the violators of God's law: So that juſtification is primarily, and moſt properly oppoſed to the marking and puniſhing of iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="unknown:007488_0181_102B90C8AB49F090"/>
HOWEVER this is not the whole of what is implied in evangelical juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not a mere negative; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves in it, poſitive bleſſings, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous privileges. For example; he that is juſtified, becomes, at the ſame time, an object of God's peculiar love; and, from a ſtate of enmity, comes into a ſtate of peace and reconciliation with Him. Thus the apoſtle tells us, that "being juſtified—we have <hi>peace</hi> with God, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." And the perſon thus juſtified is, according to the gracious promiſes and declarations of the goſpel, entitled both to God's peculiar care and guardianſhip in this world, and to glory in the other. He is accounted innocent and righteous, when abſolved from his ſins, in his Juſtification; and acquires thereby a right to happineſs, as tho' he had never tranſgreſſed. There is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>no condemnation belonging to him</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>THIS, in brief, is the ſcripture notion and idea of juſtification. Perhaps the term may be ſometimes uſed in the new teſtament, in a more lax, vague, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate ſenſe, ſo as to be applicable, as holineſs is, to the whole collective body
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:007488_0182_102B90CAF7AEAB50"/>
of profeſſed Chriſtians. But whether it is ever thus uſed, or not, is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to the point in hand. For we are now ſpeaking only of ſuch a juſtification, as implies in it the forgiveneſs of ſins, the ſpecial favour and friendſhip of Heaven, and a ſure title to eternal happineſs; and conſequently ſuch a one, as is peculiar to ſome, not common to all, who profeſs the religion of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>AND the queſtion now before us is, How this juſtification accrues to us? What terms and conditions thoſe are, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is offered, and granted, to ſinners? Whether we are, in this ſenſe, juſtified only by faith, or believing, as faith is diſtinguiſhed from repentance, and newneſs of life? Or by faith, conſidered in a larger ſenſe, and as virtually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending ſuch repentance, and new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. It is acknowledged upon all hands, that many even of thoſe who hear the glad tydings of the goſpel, and have taken upon themſelves the Chriſtian name and character, are not the ſubjects of this juſtification. Many of them are, doubtleſs, as truly under condemnation, and as much the heirs of wrath, as if God had never revealed pardon and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a ſinful world. To what, then, is this diſtinction owing? In general it
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:007488_0183_102B90CC89CFDF10"/>
muſt be owing to this, that ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the terms, on which their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is ſuſpended, while others reject them: for the terms are the ſame to all. God does not act the part of a Sovereign here, in juſtifying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> man, and leaving another under condemnation. Tho' we have no right to preſcribe rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to Him; he has preſcribed them to Himſelf; and according to them he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably diſpenſes the bleſſings of the new covenant, without <hi>reſpect of perſons</hi>—Now that God has ſuſpended the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſinners, not upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith only, in the reſtrained ſenſe, mentioned above; but upon faith, conſidered as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of repentance from dead works, and of evangelical obedience<note n="*" place="bottom">When evangelical obedience is ſaid to be neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to evangelical juſtification; the meaning is not, that we muſt actually perform a great number of good works, ſuch as the goſpel requires, before we can be juſtified. True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance includes in it the principle of obedience; ſo that every ſincere penitent, is a good man, in the qualified ſenſe of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even before he <hi>brings forth fruits meet for repentance:</hi> And he is no ſooner ſuch, than he is pardoned and juſtified. It is not imagined, that after his heart is really turned from ſin to God, his juſtification is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſuſpended upon his making this manifeſt by his good works; or by a courſe of external o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the laws of Chriſt: Which notion involves thoſe who embrace it, in many difficulties.

Shall we ſay then, that ſuch a man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not juſtified, becauſe he has performed no works of goſpel obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? By no means. His repentance, and inward ſubmiſſion to the terms of the goſpel, virtually contain all the good works which the goſpel requires. In the ſight of God, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts of men, he had complied with the terms of mercy and ſalvation, according to their true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, altho' this was not manifeſted by his outward conduct. His willing and obedient heart, placed him in the claſs of thoſe, to whom the goſpel offers mercy and ſalvation, tho' he died before he had time, out of this <hi>good treaſure, to bring forth good things.</hi> And altho' he had lived ever ſo long after his being thus renewed in the ſpirit of his mind; yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that he would have been juſtified from that very time; and antecedently to his doing good works in the ſenſe of the goſpel. The promiſes being made to ſuch a <hi>temper,</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to ſuppoſe that his juſtification would have been ſuſpended upon the actual performance of thoſe works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which naturally flow therefrom, whenever there is opportunity for it. Beſides; if the actual performance of good works, is neceſſary to juſtification; it may reaſonably be inquired, how many good works are neceſſary to that end? and how long a Man muſt live, after he is inwardly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, in order to yield ſuch an outward obedience to his commandments, without which he cannot be juſtified? Theſe queſtions, for the ſubſtance of them, have often been aſked; but never anſwered to the ſatisfaction of impartial, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced men. They are, indeed, unanſwerable; and the bare propoſing of them, is ſufficient to ſhow, that They go upon a wrong hypotheſis, who ſuppoſe that any acts of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obedience are the ground of our juſtification, or neceſſary in order there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> That obedience to the goſpel, to which the promiſes of forgiveneſs and eternal life are made, is an hearty belief, and inward ſubmiſſion to the terms, of it; ſuch a ſubmiſſion thereto, at will, whenever there is opportunity and ſcope for it, be accompanied with a correſponding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of life. And this is all the obedience, for the neceſſity of which, in order to juſtification. I argue in this, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe. Poſſibly ſome, who aſcribe our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to faith alone, may comprehend under the term faith, all that godly ſorrow, and internal ſubmiſſion to the terms of the goſpel, which others intend when they aſſert the neceſſity of obedience, and deny the ſufficiency of faith to juſtify. In this caſe, there is indeed a contradiction in words, but the real ſenſe of the parties is the ſame.</note>; I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make manifeſt by ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:007488_0184_102B90CF18C4BE78"/>
BUT there is a vulgar prejudice, which I would beg leave briefly to obviate, here. Thoſe who aſſert the neceſſity of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience in order to juſtification,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:007488_0185_102B90D0A1F9C8D0"/>
are often accuſed of holding, that good works are meritorious; and accordingly they are ranked with the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in this reſpect. Than which conduct of their adverſaries, there cannot well be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more invidious, diſingenuous and abuſive. We conſtantly diſclaim the doctrine of merit. We aſſert that Chriſt, by what he has done and ſuffered, has procured mercy, juſtification, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life for us: Altho' we think that we cannot be juſtified, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the new covenant, but by faith in, and ſubmiſſion to, our bleſſed Redeemer. And even after we have obeyed the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we account it great grace in God to accept us, and to beſtow eternal Life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Is this to teach that obedience and good works merit juſtification! Let us ſee how eaſily this charge might be retorted upon thoſe that bring it. Faith, or believing, is as much <hi>our act,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:007488_0186_102B90D22B292220"/>
done by us, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 28, 29.</note> Now when they aſſert that faith is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to juſtification, and that this alone juſtifies, they attribute as much merit to faith, as we aſcribe to obedience in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Their faith is put into, and holds, the ſame place in this affair of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with our obedience to the goſpel. How meritorious with them, is that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle act of obedience, <hi>believing in Him whom God hath ſent!</hi> No; they will doubtleſs tell us, that they do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faith as what merits juſtification; but only ſuppoſe, that, according to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel covenant of grace, the juſtification which Chriſt has purchaſed, is annexed to believing; that they are juſtified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of what He has done and ſuffered, not upon account of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent worth and merit of faith. Very well: This ſufficiently vindicates them from the imputation of making that one act, <hi>believing,</hi> meritorious of juſtification and eternal life. And in the ſame way do we clear ourſelves of the charge of making <hi>obedience</hi> to the goſpel, meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It is only ſubſtituting the word o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the room of ſaith, thus: <q>We do not conſider obedience as what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:007488_0187_102B90D46B33E020"/>
juſtification; but only ſuppoſe, that, according to the goſpel covenant of grace, the juſtification which Chriſt has purchaſed, is annexed to obeying him. We are juſtified upon account of what He has done and ſuffered for us; not upon account of the inherent worth and merit of our obedience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>PUTTING the matter in this light, and thus turning the tables, does, I think, ſhow, that we are as far from making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in general, meritorious, as they who tax us therewith, are from making their faith ſo. For to that faith, to that one act of obedience, they aſcribe all the efficacy in the matter of juſtification, which we aſcribe to faith and obedience conjunctly. And altho', in ſome of them, the bringing of ſuch an invidious charge againſt their brethren, may be charitably imputed to ignorance; yet, in others, it is but too evident that it proceeds from ſomething elſe.—</p>
            <p>HAVING thus premiſed what ſeemed to be needful, I proceed now more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to what was intended; <hi>namely,</hi> to ſhow, That juſtification, in that ſenſe of the term, which has been explained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, accrues to ſinners, not by faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered excluſively of, and in diſtinction from, repentance and evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:007488_0188_102B90D6A0DFFC30"/>
but by faith, conſidered in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſenſe, and as really comprehending ſuch repentance and obedience in it. In the proſecution of which deſign, I ſhall do theſe two things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Give ſome general account of thoſe paſſages of ſcripture, where faith, may ſeem, at firſt view, to be oppoſed to obedience: and to be made, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of it, the term or condition of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, on our part: And I ſhall ſhow that there is no real <hi>neceſſity</hi> of putting ſuch a conſtruction upon them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fairly capable of another. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhow poſitively, by various arguments, that they <hi>cannot poſſibly</hi> be underſtood in ſuch a ſenſe, in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable <hi>conſiſtency</hi> with the general doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the new teſtament: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that when we are ſaid to be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith, faith is not oppoſed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical obedience; but is conſidered as including it, and the great principle of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to give ſome general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe paſſages of ſcripture, where faith may ſeem, at firſt view, to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to obedience; and to be made, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of it, the term or condition of juſtification, on our part: And to ſhow, that there is no real <hi>neceſſity</hi> of putting
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:007488_0189_102B90D881D7E4B0"/>
ſuch a conſtruction upon them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fairly capable of another. It will not be expected that I ſhould conſider all the paſſages here referred to: I ſhall therefore ſelect only a few of the principal of them; thoſe upon which the greateſt ſtreſs has been laid; which are in the epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And if a fair and natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given of them, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the <hi>ſolifidian</hi> doctrine, this will be a clue to the underſtanding of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either exactly parallel, or ſimilar, to them.</p>
            <p>WE may begin with that of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in his epiſtle to the <hi>Romans: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law.</hi> [Chap. 3. ver. 28.] Are not faith and obedience here diſtinguiſhed from each other? And is not juſtification expreſly attributed to the former, excluſively of the latter? I anſwer, that by <hi>the law</hi> is often intended the <hi>jewiſh</hi> diſpenſation, the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and by <hi>faith,</hi> the diſpenſation of Grace by Jeſus Chriſt. And if we underſtand the terms thus in this place, the ſuppoſed difficulty intirely vaniſhes. For then the meaning of the apoſtle will be no more than this, That a man is juſtified by the goſpel, or in the method of the goſpel, even without obſerving the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:007488_0190_102B90DAB0EB4120"/>
whether he be <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> cannot be juſtified by <hi>the law,</hi> which they have violated; but muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Chriſt, who is the end thereof for juſtification: And the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may, in this way, attain to juſtification altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the law. So that both of them are upon one and the ſame footing, with relation to the divine acceptance. It is the goſpel of God's grace alone, which can juſtify either of them; and in this method, one may be juſtified as well as the other. Now as <hi>the law,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> meaning thereby the <hi>moſaic,</hi> and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical diſpenſation, are frequently oppoſed the one to the other in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this interpretation is not unnatural; and indeed it is favoured by what imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows,—<hi>Is he the God of the Jews only? is be not alſo of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles alſo. Seeing it is one God, which ſhall juſtify the circumciſion by faith, and the uncircumciſion thro' faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE proceeding context alſo favours this interpretation. The Apoſtle had been ſhowing at large, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had tranſgreſſed the law of nature; and the <hi>Jews,</hi> the revealed law of God, the law given by <hi>Moſes.</hi> From whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, [<hi>ver.</hi> 19 and 20] that all the world, <hi>Jews</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:007488_0191_102B90DC936D3888"/>
become <hi>guilty before God;</hi> and ſo could not plead a legal righteouſneſs for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. In the three following verſes St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of that gracious proviſion, which God had made in the goſpel, for all ſinners in common, whether under the <hi>moſaic</hi> law, or the law of nature; <hi>for there is no difference.</hi> By faith, by the goſpel, or ſubmiſſion thereto, all ſinners may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to juſtification. The three next ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes contain a more particular account of the method in which this juſtification ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to ſinners; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> by <hi>the grace of God, thro' the redemption that is in Chriſt; whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation,</hi> &amp;c. In the next verſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> triumphs over the boaſting, ſelf-righteous <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe dependence, for juſtification, was not upon the Mercy of God in Chriſt, but upon their legal works,—<hi>Where is boaſting then,</hi> ſays he? <hi>It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</hi> As if he had ſaid, what becomes then of that glorying, to which the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſo much addicted? It is entirely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and the very foundation of it deſtroyed. How is this done? by the law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> No: but all boaſting is effectually excluded by the law of faith; by the evangelical method of juſtification; which ſuppoſes that the ſubjects of it are
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:007488_0192_102B90DE6EC2FE38"/>
tranſgreſſors; and which muſt therefore be of grace. The words which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to explain, immediately follow; and they are an inference drawn from what had been ſaid above; or rather the ſum of it, expreſſed in a few words—<hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Since therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> have ſinned as well as the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſince <hi>every mouth muſt be ſtopped;</hi> and all men be condemned, by law; and ſince God has revealed a gracious method of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him by Chriſt, making no difference betwixt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſince theſe things are ſo, we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that how much ſoever the <hi>Jews</hi> may boaſt of their <hi>own righteouſneſs, which is of the law,</hi> and deſpiſe the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet they neither are, nor can be juſtified, by their obedience to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (it being imperfect) but muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the law of faith, to the Goſpel of God's grace in Chriſt Jeſus: And in this way, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may attain to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification as well as they; even tho' they do not obſerve the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor have any thing to do with it.</p>
            <p>NOW ſuppoſing this to be the true, as it is not an unnatural, interpretation of the paſſage; it makes nothing in favour
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:007488_0193_102B90E04E9F8BA8"/>
of the doctrine of juſtification by faith, in the <hi>modern ſenſe</hi> of the term <hi>faith;</hi> or as faith is oppoſed to evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The amount of it is only this, that juſtification cannot come by the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but only by a compliance with the goſpel; by believing it, and heartily ſubmitting to it.</p>
            <p>BUT it has been obſerved, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here ſpeaks of the <hi>deeds</hi> OF LAW, without the <hi>article:</hi> From whence ſome have argued, that he does not mean par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>moſaic</hi> diſpenſation; but law in general, law abſolutely taken: And if ſo, it is ſaid, that faith is here oppoſed no leſs to evangelical works, than to the deeds of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> law: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that believing juſtifies us, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of obedience of any kind.</p>
            <p>NOW tho' the <hi>Article</hi> is both uſed and omitted in the new-teſtament, in ſuch a manner, that no ſtreſs can be laid upon a criticiſm of this ſort; yet I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about that point here. We will, if you pleaſe, take if for granted, that, by <hi>law,</hi> the Apoſtle intends not particularly the <hi>moſaic</hi> diſpenſation; but law in the moſt abſolute, unlimited ſenſe. Let us ſee to what his words will amount upon this ſuppoſition. And I think they will come nearly to the ſame thing, as to the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:007488_0194_102B90E275D069B8"/>
particular point now before us. For then St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s ſenſe will be this: That all men having tranſgreſſed the law they were reſpectively under; the <hi>Jews,</hi> the revealed law of God, and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the law of nature; it is impoſſible that any ſhould attain to juſtification in a way ſtrictly legal. For in order to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>deeds of law,</hi> of any law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is neceſſary that thoſe deeds ſhould be exactly conformable to that law. And no mans deeds having been thus conformable to law, it is impoſſible that either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> that any man whatever, ſhould be juſtified in that way. It is neceſſary that grace and mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, in order to the juſtification of a tranſgreſſor. But tho' we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the deeds of law, in the ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expreſſed; it does not follow that we are juſtified by faith or believing <hi>only,</hi> as faith is diſtinguiſhed from repentance and newneſs of life. Nor is there any neceſſity of ſuppoſing that the apoſtle here uſes the term faith in that reſtrained ſenſe. Altho' we ſhould ſuppoſe that faith is here uſed as comprehenſive of evangelical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, when we are ſaid to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby; this would not be inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with what is immediately added,—<hi>without the deeds of law.</hi> There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:007488_0195_102B90E45A5B7B78"/>
in ſaying that we are juſtified by faith, including ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt in our idea of faith; and ſaying, at the ſame time, that we are not juſtified by the <hi>deeds of law:</hi> For the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is only ſaying, in other words, that we are not juſtified by a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or by works exactly conformable to law. In ſhort, tho' faith is here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>deeds of law,</hi> it is not oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repentance, and evangelical holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but only to ſuch a righteouſneſs as would juſtify a man in the eye and ſenſe of law; and ſo be inconſiſtent with grace in the Law-giver.</p>
            <p>WHETHER, therefore, the Apoſtle is ſpeaking only of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of law in the moſt unlimited, abſolute ſenſe; it comes exactly to the ſame thing, as to the point now in queſtion. Upon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſuppoſitions is there any need of underſtanding him as oppoſing faith, to the obedience of faith, or to goſpel holineſs; but only to the deeds of law, in <hi>that ſenſe</hi> wherein he uſes theſe terms: Which ſenſe is manifeſtly this, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> works exactly correſponding to the demands of law, whether that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or that of <hi>nature.</hi> In this ſenſe, it is indeed evident, that no man is juſtified by the deeds of law; becauſe, as the apoſtle obſerves, <hi>all
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:007488_0196_102B90E642D85CF0"/>
have ſinned.</hi> But it may be ſtill true that we are juſtified by our obedience to the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT I will go one ſtep further here, by way of conceſſion; and allow, for the preſent, that the Apoſtle oppoſes faith, not only to a <hi>legal righteouſneſs,</hi> but even to all <hi>external acts</hi> of <hi>evangelical obedience.</hi> And even this ſuppoſition will not mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the leaſt degree, againſt any thing I have ſaid; or favour the common <hi>ſolifidian</hi> doctrine. Acts of external obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or good works, moſt properly ſo called, are ſuch as proceed from an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and good heart; from a righteous principle within. It is the <hi>good tree</hi> only, that bringeth forth <hi>good fruit;</hi> and it is only a <hi>good man,</hi> out of the <hi>good treaſure in his heart,</hi> that bringeth forth <hi>good things.</hi> An holy principle within, is conſidered in ſcripture as <hi>prior</hi> to good works; the latter being the exertions and operations of the former. And, as was ſaid in the former part of this diſcourſe, a man is juſtified in the ſenſe of the goſpel, and in the ſight of God, <hi>aſſoon</hi> as he is poſſeſſed of this good principle; and, therefore, <hi>antecedently</hi> to his doing any of thoſe good works, which flow from it: Yea, he is juſtified, tho' he ſhould not live to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any good works at all. So that it
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:007488_0197_102B90E82071DCC8"/>
may be allowed, conſiſtently enough with what has been ſaid, that the apoſtle here oppoſes faith, to all <hi>external acts</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in general; whether of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to law, or to the goſpel. But yet it will not follow, that he oppoſes it to a principle of goodneſs and holineſs in the heart; the neceſſity of which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order to our juſtification in the ſight of God, is all that I am arguing for. Tho' this principle, wherever it is, will be actually, and always, productive of an obedient life, provided there is time and ſcope given for it to exert itſelf. So that none can be poſſeſſed thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe, whoſe external conduct is agreeable to the precepts of Chriſtianity.—According to this laſt explanation of the apoſtle's words, faith is conſidered as <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>radically,</hi> containing evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience; not as ſomething diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from it: And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not here teach the doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, <hi>in the modern ſenſe;</hi> but the contrary.</p>
            <p>IT appears, if I miſtake not, from what has been ſaid above, that there is no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of underſtanding the apoſtle, in this place as oppoſing faith to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the way that many interpret him; or as aſſerting that we are juſtified
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:007488_0198_102B90EA061D9510"/>
by faith excluſively of obedience. His words will fairly admit of a different ſenſe; which is ſufficient to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THE next paſſage I ſhall conſider, wherein faith and obedience may ſeem to be oppoſed to each other, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, <hi>&amp;c.—But Iſrael which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righteouſneſs? Wherefore? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought it not by faith; but as it were by the works of the law.</hi> This paſſage coincides ſo nearly, in ſenſe and deſign, with that which we have been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the leſs needs to be ſaid upon it. By <hi>Iſrael's following after the law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> is intended the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work out, or to perform, ſuch a righteouſneſs, as would, of itſelf and in its own nature, be ſufficient to juſtify them in the ſight of God. They hoped to be juſtified merely by a ſtrict adherence to, and obſervation of the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> However, in the language of the apoſtle, they did not <hi>attain to the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: i. e.</hi> they did not attain to that juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification unto life, which they were in purſuit of; but failed in the attempt. <hi>Wherefore?</hi> How does it come to paſs, that they did not attain to juſtification? This queſtion the apoſtle anſwers in the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:007488_0199_102B90EC6FB14E08"/>
next words. It was becauſe they ſought to be juſtified in an improper manner; in a way wherein it is impoſſible that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould be juſtified; neglecting that method which God had pointed out. It was <hi>becauſe they ſought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law:</hi> or, by <hi>works of law;</hi> (for the <hi>article</hi> is here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.) The plain meaning is, that the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> of this corrupt age, had rejected the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> inſtead of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to him, and ſeeking juſtification and eternal life, by him: They imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they were to be juſtified merely by obedience to law; and that they ſtood in no need of the grace of the goſpel. For which reaſon, they did not attain to juſtification; it being impoſſible that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhould come by law, unleſs where there is a <hi>perfect</hi> conformity thereto. It is manifeſt, that law, not tempered and relaxed by grace, muſt condemn all thoſe that fall ſhort of the perfection required by it. So that the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence was upon their own legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, could not, in the nature of the thing, be juſtified in this way. Whereas <hi>the Gentiles</hi> (as the apoſtle obſerves in the preceeding verſe) <hi>which followed not after righteouſneſs, attained to righteouſneſs, even the righteouſneſs which is of faith: i. e.</hi> The
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:007488_0200_102B90EDF83DDB90"/>
               <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who did not pretend to work out ſuch a righteouſneſs as would entitle them to juſtification in the eye of law; obtained juſtification notwithſtanding; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that, juſtification which God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the goſpel, thro' faith.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſurely no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that faith and evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are here oppoſed to each other; as if righteouſneſs, or <hi>juſtification,</hi> came by the former, and not by the latter. Faith is only oppoſed to an imaginary, legal righteouſneſs; ſuch a one as the <hi>Jews</hi> truſted to, deſpiſing and rejecting the grace of the goſpel. And this paſſage will receive farther illuſtration from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the 10th Chap. of the ſame epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ver. 3 and 4. The apoſtle ſays, that the <hi>Jews, being ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God For Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the end of the law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every one that believeth.</hi> The ſenſe is:—Altho' the <hi>moſaic</hi> diſpenſation was never deſigned for a law, in the exact obſervation of which, the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be accepted and juſtified of God; but had a typical reference to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> thro' whom, in a way of grace, juſtification comes; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> being ignorant of
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:007488_0201_102B90F0472D47C0"/>
this method of juſtification thro' grace, which God has ordained for ſinners; having perverted the law, which had <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> from its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal meaning and true deſign; and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempting to work out ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as would render the intervening of grace needleſs; ſuch a one, as might give them a title to juſtification upon the footing of mere law; the <hi>Jews</hi> having thus miſtaken the matter, have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, but oppoſed, that method of juſtification which God has ordained and revealed, thro' faith. For Chriſt is typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and prefigured in the law itſelf, as the end of it, for juſtification, to all thoſe who believe in, and ſubject themſelves to Him.—Is there any neceſſity of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the apoſtle here oppoſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, to obeying his goſpel? It is plain, that he oppoſes believing, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the conduct of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who went about <hi>to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs;</hi> i. e. who expected to be juſtified upon the footing of mere law; not being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they fell ſo ſhort of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs required therein, as to ſtand in need of the grace of the Goſpel; and who, therefore, rejected the promiſed Saviour. This paſſage is, I think, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly parallel to that, conſidered above.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:007488_0202_102B90F214381DF0"/>
And in both of them, the term <hi>faith</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a complex ſenſe, for believing in Chriſt, and ſincerely obeying his goſpel; not in the reſtrained ſenſe of ſome <hi>modern</hi> divines; as if our juſtification were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the former, excluſively of the latter: For which notion there is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the new-teſtament.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER paſſage of ſcripture, where faith and obedience may ſeem to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one to the other, is <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved thro' faith; (and that not of yourſelves; it is the gift of God) not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Thoſe words [and that not of yourſelves; it is the gift of God] are incidental in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's diſcourſe; and the ſenſe of them has been much controverted. And ſince it is not neceſſary that the meaning of them ſhould be aſcertained, in order to a reſolution of the particular point now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, I ſhall paſs them over at preſent, and conſider the paſſage independently of them. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved thro' faith—not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> "Does not the apoſtle (as ſome argue) here plainly oppoſe goſpel faith, and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel obedience to each other? Does he not aſcribe our juſtification wholly to the former; and deny that the latter is any cauſe or ground thereof? Is it not upon
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:007488_0203_102B90F3D4047B30"/>
this foundation that he ſays, our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of grace? And does he not intimate, that if works, or obedience, came in here, there would be ſome cauſe of <hi>boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Whereas, if we are juſtified ſolely by faith, or believing, there will be no room left for men to glory: All boaſting will then be excluded." To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p>1ſt. THAT the apoſtle is not here ſpeaking particularly concerning our juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; but concerning our ſalvation in general: "By grace are ye <hi>ſaved.</hi>"</p>
            <p>2dly. EVEN thoſe who aſſert the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of juſtification by faith only, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to evangelical obedience, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hold the neceſſity of works, or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in order to ſalvation: (a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vanity of which will be ſhown in the next diſcourſe) So that, this paſſage either proves nothing to their purpoſe; or it proves too much; and more than they are willing to allow, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we are not only juſtified, but ſaved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works.</p>
            <p>3dly. IF it had been the apoſtle's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to exclude every thing done by man, from being any occaſion, ground or condition, of his Acceptance with God; (that ſo all cauſe of boaſting might be taken away) he muſt then have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:007488_0204_102B90F674F88C00"/>
faith alſo: For believing is our own act; and expreſly called a <hi>work,</hi> by our Saviour, as has been obſerved before. Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, on the contrary, that we are <hi>ſaved by grace thro' faith.</hi> I would, if poſſible, expreſs what I here intend, ſo us not to be miſunderſtood. It is ſaid by ſome, that if our juſtification and acceptance with God, depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our obeying the Goſpel; upon any thing we do, be it what it will; then we ſhould be juſtified, not by grace, but by <hi>works;</hi> and conſequently there would be room left for <hi>boaſting,</hi> which is not to be allowed. Well then, believing in Chriſt is our own act; it is our work, tho' not done without the divine Aſſiſtance. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this, muſt therefore be excluded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent argument, leſt ſome ground of boaſting ſhould remain. Faith is as much excluded, by the preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, from having any hand in our juſtification, as obedience in any other reſpect. For whether our juſtification depend upon <hi>one</hi> act of obedience, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> believing; or whether it depends upon <hi>many,</hi> there is ſtill cauſe of boaſting, if this way of reaſoning be juſt. We may therefore conclude, that this method of arguing is not good; becauſe it proves too much; and even makes the apoſtle
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:007488_0205_102B90F856E7F7C8"/>
contradict himſelf; for, tho' he diſallows of boaſting, yet he aſſerts that our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is connected with ſomething which we do.—</p>
            <p>4thly. ALL occaſion of boaſting ſeems to be taken away, if we exclude works from being any meritorious cauſe of our juſtification and ſalvation; even tho' they are not excluded from being the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. If we acknowledge our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is very imperfect, ſo that we cannot be juſtified upon the footing of mere law; if we acknowledge, that we cannot claim Salvation as our due, by virtue of any works of righteouſneſs which we have done; if we acknowledge ourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for it to the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt; this, ſurely, leaves no room for boaſting; tho' we may ſtill very conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently hold, that our juſtification is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon our hearty ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, and ſincere obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. The aſſerting of this is not contradicting what the apoſtle ſays, that we are not ſaved by <hi>works;</hi> but perfectly conſiſtent therewith. He intends no more, than that we are not ſaved upon the footing of mere law; by ſuch works as would exclude grace; and leave room for boaſting. And his meaning, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, might be expreſſed thus,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:007488_0206_102B90FA29E6CE80"/>
more at large. "Take heed, that ye do not exalt yourſelves, or over-rate your own works, to the diſhonoring and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of the grace of God: For it is by His grace and free bounty, that you are ſaved; not in the way of obedience to law, conſidered as a covenant of works; but in the way of faith, which is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro' Chriſt, to the tranſgreſſors of Law. You are not ſaved by works, or by a legal obedience; or on account of the intrinſick value and merit of any thing you do. You have not obeyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny law of works ſo perfectly, that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becomes your due. And of this I admoniſh you, leſt any man ſhould proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſt; or think more highly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his works than he ought to do, to the diſhonor of divine grace."</p>
            <p>THIS appears to me to be the true ſenſe of the Apoſtle. And if it is, the paſſage does not favour the doctrine of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith alone, in the <hi>modern ſenſe</hi> of the terms: But is perfectly conſiſtent with the contrary ſcheme; wherein obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the goſpel is ſuppoſed neceſſary in order to our acceptance with God. There is a wide difference betwixt ſaying, that we are juſtified and ſaved by works, merely upon the footing of law; (which is what the Apoſtle denies) and ſaying,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:007488_0207_102B90FC138F4F18"/>
that we are juſtified and ſaved, by believing in, and ſubmitting to Him that was <hi>the End of the law for righteouſneſs;</hi> and who has redeemed us from the curſe thereof: (Which is what he denies not.) The former is, indeed, to ſubvert the grace of the goſpel, and to leave room for boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the latter does neither; but duly exalts the grace of God; and leads us to <hi>think ſoberly of ourſelves, as we ought to think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is hoped, that what has been ſaid upon theſe ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture, may ſerve in ſome meaſure for the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of others, which ſpeak of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by faith, and not by works. Tho' I do not pretend, as yet, to have proved any thing more, than that theſe paſſages do not eſtabliſh the doctrine which they are commonly alledged in ſupport of. And this, certainly, they do not; becauſe they fairly admit of another conſtruction, than that which is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. If I have ſhown, that there is no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſuppoſing, that the ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters intended, in theſe paſſages, which ſpeak of faith and works, to oppoſe faith to evangelical obedience; this was all that I propoſed to do, at preſent. In my next diſcourſe, I ſhall ſhow, that they cannot poſſibly be underſtood thus,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:007488_0208_102B90FE527B3B50"/>
in any tolerable conſiſtency with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral doctrine of Scripture; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that when we are ſaid to be juſtified by <hi>Faith,</hi> the term <hi>faith</hi> is uſed in ſuch a latitude, as to involve in it that obedience to the goſpel, the neceſſity of which was to be made evident.</p>

            <head>SERMON VIII. Of Juſtification by Faith.</head>
            <epigraph>

               <q>
                  <hi>LAY apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a very obvious inference from this paſſage of Scripture, That in order to the Salvation of our Souls, it is neceſſary we ſhould be <hi>doers of the word,</hi> as well as <hi>hearers</hi> and believers of it; and that they who expect to be ſaved upon any other terms, delude, and impoſe upon, themſelves. However, there is great reaſon to fear, that many perſons do actually thus <hi>deceive their own ſelves,</hi> in a matter of the laſt importance; fondly imagining, from what
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:007488_0210_102B9101BA5FD900"/>
the ſcripture ſays concerning our being <hi>ſaved by grace;</hi> being <hi>found in Chriſt, not having our own righteouſneſs;</hi> and being <hi>juſtified by faith;</hi> that obedience to the goſpel, is not an indiſpenſable condition of our obtaining eternal life. I have therefore, in ſeveral diſcourſes, been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>undeceive</hi> thoſe, who may have thus <hi>deceived themſelves;</hi> and to guard others againſt the like fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
            <p>IN my laſt diſcourſe, I entered upon a conſideration of thoſe paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein our juſtification with God, is ſaid to be <hi>by faith;</hi> by faith <hi>without works; without the deeds of law,</hi> and the like. From whence many have conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that obedience to the Goſpel was not neceſſary in order to our being juſtified; but that faith alone, (in the <hi>modern</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe of the term, as it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from repentance and newneſs of life) is available thereto. It has been ſhown that there is no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the paſſages intended, in this ſenſe; and that a fair and intelligible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count may be given of them, without having recourſe to the modern <hi>ſolifidian</hi> doctrine. There is no need of ſuppoſing, that when the apoſtles oppoſe faith and works to each other, aſſerting that we
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:007488_0211_102B9103EFE3E340"/>
are juſtified by the former excluſively of the latter, they intended to oppoſe faith, to repentance and evangelical obedience. No more <hi>may</hi> be intended by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, than that we are not juſtified upon the footing of mere law; but by the grace of God revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed now, as was propoſed in the SECOND Place, to ſhow, That the paſſages of ſcripture, which ſpeak of our being <hi>juſtified by faith without the deeds of law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cannot poſſibly</hi> mean, That we are juſtified by faith, as diſtinguiſhed from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and new obedience, in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable conſiſtency with the general doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of ſcripture: And that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to underſtand the term faith, in ſuch paſſages, in a larger ſenſe; as comprehending repentance and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience in it; not as contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed therefrom.</p>
            <p>To make which point evident, I muſt juſt remind you of what was ſaid, in the foregoing diſcourſe, concerning the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-notion of juſtification, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and privileges included in it, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects us, ſinful creatures. Juſtification, as was there premiſed, involves in it, the remiſſion of ſins, the acceptance of our perſons to the favour and friendſhip of God, and a title to eternal life in the
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:007488_0212_102B9105D270EAB0"/>
kingdom of heaven. This is the idea which the holy ſcriptures give us of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.<note n="†" place="margin">Vid. Serm. 7. page 172, 173, 174.</note> And I deſire that this may be kept in mind; otherwiſe the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will not be fully underſtood.</p>
            <p>NOW, That <hi>faith,</hi> when we are ſaid to be juſtified thereby, <hi>without the deeds of law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cannot</hi> mean faith, excluſively of repentance and obedience; but <hi>muſt</hi> intend faith, conſidered as the principle of evangelical holineſs, and as virtually comprehending it, will appear from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>I. WHATSOEVER is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the forgiveneſs of ſins, is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to juſtification; becauſe the pardon of ſin is a principal part of our juſtification. It is a manifeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to ſay, that we can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied without that which is neceſſary to our forgiveneſs, if forgiveneſs is includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the idea of juſtification. This would be, in effect, to ſay, that we are juſtified without, and independently of, that upon which our juſtification is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. Since juſtification before God, involves in it the paſſing by our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we cannot, certainly, become the ſubjects of it, till we have complied with thoſe terms, on which God has expreſly made our forgiveneſs with him to depend.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:007488_0213_102B910807F18DD8"/>
And if we look into the new-teſtament, we ſhall find, that God has ſuſpended our forgiveneſs with him, upon our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving thoſe that have injured us. "If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, ſays our Saviour, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive your treſpaſſes: But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your treſpaſſes." Since then, the forgiving of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is neceſſary to our forgiveneſs; it muſt be equally neceſſary in order to our juſtification; unleſs any will ſay, that we may be juſtified without being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given: i. e. in effect, be pardoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being pardoned. For it really comes to this, if pardon is included in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an eſſential part of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">That juſtification compriſes in it the pardon of ſin, was ſhown in the preceeding diſcourſe: Nor will this be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who are the moſt likely to deny the general doctrine here advanced: ſince juſtification is thus defined in the <hi>Aſſembly's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> God's free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our ſins, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>NOW ſince, at leaſt, <hi>that one</hi> chriſtian duty of forgiving an offending brother, is requiſite in order to our being forgiven ourſelves; and, conſequently, in order to our being juſtified; how can the faith, by which we are ſaid to be juſtified, be oppoſed to chriſtian obedience? or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood excluſively of it? Is it not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:007488_0214_102B910991AB6830"/>
contradiction to ſay, that we are juſtified by faith alone, in the <hi>modern</hi> ſenſe, by faith as diſtinguiſhed from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and yet to ſay, that our forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God (a primary and principal branch of our juſtification) is ſuſpended on the condition of forgiving our neighbour his treſpaſſes? There cannot well be a greater ſoleciſm, or repugnancy. We are therefore reduced to this neceſſity; to this dilemma: We muſt either deny, that our forgiveneſs is ſuſpended upon our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving others; (tho' our Saviour has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerted it) or elſe we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the faith, by which we are juſtified, involves obedience in it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being oppoſed thereto. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative is unavoidable; there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium in this caſe, if pardon is an eſſential part of juſtification; which is now taken for granted.</p>
            <p>THIS is ſufficient to ſhow in general, that the vulgar notion of juſtification by faith alone, cannot be true. It is at leaſt neceſſary, that we add to our faith, <hi>that one</hi> virtue of forgiving others their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes. And here I may aſk, Whether, ſince this one is required, in order to our being pardoned and juſtified, it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that all other chriſtian virtues are neceſſary to the ſame
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:007488_0215_102B910BD9EE9490"/>
end? What ground is there to imagine, that this one duty is made neceſſary, and that others, of equal importance, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary? Our Saviour's particularly mentioning and requiring this, does not exclude others; but it may be naturally inferred, that all other evangelical graces and virtues are neceſſary likewiſe: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince no good reaſon can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why our pardon and juſtification ſhould be ſuſpended upon this, rather than upon many other duties of Chriſtianity; ſuch as the love or fear of God, love and gratitude to our Saviour, and juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man. Indeed if there is ſuch a natural and neceſſary connection betwixt the ſeveral graces and virtues of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as ſome ſuppoſe; if he that is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of one, muſt needs be deſtitute of all; and if he that is poſſeſſed of one, muſt alſo be the ſubject of all; it follows, that they are all equally neceſſary to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and juſtification, or equally unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: So that the requiring of any one, is, in effect, the requiring of all; and if there is any one, which is not neceſſary, no other can be neceſſary. This is, indeed, only an argument <hi>ad hominem.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not certain, that there is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any ſuch neceſſary concatenation or connexion, betwixt the various graces
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:007488_0216_102B910E0FCFD230"/>
and virtues of Chriſtianity, I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it. But,</p>
            <p>2dly, THAT faith cannot be oppoſed to evangelical obedience, when we are ſaid to be juſtified thereby, appears from the ſcripture-doctrine of <hi>repentance.</hi> It will not, I ſuppoſe, be denied, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or the forgiveneſs of ſins, is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on our repentance. But becauſe thoſe, with whom I am concerned, can deny almoſt any thing, I ſhall prove this point before I deduce the conſequence intended. The few paſſages following may ſuffice—"Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."—"I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth; but that the wicked forſake his way and live"—"Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh."—"That repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name."—"Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out."—"Teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt."—"He that covereth his Sins ſhall not proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:007488_0217_102B910FEC5D7F88"/>
ſhall find mercy."—"If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs."—Theſe paſſages abundantly ſhow, that our forgiveneſs, pardon, or acceptance to the divine favour, depends upon our repenting of our ſins; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true penitent ſhall obtain mercy; and that all impenitent tranſgreſſors ſhall final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be condemned.</p>
            <p>NOW if repentance is really neceſſary in order to our obtaining pardon, it muſt be equally neceſſary in order to our being juſtified: Since, as has more than once been obſerved, our pardon is involved in our juſtification, and is an eſſential and principal part of it. It is impoſſible we ſhould be juſtified without that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is neceſſary to the pardon of our ſins: for this were to ſuppoſe, that juſtification is ſomething diſtinct from, and prior to, our forgiveneſs. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then, being neceſſary in order to our being pardoned; and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to our being juſtified; let us briefly conſider the ſcripture notion of repentance; and what is implied in it. Now it is manifeſt, that by repentance, the ſcripture intends, a turning from ſin to God, accompanied with humiliation and ſorrow for having offended Him. It
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:007488_0218_102B911173FCB740"/>
is a principle of holineſs and univerſal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; the beginning of a new life, devoted to God and his Service. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical repentance, therefore, compriſes in it, evangelical obedience: So that if the former be neceſſary in order to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and juſtification unto life, the latter muſt be ſo too. To ſay, that repentance is neceſſary, and yet to ſay that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of our ſins, and entering upon a courſe of obedience to God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (in which repentance conſiſts) is unneceſſary, is a plain contradiction.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe premiſes, the concluſion is very obvious to thoſe who will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, attend to it; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That we are not juſtified by faith alone, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of evangelical obedience; but by faith, conſidered as the beginning, and the great principle of it. Is there not a very manifeſt repugnancy betwixt theſe two propoſitions?—Repentance, which involves in it a turning from ſin to God, is neceſſary in order to our forgiveneſs and juſtification:—But yet faith alone, as diſtinguiſhed from repentance and new obedience, juſtifies us. He muſt have a head peculiarly turned for making ſubtile diſtinctions, that will undertake to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them. They are contradictory; and ſince the former of theſe propoſitions has
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:007488_0219_102B9113858548C8"/>
been proved true, the latter muſt, of courſe, be falſe.</p>
            <p>THE reaſoning under this head, may perhaps ſeem intricate and abſtruſe to ſome. But the argument, if I miſtake not, is ſtrictly concluſive. The ſum of it is this—Pardon being an eſſential part of our juſtification; and repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary in order to pardon, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt alſo be neceſſary in order to juſtification. And ſince repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves evangelical obedience in it, and is, indeed, the beginning of it; ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt alſo be neceſſary in order to our being juſtified. And therefore, when the ſcriptures ſpeak of our being juſtified by <hi>faith, faith</hi> cannot be oppoſed to <hi>obedience,</hi> in the <hi>modern</hi> way of interpretation; but muſt comprehend it. So that thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſcripture, ſo much inſiſted upon by the <hi>Solifidians,</hi> are not only capable of a different ſenſe from that which they put upon them; but there is an abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> of interpreting them otherwiſe. Indeed if the pardon of ſin is not an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of our juſtification; or if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not neceſſary in order to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; or, laſtly, if repentance does not involve in it a turning <hi>from dead works, to ſerve the living God;</hi> then the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed above, is inconcluſive; and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:007488_0220_102B911616E3DD00"/>
faith alone may juſtify. But if thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are true, as they evidently are, the <hi>modern</hi> notion of juſtification by faith alone, muſt be both falſe and futile: And the advocates for it, amuſe themſelves with the more found of words.</p>
            <p>3dly, WHATSOEVER is neceſſary, in order to our being at peace with God, and becoming the objects of his peculiar love and complacency, is neceſſary in order to our juſtification. But in order to our being at peace with God, and becoming the objects of his ſpecial love and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, it is neceſſary that we forſake our Sins, and obey the Goſpel: This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary in order to our juſtification. The two propoſitions from whence this concluſion is drawn, I ſhall briefly prove.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>former</hi> of them is, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary in order to our being at peace with God, and becoming the objects of his peculiar love and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, is neceſſary in order to our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: The proof of which is ſhort and eaſy. It is in our juſtification, that we commence the objects of the divine love, as expreſſed in the propoſition; neither before we are juſtified, nor afterwards; but at the ſame inſtant. And indeed our being thus reconciled to, and at peace with, our Maker, is not any thing really
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:007488_0221_102B9117A0143050"/>
diſtinct from our being juſtified; but one of the bleſſings or privileges implied therein. So that our becoming the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of God's ſpecial love, is not only cotemporary with our juſtification; but the former is involved in the latter, inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it, and an eſſential part of that compound idea. It is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuppoſe a man juſtified, without ſuppoſing him beloved of God; or <hi>vice versâ,</hi> beloved of God, and yet not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The ideas are coincident, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually imply each other: So that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is juſtified, is at peace with God, and the object of his complacency; and whoſoever is thus at peace with God, is juſtified of him. Now theſe ideas (or theſe things) being thus coincident, thus inſeparable, and thus mutually inferring and implying each other, it is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to ſuppoſe that any thing ſhould be requiſite in order to one, which is not equally requiſite in order to the other. To ſuppoſe that our being beloved of God, depends upon one condition, and our being juſtified, on another condition; is to ſuppoſe theſe things diſtinct, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from each other; which they are not, according to the ſcripture account of them. We are therefore, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to this account, obliged to own,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:007488_0222_102B911928EBFB90"/>
that whatſoever God has required of us in order to conciliate his ſpecial love and friendſhip, is equally required in order to our being juſtified of him. Certainly more cannot be neceſſary in order to the former, than is neceſſary in order to the latter: For if more were neceſſary, it would follow, that we might be juſtified without, and antecedently to our being in a ſtate of favour and friendſhip with God; which were a manifeſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>other</hi> propoſition to be proved, is, That, in order to our becoming the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of God's ſpecial love, it is neceſſary, that we forſake our ſins, and obey the goſpel: The proof of which is ſtill more plain and direct. For <hi>there is no peace,</hi> faith God, <hi>to the wicked.</hi> He has ſaid, that he is <hi>angry with the wicked every day; and that if they turn not he will whet his ſword</hi>—No one, in ſhort, can look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bible, without finding <hi>the wrath of God there revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all impenitent and unreformed Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. So far are perſons of this character from being the objects of God's ſpecial love and complacency! The doctrine of ſcripture, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> is, that ſo long as men perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:007488_0223_102B911B512FB050"/>
in their evil ways, they are at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, and abhorred of him; that they cannot be reconciled to Him, or He to them, without <hi>turning their feet into his teſtimonies.</hi> This is what the ſcripture, thro'out, repreſents to us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at peace with our offended Maker; and to our being beloved of him as his ſervants and children.</p>
            <p>THE concluſion follows of courſe, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that we cannot be juſtified without, or antecedently to, our thus turning unto God, and doing the will of our Father which is in Heaven. Becauſe, as was ſaid before, whatſoever is requiſite in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the former, muſt, in the nature of the thing, be equally neceſſary in order to the latter. Whenever the ſcripture ſpeaks of our being juſtified by <hi>faith,</hi> there is, therefore, a neceſſity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the term <hi>faith,</hi> in a complex ſenſe; not as it is contradiſtinguiſhed from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and obedience, but in ſuch a latitude as to include them. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there will be an irreconcileable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction betwixt thoſe paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many others: I now mean, more particularly, ſuch as make the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of our ſins, and the keeping of God's commandments, neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:007488_0224_102B911D2FFD81D8"/>
to our becoming the objects of his paternal love and favour. If this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it is abſurd, and even a plain contradiction to imagine, that we can be juſtified by <hi>faith only;</hi> underſtanding faith in the modern reſtrained ſenſe; and as it is oppoſed to goſpel-obedience.</p>
            <p>4thly, WHATSOEVER is neceſſary, according to the terms laid down in the goſpel, in order to our having a <hi>title</hi> to eternal life in the kingdom of heaven, is neceſſary in order to our being juſtified in this world. But in order to our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a title, it is neceſſary, that we repent of our ſins, and obey the goſpel: This is, therefore, neceſſary in order to our juſtification.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>former</hi> propoſition is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the goſpel makes neceſſary in order to our having a <hi>title</hi> to eternal life hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is neceſſary in order to our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here. The truth of which, can, I think, admit of no diſpute; it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the account already given of juſtification, and the bleſſings and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges implied in it. A title to eternal Life is involved in the ſcripture-idea of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and is an eſſential part of it. We can neither be juſtified without this title; nor have this title without being juſtified; they mutually infer and imply each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:007488_0225_102B911F6A374BF8"/>
and are inſeparable. So that it is a contradiction to ſuppoſe, that we are juſtified antecedently to our having a title to ſalvation; or upon any other, or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er terms, than thoſe to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of future bleſſedneſs is made. Aſſoon as a man is juſtified, or rather in his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, this title is given to him; and not before. While we keep to the true idea of juſtification, as it involves in it the promiſe of future glory, and a right, thro' grace, to the Heavenly inheritance; we cannot even make the ſuppoſition of our being juſtified on other terms than thoſe, on which eternal life is offered to us, without perceiving the ſelf-repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it. The ideas of juſtification, and of the title here intended, tho' different in ſome reſpects, are yet ſo far coincident, and have ſuch a connexion and mutual dependence, that we may eaſily ſee, that whatever God requires of us in order to our being entitled to Heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt alſo be required in order to our juſtification. For otherwiſe we might be juſtified without having the title mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>i. e.</hi> juſtified without ſomething, which is implied in the very notion of juſtification; which is a contradiction.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>other</hi> propoſition is, That in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our having a title to eternal life,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:007488_0226_102B9120F2E09110"/>
it is neceſſary that we repent of our ſins, and obey the goſpel. And agreably here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is ſaid, "Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have <hi>right</hi> to the tree of life." There are no promiſes of future glory and happineſs, made in the ſcriptures, to impenitent, perſevering tranſgreſſors. They are all made to thoſe who confeſs and forſake their ſins. The goſpel is ſo far from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any title to future glory, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent workers of iniquity, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly condemns them, and cuts them off from it. "Know ye not, ſays the apoſtle, that the the <hi>unrighteous</hi> ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators," &amp;c. It is ſaid, that God will render to them that "obey not the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, indignation and wrath; even upon every ſoul of man that doth evil." It is not, ſurely poſſible, that the ſame goſpel, which ſpeaks thus to, and of, the wicked and diſobedient, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to future woe and puniſhment, ſhould, at the ſame time, entitle them, by it's promiſes, to life everlaſting—Now ſince nothing is required of us, in order to our being entitled to eternal life, but what is equally required in order to our being juſtified; (as was ſhown above)
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:007488_0227_102B9123EE321C60"/>
and ſince, in order to our being entitled to eternal life, it is neceſſary that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our ſins and obey the goſpel, (as we have juſt now ſeen) it undoubtedly follows, that repentance and evangelical obedience are neceſſary in order to our being juſtified. And hence it is farther evident, that when we are ſaid to be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by <hi>faith, faith</hi> is not, in ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſcripture, contradiſtinguiſhed from repentance and new obedience; but muſt, of neceſſity, be conſidered as compriſing them in it.</p>
            <p>5thly, THE main point to be eſtabliſhed, will be ſtill more evident from a curſory view of St. <hi>James'</hi>s doctrine in this epiſtle: One main deſign of which appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be, the reſcuing of St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of juſtification, from the abuſes and falſe gloſſes which began, even then, to be put upon it by licentious men. Or, at leaſt, St. <hi>James</hi> deſigned to guard the Church in ſucceeding times, againſt ſuch abuſes and corruptions in this reſpect, as he ſaw likely to creep into it, and which have, ſince, actually overſpread and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured a conſiderable part of it. For that this apoſtle profeſſedly oppoſes the doctrine of juſtification by faith only, in the <hi>modern</hi> ſenſe of the term, is as evident as words can make any thing to be. And
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:007488_0228_102B9125CF137388"/>
all the attempts that have been made to reconcile St. <hi>James'</hi>s doctrine, to the fond conceits of thoſe who are for exalting faith, at the expence of holineſs and good works, are equally futile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</p>
            <p>IT is more eſpecially in the ſecond chapter of this epiſtle, that the apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes and refutes theſe fooliſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conceits. At the tenth verſe he tells us, That "Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law," (meaning the <hi>law of liberty,</hi> as it is called ver. 12, and which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the goſpel-rule of life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." The plain meaning of which is, that whoſoever ſhall habitually tranſgreſs any one known precept of the goſpel, is not in a ſtate of favour with God; but as certainly lies under condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as if he violated them all. The apoſtle then admoniſhes us to live and act in all reſpects, as becomes thoſe who are hereafter to be judged according to this law—"So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty." Now if we are to be judged by this law, it is certain that we ſhall be either juſtified or condemned by it, according as we have, or have not, yielded a ſincere and univerſal obedience to the precepts
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:007488_0229_102B912756812390"/>
of it. This is neceſſarily implied in our being judged by it. From whence it is an obvious inference, that we cannot <hi>now</hi> be juſtified by this law of liberty, [the goſpel] without obeying it. This law will be the ſame, in itſelf, in the day of judgment, that it is at preſent: And all who will be condemned by it, in that day, are equally condemned by it now. It cannot now juſtify the ſame perſons, whom it will condemn, when it ſhall be put into execution by the judge of quick and dead. Or will any one ſay, that we may now be juſtified by the law of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on account of our <hi>faith;</hi> and yet be condemned by it hereafter, on account of our <hi>diſobedience?</hi> This ſeems to be too abſurd for any one to aſſert or ſuppoſe. But were it ſuppoſeable, yet <hi>That</hi> juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which does not exempt us from future condemnation; <hi>That</hi> which we may be the ſubjects of here, and yet be ſentenced to woe and miſery hereafter for our ſins, is a thing of but little value or importance to us; Our great concern is, to know and to do that, which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to the approbation of our Judge, in the great day of his appearing. Even the law of liberty will not then juſtify us, unleſs we have ſincerely obeyed it: And this being the caſe, it is manifeſt, as was
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:007488_0230_102B9128DFAF0DB0"/>
ſaid before, that it cannot juſtify us now, if we diſobey it; that law being ſtill the ſame. And all the <hi>Solifidians</hi> in the world might be defied to anſwer this ſingle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, were there no others.</p>
            <p>BUT the apoſtle proceeds (ver. 14.) more particularly to conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works;</hi> and from thence to the end of the chapter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly combates this notion, that a man is juſtified by the <hi>former,</hi> independently of the <hi>latter</hi>—"What doth it profit, my brethren, tho' a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith ſave<note n="*" place="bottom">"Can faith <hi>ſave</hi> him?" Some who aſſert the ſufficiency of faith to <hi>juſtify;</hi> ſtill allow that it is not ſufficient to <hi>ſave:</hi> But the Apoſtle makes no ſuch idle diſtinction. The ſcope of his argument requires, that by <hi>ſaving,</hi> he ſhould here mean <hi>juſtifying;</hi> and accordingly he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the latter term in the room of the former, in the following verſes.</note> him?" As if he had ſaid: Of what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy or advantage is it, for a man to talk and boaſt of his faith, if his faith is not accompanied with obedience? Can faith entitle <hi>Him</hi> to the favour of God, and eternal life, who does not obey the commandments of Chriſt, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him? Vain, abſurd imagination! He goes on: "If a brother or ſiſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily food; and one of you ſay unto them, Depart in
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:007488_0231_102B912B9C6A4EA8"/>
peace, be you warmed, and filled; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even ſo faith, if it hath not works is dead being alone." <hi>q. d.</hi> If you give your neceſſitous brethren only good words, inſtead of relieving their wants; of what ſignificancy is this? It is rather to mock and inſult them, than to do them any real kindneſs. And faith is juſt as inſignificant as thoſe good words, if it is not attended with charity and righteouſneſs. Being thus alone, it is a dead uſeleſs thing; and can no more juſtify or ſave the ſubjects of it, than fair ſoft words can feed and cloath thoſe, who are periſhing with hunger and cold.—"Yea a man may ſay, Thou haſt faith, and I have works: Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works." As if he had ſaid: Yea, one might reaſon after this manner with you; You pretend to have faith; and perhaps you really have: But I have works, which demonſtrate that I have faith. Whereas you cannot make it appear, even that you have any faith, unleſs your behaviour bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for you. Shew me, if you can, that you have any faith, without works: This is impoſſible; but I will make it evident
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:007488_0232_102B912D23B58290"/>
that I am a believer, by my good life. So that faith is not only inſufficient to juſtify and ſave a man; but no man can even prove that he is poſſeſſed of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle proceeds: "Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt that there is one God; thou doſt well: the devils alſo believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead." <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou wilt tell me, perhaps, that thou believeſt in the One true God. Be it ſo: Thus far it is well: But you cannot reaſonably think that you are hereby juſtified; for even the apoſtate angels believe, and yet juſtly tremble; being <hi>reſerved in chains under darkneſs, to the judgment of the great day:</hi> To which condemnation you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtand expoſed, notwithſtanding your faith, while you perſevere in your ſins. O vain, fooliſh man! wilt thou not at length be ſenſible, that faith without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is a dead uſeleſs thing, of no profit or advantage? St. <hi>James</hi> goes on to illuſtrate and confirm his doctrine by the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi> "Was not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> our father juſtified by Works, when he had offered <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſon upon the Altar? Seeſt thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect." <hi>q. d.</hi> You may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:007488_0233_102B84A23AEFF788"/>
by the ſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that a man muſt <hi>obey</hi> as well as <hi>believe,</hi> in order to his being juſtified. For was not he, our common father, and the father of the faithful, juſtified, in effect, by works; when he ſubmitted to the command and authority of God, in preparing to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his ſon? Seeſt thou not how his faith was exerciſed, and exerted itſelf in works of obedience, receiving thence all its value and efficacy? And that it would have been imperfect, dead and uſeleſs, had it not been accompanied with an obedient heart. "And the ſcripture was fulfilled which ſaith, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs; and he was called the friend of God." <hi>q. d.</hi> And thus was the ſcripture verified, which tells us, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious believer in God; and this his pious and obedient faith, procured him the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation; it being, thro' grace, reckoned to him and accepted of God, as righteouſneſs. So that he was high in the divine favour; and obtained that glorious teſtimony, that he was God's Friend: Which character he could never have obtained, had he not added works to his faith. "Ye ſee then, ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, how that by works a man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not by faith only." <hi>q. d.</hi> Ye
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:007488_0234_102B9130E929E338"/>
may be aſſured therefore, that it is by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God's commands, that a man is juſtified in his ſight; and not, as ſome may vainly imagine, only by believing.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle having obſerved, that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> was juſtified by works; cloſes this ſubject with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſimilitude. "As the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo." As if he had ſaid: So far is it from being true, that faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is ſufficient to juſtify us, and that our obedience is not alſo neceſſary to that end; ſo far is this from being the truth of the caſe, that obedience gives to faith all its worth and value and efficacy. In ſhort works are to faith, that which the ſpirit is to the body. As the body, being deprived of the ſpirit which ſhould inform and animate it, becomes a mere carcaſe, a dead lump of matter, void of all vigor and energy, and unable to perform any of the proper vital functions; ſo faith, being ſeparated from works, or not attended with them, is a dead, uſeleſs thing; and as unable to juſtify the ſubjects of it, as a breathleſs corps is to perform the actions of a living man.</p>
            <p>THUS I have briefly laid before you the doctrine of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>James,</hi> concerning juſtification. And it is manifeſt that he
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:007488_0235_102B9132D3587FD8"/>
oppoſes, directly and profeſſedly oppoſes, and not only oppoſes, but refutes, the notion of juſtification by faith alone; or faith conſidered independently of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Tell me, then, do not thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſow diſcord betwixt brethren, who interpret St <hi>Paul</hi> as teaching the contrary doctrine of juſtification by faith, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, and in contradiſtinction from works? They certainly make as wide a breach betwixt theſe two apoſtles, as happened heretofore betwixt the latter of them, and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> And this they do without any neceſſity. Becauſe what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays concerning juſtification <hi>by faith without the deeds of law,</hi> admits of a fair and eaſy interpretation, in perfect conſiſtency with St. <hi>James'</hi>s doctrine as explained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: Whereas St. <hi>James'</hi>s doctrine here, cannot, by all the ſubtlety of man, be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and fairly explained in any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſiſtency with St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s, provided the deſign of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to oppoſe faith to evangelical obedience; and to teach, that juſtification comes by the former, excluſively of the latter.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral ways, in which St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s doctrine may be made to harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with St. <hi>James'</hi>s, without putting any unnatural force upon the words of either. For example; (1.) When St.
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:007488_0236_102B9134E1BA23D8"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that we are juſtified by <hi>faith, faith</hi> may be underſtood <hi>objectively;</hi> as if he had ſaid, we are juſtified by the <hi>goſpel;</hi> and not by the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And this interpretation is much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the ſcope of ſome paſſages, where he treats of juſtification. (2) Whenever faith is to be underſtood <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi> (as it certainly <hi>muſt</hi> be in many places) it is no unnatural conſtruction, to underſtand the term as comprehenſive of the <hi>whole chriſtian temper,</hi> and that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which the goſpel requires of us.—If it ſhould be ſaid, that this cannot be St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s meaning, becauſe he oppoſes faith to <hi>works,</hi> and to the <hi>deeds of law;</hi> ſince faith really includes them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this interpretation: Tho' this is the principal difficulty, it admits of a very eaſy ſolution. For by works, and the deeds of law, in theſe places, may be meant, either the ceremonial and ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obſervances of the <hi>moſaic</hi> law; as if the apoſtle had ſaid, "A man is juſtified by believing and obeying the goſpel; not by thoſe legal obſervances, to which the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſo diſpoſed to truſt:" Or by works and the deeds of law, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a perfect righteouſneſs, which would exclude grace, and which no one ever performed; as if he had ſaid, "We
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:007488_0237_102B91371DBFD840"/>
are juſtified by a ſincere, tho' imperfect obedience to the goſpel, thro' the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus; not by our works, conſidered as ſtrictly conformable to law; in which ſenſe it is impoſſible that any <hi>tranſgreſſor</hi> of the law ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied—Now in either of theſe ways, the diſtinction which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes betwixt faith and works, when he oppoſes the one to the other, is ſufficiently preſerved: And either of theſe interpretations will perfectly harmonize with St. <hi>James'</hi>s doctrine, That a man is not juſtified by faith, excluſively of that obedience to the laws of Chriſt, which ought to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; and without which it is dead.</p>
            <p>THE Attempts made to reconcile St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> on the contrary hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, (<abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches the doctrine of juſtification by faith alone, or faith in contradiſtinction from evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obedience) have hitherto been to little purpoſe: unleſs it is to ſhow the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreights, to which the advocates for that hypotheſis are driven; and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they are to ſupport it, without uſing unnatural violence with the ſcriptures. Let me give a ſpecimen of theſe attempts, in order to ſupport and verify this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>SOME have ſuppoſed that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:007488_0238_102B9138A979E798"/>
St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeak of two <hi>kinds</hi> of faith; the former, of a true, evangelical and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faith, the latter of a dead, hiſtorical, and notional faith, quite different there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: That the firſt kind juſtifies without, and independently of, works; but that the latter does not. In anſwer to which, I ſhall make one or two ſhort remarks.</p>
            <p>IT is evident that St. <hi>James</hi> intended no ſuch diſtinction; becauſe he ſpeaks of faith at large, in the moſt general and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited ſenſe. "Can faith ſave him."—"What doth it profit"—"Faith without works is dead."—"A man is juſtified—not by faith only. "He does not ſay, that this or that <hi>particular kind</hi> of faith cannot <hi>ſave,</hi> cannot <hi>profit,</hi> cannot <hi>juſtify,</hi> without works: But the ſenſe is plainly this, that <hi>No kind</hi> of faith whatever, can ſave, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or juſtify, without works; or of itſelf alone. Moreover,</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle is here ſpeaking of ſuch a faith as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> were the ſubjects of. The <hi>former</hi> of whom, at leaſt, it is to be preſumed, had as good a faith as any one can pretend to, ſince he is called the <hi>father of the faithful.</hi> And yet the apoſtle denies that either of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was juſtified by faith alone; He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts that they were juſtified by works—"Was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our father juſtified
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:007488_0239_102B913A4B23E208"/>
by works"—"Likewiſe alſo was not <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> juſtified by works."—Now if <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, the goodneſs, and evangelical nature of whoſe faith, is not diſputed by any, was not juſtified by faith, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in contradiſtinction from, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to, works; certainly no other believer can be thus juſtified by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But,</p>
            <p>LET us, for the preſent, take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that St. <hi>James</hi> is not ſpeaking of a true evangelical faith, when he ſays, that faith cannot ſave, profit or juſtify, without works; but ſpeaking of ſuch an idle, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical and inoperative faith, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſome: And let us then ſee what his doctrine will amount to. And I think it will be manifeſtly this, according to the preſent hypotheſis; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz;</hi>
               </abbr> That tho' an <hi>idle, hiſtorical, inoperative</hi> faith, cannot juſtify without works; yet <hi>ſuch a faith</hi> might ſave, profit and juſtify, with works: (for this is plainly implied.) But there is another <hi>peculiar</hi> kind of faith, a truly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical, a living and working faith, which juſtifies without works, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of them! And again: when the apoſtle ſays, (ver. 24.) "Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith <hi>only</hi>"; according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hypotheſis, the ſenſe (or rather the
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:007488_0240_102B913D24841D30"/>
nonſenſe) of the aſſertion muſt be this; That a man is juſtified, not <hi>only</hi> by a dead, inoperative, and idle faith, a faith that worketh not; not <hi>only</hi> by ſuch a faith; but by ſuch a faith in <hi>conjunction</hi> with good works! Now let me aſk any ſober man, Whether ſuch <hi>ſtuff</hi> as this, is worthy the pen of an inſpired apoſtle? And whether this method of reconciling St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> is not to pervert and wreſt the plain meaning of the latter; and make him ſpeak right-down <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER way of reconciling St. <hi>James</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (or rather of making him contradict himſelf) is this: It is ſaid, that he is not here ſpeaking of what is neceſſary to our juſtification in the ſight of God; but of what is neceſſary to the juſtification of our <hi>faith;</hi> neceſſary to the making it <hi>evident</hi> to others, that we have <hi>true</hi> faith. It is ſaid, that tho' faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of obedience or works, juſtifies us before God; yet we cannot exhibit a proof and evidence of our faith to others, without works: And that accordingly, by being juſtified, the Apoſtle here means, juſtified to the world, and in the ſight of all men, as true ſincere chriſtians.</p>
            <p>LET us briefly examine this pretended ſolution of the difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="unknown:007488_0241_102B913F075DC1E8"/>
And it is to be obſerved,</p>
            <p>THAT this is quite an arbitrary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; altogether unwarranted, and unnatural. The <hi>juſtifying of a man's faith</hi> is, in itſelf, an uncouth, ridiculous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: And thoſe make much too bold with the apoſtle, who apply that to <hi>faith,</hi> which he ſays of <hi>men,</hi> of <hi>perſons.</hi> The principal, if not the only thing alledged in ſupport of this interpretation, is, that St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, in ver. 18. of <hi>ſhewing</hi> our faith by works. Upon this ſlender foundation it is, that ſome men have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted all that he ſays in this paſſage concerning the neceſſity of obedience and works to juſtification, of the need of works in order to <hi>ſhew</hi> that we have faith. Whereas it is evident, that what the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays in <hi>that</hi> verſe, is merely inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental; ſomething quite diſtinct from his main argument, and general deſign. Having before ſhown, that faith without works, was unable to ſave; that it was a dead, uſeleſs, unprofitable thing; he then tells thoſe with whom he is arguing, (as it were in a parentheſis) that faith was ſo far from juſtifying them, that they could not even make it <hi>manifeſt</hi> that they had any faith at all, but by their works. He tells them, that one <hi>might,</hi> were it needful, reaſon with them thus: But he lets this
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:007488_0242_102B9140D4555280"/>
matter drop, with a bare mention; and then returns to his main argument; which he purſues to the end of the chapter.</p>
            <p>BUT that the apoſtle does not intend the juſtifying of our faith, or making it <hi>appear</hi> to the world, that we have faith; is demonſtrable from ver. 24.—."Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>not by faith only.</hi>" According to theſe goodly interpreters of ſcripture, the ſenſe muſt be this—"Ye ſee then how that a man's faith is juſtified, or made <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident</hi> to the world, by good works, and not <hi>only</hi> by faith." Or thus, "Faith is made to <hi>appear,</hi> not <hi>only</hi> by faith itſelf; but partly by faith and partly by works." Which, beſides the Nonſenſe of it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly militates even againſt that part of the paſſage, (ver. 18) which they think warrants this interpretation. For there it is ſuppoſed, that faith cannot be <hi>ſhewn at all,</hi> by faith itſelf; but <hi>only</hi> by works. And indeed, had St. <hi>James</hi> talked at the rate which they would make him, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their favourite ſyſtem, One might be apt to queſtion, not only his inſpiration, but even the ſoundneſs of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>IT is farther to be obſerved, that St. <hi>James</hi> is ſpeaking in this paſſage, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is neceſſary to <hi>ſalvation:</hi>—
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:007488_0243_102B9235D53342E8"/>
("Can faith ſave him?") It is therefore much more natural to underſtand him as treating here, of our juſtification in the ſight of God, on whom alone our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends, than of our juſtification in the ſight of men. We may be ſaved hereafter, altho' men ſhould think and ſpeak evil of us, and condemn us: Or we may periſh, tho' we ſhould <hi>appear righteous unto men.</hi> But in order to our ſalvation hereafter, it is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſhould be juſtified of God in this world: For it is only thoſe, "whom He firſt juſtifies, that He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards glorifies." We may therefore fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that this is the juſtification here diſcourſed of.</p>
            <p>AGAIN: That the apoſtle is treating of juſtification in the ſight of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what he ſays concerning <hi>Abraham.</hi> When he "believed God," and when "faith wrought with his works," "it was<note n="*" place="bottom">It will be obſerved, that the particular queſtion here is not, <hi>What</hi> it was that was <hi>imputed to Abraham for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> whether it were his faith only, as diſtinguiſhed from his obedience; or both of them conjunctly; or, as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt? But the point is, whether the acceptance of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s perſon to the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and his juſtification in the ſight of God, is not implied in <hi>that phraſe?</hi>
               </note> imputed to him for righteouſneſs." By whom was it impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Certainly by that God, in whom he
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:007488_0244_102B84AF28A42108"/>
truſted and whom he obeyed; as appears from <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. the place here referred to,—<hi>He believed in the LORD, and HE counted it to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Now we know, that for God to <hi>impute righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> to a man, and to <hi>juſtify</hi> him, are phraſes that are equivalent in ſcripture. So that there can be no reaſonable doubt, but that it is juſtification in God's ſight, that is meant here, and throughout this paſſage. Nor was <hi>Abraham</hi> only <hi>called the friend of God</hi> by men, on account of his obedience: but it was his obedient faith which <hi>made him ſo.</hi> It is therefore evident, that St. <hi>James</hi> is not treating of juſtification before men.</p>
            <p>AND indeed it is, even at firſt view, a very ſtrange unnatural ſuppoſition, that the apoſtle ſhould labour ſo much, <hi>only</hi> to prove that a man cannot <hi>appear</hi> juſt and righteous in the ſight of men, merely by his faith, which is <hi>inviſible;</hi> or without living righteouſly. This is both ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo as to need no formal proof; and, at the ſame time, a matter, comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, of but little importance. Tho' this is plainly the main ſcope and drift of this whole paſſage, unleſs it is our juſtification in the ſight of God, that is intended in it. And this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone, is, I think, ſufficient to
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:007488_0245_102B84B0F2C4AC70"/>
that it is of a higher, and far more important juſtification, than one in the eyes of men, that St. <hi>James</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing. The zeal and warmth which he diſcovers in the courſe of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the ſolemnity and pathos of his expreſſions; in ſhort, the whole air of this paſſage, is a demonſtration that the apoſtle is treating on a ſubject no leſs intereſting, than that of our juſtification with God, and the ſalvation of our ſouls. And the other ſuppoſition, that he is ſpeaking only of what is neceſſary to make our faith <hi>apparent,</hi> that ſo we may be juſtified in the opinion and <hi>ſight of men,</hi> is as inconſiſtent with good <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> as it is with <hi>ſound Theology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have given you a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of the methods taken to make theſe two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles harmonize; taken, I mean, by thoſe who will have it, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the doctrine of juſtification by <hi>faith,</hi> as contradiſtinguiſhed from <hi>evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical obedience.</hi> The two methods which I have mentioned, are all that I have met with, which ſeem to claim any notice. And how inſufficient, how unnatural, even theſe ſolutions are, it is preſumed need not be made more apparent than it is already. Both the ſolutions are founded upon arbitrary ſuppoſitions; and ſuch as
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:007488_0246_102B84B2C20522B8"/>
are demonſtrably falſe. And they are alſo mutually repugnant to each other; ſo that if either of them were true, the other muſt neceſſarily be falſe: Tho', if I miſtake not, ſome perſons, that they might the more effectually put <hi>hereſy</hi> out of countenance, have gravely adopted them both, and maintained them together.</p>
            <p>BUT, as has been obſerved before, it is eaſy to reconcile all that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has ſaid concerning juſtification by faith, with the doctrine, that evangelical obedience is required in order to our being juſtified: (Which laſt is certainly the doctrine of St. <hi>James.</hi>) How this may be done, has been ſhown before.—But if it is ſuppoſed, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ever taught the doctrine of juſtification by faith alone, in contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from obedience, the only queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, How he can be reconciled with St. <hi>James?</hi> Another queſtion which naturally ariſes, is, How he can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with <hi>himſelf?</hi> In all his epiſtles, he aſſerts that impenitent, unreformed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, lye under wrath and condemnation. He therefore <hi>teſtified to them repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,</hi> as well as <hi>faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in order to their getting out of this ſtate of condemnation; to their being reconciled to God, and entitled to eternal life. <q>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:007488_0247_102B84B4F3836C78"/>
his goodneſs, forbearance and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, ſays he; not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance; but after thy hard and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath?</q>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</note> Is it not here ſuppoſed, that ſuch obdurate tranſgreſſors are under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? that they are continually ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating their guilt and ruin? and that their repentance and reformation are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary in order to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the favour and mercy of God? Certainly it is. How then can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that this ſame apoſtle in the ſame epiſtle, ſhould teach, that faith alone, as diſtinguiſhed from repentance and new obedience, is ſufficient to juſtify us; and that it actually does ſo? or if he had taught this latter doctrine, who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it with the other? and vindicate him againſt the imputation of <hi>ſelf-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction?</hi> The doctrines are diametrically repugnant to each other: And whoever ſhall undertake to ſhow on one hand, that repentance and new obedience, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our obtaining the favour and mercy of God; and yet, on the other hand, that we are juſtified by faith exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of repentance and new obedience, will, I am perſwaded, only <hi>darken counſel by words without knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="unknown:007488_0248_102B91430975A568"/>
I INTENDED to have brought divers other arguments to ſhow the falſhood of this too common doctrine, that we are juſtified by faith alone, as faith is oppoſed to goſpel-obedience. But the time will not allow of it. This is, in ſhort, a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine quite repugnant to that preached by our bleſſed Saviour and his apoſtles; a doctrine, full of abſurdity, and fruitful of miſchief; a doctrine, contrary to the general ſcheme and genius of the goſpel; a doctrine, altogether irrational; and not leſs pernicious in its practical tendency, than it is abſurd in ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>BUT as I am now concerned with thoſe who make great uſe of <hi>diſtinctions;</hi> I muſt beg leave to take notice of one or two of <hi>theſe,</hi> before I conclude.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid, that tho' one eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a juſtifying faith, is, that it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative; and that no faith can juſtify, beſides that which is productive of good works, and is manifeſted by them; yet faith does not juſtify <hi>becauſe</hi> it is operative, and productive of good works; but upon another account; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> becauſe believing is a <hi>going out of ourſelves;</hi> and is the <hi>hand by which we lay hold upon the perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi> This, if I miſtake not, is generally ſaid by thoſe who aſſert the doctrine of juſtification by faith, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:007488_0249_102B9144F3CDEAC8"/>
to obedience. And I ſhall make a few remarks upon this <hi>curious</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; becauſe it tends rather to puzzle the <hi>ignorant,</hi> than to edify <hi>any;</hi> and may probably be a means of <hi>beguiling unſtable ſouls to their deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. IF that which is intended by this diſtinction, were only this, that we are not juſtified on account of the inherent merit of our obedience, ſo as to exclude the mercy and grace of God, by which we are juſtified thro' a Mediator; this is unqueſtionably true; and a thing of great importance to be conſidered by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But then it is to be obſerved, that this is at leaſt as applicable to our faith, as it is to our works. For faith is no more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of our juſtification and ſalvation, than our works are: To be ſure it is not, if that be the true notion of faith, which ſome have advanced, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all deſert and merit in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and relying wholly and abſolutely upon the righteouſneſs and merit of Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—But this is not the true deſign of the diſtinction: for were this all that they intend, there would be no controverſy. They intend, that faith juſtifies us in ſome ſenſe in which obedience does not juſtify us; otherwiſe even they themſelves, would ſee what others do; I mean, that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:007488_0250_102B91476C9FFEF8"/>
has really nothing in it. For</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF that faith which juſtifies us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it a principle of obedience, as one eſſential property of it, (as they generally aſſert) then it is moſt futile and abſurd to <hi>oppoſe</hi> faith and obedience, in the manner they do, one to the other; as tho' the former juſtified us independently of the latter. For what is this, in effect, but to oppoſe a thing to itſelf; to that which is eſſential to the very being of it? It is as if we ſhould oppoſe the ſun to the light and warmth of it; or the great <hi>Father of lights,</hi> to his eſſential attributes: It is as if it were ſaid, that tho' God made the worlds; yet they were not produced by his power, wiſdom and goodneſs; but excluſively of them!</p>
            <p n="3">3. BUT the futility of this diſtinction, and the falſhood of what is intended by it; is ſtill further evident from the paſſage in St. <hi>James,</hi> which was conſidered above. For it appears from thence, not only, that we cannot be juſtified by a faith that is without obedience; but alſo that it is obedience which gives to faith all it's life, efficacy and perfection. Without this, any faith, all faith is vain, dead, and unprofitable; utterly inſufficient to juſtify and ſave the ſubjects of it. It is this principle of obedience that is, as it
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:007488_0251_102B9149560494D8"/>
were the ſoul and ſpirit of faith; the very, the only thing, by which we can be juſtified. So widely do thoſe miſtake the matter, and differ from St. <hi>James,</hi> who aſſert, that tho' a juſtifying faith is always productive of obedience; yet it is not this operative quality, which gives vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy to it; but that a true faith juſtifies, excluſively of the obedience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in it. The Apoſtle more than inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that if faith conſidered indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of obedience, could juſtify us, the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves might be juſtified as well as we!—But theſe men, it ſeems, will not allow that <hi>that,</hi> upon which the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle lays, in a manner, the <hi>whole</hi> ſtreſs of our juſtification, ſhould have any ſtreſs <hi>at all</hi> laid upon it in this affair. Even while they allow, that the quality which eſſentially diſtinguiſhes a juſtifying faith from any other, is its being operative; yet it muſt not be allowed, that faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies upon account of this diſtinguiſhing quality, leſt it ſhould follow that we are juſtified <hi>by works!</hi> This (tho' we ſhould not be uncharitable) looks too much as if theſe men were determined to ſay <hi>any thing;</hi> and even plainly to contradict <hi>themſelves,</hi> rather than not contradict the apoſtle when he ſays, that "a man is juſtified by works, and not by faith only."</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:007488_0252_102B914B37538748"/>
4. IF no faith can juſtify, (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) beſides that which involves in it a principle of obedience, then faith muſt juſtify us, conſidered as including this principle in it; and not independently of it. This conſequence is inconteſtibly true; tho' it ſeems not to be generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to: and if it were, there would be no room left for controverſy about faith and works.—Let me illuſtrate what I here intend—If this quality is eſſential to a true, juſtifying faith; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative, and productive of good works; and if the faith which has this property, certainly juſtifies the ſubject of it; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that faith juſtifies, only conſidered as having that property; <hi>i. e.</hi> on account of the obedience involved in the idea of it. For otherwiſe, why may not ſome <hi>other kind</hi> of faith juſtify, tho' deſtitute of this property, as well as that to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is eſſential? If this quality of faith is of no conſideration in the affair of our juſtification; or if faith does not juſtify us, <hi>becauſe</hi> it includes obedience; it will be impoſſible to aſſign a reaſon, why another faith which has all the qualities of a true one, excepting this of being operative, ſhould not juſtify as well as that which has this alſo. In ſhort, to ſay, that <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> only, is a juſtifying
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:007488_0253_102B914D72B2C280"/>
faith, which has this property, is, in effect, to ſay, that this property is what renders it available to our juſtification; and that we are juſtified by faith, <hi>only</hi> conſidered as a principle of obedience. So that thoſe who ſay obedience is eſſential to a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith; and yet that faith juſtifies us, conſidered in contradiſtinction from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, do not only make a <hi>needleſs, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling </hi> diſtinction; but plainly contradict themſelves in it. What would you think of a perſon who ſhould tell you that <hi>wings</hi> were eſſential to a <hi>bird;</hi> that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures which had them, could <hi>fly;</hi> but that none could <hi>fly</hi> without them; and yet tell you, in the ſame breath, that theſe inhabitants of the air did not fly <hi>by virtue</hi> of their wings, but quite <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> of them? Or what would you think of one, who ſhould tell you, that <hi>obedience</hi> to our earthly ſovereign, was eſſential to <hi>loyalty;</hi> that all his loyal ſubjects were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to his <hi>protection;</hi> but that none could be entitled thereto, without <hi>loyalty;</hi> and yet tell you that <hi>loyalty</hi> did not entitle you to your ſovereign's protection, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as compriſing obedience in it; but conſidered <hi>abſtractly,</hi> and even in <hi>contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction</hi> from obedience? It will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, perhaps to ſpeak out what you would think of ſuch <hi>ſubtile Diſtinguiſhers</hi> as theſe—
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:007488_0254_102B914EFB53D208"/>
But whatever you would think of <hi>them;</hi> the ſame you muſt think of thoſe, who tell us that a principle of obedience is eſſential to a <hi>true faith;</hi> that all who have true faith are <hi>juſtified;</hi> but that thoſe who have it not, are not <hi>juſtified;</hi> and yet tell us, that a true faith does not <hi>juſtify,</hi> conſidered as comprehenſive of <hi>obedience;</hi> but as diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to it. And this is really the amount of all the <hi>gibberiſh</hi> which you read or hear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning being juſtified "<hi>Fide ſolâ</hi>", but not "<hi>Fide ſolitariâ!</hi>"—"<hi>By faith alone</hi>" but not "<hi>by faith that is alone!</hi>"—</p>
            <p n="5">5. AND laſtly here, If we conſider faith abſtractly, or independently of holineſs and obedience, what can we ſee in it, which ſhould give it this preheminence above every thing beſides? above ſincere repentance for our ſins? above righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and charity to our neighbour? above gratitude to our Redeemer? above the love and reverence of our Maker? Does faith, abſtractly conſidered, ſeem to have any ſuch prerogative, that it ſhould juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us rather than any, or all, of theſe graces and virtues? Indeed if we conſider faith as a principle of univerſal obedience; as containing in it all the divine and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial virtues; and as being the ſource and ſum of them; if we conſider it in this
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:007488_0255_102B9150A313D008"/>
light, there will be no difficulty in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the higheſt things that are ſaid of it in the new teſtament. But if we conſider faith in contradiſtinction from theſe virtues; and from all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's commandments, no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible and rational account can be given of it; why it ſhould have that prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence? why it ſhould juſtify? why it ſhould be <hi>imputed for righteouſneſs?</hi> But all this will be <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>myſtery;</hi> which, tho' accounted by ſome, the chief glory of the goſpel, ſeems to me to be no real part of it's glory. The chriſtian revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is glorious in reſpect of the great <hi>light</hi> which it affords us; but not, ſurely, on account of what is ſtill left <hi>obſcure</hi> in it! Otherwiſe the apoſtle might m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e properly have congratulated thoſe who ſtill <hi>ſat in darkneſs,</hi> than thoſe who were, by this diſpenſation, <hi>called out of it into marvellous light.</hi>—But not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: When faith is ſpoken of in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the primary and reſtrained ſenſe, or as it is contradiſtinguiſhed from true piety and virtue, other things are plainly preferred to it. Even the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who is tho't by ſome to exalt faith ſo much, as to render every thing elſe inconſiderable in compariſon of it; even this ſame apoſtle undervalues faith
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:007488_0256_102B915394568B00"/>
when put in competition with the moral virtues. "Tho' I have ALL FAITH, ſays he, and have not charity, I am NOTHING." And again, "Now abideſt faith, hope, charity, theſe three; but the GREATEST of theſe is CHARITY." And this is that <hi>more excellent</hi> way, which he ſhews unto us, after exhorting us to "covet earneſtly the <hi>beſt gifts.</hi>" Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great champion for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, undervalues ſaith when conſidered in diſtinction from, and in compariſon of, virtue and obedience: Which plainly ſhows, that when he ſpeaks of our being juſtified by faith, he cannot mean faith, as diſtinguiſhed from charity, and other chriſtian virtues; but as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.—As to the preheminence which ſome give to faith, in the affair of juſtification, on account of its being <hi>the hand that lays hold</hi> on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and a <hi>going out of ourſelves;</hi> theſe things, I confeſs, are beyond my compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: Only it were to be wiſhed, that ſome people would not go out of their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> as well as out of <hi>themſelves;</hi> and both amuſe <hi>themſelves,</hi> and peſter <hi>others,</hi> with unmeaning phraſes, and mere <hi>Jargon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus conſidered this notable <hi>diſtinction,</hi> (that tho' true faith includes a

principle of obedience; yet it does not juſtify us conſidered as containing that principle, but excluſively of it, and as oppoſed to it;) I ſhall juſt mention another, which is equally <hi>edifying;</hi> and which has, indeed, been already hinted at in this diſcourſe. The diſtinction I mean, is this, That tho' faith alone juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us in this world, and <hi>intitles</hi> us to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world to come; yet obedience to the goſpel is neceſſary in order to our being juſtified at Chriſt's tribunal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and ſo, in order to our being actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved at laſt.</p>
            <p>NOW if what is here ſaid were indeed true, it would ſcarce be worth while to give ourſelves much concern about the terms of juſtification <hi>here;</hi> whether we are <hi>now</hi> juſtified by faith alone, or not? This cannot be a very intereſting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion, provided it is certain that we muſt <hi>both</hi> believe in Chriſt and obey Him, in order to our being <hi>finally</hi> juſtified and ſaved by Him, when he ſhall come to judge the world in righteouſneſs. The grand intereſting point, is, What the goſpel requires of us in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquitted in that great day of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; and to our "going away into life eternal"? Which point being once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the other is but of very little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:007488_0258_102B9156F8215AB0"/>
It is rather a matter of curious ſpeculation for men of leiſure, than of ſerious concernment to the ſouls of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. So that there is either no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this diſtinction; or, if there is, thoſe who make it might be much better employed in inculcating that piety and virtue, which is acknowledged neceſſary to ſalvation; than in eternally inſiſting upon the doctrine of juſtification <hi>here</hi> by faith <hi>only;</hi> as if there could be no chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, no religion, without it!</p>
            <p>BUT when this diſtinction comes to be examined, there is really nothing in it: it is wholly without foundation; and the thing intended by it, is demonſtrably falſe. We are not juſtified here, and entitled to ſalvation, on one condition; and juſtified and actually ſaved hereafter, on another; but on the ſame. That which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel has made neceſſary in order to our being acquitted and ſaved in the day of judgment, it has made equally neceſſary in order to our being juſtified now, and entitled to ſalvation. For (as has been obſerved already in this diſcourſe) the goſpel is the rule, by which thoſe who are under the diſpenſation of it, are to be judged hereafter. So that we ſhall then be either acquitted or condemned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we have, or have not, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:007488_0259_102B91592A13F130"/>
with the terms of it according to their true intent and meaning, whatever thoſe terms are. And theſe terms being the ſame now that they will be hereafter, without the leaſt variation, it undeniably follows, that ſuch perſons as will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the goſpel then, muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually condemned by it now; and that ſuch as will then be juſtified by it, and no others, can be juſtified by it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or intitled to the ſalvation of it. Betwixt the juſtification and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel, there is no medium. Whom it does not juſtify, it condemns; whom it condemns not, it juſtifies. Nor does length, or diſtance of time, make any alteration in this caſe. We cannot be juſtified only by believing, at preſent, unleſs we may be juſtified only by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, hereafter; provided the terms of the goſpel, like the author of it, are "the ſame yeſterday, to day and forever:" So that what theſe men take for an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>theological diſtinction,</hi> turns out (like ſome of St. <hi>Athanaſius'</hi>s) to be no better than a palpable <hi>contradiction.</hi> For there cannot well be a more glaring repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than to ſay, that the ſame goſpel which will condemn men for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the day of judgment, does not alſo condemn men equally for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:007488_0260_102B915B9EFE7E78"/>

in a matter of ſo great importance; and given you an antidote againſt the poiſon of thoſe errors, which are but too rife in the Chriſtian world; I proceed now to the next thing propoſed when I enter'd upon this ſubject: Which was,</p>
            <p>EIGHTHLY, To explain more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience. And here, <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the <hi>nature</hi> of this obedience, ſo as to diſtinguiſh it from the obedience of a mere <hi>Moraliſt,</hi> and of a <hi>Theiſt;</hi> and alſo from that of good men, who lived under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſpenſation. And, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> I ſhall conſider the <hi>principle</hi> from which this obedience flows.</p>
            <p>IT is to be obſerved in general, that all obedience, properly ſpeaking, conſiſts in the obſervation of ſome law or rule. The apoſtle tells us, that "where there is no law, there is no <hi>tranſgreſſion:</hi>" It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually true, that where there is no law, there can be no <hi>obedience;</hi> all obedience conſiſting in conformity to ſome law, or rule of conduct, as all tranſgreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a deviation therefrom. And <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical</hi> obedience, is nothing either more or leſs, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of our practice to the laws and commandments of CHRIST, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Lord and King and Judge of
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:007488_0263_102B9160EF157F50"/>
the world; to whom <hi>all power in heaven and in earth is given,</hi> that all men ſhould honor Him in like manner as they honor the Father.</p>
            <p>IF you aſk <hi>where</hi> you are to look for the laws of this "King of Kings, and Lord of Lords?" I anſwer, Neither into the volumes of nature, nor into your own hearts; tho' there are laws written there, correſponding to them; and <hi>written as with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond.</hi> You are not to look for them in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-books, and other law-books in the country, where you happen to live; or in any of the <hi>civil</hi> eſtabliſhments of religion. Nor are you to look for them in the tomes of theological writers, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Popes and Councils; where they are too often <hi>made void</hi> by vain traditions. No! you are to look for them only in the goſpel of Chriſt; they being no other than the precepts and rules of conduct, which are found there; and which were promulgated, either immediately by Chriſt himſelf; or mediately, by his inſpired apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the chief miniſters of his kingdom, whom He authoritatively ſent forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his will, <hi>even as the Father had ſent Him.</hi>

                  <hi>John</hi> 20. 21.</note> Theſe laws of Chriſt, our anointed Sovereign, and whoſe right it is to reign over us, are contained in their native in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity

and perfection, only in the holy ſcriptures; more particularly of the <hi>new teſtament. This</hi> alone is the law-book of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as ſuch; tho' as <hi>men,</hi> and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of civil <hi>ſociety,</hi> we have other laws to obſerve. It is only in conformity to the commandments of Chriſt, as they are contained in theſe <hi>ſacred records,</hi> that chriſtian obedience conſiſts. And it is a manifeſt <hi>ſoleciſm</hi> to call any other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>evangelical,</hi> beſides that, of which the laws of Chriſt, or the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is the <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>ſtandard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THO' theſe laws are <hi>many,</hi> as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our hearts, and external conduct; as they preſcribe to us our duty towards God, and our Saviour; towards our neighbour and ourſelves; yet they are ſometimes conſidered as <hi>one:</hi> Not only as one <hi>ſyſtem</hi> or body of laws; but as <hi>one law;</hi> the <hi>law of liberty,</hi> by which we are to be <hi>judged;</hi> and againſt which, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever preſumptuouſly and habitually <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends,</hi> tho' but in <hi>one point, is guilty of all:</hi> i. e. He ſo far violates the <hi>whole,</hi> and that authority by which the <hi>whole</hi> is injoined, that he is <hi>condemned as a tranſgreſſor,</hi> even by this <hi>law of liberty;</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified and ſaved by it—But this is not the place for conſidering the <hi>extent</hi> of chriſtian obedience—I ſhall therefore
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:007488_0265_102B916506EF92E0"/>
only juſt obſerve here, that as on one hand, it is certain the continued and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful violation of the chriſtian law, in any reſpect, is inconſiſtant with that obedience which is neceſſary to ſalvation; ſo on the other hand, it is equally certain, that a <hi>perfect</hi> conformity thereto, is not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably required, that whoſoever falls ſhort of it, muſt finally be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For to ſuppoſe this, were plainly to turn the <hi>law of liberty</hi> into a legal <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> from which it eſſentially differs. And were this the caſe, it would be as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that juſtification and life ſhould come by the <hi>goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> as that it ſhould come by the law of <hi>Moſes</hi>—But</p>
            <p>HAVING obſerved in <hi>general,</hi> that chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian obedience conſiſts in conforming our tempers and behaviour to the laws of Chriſt; it may be proper, for the better underſtanding of what is here intended, to ſhow more <hi>particularly,</hi> how this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is diſtinguiſhed from any other.</p>
            <p>AND it certainly differs very widely from obedience to the law of nature, or the moral law; eſpecially in that narrow, partial ſenſe and acceptation of this law, which confines <hi>morality</hi> to men's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards each other in civil and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial life: and to the private virtues of temperance, and the like, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:007488_0266_102B916741596DB0"/>
to <hi>Deity,</hi> and a <hi>moral Governor.</hi> The ancient pagan Moraliſts generally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered morality only in this light. When they teach that the law of reaſon, or the law of nature, is to be followed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, (on many branches of which, they treat with great propriety) they uſually mean no more, than that men are bound to practice juſtice, benevolence, ſobriety, and the other virtues of private and ſocial life, as being, in their own nature, convenient, fitting and decent. This is a notion of virtue and obedience, which falls vaſtly ſhort of the Chriſtian idea; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſtians are under obligation to practice other duties beſides thoſe which nature dictates; but alſo becauſe chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ultimately reſolves all duties into the will of God, conſidered as the all-wiſe, good, and righteous Lawgiver, and the moral Ruler of the world. "There is one Lawgiver, ſays St. <hi>James,</hi> who is able to ſave and to deſtroy." And "He that ſaid, do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill." Our obedience is, "doing the <hi>will</hi> of our Father which is in heaven." What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duty we are bound to practice, it is conſidered as injoined upon us by the authority of almighty God. All our good and virtuous actions, are conſidered as a tribute which we owe to Him; as a <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
               <pb n="262" facs="unknown:007488_0267_102B9168CC38B538"/>

               <hi>well pleaſed.</hi> And, on the other hand, whenever we tranſgreſs our duty, this is conſidered as tranſgreſſing the law of God: againſt <hi>Him, Him</hi> only do we ſin. For the divine will and authority, does, as it were, involve and ſwallow up all other obligations; even the laws of nature and reaſon, as they are ſometimes called, being the laws of Him who is Lord of nature, and the Fountain of all reaſon.</p>
            <p>BUT what has now been ſaid, only diſtinguiſhes the obedience of Chriſtians from ſuch virtue as a mere <hi>Atheiſt</hi> may, in ſome degree, be the ſubject of. For a man may be, in ſome meaſure, juſt, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, temperate, &amp;c. from an internal ſenſe of the reaſonableneſs and fitneſs and advantage of being ſo; altho' he is ſo far from obeying and honouring God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that he does not even believe his exiſtence. Our modern <hi>Theiſts</hi> profeſs to go much farther than this; tho' their obedience, if they really practiſed agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their principles, (which they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do) would fall much below that of Chriſtians, who act up to their profeſſion. The <hi>Theiſts</hi> profeſs to reverence God as the moral governor of the univerſe, whoſe will and laws are to be read in men's

hearts, and in the volumes of viſible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the dictates of nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is ſaid, ought to be obeyed, not merely conſidered as in themſelves fit to be obſerved; but alſo becauſe they muſt be ſuppoſed conformable to the will of the <hi>Deity;</hi> and to have all the force of laws enacted by <hi>Him:</hi> So that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, men will be rewarded or puniſhed by <hi>Him,</hi> as they obey or diſobey theſe laws. I ſpeak now only of the more ſober and rational part of modern <hi>Theiſts.</hi> There are others of them, who while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe in God, deride all this as mere <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>enthuſiaſm;</hi>

In order to a perſon's obeying as a Chriſtian ought to do, it is not only neceſſary that he performs the duties <hi>peculiar</hi> to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanity; but alſo that he performs all others, which may be <hi>common</hi> to this and other religions, in obedience to Chriſt, as his Lord and Maſter and final Judge: <hi>doing all things whatſoever he does in word or deed, in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>

THE obedience of a mere <hi>Theiſt</hi> may be excited by a contemplation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, and other attributes, as manifeſted in the creation of the world; and in that providence which ſuſtains and governs all things. But a Chriſtian's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is moreover, excited, I might perhaps ſay, more eſpecially excited, by a contemplation of God's perfections, as manifeſted in our redemption: And we are <hi>conſtrained by the love of Chriſt,</hi> who "died for all." when all were dead. The <hi>Theiſt</hi> may do acts of charity to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours conſidered as his fellow-creatures, the creatures of God. But a Chriſtian moreover conſiders the relation in which all men ſtand to Chriſt, who ſo loved them, as to give his life "a ranſom for all:" And if he gives ought to a diſciple, it is <hi>in the name</hi> of a diſciple that he does it, and <hi>becauſe he belongs to Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Theiſt</hi> may be ſober and temperate becauſe this is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and conducive to health. But the Chriſtian moreover, conſiders himſelf as "the habitation of God thro' the ſpirit;" and will not <hi>defile the temple of God,</hi> leſt God ſhould <hi>deſtroy</hi> him. The <hi>Theiſt'</hi>s virtue and obedience may be excited by ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral confuſed notions of a future ſtate of retribution. But a Chriſtian lives under the habitual expectation of a reſurrection, and
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:007488_0276_102B917AB1DB0408"/>
a future judgment; when all they that are in their graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and come forth, <hi>they that have done good, to the reſurrection of life,</hi> and <hi>they that have done evil, to the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> The <hi>Theiſt</hi> may obey, becauſe he imagines his virtue (notwithſtanding all it's defects) ſo valuable in itſelf, that it will fully and ſufficiently recommend him to the approbation of his Creator. But the Chriſtian obeys, becauſe this will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God thro' his Redeemer, and be rewarded for <hi>his ſake.</hi> In fine, the obedience of a Chriſtian, in all its parts and branches, receives a peculiar tincture and complexion from his profeſſion; and is animated by the faith of the Son of God, who has redeemed us by his blood; <hi>and made us kings and prieſts unto</hi> God, <hi>to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to Him by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>BUT it may be inquired, How chriſtian obedience differs from that of good men under the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in the fleſh? The reſolution of which inquiry, depends very much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:007488_0277_102B917C939876D8"/>
on another queſtion, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> How far the mediatorial ſcheme of our redemption and ſalvation, was opened to <hi>Their</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, during that preparatory diſpenſation? If we ſuppoſe this ſcheme to have been as clearly revealed to <hi>them</hi> in general, as it ſeems to have been to ſome of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> before the law, and to ſome good men after, and under, it, the difference will not be ſo great as ſome may perhaps imagine. For it will then conſiſt chiefly in theſe two things:</p>
            <p>1ſt. IN the externals, the modes and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals of religion; which, to be ſure, were very different under the <hi>Moſaic,</hi> and the <hi>evangelical</hi> diſpenſation; the morality of the law and of the goſpel being ſtill the ſame. And</p>
            <p>2dly. WHEREAS WE believe and truſt in a Redeemer already come; and are hereby excited to obey: <hi>They</hi> believed in the ſame Saviour, as promiſed, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; and were, by this expectation of a Deliverer, ſtimulated to the ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>WE are told expreſsly, that the <hi>goſpel was preached to Abraham,</hi> who <hi>rejoiced to ſee the day of Chriſt</hi> approaching. And he, together with others both before, and after the <hi>Moſaic</hi> oeconomy took place, were juſtified in the ſame way, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:007488_0278_102B917ED4C0D208"/>
on the ſame footing of grace, that we are now; <hi>Abraham</hi> being <hi>the father of the faithful</hi> in all ſucceeding generations. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enumerated divers of theſe ancient worthies, tell us, that <q>theſe all died in <hi>faith,</hi> not having received the promiſes; (<hi>i. e.</hi> the fulfilment of them) but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen them afar off, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them, and embraced them; and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims in the earth.</q>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 13.</note> And of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is ſaid afterwards, that he <q>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the reproach of Chriſt, greater riches than the treaſures in <hi>Egypt;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſpect unto the recompence of the reward.</q>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 26,</note> Now according to theſe, and ſuch-like repreſentations in the new-teſtament, one would think that, excepting the two particulars mentioned, there could be no conſiderable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the obedience of good men before, and after, the coming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT whether this knowledge of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to come, were common to all good men, under the <hi>law,</hi> or not, there is ſome ground of doubt. For tho' one great end of the law was, that it might <hi>ſhadow forth good things to come;</hi> that it might at once admoniſh thoſe who were under it, of their <hi>need</hi> of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> deliverer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:007488_0279_102B91805D2570E8"/>
and lead them to <hi>expect ſuch</hi> a One; yet it is manifeſt that the generality of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for ſometime before our Lord's nativity, had no notion of this ſpiritual meaning, and typical reference of the law; and therefore interpreted all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Prince and Saviour. And whether ſome truly pious and virtuous men, were not carried away with this prevailing er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, I will not pretend to determine—Nor can we fully and thoroughly diſcriminate betwixt the obedience of good <hi>Jews,</hi> and good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> unleſs we knew more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly than we do, what the ideas and ſentiments of the <hi>former</hi> generally were, reſpecting the promiſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>TO conclude this head, concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of chriſtian obedience—This obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not only <hi>that</hi> which, for the matter of it, is agreable to the precepts of the goſpel; but <hi>that</hi> which is performed with a due regard to Chriſt, as our great Prophet, Prieſt and King; <hi>the Captain of our Salvation;</hi> the <hi>author and finiſher of our faith: That</hi> obedience, which has the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel revelation for its baſis and rule; and which is performed from views and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives proper and peculiar to this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine grace. However right and reaſonable men's actions are, conſidered
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:007488_0280_102B9182B88930B8"/>
in themſelves; however correſponding to the <hi>law of liberty;</hi> yet there is not, in ſtrict propriety, any thing of chriſtian o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience therein, any farther than they are done with reference to the goſpel of Chriſt. This is the <hi>characteriſtick</hi> of the obedience we are conſidering: hereby it is diſtinguiſhed from any other. And this will be farther evident from a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the grand <hi>principle</hi> of this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which was the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the beginning of this diſcourſe, and to which I now proceed.</p>
            <p>THE great <hi>principle</hi> of chriſtian obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is <hi>chriſtian faith;</hi> faith in Chriſt, and in God thro' him. I add—<hi>in God thro' him;</hi> becauſe the faith of Chriſtians does not terminate in Chriſt as the <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> (tho' he is the <hi>immediate</hi>) object of it: but it is extended, thro' him, to the <hi>one God and Father of all.</hi> And to beget in men that belief and truſt in God, which is here intended, was one grand deſign of the mediatorial undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Chriſt came into the world in his Father's name, as ſent and commiſſioned by Him, to declare and reveal Him. And in His name he ſpake to the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and His kingdom. All he taught, did and ſuffered, refered ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Father; the end thereof being to
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:007488_0281_102B9184F37E6750"/>
               <hi>bring us to God.</hi> A paſſage in the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> will both illuſtrate and confirm the thing here intended; where, ſpeaking of our Saviour, he ſays, that he <q>was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained before the foundation of the world; but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for us, who <hi>by him do believe in God</hi> that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that our <hi>faith and hope might be in God.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 20, 21.</note> From hence, and from many other paſſages of ſcripture, it is evident that chriſtian faith is not merely a belief in Chriſt, or relying upon him for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but rather a belief and hope in <hi>God</hi> thro' him; a belief that <hi>He</hi> is what Chriſt has declared him to be; that <hi>He</hi> is that righteous, that good and gracious Being, which the goſpel repreſents him to be; that He is <hi>reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> by ſuch means, and upon ſuch terms, as are therein mentioned: A belief, that Chriſt is "the way, the truth and the life; that no man can come unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by him;" or that ſinners can obtain eternal life in that method, and that alone, which he has opened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.<note n="‡" place="margin">Act 4. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the proper notion of chriſtian faith: And, indeed, to ſuppoſe that faith terminates in Chriſt, as the <hi>ultimate</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, is inconſiſtent with his being a
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:007488_0282_102B9186802D8840"/>
               <hi>Mediator</hi> at all. We loſe the very idea of a <hi>Mediator</hi> upon this ſuppoſition. If Chriſt is really "the Mediator betwixt God and Man;" he is to be believed on as ſuch; and our faith muſt terminate, as was obſerved before, in <hi>that God,</hi> betwixt Whom and us, he <hi>mediates.</hi>—And having premiſed thus much concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of chriſtian faith in general; (which is much miſtaken by many) I am now to ſhow, that this is the great <hi>principle</hi> of chriſtian obedience. I do not mean, that all who thus believe in Chriſt, and in God thro' him, do actually obey the goſpel; (which is contrary to fact and experience) but, that all who obey it, obey it from this <hi>principle.</hi> It is this faith that purifies their hearts; and animates them in the diſcharge of all the duties of the chriſtian life—Let me explain myſelf a little more particularly upon this point.</p>
            <p>IT is very evident that no man can obey as a Chriſtian, who has not the faith of a Chriſtian. It is ſuppoſeable that a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or even an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> might <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally</hi> perform any duty which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel injoins upon us. But if a <hi>Mahometan</hi> or <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> known to be ſuch, ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many of theſe duties, no one, ſurely, would call this <hi>chriſtian</hi> obedience. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical faith being wanting, there cannot,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:007488_0283_102B9188B81550A8"/>
properly ſpeaking, be any thing of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience in any actions whatever.</p>
            <p>SUCH faith in Chriſt, and in God thro' him, as is mentioned above, has a very natural and apparent <hi>tendency</hi> to make the ſubjects of it truly pious and virtuous; and to yield that obedience to the goſpel, which is required of them. As far as the belief of any thing; as far as any faith, in the primary and moſt proper ſenſe of the term, can influence the tempers and practices of men; ſuch a faith as I am ſpeaking of, bids the faireſt of any, to have a good influence upon men's hearts and manners; to turn them from ſin to God; and to induce them to obey his commandments. What can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſufficient and effectual to this good end, if a belief of ſuch truths as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the goſpel; if believing Chriſt to be really that divine meſſenger which he is ſaid to be; if believing, that he came into the world to redeem us, according to the evangelical account of this matter; if believing in God, thro' him, believing in his righteouſneſs and holineſs; his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy; his promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; what, I ſay, can be ſuppoſed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and effectual to turn men from ſin to righteouſneſs, if ſuch a faith as this, has not that influence and efficacy? if it leaves
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:007488_0284_102B918AB34D7BE0"/>
the ſubjects of it, as it found them, <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins?</hi> There is certainly no faith, conſidered in the firſt and moſt proper ſenſe of the word, which can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage men from their evil courſes, and induce them to love and ſerve God, if this faith fails to do it. And as this is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious tendency of it; ſo</p>
            <p>IT is manifeſt thro' out the new-teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, that the apoſtles of our Lord, and other holy men, lived under the influence of ſuch a faith. This was the ſpring, and ſource, and animating principle of their obedience. It was this, that made them <hi>abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.</hi> It is by this faith, that they are ſaid to have <hi>walked:</hi> And the <hi>life which they lived in the fleſh, they lived by this faith of the Son of God.</hi> This is the faith, which is ſaid <hi>to work by love:</hi> And <hi>this is the victory that overcometh the world,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, even your faith.</hi> It was by faith, that theſe holy men <hi>run with patience the race ſet before them:</hi> It was by this <hi>ſhield of faith,</hi> that they were armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations; and <hi>wherewith they were enabled to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> In fine it was faith, that gave them ſpirit and courage to encounter, and ſtrength to overcome, all difficulties and dangers, in the diſcharge of their duty
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:007488_0285_102B918CF17164F8"/>
—The account which the apoſtle gives us of ſome renowned men before the coming of Chriſt, (whoſe faith was not eſſentially different from our's) is agreable to what is ſaid above. <q>
                  <hi>By faith,</hi> Moſes, ſays he, when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah's daughter—<hi>By faith</hi> he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King; for he endured as <hi>ſeeing him who is inviſible</hi>
               </q>—"And what" (as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle goes on) <q>ſhall I more ſay? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Sampſon, and of Jeptha, of David alſo and Samuel, and of the prophets; who <hi>thro' faith</hi> ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kingdoms, <hi>wrought righteouſneſs,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. Thus was faith the great operative prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in good men, even before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt: It was the ſame principle in general, which wrought in the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians: And it is this principle that operates in good men, in all ſucceding ages. This is the heavenly ſeed, which taking root in the heart, ſprings up, and ripens into good fruit: This is the ſource and fountain from whence obedience flows: And without ſuch a principle of faith, there can, as has been obſerved before, be no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence properly <hi>evangelical.</hi> But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="unknown:007488_0286_102B918ED1C62BC0"/>
NOTWITHSTANDING the viſible, apparent tendency of faith, to produce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; to make men truly pious and virtuous; and altho' no perſon does, or can, obey the goſpel, but from this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; yet it is manifeſt both from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and daily obſervation, that people may be the ſubjects of faith, while they live in diſobedience to Chriſt's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: They may have faith, without having their tempers and manners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the dictates of it: Their lives and practice may be contrary to what they profeſs to believe; yea, to what they actually do believe. So that tho' faith is the true principle of obedience, in all thoſe who obey; yet it is not, in fact and event, a principle of obedience in all that believe; for there are vicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; as well as vicious infidels. We learn from the new-teſtament, that many who believed in Chriſt and the goſpel, of old, wholly apoſtatized from the faith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; ſome in a ſhorter, and ſome in a longer time. Many others, who did not make <hi>ſhipwreck concerning faith,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to <hi>hold</hi> it; yet held it <hi>in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> making <hi>ſhipwreck of a good conſcience;</hi> and being <hi>to every good work reprobate.</hi> Our own obſervation may, perhaps, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and verify theſe repreſentations of
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:007488_0287_102B91908EFC5978"/>
ſcripture. Have we not known ſome who profeſſed to believe in Chriſt; to truſt in the mercy of God thro' him; and even to be very confident of their title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; (of whom we cannot pretend to ſay, that they did not thus believe, and truſt, and confidently expect ſalvation) Have we not, I ſay, known ſome ſuch perſons, who were far from being good men, if the tree is to be known and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by its fruit? Yea, have we not known ſome, who were not only belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; but very <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> ones, who have wholly <hi>departed from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits,</hi> as was foretold?<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.</note> Have we not ſeen examples of ſuch as our Saviour ſpeaks of, who "hear the word, and anon <hi>with joy receive it;</hi> yet not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>root</hi> in themſelves, endure only <hi>for a while?</hi>"<note n="†" place="margin">

            <p>IT is very evident then, that faith is not really a practical principle in the hearts of all <hi>believers:</hi> Some of them are very little, if any thing, the better for their faith—And there is one thing that deſerves a particular notice here: Which is, That the Apoſtles, in their epiſtles to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, or to chriſtian churches, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak of the <hi>vicious, impenitent</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of chriſtianity, as being <hi>deſtitute of true faith;</hi> or as being really <hi>unbelievers,</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="unknown:007488_0288_102B9192736D0A00"/>
while they profeſſed to have faith. On the contrary, they always take it for granted, that theſe perſons, however wicked, were really believers notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their wickedneſs; exhorting them to repent and amend; and to live ſuitably to their holy vocation. In this reſpect, at leaſt, there is a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference betwixt the Apoſtles, and ſome modern preachers of the goſpel. The latter ſpeak to, and of, all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſors of chriſtianity, as unbelievers, as deſtitute of <hi>true</hi> faith; upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that where faith is, there will always be obedience; or, that no true believer, can remain vicious. Now I am bold to ſay, that this manner of preaching is altogether <hi>unſcriptural;</hi> and that there cannot be a ſingle inſtance produced, from the writings of the apoſtles, which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it. For, as was ſaid before, They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take it for granted, that men may be really <hi>believers,</hi> and addreſs them <hi>as ſuch,</hi> how much ſoever their lives and morals might reſemble thoſe of <hi>pagans</hi> and <hi>infidels.</hi> So that we cannot reaſonably doubt, but that faith, <hi>true faith,</hi> which is a principle of obedience in ſome perſons, is not <hi>ſo</hi> in others; not <hi>working by love,</hi> nor producing <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOME will probably inquire, How
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:007488_0289_102B919519C8BD10"/>
it comes to paſs, that faith, which is the principle and ſource of obedience in ſome perſons, ſhould not be ſo in others, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally? Why the hearts and manners of many ſhould be influenced by their faith; while the hearts and manners of as many, perhaps a much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhould be ſo much at variance with their faith? ſo oppoſite to what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe; and which they really do believe, according to the preſent hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis? And, indeed, tho' the poſſibility of this, and the truth of the ſuppoſition, is evident from the whole current of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and verified by daily experience; yet it may well be accounted one of the greateſt ſpeculative difficulties that occurs, upon the ſubject of religion: And it is one, of which it is, perhaps, beyond the ſphere of human underſtanding to give a clear and full ſolution; ſince it ſeems plainly to run up into the old queſtion concerning <hi>liberty;</hi> ſo that They who can fully clear up all the difficulties attending the doctrine of human freedom, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to neceſſity, can be at no loſs for an anſwer to this—But who They are, I have not yet found—</p>
            <p>SOME think this fact is ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, only by ſuppoſing that good and wicked men under the goſpel, (tho'
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:007488_0290_102B9196A1A94388"/>
both of them are truly believers) believe in different degrees of intenſeneſs. There are doubtleſs degrees in faith; there is a ſtrong and lively faith, as well as a weak and languid. Thoſe who are the ſubjects of the former, it is ſaid, are obedient to the dictates of it; faith, in them, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an operative, practical principle: Whilſt thoſe, whoſe faith is feeble and weak, do not give themſelves up to the guidance of it; this weak faith not being a practical principle, as the other is: But if it were ſtrengthened to a certain degree, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is ſuppoſed, it wou'd become ſo; and certainly be productive of good fruit.—Thus, as ſome ſuppoſe, it comes to paſs, that faith is actually a principle of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſome perſons, and not in others. But this is far from being a full ſolution of the difficulty: For the queſtion ſtill occurs, how it comes to paſs that ſome men are thus <hi>ſtrong in faith;</hi> while others give but a feeble and cold aſſent to the great truths of chriſtianity? Beſides, if there is any ſuch thing as human liberty, it is certain that, of different men, whoſe faith is the ſame, both for kind and degree, ſome may act agreably, others contrary thereto: And to ſay, that all men whoſe faith is alike ſtrong, muſt act alike, is, in effect, to deny that men are free creatures;
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:007488_0291_102B9198DC870A20"/>
unleſs we ſuppoſe their freedom lies rather in believing, than acting. For if there is a neceſſary connection betwixt men's <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> it is plain that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free in the <hi>latter</hi> of theſe reſpects; ſo that they muſt either be free in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> or not at all. And, to human ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſome great and ſtrong believers are much worſe men, than ſome who have but <hi>little faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OTHERS ſuppoſe that here is a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific, eſſential</hi> difference in the faith it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of thoſe who obey the goſpel, and of thoſe who do not: From which difference in the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of their faith, it is ſaid, we are to account for the difference which there is in their lives and manners; one of them being always, and univerſally, a principle of chriſtian obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the other, never. But it ſeems impoſſible to give any intelligible account of this ſuppoſed <hi>ſpecific</hi> difference in men's faith. For to ſay, that one man's faith is wrought by the ſpecial operation of the ſpirit of God upon his heart; and another's, not; is not to point out to us the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which there is ſuppoſed to be in theſe men's faith; but only to tell us, how theſe different perſons <hi>come by</hi> their faith: Which is quite another thing. If two perſons aſſent to the ſame divine truths;
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:007488_0292_102B919B17C3F818"/>
if they believe in the ſame God; if they depend upon the ſame Saviour; their faith is, for <hi>kind,</hi> the ſame, in how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent a manner ſoever we may ſuppoſe they <hi>became</hi> the ſubjects of it. This faith, as was ſaid above, may, indeed, be ſtrong in ſome perſons, and weak in others: But this makes only a <hi>gradual,</hi> not a <hi>ſpecific</hi> difference in their faith itſelf.</p>
            <p>SOME, who ſuppoſe there is a <hi>ſpecific</hi> difference betwixt the faith of obedient, and that of diſobedient chriſtians; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make out this difference, and to ſhow how faith becomes a principle of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in ſome perſons and not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; tell us, that one is a penitent faith, an humble faith, an holy faith; and ſo on: Whereas the other is an impenitent faith; not humble, unholy, &amp;c. But upon examination, it will appear, that this is rather to tell us how <hi>men differ</hi> from each other, than how their <hi>faith differs.</hi> For ſince a penitent faith, includes penitence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n humble faith, humility, and an holy faith, holineſs; to ſay that one perſon has a penitent, humble, holy faith; but that the faith of others is not a penitent, not an humble, not an holy one; really amounts to no more than ſaying, that ſome believers are penitent, humble and holy; but that other believers are not ſo.
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:007488_0293_102B919CF7D0C9B0"/>
Which is only telling us, how widely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed chriſtians differ from each other in their moral and religious character; not ſhowing us how the faith of a good man differs <hi>ſpecifically</hi> from that of a wicked one.</p>
            <p>THE ſame faith, both for <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> may be attended, or accompanied, with different qualities in different men. One believer may be wiſe and learned; another ſimple and unlearned. Does this difference betwixt the men, infer any <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific</hi> difference in their faith? No ſurely! Thus alſo one believer may take a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pleaſure and delight in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of one worldly calling or occupation; another, in another. Do theſe different turns of men's minds, infer a <hi>ſpecific</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their faith? You will juſtly anſwer, None at all. Well: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (for aught that has hitherto appeared) the ſame faith may be accompanied with repentance, humility, holineſs, in one man; and with hardneſs of heart, pride, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in another. Theſe contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be found in believers; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them in ſome, the latter in others: But neither of them are faith, <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> ſpeaking; but ſomewhat quite diſtinct from it. Tho' ſome believers are penitent, humble and internally holy;
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:007488_0294_102B919E83A1CB58"/>
yet theſe moral and religious qualities, or theſe chriſtian graces, <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſpeaking, are not faith; but they are as diſtinct from it, as wiſdom and learning; or any other natural and civil accompliſhments; or any particular turn of mind, with relation to ſecular employments. We might as well ſay, that there is a <hi>ſpecific</hi> difference betwixt the faith of a wiſe man, and that of an ignorant one; betwixt the faith of a chriſtian <hi>magiſtrate,</hi> and that of a chriſtian <hi>merchant;</hi> as that there is ſuch a difference betwixt the faith of a <hi>ſaint,</hi> and that of a <hi>ſinner:</hi> Yea we might as well ſay, that there is a ſpecific difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the faith of a man of a <hi>fair,</hi> and one of a <hi>dark</hi> complexion;—the faith of an <hi>European,</hi> and that of the <hi>AEthiopian</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by <hi>Philip.</hi> For, in truth, learning and ignorance, civil magiſtracy and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, darkneſs and fairneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, are not more diſtinct from faith, <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, than moral and religious qualities are; ſuch as repentance, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and holineſs. Theſe good qualities are not only diſtinct from faith, and faith from them; but there is no <hi>neceſſary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection betwixt them. Some believers are poſſeſſed of them; others are not. Nor can this fact be accounted for, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that there is a ſpecific difference
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:007488_0295_102B91A00D171EB8"/>
betwixt the faith of the former, and that of the latter. For if there were really any ſuch difference, yet the queſtion would ſtill recur, How comes one man to have the good faith? another, only that of an inferior kind? And beſides; thoſe who have endeavoured to make out ſuch a <hi>ſpecific</hi> difference, have not, by any means, done it. For they either only tell us how we come by true faith, ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing it is wrought in us by the ſpirit of God, &amp;c. (which, however true it may be, is not to ſhow us wherein <hi>that</hi> faith, conſidered in itſelf, differs from any <hi>other</hi>) Or elſe they tell us, it is a penitent, humble, holy faith: Which is, in effect, to ſay, that the faith of ſome men differs <hi>ſpecifically</hi> from that of others, by having ſomewhat which is really <hi>diſtinct</hi> from faith, joined with it; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> repentance, humility and holineſs. So that to have recourſe to this ſuppoſed <hi>ſpecific</hi> difference in men's faith, in order to account for ſome men's obeying, and others not obeying, the goſpel; is really no more than ſaying, in other words, that ſome men obey the goſpel, becauſe they do not only believe, but are alſo penitent, humble and internally holy; <hi>i. e.</hi> they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, becauſe—they obey it! While o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſobey it, becauſe, tho' they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, yet they remain impenitent, proud,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:007488_0296_102B91A23B7A3628"/>
unholy; <hi>i. e.</hi> they diſobey it, becauſe—they diſobey it! And is not this a very notable ſolution? When the very thing which is inquired, is, How it comes to paſs, that ſome believers are penitent, humble and holy; others the reverſe?</p>
            <p>BY this time, I ſuppoſe, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as was hinted above, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry runs directly into another; and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates therein: I mean, the perplexing queſtion concerning <hi>human liberty;</hi> and it can only be reſolved fully by thoſe, who can <hi>fully</hi> reconcile our freedom (which ought not to be doubted of) with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-doctrine of God's fore-knowledge, and eternal counſels; of his governing providence, and the operations of his ſpirit and grace. To pretend to anſwer the difficulty, by <hi>denying</hi> human freedom, and reſolving all into the abſolute ſovereignty, and power of God, is only to <hi>cut the knot</hi>—And on the other ſuppoſition, that we are free, there is ſomewhat in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is, even at firſt view, <hi>above humanity</hi>—ſomewhat, to which we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain</hi>—ſomewhat, which is evidently <hi>too high</hi> for creatures of ſuch limited facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and probably for all CREATURES. And if we <hi>exerciſe ourſelves in theſe things,</hi> I know of no valuable end it can anſwer—except that of convincing us of our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,

'till we come, at laſt, to ſit down contented and reſigned, <hi>where</hi> the holy apoſtle did, ſaying with him—<q>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</q>

            <p>THOSE perſons who deny the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and the eternal purpoſes of God, becauſe they cannot clearly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile this doctrine with that of human li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſeem very worthy of blame: Since, if the ſcriptures are true, theſe doctrines muſt both be true. But thoſe who, becauſe of the difficulty which they find here, deny that man is free, are ſtill much more blameable: Becauſe the denial of liberty, is the charging of all our ſins on God; making him the author, as well as the puniſher, of them: and ſo, abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys his moral character: Whilſt, at the ſame time, this is of the moſt fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with reference to practical religion—</p>
            <p>IN that revelation, with which God has favoured us, it is forever taken for granted, that we have a <hi>ſelf-determining</hi> power; (whatever difficulties may attend the ſuppoſition) I mean, the power either of accepting the mercy offered us, by complying with the gracious terms of it; or <hi>rejecting the counſel of God againſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> So that none ever had, or ſhall

                  <p>THERE are many things attended with inſuperable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in ſpeculation; things, of which no clear account, or <hi>Rationale</hi> can be given; yea, which ſeem to run us into ſome abſurdity, if ſuppoſed true: Which things are, nevertheleſs, certain, indubitable facts; ſuch as cannot be denied, without denying our own daily experience. Liberty, as oppoſed to neceſſity, I take to be ſomewhat of this kind. Great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities and difficulties ariſe upon the ſuppoſition of it; but much greater, upon the denial. All human language is exactly accommodated to the doctrine of freedom: ſo that we could neither underſtand each other, nor ourſelves, without the idea of liberty; or a power both of chooſing and acting <hi>variouſly,</hi> or <hi>differently,</hi> within a certain ſphere, under the <hi>ſame</hi> given circumſtances. For this is the true, proper notion of liberty: At leaſt, this is the ſenſe in which the terms <hi>liberty, freedom, active power,</hi> are uſed in this note. And without the idea of ſuch a power, what do we mean by ſuch forms of expreſſion as theſe, which are common? <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> That we can do ſo or ſo; but cannot do another thing: That we would do this or that, if we could; but cannot: And, <hi>vice versâ,</hi> That we could do this or that, if we would; but will not: That we will try, or uſe our endeavours to do ſo or ſo; and do it, if we can. This is the language of nature; and every man underſtands theſe forms of expreſſion: Which, yet, would be quite ſenſeleſs and unintelligible to us, without the idea and ſuppoſition of liberty. There would be no foundation for ſuch a diſtinction betwixt what we can, and what we cannot do, &amp;c. All men have therefore the idea of liberty: which is, indeed, one of the moſt plain and ſimple of all our ideas: Even children have it. And</p>
                  <p>IT may be fairly argu'd that we are free, and conſcious to ourſelves of our being ſo, from our having this idea. For how did we, <hi>at firſt,</hi> come by it? It could not, I think, come into our minds, <hi>originally,</hi> from any thing external and material; or by means of any of our corporeal ſenſes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. There ſeems to be nothing in all viſible nature, which could ſuggeſt it to us at firſt; tho' ſpontaneous animal motion bids the faireſt for it. If we had not actually experienced the thing ourſelves, we could have no more idea of it, than a blind man, of colours, or a deaf one, of ſounds. This idea could be gotten only by reflecting upon what has paſſed in our own minds; upon what we have experienced in ourſelves, by a kind of internal ſenſation. We are, therefore, <hi>conſcious</hi> of our freedom: So that thoſe who deny there is any liberty in man, do not only contradict the experience of others; but their own. For they have this idea, no leſs than others; which yet, they could not have, but from experience.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER: If it ſhould be ſaid, that we do not get the idea of active power, by reflecting on our own experience; but that it might be <hi>naturally</hi> ſuggeſted to the mind <hi>ab extra,</hi> by animal motion, of which we are daily witneſſes; or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other phoenomena in nature: It will, even from hence follow, that there are really ſome phoenomena in nature, which correſpond to this idea; for otherwiſe the idea could not have been <hi>naturally</hi> ſuggeſted to our minds by theſe appearances. So that, even upon this ſuppoſition, it follows that the notion of liberty, or active power, is a <hi>natural</hi> one; bro't into our minds by daily obſervation. And if this is the caſe, it is ſurely <hi>natural</hi> to believe there is freedom: Conſequently to deny this, is <hi>unnatural;</hi> and to contradict a man's own daily obſervation. For we do not live a day without ſeeing what has, at leaſt, the <hi>appearance</hi> of liberty; and what, according to the preſent ſuppoſition, originally ſuggeſted to us the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or idea of it.</p>
                  <p>THERE is, demonſtrably, liberty <hi>ſomewhere;</hi> in ſome <hi>One</hi> Being, at leaſt. All things could not have proceeded in an eternal ſeries of neceſſary cauſes and effects, each of which is both an effect with relation to ſomewhat preceeding, and a cauſe with relation to ſomething following. We muſt aſcend, and follow the chain, 'till we come to a firſt Mover, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and remote ſoever: Which firſt Mover, muſt be a free Being, or have a principle of active power, which is the ſame thing. He cannot be neceſſarily actuated by any thing: Which would be, in effect, to ſuppoſe there is a Cauſe of the firſt Cauſe; or that the firſt Cauſe is a neceſſary effect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To deny to this great firſt Cauſe, the power of imparting to his creatures a <hi>meaſure</hi> of freedom; or of making a free creature, who can either chuſe and act, or not, within a certain ſphere, (how narrow and limited ſoever that ſphere may be) is making much <hi>too free with Him.</hi> There is not the leaſt contradiction or abſurdity, in the ſuppoſition of a creature's having active power, or being a <hi>free agent.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>IF active power be not an <hi>incommunicable</hi> attribute of the Creator; (which we have no reaſon to think it is) or if a creature may <hi>poſſibly</hi> be endow'd with liberty; we have no reaſon to <hi>doubt</hi> but that we have it <hi>ourſelves:</hi> Since, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that we were actually free, we could not be more <hi>experimentally</hi> certain that we were ſo, than we are at preſent. That we are poſſeſſed of active power, is ſo immediately, ſo experimentally known by us; and we have ſuch an inward conſciouſneſs and feeling of it; that no difficulties, merely <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> can overthrow, or in any meaſure invalidate, this evidence of it. We are not more certain of any one thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, perhaps, of our own exiſtence, than that we are free creatures.</p>
                  <p>BUT it will perhaps be ſaid, that tho' we do, indeed, <hi>ſeem</hi> to ourſelves to be free; yet we may not <hi>really</hi> be ſo: This may be all a deluſion.—To which it is anſwered, that if this ſhould in fact be the caſe, it is impoſſible for us to know it to be ſo; or to have any reaſon to think it ſo; ſince we are as immediately and experimentally certain of our freedom, as we are of any one thing whatever, with the ſingle exception mentioned before. Thoſe notions and principles, which lead People to doubt of their freedom, muſt in their own nature, be far more precarious than <hi>that</hi> is. We might as well call in queſtion the teſtimony of any, or all of our ſenſes, as doubt the truth and certainty of our experience in this caſe; this conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our freedom, I mean, whatever ſpeculative difficulties may lye in the way. We might as plauſibly, at leaſt, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the exiſtence of an external, material world; queſtion whether we <hi>really</hi> ſee, hear, ſmell, taſte or feel, any thing; becauſe of the difficulties which occur reſpecting the <hi>modus</hi> of that communication and intercourſe, which there is betwixt <hi>body</hi> and <hi>mind:</hi> We might as plauſibly, at leaſt, ſay, that tho' things <hi>ſeem</hi> to be ſo and ſo; yet they may not be <hi>ready</hi> ſo; but we be deluded by falſe appearances: We might, I ſay, as plauſibly talk thus, as call in queſtion the <hi>reality</hi> of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becauſe we cannot clearly ſee <hi>how</hi> we can be free, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with ſome ſpeculative opinions; nor fully ſolve all the difficulties ariſing upon the ſuppoſition of our being ſo. The <hi>former</hi> is not more certainly a matter of daily experience to us, than the <hi>latter:</hi> We are conſcious of, and feel, our freedom <hi>within</hi> us, as truly and certainly as we ſee or feel cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal objects <hi>without</hi> us.</p>
                  <p>IF men will not reſt ſatisfied with ſuch experience; but will ſtill doubt the truth of their own outward ſenſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conſciouſneſs; ſaying, that tho' things <hi>ſeem</hi> to be thus, yet they may not be ſo in <hi>reality;</hi> there is no remedy—Theſe are the faculties which the Author of our beings has given us: Nor have we any other way of coming to the truth, which is better than this, or even ſo ſure and infallible. If the truth of theſe faculties, or the certainty of the teſtimony which they bear, is called in queſtion, we are, of courſe, reduced to a total abſolute <hi>ſcepticiſm;</hi> having no <hi>Data,</hi> no firſt principles, on which to proceed in any caſe whatever; whether with reference to religion, or common life: We may doubt of every thing, or believe any thing; even <hi>tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> will be no longer an abſurdity, or incredible for the good old <hi>proteſtant reaſon,</hi> that it is a contradiction to <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>common ſenſe.</hi> For altho' all our ſenſes <hi>ſeem</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it; yet it <hi>may</hi> be really true—</p>
                  <p>CERTAINLY thoſe things, of which we have ſuch an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſciouſneſs, ſuch an experimental knowledge, as is here intended, and as we actually have reſpecting our own freedom; ought not to be called in queſtion, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>ſpeculative</hi> difficulties: Which muſt neceſſarily, and in their own nature, be more doubtful and precarious. We are to look upon the former as <hi>firſt principles,</hi> (as they really are) from which if we once depart, we have abſolutely no footing; no ground at all left to ſtand upon; but are plunged into an abyſs, or endleſs labyrinth of doubts, from whence no clue can extricate us—And, indeed, what a <hi>paradox</hi> is this? that men ſhould deny what they acknowledge <hi>ſeems,</hi> even to themſelves, to be true from <hi>experience,</hi> on account of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties merely <hi>ſpeculative!</hi> This is the caſe with relation to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: For theſe men univerſally confeſs, that they <hi>ſeem</hi> to themſelves to be free.—This is ſuch a degree of <hi>ſcepticiſm;</hi> it is ſuch <hi>infidelity</hi> to common-ſenſe; ſuch a want of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> therein, and to thoſe faculties which God has given us for the more immediate, and the moſt infallible, guide of life; that one would think it impoſſible, were there not examples of it! Moreover,</p>

                  <p>THE doctrine of liberty only accords naturally to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe of things, of actions and characters, which all mankind in all ages, in all countries, have had, and have: I mean, their ſenſe of ill deſert, and its contrary, both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. It is indeed the notion or ſuppoſition of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, (ever intimately preſent to the human mind, tho' ſome perverſely diſown it: It is, I ſay, this idea of liberty) which partly conſtitutes that moral ſentiment, and internal feeling, which is here intended. All men know what <hi>peculiar</hi> ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>that</hi> is, which poſſeſſes the human mind, upon ſeeing, or only hearing of, ſome remarkable inſtance of cruelty, injuſtice or perfidy. This ſentiment (or, call it what you pleaſe) is cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with the notion of liberty: Or rather, the former cannot be, without the latter; which is really a conſtituent part of it. There is ſometimes indeed a momentary reſentment and anger, reſembling it, raiſed in our breaſts, even againſt inanimate, <hi>inactive</hi> beings. But we ſoon check ſuch reſentment by reflecting, that <hi>that</hi> at which we are angry, was inti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely paſſive, that it had no ſelf moving, active principle; but was actuated in ſome manner, as to itſelf, quite unavoidable. This ſingle reflection, that the being, or thing, could not help, could not avoid what has happened, immediately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; tho' we may have received harm and damage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Which ſhows, that there is a cloſe, an intimate connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, betwixt the ideas of <hi>blame-worthineſs</hi> and <hi>liberty;</hi> ſo that the former cannot be without the latter, as was hinted before. Nor can a man calmly and cooly think any action really culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or him that did it, of ill-deſert, without preſuppoſing, that he was a free being: At leaſt no man can think ſo, 'till he has <hi>made himſelf</hi> another <hi>kind</hi> of creature than God made him.</p>
                  <p>AND now, ſince the great Author of our being has framed our minds in ſuch a manner, that we thus naturally connect the idea of liberty, with that of demerit, or ill-deſert; ſo that it is almoſt, if not altogether impoſſible, to have the latter of them without the former; we may fairly conclude, that <hi>He Himſelf</hi> cannot reſent, or be angry with his creatures for, any thing beſides the abuſe, or the neglect, of their own freedom and active powers. Conſequently, He neither does, nor will puniſh them, properly ſpeaking, for the omiſſion of that which they had no power to perform, or the doing of that which they could not forbear. We cannot be more certain that there is really a righteous moral government eſtabliſhed in the univerſe, than we are of this: We cannot even have the idea of ſuch a conſtitution, without taking this ſuppoſition along with us, our minds being moulded and faſhioned as they are. And whether it becomes Us to attribute ſuch a kind of proceeding to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Lord of all, as we all neceſſarily condemn in each other, under the names of <hi>cruelty, injuſtice, tyranny, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> all are left to judge!—</p>
                  <p>BUT it is particularly to be obſerved, that both the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> revelations, proceed wholly upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that men are free creatures. This point is never once brought into queſtion; but is always taken for granted: And upon this foundation the whole ſuperſtructure of precepts, exhortations, promiſes and threatnings, is apparently built: Revelation, in this reſpect, exactly co-inciding with, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to, the natural ſentiments, the common feelings of men's own breaſts and conſciences. So that human liberty is, in fact, the true baſis of the moral conſtitution of things; or God's moral government as diſtinguiſhed from his natural: It is the baſis of <hi>all religion,</hi> whether natural or revealed. And from hence it follows, that any ſyſtem of principles which militates againſt this doctrine; or which cannot be ſupported, but by the denial of it, muſt <hi>neceſſarily be falſe;</hi> and (tho' chriſten'd by the venerable name of <hi>religion</hi>) muſt be a <hi>real contradiction to all religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT if it could be truly ſaid, (as it cannot) that Chriſtianity either aſſerts, or ſuppoſes, men not to be free creatures; 'tis plain, Chriſtianity ought not to be credited. For we are more certain of this <hi>fact,</hi> that we are free, from daily <hi>experience;</hi> than we can be of the truth of Chriſtianity, in the way of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, deduction,</hi> or <hi>reaſoning:</hi> Which reaſoning all mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly depends on the truth of ſome <hi>hiſtorical facts,</hi> of which we muſt, in the nature of the thing, be leſs certain than we are of the <hi>other.</hi> No revelation, therefore, can poſſibly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the doctrine of human liberty: So far from this, that any pretended one which contradicts it, ought to be accounted an <hi>impoſture,</hi> for that very reaſon. We could not <hi>rationally</hi> have been believers in Chriſt, without being firſt believers in our own ſenſes, had we been ſpectators of his miracles; or, even the <hi>ſubjects</hi> of them, <hi>feeling in our bodies,</hi> that we were healed by him: (<hi>Mark</hi> 5. 29.) Nor can any man ſet Chriſtianity at variance with the experience and feeling, with the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of mankind; or exalt <hi>faith</hi> to triumph in their ruines; without being firſt more truly an Enemy to <hi>them,</hi> than he is a Friend to religion afterwards—</p>
                  <p>WHAT good ends Chriſtians can propoſe to themſelves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in making it a <hi>queſtion,</hi> whether men have liberty or not? (which, ſurely, is never made <hi>one</hi> in the holy ſcriptures) I am unable to conceive. But their attempting to eſtabliſh the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is ſtill more ſurpriſing; unleſs they were ſure that they were right, beyond the poſſibility of a miſtake: For ſhould they happen to be wrong, they cannot well be inſenſible of the fatal miſchiefs which may naturally follow, if they could perſwade people to believe, that they <hi>can chuſe and act no otherwiſe than they do;</hi> thus furniſhing them with a full and ample excuſe for all the impieties, and villanies, which they are either guilty of at preſent, or may have an inclination to commit! And how <hi>gravely</hi> ſoever men may talk, or write, while they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to reconcile the doctrine of neceſſity with our daily experience; with our natural notions of virtue and vice, merit and demerit; with a righteous moral government, and with the religion of the <hi>Bible;</hi> I muſt confeſs it appears to me, to be no better than <hi>formal, ſolemn</hi> trifling upon a ſubject, which ought not to be trifled with! In ſhort, if any ſpeculative prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple can be juſtly ſaid to be contrary to the common ſenſe, or ſentiments, of mankind; to be immoral; to be impious; it is <hi>this,</hi> of an univerſal neceſſity: For it really <hi>terminates</hi> in <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> if purſued in its juſt and natural conſequences.</p>
                  <p>IT is, probably, a great while before men can bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves heartily to acquieſce in this opinion: Common reaſon and ſenſe greatly reluct at it. And if it ever ſits quite eaſy upon peoples minds at laſt, it is becauſe their minds are, <hi>by ſome means or other,</hi> corrupted and debauched. Some perſons, doubtleſs, have recourſe to this doctrine, as a <hi>ſalvo</hi> for their vices; and that they may find reſt from a <hi>guilty conſcience.</hi> For this is a ſhort, tho' not a wiſe and ſafe method, for men to rid themſelves of the remonſtrances and upbraidings of <hi>that</hi> offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, troubleſome companion: Tho' I would not, by any means, ſuggeſt, that this is <hi>always</hi> the caſe.—</p>
                  <p>OTHERS ſeem to have embraced this doctrine, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tho't it follow'd from ſome <hi>philoſophical</hi> and <hi>anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> principles, which they had laid down, and were not willing to part with. Thus, particularly, a learned Phyſician and Anatomiſt, who, not long ſince, wrote in defence of it, tells the world, That he had great reluctance at embracing it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeemed to him, at firſt, to be inconſiſtent with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural idea of vice and virtue, and the principles of religion; (in which he ſeems to have been a ſerious believer) However, he ſays, he found himſelf obliged to admit it, in conſequence of his <hi>hypotheſis</hi> concerning the <hi>vibratory</hi> motion of the <hi>nerves;</hi> the <hi>medullary</hi> ſubſtance; the <hi>ſpinal</hi> marrow, &amp;c.!</p>
                  <p>IF ſome other Gentlemen had, with equal plainneſs and honeſty, declared to the world their reaſons for embracing this doctrine of neceſſity, it is probable they would have ſaid, "It was becauſe they were <hi>reſolved,</hi> at all adventures, to defend <hi>their (religion,</hi> ſhall I call it? or <hi>irreligious?) hypotheſis;</hi> which they knew not how to defend well without it." How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>That ſyſtem of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>heology</hi> is, perhaps, as indefenſible with, as without this doctrine: Since it is, hereby, weakened and pulled down <hi>in ſome reſpects,</hi> in the ſame proportion that it is ſtrengthened and built up in <hi>others.</hi> The doctrine of neceſſity, if true, would, indeed afford a ſolution of ſome of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties reſpecting fore-knowledge, predeſtination, and <hi>Their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical</hi> converſion: But if theſe Gentlemen deſign, in <hi>Their ſyſtem</hi> to vindicate the <hi>moral</hi> Character of God, and the equity of his dealings; particularly in conſigning the <hi>wicked</hi> to endleſs torments, <hi>rather</hi> than the <hi>holieſt</hi> man on earth, or <hi>angel</hi> in heaven; if this, I ſay, is ready <hi>any part</hi> of their deſign, they are ſo far from receiving any help at all, in this reſpect, (wherein they needed ſo much) from the doctrine I am ſpeaking of; that <hi>that</hi> which was before their <hi>grand difficulty,</hi> is heighten'd, hereby, into an <hi>abſolute impoſſibility</hi>—For</p>
                  <p>IT is to no purpoſe for theſe Gentlemen to tell us, That <hi>vicious</hi> men are <hi>juſtly</hi> puniſhed, becauſe they are not actuated by a foreign, <hi>external</hi> conſtraint; but will, and chuſe to ſin, and do it voluntarily: Which is the method in which ſome of them have endeavoured to vindicate the divine juſtice in the perdition of the wicked. This is equally evaſive and futile. For what they call <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>chuſing</hi> to ſin, and doing ſo <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,</hi> is either that which the ſinner might have avoided, or that which he could not avoid: Let them <hi>chuſe</hi> their alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native If they ſay, this was avoidable; then the doctrine of neceſſity is given up: If, unavoidable; then the objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt puniſhing the ſinner for it, remains in its full ſtrength: For if the ſinner (it ſeems we <hi>muſt ſtill call him ſo!</hi>) could not poſſibly have avoided thus <hi>willing, chuſing,</hi> and acting; but was, in every ſucceſſive moment of his exiſtence, even from the firſt, laid under a neceſſity of doing juſt as he did; whether this were owing to any <hi>external</hi> conſtraint, or to ſome <hi>internal, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal</hi> byaſs, or impulſe of <hi>nature;</hi> makes not the leaſt altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the caſe, ſo far as divine juſtice is concerned in it. He is as blameleſs on the latter ſuppoſition, as he would be on the former: And if it would be unrighteous to puniſh him on one; it would be equally ſo, to do it on the other—</p>
                  <p>BUT what was intended at firſt, only for a ſhort <hi>marginal</hi> note, is already become a very long one. I ſhall however, juſt add, that it is aſtoniſhing to ſee ſome <hi>apparently</hi> ſober, religious men, ſo ſollicitous to eſtabliſh <hi>Their</hi> doctrine of the divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, of the uncontroulable ſovereignty, and all-determining providence of God, as to do it at the expence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of this divine principle of faith, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the complex ſenſe here ſpoken of, ſhould not externally walk agreably to the goſpel; or that he ſhould continue to work iniquity. For this would be to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a man might be wicked exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; and yet be internally pious and holy! Whereas our Saviour ſays, with reference to this very point, That <q>EVERY good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree CANNOT bring forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</q>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 17, 18.</note> Faith, conſidered in this large ſenſe, ſeems to have a cloſe and inſeperable connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with chriſtian obedience: In any other ſenſe of the term faith, it has no ſuch connexion therewith. And it may be added, that no man can obey the goſpel as a chriſtian ought to do, without having this divine principle in his heart: If this is wanting, a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally wicked; and ſo not juſtified; nor intitled to the glorious promiſes of the goſpel, whatever his external behaviour may be.</p>

perſwaded, it is <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus</hi>—Nor do I know how I can conclude this diſcourſe better, than by beſeeching you all, to ſee that your faith is improved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a practical principle of holineſs and obedience in your hearts, as has been now ſpoken of. Without faith, in this ſenſe; or unleſs people have ſuch a pious truſt and confidence in God, thro' Chriſt; ſuch a perſwaſion of his goodneſs and holineſs; of the truth of his promiſes and threatnings, that they are formed into the divine image; and internally reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the divine will; their outward behaviour, however irreproachable, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well-pleaſing in God's ſight; as that of Chriſt's faithful ſervants is. There is a faith which is dead for want of works: There may alſo be works which are dead, for want of faith; I mean for want of a truly pious and chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at the bottom, in conjunction with what is more uſually termed faith. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, our external obedience is ſcarce better than mere formality, and empty ceremony; ſince God looketh at our hearts. That is not a pure fountain, from whence ſuch obedience flows: Nor are thoſe who perform it, truly made alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by Jeſus Chriſt; They have not yet in them that <hi>well of living water, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the forgoing diſcourſe; we are now to conſider the <hi>extent</hi> of it; and to give a ſhort deſcription thereof, as it is found in good men, who are the heirs of ſalvation. This was the laſt head of diſcourſe propoſed, when we entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="unknown:007488_0314_102B91C5523CF9D0"/>
I HAVE, more eſpecially, two reaſons for ſpeaking of the <hi>extent</hi> of chriſtian o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and giving a ſhort deſcription of it, as it is actually found in the hearts and lives of Chriſt's true diſciples. One is, that they who are <hi>really</hi> chriſtians, and not only <hi>nominally</hi> ſuch, may have the great and bleſſed ſatisfaction of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this character belongs to them; and ſo may reaſonably <hi>hope for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God unto eternal life;</hi> being ſtill excited by this very hope, to purify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves yet more; to make farther progreſs in piety and virtue; and to <hi>perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God.</hi>—The other end which I have in view, is, that thoſe who are not truly <hi>doers of the word,</hi> may not <hi>deceive their own ſelves;</hi> that they may not hope to be <hi>bleſſed in their deed;</hi> but may know wherein they fall ſhort of what is neceſſary to conſtitute the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an character; and ſo be excited to amend their ways, 'till they come up thereto.</p>
            <p>THESE two ends may, by the bleſſing of God, be both attained by laying before you the chriſtian rule of life and conduct, (by which we are to be judged hereafter) in order to your comparing your own tempers and manners therewith. Thoſe whoſe hearts and manners correſpond to this law of liberty, (allowing for ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:007488_0315_102B91C732870B18"/>
as may properly come under the head of human infirmities) may juſtly have confidence towards God; and <hi>aſſure their hearts before Him.</hi> On the other hand, thoſe whoſe own hearts condemn them, as being preſumptuous, wilful tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of this <hi>law of liberty,</hi> may be equally ſure that they are not heirs to the bleſſings annexed to the obſervance, but to the condemnation annexed to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of it. The goſpel, as it is a rule of life to us, and as we behold the glory and perfections of God therein, is a ſort of ſpiritual fountain, or intellectual mirrour; by looking into which, we may diſcern the true features and lineaments of our ſouls. In this it is, that the good man may diſcover the <hi>beauty of holineſs</hi> (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine image) in himſelf, as it were by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion from it: It will give him back, and make him ſee, his own likeneſs; his <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelf:</hi> And, at the ſame time that it ſhews him all that is truly beautiful and amiable in his <hi>inner man,</hi> it will alſo ſhew him, wherein <hi>that</hi> ſtill needs poliſhing and adorning. By means of this, the wicked may likewiſe come to a ſight of their moral deformity: For this glaſs repreſents uglineſs and deformity in their juſt and proper colours, no leſs than it does beauty and comelineſs, in <hi>their</hi>'s: It is not a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="unknown:007488_0316_102B91C8C2B129C8"/>
one, which will either flatter the bad, or bely the good; but it will truly ſhew every perſon to himſelf, who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking a careleſs ſide-glance at it, looks full and direct upon it, with an open and honeſt face. Nor ſhould either the good or bad, having looked into it when preſented before them, and beheld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, <hi>go their way and forget what manner of men they are.</hi>

                  <hi>James</hi> 1. 24.</note> But this is often done by vicious men; who do not like to <hi>retain</hi> either God, or themſelves <hi>in their knowledge</hi> and remembrance. They are diſguſted at the ugly image repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, when they ſee themſelves in contraſte with the purity and holineſs of God, as exhibited to them in His word. Far different from <hi>Narciſſus</hi> in the <hi>fable,</hi> who was loth to loſe ſight of himſelf in the chryſtal ſtream; and ſo would have gazed forever; <hi>They</hi> are generally for loſing ſight of themſelves as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Such a diſagreable and loathſome object as a ſinful, polluted, guilty ſoul, fills them with horror, inſtead of delight; and they are uneaſy 'till the very idea of it is eraſed from their Minds. Good men, on the other hand, receive a ſacred pleaſure by obſerving the image and ſuperſcription of God in their own hearts, while they are contemplating His word; tho' this is

                  </gap>. 12.</note> It is manifeſt that our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not truly chriſtian, unleſs we pay a religious regard to the whole evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical law, however <hi>broad</hi> this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be; and how many <hi>points,</hi> or diſtinct precepts, ſoever, it may be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into. People may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as they pleaſe, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it as eaſy as they pleaſe, to be truly pious and good. But one may be bold to ſay, that no man was ever altogether a chriſtian, without giving his heart intire,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:007488_0318_102B91CCDE85B0B0"/>
and undivided, to God thro' Chriſt; ſo as to be internally diſpoſed to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all his known commandments. There is no true principle of chriſtian piety and goodneſs in the heart, but what is an univerſal one; not confined to this, or the other precept and duty, but extended to all of them in general. This will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to any one, who attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what is implied in a principle of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, and of ſubmiſſion to his authority. For this is really a principle uniform, and conſiſtent with itſelf, thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. He that truly loves virtue, as being what it is, loves it univerſally; tho' a man may in many caſes put on the appearance of it, without really loving it at all. So he that truly loves God, and reverences his authority, as ſuch, reverences it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, ſo as to have a temper of mind diſpoſed to ſubmit, in all reſpects, to the divine will, without reſerve or limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this reſpect, there is a wide difference betwixt a due principle of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's will, as diſcovered to us in the goſpel of his Son, and a principle of obedience to any human authority, whether civil or parental. No one but God, has an abſolute, unlimited authority over us. We may therefore (and indeed ought to) have reſerves in our breaſts,

<pb n="314" facs="unknown:007488_0319_102B91CE686143D8"/>
with regard to all human authority; not being obliged, in reaſon, to yield up our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intirely to the will and diſpoſal of men; or to do whatſoever may, by them, be injoined upon us. We are bound to reverence, and ſubmit to, our natural pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the civil Powers, ſo far as their right of commanding extends: If we do ſo, it is ſufficient. But if we have not a diſpoſition thus to ſubmit to all their rightful commands, we can neither have the temper of dutiful children, nor of loyal ſubjects: <hi>i. e.</hi> we cannot have either a true principle of filial obedience, or of obedience to the Powers that are <hi>ordained of God.</hi> Apply this to the caſe in hand; to that obedience which we owe to God; and then the argument will ſtand thus: The authority of our Saviour, or that authority of God, with which he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, has no limitation, beſides thoſe which God's own infinite wiſdom, juſtice and goodneſs, fix and preſcribe to it: which is, in effect, to ſay that it has none at all—There is nothing, which can in the nature of things, interfere with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch a Being, ſo as to limit it, to ſuperſede it, or ſet it aſide: It is in its own nature both <hi>ſupreme</hi> and <hi>univerſal.</hi> Is it not, then, evident that our obedience ought to be without any reſerves, exceptions
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:007488_0320_102B91D0A60B8080"/>
or limitations? and that God's holy will and commands, as made known to us in the goſpel, are the only meaſure and ſtandard of that obedience which is truly chriſtian? Is it not incongruous to imagine, that we can really reverence the divine authority, with reference to <hi>any</hi> of the divine commandments, without doing ſo as to <hi>all</hi> of them? The ſame principle of love, reverence and ſubmiſſion, to God and our Saviour, which is even neceſſary to conſtitute a truly chriſtian obedience to any one commandment; muſt and will run thro', and take place with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the whole divine law; to all points and branches of it. It is, in the very nature of it, an uniform, univerſal principle; which regards the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as ſuch; and is therefore co-exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the divine commandments: They alone can limit and bound it, in thoſe perſons, in whom it really takes place. My meaning is, that no man who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely loves and reverences God, and, from this principle, lives conformably to <hi>ſome</hi> of his commandments; can perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere from time to time in known, wilful diſobedience to <hi>others</hi> of them; or even to <hi>one</hi> only. It is a contradiction. We may therefore be as certain, as we can of any thing, that he who has not a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:007488_0321_102B91D2E2F9FAC0"/>
to obey the goſpel univerſally, has not a truly pious diſpoſition to obey it at all; <hi>i. e.</hi> that he has no principle of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which comes up to the evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtandard. Knowingly and habitually trangreſſing any one commandment, is a demonſtration that a man obeys no others in the manner which he ought to do. He has not <hi>cut off that right hand;</hi> he has not plucked out <hi>that right eye which offends.</hi> Either <hi>mammon,</hi> or ſome other worldly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has the poſſeſſion of, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over his heart; and ſtill ſeparates it from God. There is ſomewhat, in this caſe, which has the preheminence, and ſupremacy in a man's heart: It is plain that God has it not: If He had, a man could not thus preſumptouſly tranſgreſs one of his commands from time to time, for the ſake of ſerving another maſter: And <hi>his ſervant he is, to whom he obeys.</hi> He is not truly the ſervant of God and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: he does not truly, and in the manner he ought to do, obey any of God's laws; which cannot be done, without a ſupreme love to him, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of his authority as ſuch. So that known habitual ſinning, in any caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is a proof, that a man is, in ſome ſort, guilty with reference to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; tho' he may ſeem to keep
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:007488_0322_102B91D46A6CC760"/>
them all, with one ſingle exception.</p>
            <p>THIS is not ſo much my own reaſoning, as it is St. <hi>James'</hi>s; for I muſt now confeſs to you, that I borrowed it all from <hi>him.</hi> You have it compriſed in the 10th and 11th verſes of the 2d chapter of his epiſtle—<q>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all. For he that ſaid, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill: Now if thou commit no adultery; yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the [whole] law.</q> The meaning is not, that one offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes all other offences in it, or <hi>makes</hi> a man a tranſgreſſor of the whole law, becauſe this is offending againſt that one ſupreme authority, which binds all the commandments upon us: This is, I think, a forced, unnatural conſtruction; and very remote from the true ſpirit, and ſenſe of the paſſage. The apoſtle aſſerts no ſuch thing: But what he intends is, that offending in one point, tho' it does not of itſelf <hi>make</hi> a man guilty of all, yet it proves him to be ſo, and he certainly is ſo, in ſome degree, tho' he may <hi>ſeem</hi> to keep the whole law, excepting in that one point. And the argument to prove this [ver. 11,] is concluſive, if underſtood thus—That God who has forbid one
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:007488_0323_102B91D64DF8E780"/>
crime, has forbid all others: Therefore, if you truly reverence his authority, you will obey <hi>all</hi> his commandments: And tho' you may pretend to obey many of them, and appear both to yourſelves and others to do ſo; yet if you habitually and preſumptuouſly diſobey any <hi>one</hi> of them, it is certain you do not obey any of them, as you ought to do; and, therefore, muſt be more or leſs guilty with reſpect to all points of chriſtian duty. This ſeems to be plain and intelligible: But if the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument needs further illuſtration, it will receive, from the laſt verſe but one in the preceeding chapter—<q>If any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you <hi>ſeem</hi> to be religious, and bridleth not his <hi>tongue,</hi> but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</q> The obvious meaning of which is, that how religious ſoever any man may <hi>ſeem</hi> to be; yet if his tongue is not under any reſtraint; if he offends in that <hi>one point;</hi> he is deceived in himſelf; all his religion is ſcarce better than <hi>ſhew,</hi> and vain formality: He has no real principle of piety or goodneſs in him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be guilty, in a degree, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all points, even thoſe wherein he may <hi>ſeem</hi> to keep the law. There is nothing forced in this conſtruction. And may not what the apoſtle ſays concerning
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:007488_0324_102B91D8897F1378"/>
that one point, of not <hi>bridling</hi> the tongue, be applied to all other vicious, immoral practices? May it not be ſaid, with equal certainty, that if any man among us <hi>ſeem</hi> to be religious; and yet is a <hi>Thief,</hi> a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Liar,</hi> an <hi>Extortioner,</hi> or <hi>Adulterer,</hi> &amp;c. this man's religion is alſo <hi>vain?</hi> that he has not the fear of God before his eyes, nor the love of God, and of his Saviour in his heart? that he is no true diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt; but that all his religion is mere formality and ſhew? that tho' he may, to outward appearance, keep the whole law, one point of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; yet he really obſerves none of the commandments, from a principle of love and reverence to God and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? that he is, therefore, really guilty, in a degree, with reference to all points even of the law of liberty? and that he muſt therefore be condemned as a tranſgreſſor of this whole law?—This ſeems to be evidently true; and it is, I think, the plain doctrine of St. <hi>James.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>I HAVE in part, tho' not wholly, followed the common interpretation of <hi>James</hi> 2. 10, 11.

                  </p>
                  <p>HIS Lordſhip judges, that the common interpretation is <q>evidently liable to all the difficulties of the <hi>Stoic'</hi>s paradox that all offences are equal—So that there will be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between killing your neighbour and your neighbour's horſe; for he that has forbid you killing your neighbour, has likewiſe forbid you doing any act to the hurt and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your neighbour.</q>

                  <p>HIS Lordſhip ſays farther, that <q>the apoſtle's inference in the latter part of the verſe [i. e. ver. 11.] does not anſwer to the principle laid down in the former,</q> in the common method of interpretation. <q>

Why may not the ſame paradox be alſo avoided, in the old way, by ſaying, that tho' every tranſgreſſion is, in a ſort, the violation of all God's law in general, as it is a violation of that <hi>one</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral authority, on which all laws depend; yet the nature and circumſtances of ſome ſins againſt this one great authority, may render them more heinous than others? <q>To <hi>ſome</hi> men who have plain ſenſe, and can follow it,</q> there will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, appear no more <hi>abſurdity</hi> in this latter method of ſolving the difficulty, ſo far as it relates to the <hi>ſtoical</hi> paradox, than there will appear in the former.</p>
                  <p>AND tho' his Lordſhip is pleaſed to ſay, that <q>the apoſtle's inference in the latter part of the [11th] verſe, does not anſwer to the principle laid down in the former,</q> in the old way of interpretation; I muſt beg leave to think it anſwers as well thereto, in this, as in his Lordſhip's interpretation: Tho' One would not diſſent from ſuch an acknowledged maſter of reaſon and critical learning, but with caution and diffidence. This 11th verſe evidently contains the grounds of the aſſertion in the preceeding verſe, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> 
                     <hi>That whoſoever offend, in one point is guilty of all</hi> [points.] And conſidered in this light, the meaning of the inference. <hi>Thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the law,</hi> muſt be this, Thou art a tranſgreſſor of the <hi>whole</hi> law, ſo as to make thee <hi>guilty of all;</hi> as it is expreſſed ver. 10. This is the deſign of the argument, both in his Lordſhip's method of interpretation, and in the other; it is common to them: Only his Lordſhip confines the words, <hi>guilty of all,</hi> to the great law of charity; the perſon ſpoken of, is guilty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>whole</hi> law, tho' not of all laws in general. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably hereto, his Lordſhip, by a tranſgreſſor of the law, ver. 11. underſtands <q>a tranſgreſſor of this <hi>whole</hi> law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. So that in both methods of interpretation, the inference in the latter part of ver. 11, muſt anſwer, not only to the principle laid down in the former part; but alſo correſpond to the Propoſition to be proved, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz,</hi>
                     </abbr> that he who offends in <hi>one</hi> point is guilty of <hi>all</hi> (points.) And the queſtion is, How this inference anſwers better, either to the principle in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſe, (which is the medium to prove the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,) or to the propoſition itſelf, upon his Lordſhip's hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, than upon the old. Upon the old one the argument ſtands thus, The one great Lawgiver, on whoſe authority all laws depend; and who has ſaid, Do not commit adultery, has ſaid alſo do not kill: Therefore, if thou doſt not commit adultery, but yet killeſt, thou art a tranſgreſſor of his whole law; ſo that thou art <hi>guilty of all</hi> [points] thereof; <hi>i. e.</hi> as thou violateſt that one authority which extends equally to all points. If the inference does not anſwer to the principle, (or medium) or to the propoſition to be proved, in this way: Let us ſee, whether it anſwers to either of them any better, in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's. Upon his hypotheſis, the thing to be proved is, That whoſoever offends <hi>againſt his neighbour</hi> in one point, breaks the <hi>whole</hi> law of charity; or is <hi>guilty of all</hi> [points of that royal law.] The principle or medium of proof (in his Lordſhip's tranſlation) is this—"<hi>For the law which ſaid,</hi>" &amp;c. And the argument, I humbly conceive, muſt ſtand thus—The ſame royal law which <q>has forbid you killing your neighbour, has likewiſe forbid you doing any act to the hurt and detriment of your neighbour</q>: Therefore if thou doſt not kill thy neighbour; but yet injureſt him in any <hi>one</hi> reſpect, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of this <hi>whole</hi> law of charity; ſo that thou art <hi>guilty of all</hi> [points] thereof; <hi>i. e.</hi> as thou violateſt that one royal law, which extends equally to all points of ſocial duty and benevolence. This is evidently the true ſtate of the argument, upon his Lordſhip's hypotheſis; but I muſt confeſs I am not able to ſee, that the inference an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers any better, either to the principle, (or the medium of proof) or to the propoſition to be proved, in this method of interpretation, than it does in the old. If it does not follow, that becauſe all laws depend upon one and the ſame authority of God, therefore he who tranſgreſſeth one law, is a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the <hi>whole</hi> law, or <hi>guilty of all</hi> [points;] it ſeems not to follow, that becauſe all particular ſocial duties are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in one and the ſame law of charity, therefore he who tranſgreſſeth one branch of that law, is a tranſgreſſor of the <hi>whole</hi> of it, or is guilty of all [points] thereof. There ſeems to be as much "occaſion for niceties and diſtinctions" in one caſe, as there is in the other.</p>
                  <p>HIS Lordſhip judges, that his tranſlation "<hi>For the law which ſaid,</hi>" inſtead of—<hi>For he that ſaid,</hi> removes the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which there is, otherwiſe, in this paſſage. However he candidly allows, that <q>the words in the original are of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interpretation;</q> as they certainly are. And ſince the term <hi>law,</hi> is not in the original; and the <hi>Greek</hi> participle may be as well referred to that <hi>One Lawgiver,</hi> expreſly mentioned by St. <hi>James</hi> in this epiſtle, as to the law itſelf, whether the <hi>royal law,</hi> or the law in its utmoſt extent and latitude; there ſeems to be no real neceſſity for departing from the common tranſlation. But admitting his Lordſhip's tranſlation to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, it is not eaſy to ſee, how this helps the matter in any degree. For what is the law? or what can it ſay, conſidered independently of the will and authority of the <hi>One Law-giver?</hi> Thus abſtractly conſidered, it lays us under no <hi>obligation:</hi> nor can it be broken in a moral or religious ſenſe. It is only <hi>ink</hi> and <hi>paper,</hi> if written; only <hi>ſound,</hi> if articulately pronounced;—even tho' pronounced in <hi>Thunder,</hi> as at <hi>Sinai.</hi> So that tho' the true <hi>critical</hi> rendering were, "<hi>For the law which ſaid,</hi>" &amp;c. as his Lordſhip judges it is; yet we are obliged to recur to the will and authority of the Law-giver; and to conſider <hi>Him</hi> as ſpeaking to us in and by the law. The law, ſtrictly ſpeaking, is only the will of the Legiſlator, in ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made known to us: And this equally, whether the royal law of charity <hi>only,</hi> be intended by St. <hi>James,</hi> or the <hi>whole</hi> law of God in general. So that tho' his Lordſhip's tranſlation were received; yet this would not, I humbly conceive, in any degree, tend to eſtabliſh his ſenſe of the apoſtle's doctrine, or to overthrow the common. This ſeems to be no more than a <hi>verbal</hi> criticiſm; which cannot, in the preſent caſe, (tho' it might in many others) make the leaſt alteration in the ſenſe and true deſign of the writer: Settle this point how you will, either one way or the other; yet the reſult will be exactly the ſame at laſt.</p>
                  <p>IT muſt be added, (becauſe his Lordſhip lays ſtreſs upon it) that tho' St. <hi>James</hi> is certainly ſpeaking, in the preceeding context, more directly concerning the great law of charity and the ſocial duties; yet this does not ſeem to be a ſufficient ground for underſtanding him in the 10th and 11th verſes, as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that royal law, and of theſe duties, <hi>excluſively</hi> of others. The reaſoning here, may be naturally extended to all other laws, all other branches of duty; and ſtill be as good and concluſive, as if it were reſtrained to the law and duties of charity. And there is, perhaps, as truly a connexion betwixt all chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in general, ſo that they may be reſolved into <hi>one,</hi> 
                     <abbr>

                  <p>UPON the whole; whatever of difficulty, or paradox, there is in this paſſage, in the old method of interpretation, it ſeems evidently to <hi>remain</hi> in his Lordſhip's. For it is particularly to be obſerved, (tho' his Lordſhip has not mentioned it) That when a man who tranſgreſſeth in <hi>one</hi> point, is ſaid to be guilty of all; the word <hi>all</hi> is <hi>plural</hi> in the original; and ſo cannot naturally be refered to any <hi>one</hi> general law. It is uſed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>one point,</hi> or <hi>one reſpect,</hi> in the preceeding clauſe: And the obvious conſtruction is, that whoſoever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends thus in <hi>one</hi> point, is (<hi>in ſome ſenſe or other</hi>) guilty in <hi>all</hi> points. The grand difficulty really lies here: And this, I humbly conceive, is not, in any meaſure, leſſened by his Lordſhip's obſervations. For tho' you admit his propoſed emendation in the verſion; tho' you admit all which he ſays upon the context; tho' you allow, that St. <hi>James</hi> is ſpeaking only of that royal law of charity; (which extends to all points of ſocial duty, and prohibits all kinds of injury to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) tho' you conceed all this, ſtill the queſtion returns, Why, or in <hi>what ſenſe,</hi> he who offends in <hi>one</hi> point of this great <hi>royal law,</hi> muſt needs be a trangreſſor of the <hi>whole</hi> of that law? or quality as to <hi>all</hi> points thereof? This remains as much a difficulty, upon the ſuppoſition that the great law of charity only, is here treated of; as it is upon the old ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the apoſtle is ſpeaking of God's law in general All God's laws may be conſidered as <hi>one general</hi> law, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of various points, or branches; as well as all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar laws of juſtice and charity, may be reduced to that one, royal law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love,</hi> &amp;c. Nor has the apoſtle's reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ver. 11. any more obvious a tendency to prove, (on his Lordſhip's ſuppoſition) that he who offends in <hi>one</hi> point of the general law of love, is a tranſgreſſor of the <hi>whole</hi> of that law, or guilty of <hi>all;</hi> than it has to prove, (on the other ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that he who offends in <hi>one</hi> point of God's general, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal law, is a tranſgreſſor of the whole of that law, or guilty of <hi>all.</hi> The reaſoning, I humbly conceive, receives no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional clearneſs, weight or cogency, by ſuch a change of the ſuppoſition. For there is ſtill a general law, conſiſting of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>branches,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> of which, it is ſaid, is broken, by him that offends in <hi>one</hi> point of it. And whether it were <hi>The law,</hi> which ſaid, or the <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> &amp;c. this makes not, ſo far as I am able to ſee, the leaſt alteration in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>THAT which makes this paſſage appear ſo paradoxical as it does to many, is a palpable miſtake of St <hi>James'</hi>s ſenſe; in ſuppoſing him to aſſert ſomething which he does not; <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> that offending in <hi>one</hi> point, or as to one particular law, is what <hi>makes, renders,</hi> or <hi>conſtitutes</hi> a man guilty with reference to all others; or <q>that an offence againſt one law, is a breach of all laws, however different they are in kind or degree.</q> This would, indeed, be rather a contradiction than a paradox; and equally ſo, whether ſaid only with reference to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous points of the <hi>royal law</hi> of love; or to the various branches of God's law in general. But the apoſtle aſſerts no ſuch thing as either. He aſſerts only, that the man who thus offends in <hi>one</hi> point <hi>is</hi> [really] guilty of all; and that he <hi>is</hi> a tranſgreſſor of the [whole] law: Which is quite a different thing from ſaying, that <hi>in that very act,</hi> by which a man offends againſt one precept, he offends againſt all the reſt. Let us therefore keep to the very words of the apoſtle—"He <hi>is</hi> guilty of all" But how? in what ſenſe guilty? Certainly he does not <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> diſobey all the laws of God: For the ſame man is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the former part of the verſe, to keep the <hi>whole</hi> law, [outwardly] with <hi>one</hi> ſingle exception—Now look to the 26th ver. of the preceeding chapter; and there you will find a ſure and eaſy clue to the apoſtle's meaning: <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, that man's reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is vain.</hi> Offending in that <hi>one</hi> point, or giving a wicked licence to the tongue, is a proof that <hi>all</hi> a man's religion is vain; however religious he may <hi>ſeem</hi> to himſelf or others to be: Yea tho' he <hi>ſeem</hi> to keep the <hi>whole</hi> law in other reſpects, he <hi>deceiveth his own heart;</hi> and is guilty with reference to <hi>all</hi> the commandments: For ſince ſuch a man does not truly and piouſly obſerve <hi>any</hi> of the commandments; but his religion is all <hi>vain;</hi> certainly he is guilty in all points; or with relation to all the commandments. For there is really no medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> keeping the commandments, and <hi>really</hi> breaking them. Such a man is, therefore, guilty of <hi>all;</hi> a tranſgreſſor of the <hi>whole</hi> law. Tho' he does not tranſgreſs the whole, BY offending in <hi>one</hi> point; (which it were abſurd to ſuppoſe) yet his thus offending in <hi>one</hi> point, is a proof and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his being wicked and hypocritical at the bottom. And an evil and wicked heart is more properly a contradiction to, and a <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of, all God's commandments; than any external conformity thereto, without a pious, good heart, is <hi>obedience</hi> to them.</p>

                     </gap>oting of <hi>mere</hi> law, any ſingle deviation, tho' but for a moment, and in the leaſt point, would render a man a tranſgreſſor of that <hi>whole</hi> convenant of works; or of that whole law. The whole law in this caſe would be, in ſuch a ſenſe <hi>one;</hi> [<hi>one</hi> covenant:] that it muſt be either <hi>wholly</hi> kept, or <hi>wholly</hi> violated, by every perſon under it. There could be no medium here. Such a <hi>unity</hi> is of the very nature and eſſence of a diſpenſation merely <hi>legal.</hi> But the apoſtle is here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſtians, upon chriſtian principles; the principles of evangelical grace. And tho' he uſes the terms <hi>law,</hi> in the 10th and 11th verſes; yet he means the chriſtian law, as contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the <hi>Moſaic</hi> covenant of works: This he calls <hi>the law of liberty,</hi> ver. 12. And there is really ſuch an <hi>unity</hi> even in this covenant of grace alſo, that it muſt be either <hi>wholly</hi> kept, or <hi>wholly</hi> broken, by each man that is under it. This appears from the condition of it, on our part: Which is <hi>faith,</hi> in that comprehenſive ſenſe in which the word is often uſed in ſcripture; <hi>i. e.</hi> as including uprightneſs of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; which every man is either poſſeſſed of, or not. So that every man either <hi>wholly</hi> keeps, or <hi>wholly</hi> breaks this covenant of grace. This uprightneſs, or ſincerity towards God, is oppoſed to <hi>perfection</hi> on one hand; and <hi>both</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined hypocriſy,</hi> and to <hi>preſumptuous</hi> ſinning, on the other. It is the <hi>medium</hi> betwixt them. No ſincere chriſtian is perfect; no one is an habitual tranſgreſſor in any one point. The former is incompatible to the preſent imperfect ſtate of mankind; the latter is inconſiſtent with ſincerity towards God; or with faith, in that ſenſe of the term before alluded to. And theſe things being conſidered, the ſenſe of this paſſage will, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, be intelligibly expreſſed; and the reaſoning of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſet in a true and convincing light, in the following <hi>paraphraſe</hi> of the 10th and 11th verſes, <hi>q d.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall <hi>externally</hi> obſerve the whole goſpel rule of life, excepting in one point, wherein he knowingly and preſumptuouſly offends; tho' he may <hi>ſeem</hi> to be religious, yet that man is certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſincere piety to God; his religion is <hi>vain;</hi> he <hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi> his own Heart. This is an evidence that he obeys <hi>none</hi> of the commandments in a truly chriſtian manner; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he is guilty with reſpect to <hi>all</hi> of them in general. For remember, that the ſame great Lawgiver, who forbids murder, forbids adultery alſo; and His commands, you know, are equally obligatory in all caſes: So that whoſoever truly knows and loves Him, and ſincerely reverences his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will have no reſerves, but pay a ſacred regard to all his commandments. And therefore, tho' you ſhould not actually commit adultery, in the common <hi>groſs</hi> ſenſe; yet if you commit murder, or live in the practice of any other known ſin; this proves you to be ſuch contem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ers of God and his authority, as cannot be ſuppoſed truly, and in a chriſtian manner, to obſerve any of his laws, however you may flatter yourſelves. And if you do not properly obſerve any of them, you muſt, of conſequence, be adjudged tranſgreſſors of the <hi>whole</hi> chriſtian law; and guilty, in a greater or leſs degree, with reference to all points of your duty in general. Sincerity and piety towards God, being wanting, you are nothing; and are cut off from all reaſonable hopes of ſalvation, even tho' you are under the merciful covenant of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE been the longer in endeavouring to ſhow the true ſenſe of this paſſage, and wherein the force of St. <hi>James'</hi>s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning lies; becauſe I conceive this to be a point of real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Tho' I ſhould ſcarce have ſaid any thing upon it, in the way of <hi>criticiſm,</hi> but as an APOLOGY for myſelf; for not embracing Biſhop <hi>Sherlock'</hi>s new interpretation: Whoſe [juſtly] great name and character ſeemed to demand this; and whoſe writings are ſo much eſteemed amongſt us;—tho', by none more than by him, who has thus preſumed to diſſent from his Lordſhip.</p>

I tell thee, in the name of the living God! that thou doſt not <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> obey any one precept of the goſpel, while there is any one which thou preſumptuouſly violateſt from day to day. Thou decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thine own heart: Thou art a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the whole law, and guilty of all, rather than a true and conſcientious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the law, in any one reſpect. If thou hadſt a real principle of love and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Chriſt in thy heart, thou wouldeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all his known commandments; and not think any of them grievous: Thou wouldeſt not think of compounding with thy Creditor and gracious Benefactor thus; but be deſirous, as far as poſſible, to pay thy whole debt to him.—Thou canſt not ſerve two Maſters: Thou canſt not be half loyal to thy King and Redeemer, and half rebel: Thou art all rebel, 'till thou intirely ſubmitteſt thy will to <hi>His,</hi> and
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:007488_0335_102B91ED4B5BE5E0"/>
makeſt THAT a univerſal rule to thee to walk by;—'till thou renounceſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved luſt, which cauſes thee thus to tranſgreſs in one reſpect. However thou mayeſt flatter thy ſelf, this ſin which ſo eaſily beſets thee, is the lord which has dominion over thee; and thou art <hi>the ſervant of ſin unto death</hi>—</p>
            <p>BUT let us ſuppoſe, for the preſent, that the terms of ſalvation were leſs rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Let us ſuppoſe that the goſpel had aſſured us, that provided we heartily and ſincerely obey all the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments excepting <hi>one,</hi> we ſhall be ſaved. Tho' the very ſuppoſition of our heartily and conſcientiouſly obeying ſome of the commandments, while we ſet any one of them at nought, is abſolutely abſurd, and ſelf-contradictory; yet I will take the poſſibility of it for granted; and ſee what ſuch a <hi>gracious</hi> diſpenſation for breaking <hi>one</hi> commandment will come to—what the conſequence will be.—God being thus condeſcending, it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that it is left to every particular man to <hi>chuſe</hi> what particular command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will ſtrike out of the decalogue: Which will be <hi>that,</hi> certainly, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of which, he is the moſt averſe; <hi>that</hi> which the moſt thwarts his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular turn and temper and inclination,
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:007488_0336_102B91EF043ABBB0"/>
For example, one man has a ſtrong and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar diſpoſition to ſwearing and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; to the <hi>taking of God's name in vain:</hi> before <hi>him,</hi> the <hi>third</hi> commandment, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, falls a ſacrifice. Another is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly addicted to cozening and ſtealing: <hi>He</hi> ſtrikes out the command which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids this. Another has a peculiar diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to bely, and ſlander his neighbours: <hi>He</hi> will be at no loſs what command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is moſt grievous to him. Another has a particular pique againſt the <hi>ſeventh</hi> commandment; becauſe he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be under ſuch a reſtraint, with reſpect to his neighbours wives and daughters, as <hi>that</hi> lays him under. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is very cholerick; and could often taſte the ſweets of bloody revenge, were it not ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> With <hi>Him,</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi> commandment will find <hi>no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> And ſo on—Every man will make a ſacrifice of that commandment; of that particular precept or prohibition, which ſtands moſt in the way of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his favourite, maſter-paſſion; of that which would keep him from <hi>his own iniquity;</hi> from <hi>the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet him.</hi> Well; God is ſo gracious as to diſpenſe with the obſervation of <hi>one</hi> of his commandments, thus far, that the habitual tranſgreſſor of it, ſhall not be
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:007488_0337_102B91F155DB42B8"/>
ſubjected to condemnation; but obtain eternal life, thro' the merits of Chriſt, provided this habitual ſinner <hi>piouſly</hi> and <hi>conſcientiouſly</hi> obſerves all the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: This being the caſe, I ſay, it follows, that every man may give full ſcope to himſelf, as to that particular luſt or ſin, which his heart is moſt ſet upon. And he will doubtleſs eſteem this a great and bleſſed <hi>privilege,</hi> which he enjoys by the Goſpel; and <hi>improve it</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>IT is farther to be obſerved, that there is no <hi>one</hi> great, cardinal vice or impiety, to which one man or another is not more inclined, than to any other: And every perſon, by the preſent ſuppoſition, being permitted to practice that <hi>one</hi> ſin, which ſuits his humour and taſte the beſt; it plainly follows, that <hi>all</hi> ſins are permitted; not, indeed, all to one and the ſame man, but one to one man, and another to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No one muſt be ſo ſelfiſh as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs and monopolize all kinds of ſin: But yet all men may take them all, and ſhare them amongſt themſelves: And yet no man give up his hopes of ſalvation!</p>
            <p>NOW let me aſk any man in his ſenſes, Whether this is not to give all manner of wickedneſs and impiety a <hi>free courſe,</hi> that they may <hi>run</hi> and be <hi>glorified</hi> in the world? Is not this, in effect, to open the gates of
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:007488_0338_102B91F6F90C6E60"/>
the bottomleſs pit, for a monſtrous, <hi>helliſh</hi> ſwarm of vices to iſſue out, and overſpread the face of the earth; like the <hi>locuſts</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion, coming up from thence! How wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable? how much like hell, muſt this world be, if every man might habitually break <hi>one</hi> commandment with impunity? if one man might cheat or rob; another perjure himſelf; another blaſpheme his maker; another commit adultery; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, murder; and ſo on? Does not the preſent ſuppoſition tend to deluge the earth with a flood of wickedneſs and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. For ſince men are not generally much ſet upon the practice of more ſins than <hi>one;</hi> and ſince, upon the preſent ſuppoſition, every man may indulge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the full, in <hi>one;</hi> there is manifeſtly but little difference betwixt giving men a licence to indulge themſelves in that particular <hi>ſin,</hi> which they are the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to; and giving them the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence with reſpect to all others. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver different the two ſuppoſitions may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at firſt view, they come very near to the ſame thing at laſt: So that you had almoſt as good take off all the reſtraints and obligations of religion from men's minds, at once; and tell them they might be ſaved, altho' they habitually violated
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:007488_0339_102B91FE5B621DD8"/>
               <hi>all</hi> the commandments; as take off that obligation in <hi>one</hi> reſpect, by telling them, they may be ſaved altho' they perſevere in the breaking of <hi>one</hi> commandment. Is not ſuch an indulgence as I am ſpeaking of, abſolutely repugnant to the wiſdom and holineſs of God?—that God, who is of <hi>purer eyes than to behold iniquity?</hi> It is certainly repugnant to all ſober, rational conceptions of God, and of a moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to imagine that He gives men any ſuch diſpenſation for ſinning, tho' but in <hi>one</hi> point; or that he will have mercy upon thoſe who thus offend. Nor is this leſs contrary to the expreſs declarations of the goſpel, than it is to ſober reaſon.—But, as was ſaid before, this ſuppoſition itſelf, that men may poſſibly obey <hi>all</hi> the commandments of God, ſincerely and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as chriſtians ought to do; and yet preſumptuouſly perſevere in any known ſin, is a contradiction. There is no true and hearty obedience to <hi>any</hi> of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; there is no truly pious and holy principle in the heart of a man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>all</hi> the commandments are regarded. Piety and virtue, or evangelical holineſs, is a <hi>uniform</hi> character. No man can be habitually pious in ſome reſpects, and yet habitually impious in others: No man can truly love virtue, as ſuch, in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:007488_0340_102B91FFE5F3CE18"/>
without loving it in all. He may, indeed, do many pious and virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if you conſider them externally; and view only the ſurfaces of things: But <hi>God looketh at the heart;</hi> and while <hi>that</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains rebellious to <hi>one</hi> commandment, God accounts the tranſgreſſor, as he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, in ſome ſenſe, <hi>guilty of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole: A truly good man preſumes not to ſay in his heart, "<hi>Theſe</hi> commandments will I keep, becauſe I can do ſo, without much trouble or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to myſelf; but <hi>that</hi> other I will diſobey, becauſe it is irkſome to fleſh and blood; and requires great ſelf-denial." This is evidently the language of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs and rebellion; 'tis the language of an heart unſubdued to the authority of God; an heart unanimated with love and gratitude to Chriſt; an heart unſanctified by the Holy Spirit; and therefore <hi>unſealed to the day of redemption.</hi> The language of a truly good man's heart, is this,—"O my God! O my Redeemer, and Saviour! I am not mine own, but bought with a price: Therefore will I be <hi>wholly</hi> thine; I will glorify God in my body and in my ſpirit which are his; I will do nothing which thou haſt forbidden; I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce every luſt however dear: I will, by thy grace and aſſiſtance, <hi>walk in all thy
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:007488_0341_102B9201CE554FC0"/>
commandments and ordinances blameleſs.</hi>"—He that has not ſuch a principle of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, unreſerved ſubmiſſion to the will of God and his Redeemer, rooted in his heart; has <hi>none</hi> that is <hi>truly chriſtian:</hi> But he is ſtill <hi>alienated from the life of God thro' the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in him, becauſe of the blindneſs of his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſhown, That chriſtian piety and virtue is a uniform, univerſal principle in the heart, extending itſelf to <hi>all</hi> the precepts of the goſpel; ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever truly obeys in one inſtance does ſo in all inſtances; and whoſoever diſobeys habitually in one reſpect, is, in a ſenſe, <hi>guilty</hi> of all; I proceed now to give a more particular deſcription of this obedience, as it is found in <hi>the heirs of ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT appears from what has been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that chriſtian obedience is partly internal, partly external. It begins in the <hi>heart,</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, or a principle of real piety and virtue ſeated <hi>there.</hi> Thence it diffuſes itſelf into the actions and lives of men, regulating and animating all their outward deportment. Thoſe who are really the ſubjects of chriſtian piety, or evangelical holineſs, are the ſame men <hi>within,</hi> that they are <hi>without,</hi> or in appearance. If you could look into the breaſt of a good man you would there ſee that, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:007488_0342_102B92035641E428"/>
and anſwers to his outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; the latter being only a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and copy of the former; tho' one attends the other as certainly and invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as the ſhadow does the ſubſtance, there being an inſeparable connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. So that, on one hand, He is certainly no chriſtian, all whoſe religion is within, not exerting itſelf in a good exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal behaviour: And, on the other hand, He is no chriſtian, all whoſe religion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, having nothing which correſponds thereto in his own heart and breaſt. The one has neither the <hi>power</hi> nor the <hi>form</hi> of godlineſs: The other, tho' he has the form, yet he denies the power thereof; being like thoſe, whom our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to "<hi>whited ſepulchres,</hi> which indeed appear beautiful <hi>outwards,</hi> but are <hi>within</hi> full of dead men's bones, and of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs."</p>
            <p>AGAIN: As the precepts of the goſpel may be diſtributed under the two heads of <hi>negative</hi> and <hi>poſitive; i. e.</hi> commands prohibiting the doing of ſome things, and injoining the doing of others; chriſtian obedience may be diſtributed into <hi>negative</hi> and <hi>poſitive,</hi> likewiſe; ſo as to correſpond to theſe different kinds of precepts. The true diſciple of Chriſt accounts himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, not only to abſtain from what his
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:007488_0343_102B9204E1F392F8"/>
Lord has forbidden, but to do thoſe things which he has required. Accordingly he avoids with care, all thoſe paths which he is admoniſhed not to walk in; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly performs the duties which are injoined upon him. He knows that in the judgment of the great day, according to our Saviour's own repreſentation of it, men will be condemned, not only for committing thoſe crimes which the goſpel has forbidden, but alſo for omitting thoſe duties which it has required us to practice. He is therefore cautious, on one hand, leſt he ſhould treſpaſs againſt any of the negative commandments; and careful on the other, to fulfill all the duties and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations lying upon him.</p>
            <p>THIS leads me to obſerve, that chriſtian obedience reſpects both the <hi>morals</hi> of the goſpel, and the <hi>poſitive inſtitutions</hi> of it. A true diſciple of Chriſt eſteems himſelf bound to conform to the <hi>inſtituted</hi> worſhip, and the <hi>ritual</hi> or <hi>ceremonial</hi> part of Chriſt's religion, as well as to that part of it which we diſtinguiſh therefrom, by the name of <hi>moral.</hi> With him, every thing is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial branch of duty and obedience, which Chriſt's laws have actually and plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, by whatever name it is called, whether morality, or poſitive inſtitution. Indeed the <hi>obligation</hi> is, in a ſenſe moral,
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:007488_0344_102B9206C7898CD8"/>
altho' the duty, conſidered in itſelf, may not be ſo. For certainly we are under a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation to comply with the <hi>whole</hi> will of God and our Redeemer, in what way ſoever it is made known to us; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the light of nature, or by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and poſitive command. I do not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, aſſert that a chriſtian lays an <hi>equal</hi> ſtreſs upon every thing which Chriſt has commanded. There were ſome <hi>weightier matters</hi> of the law, of old: There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome <hi>weightier matters</hi> of the goſpel now: And our Saviour and his apoſtles, have evidently made this diſtinction. However, a ſincere chriſtian does not think any of his Lord's commandments of ſo little importance, that they need not be obeyed. There is, in ſhort, no <hi>trifle</hi> in our religion, unleſs you will ſay, that the Author of it was a <hi>Trifler!</hi>—All the real duties of it are ſolemn, weighty and important, in their reſpective places; and all ſtamped with a divine authority. The whole ſyſtem of chriſtian duties, or of chriſtianity reduced to life and practice, is like a goodly <hi>fabrick,</hi> ariſing into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, proportion and beauty, by a correſpondence and due adjuſtment of the various parts. A ſkilful <hi>Architect</hi> will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing which might contribute to the regularity, the ſtrength and beauty of
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:007488_0345_102B920959259388"/>
the whole <hi>pile,</hi> merely becauſe it is not a main <hi>pillar</hi> in the building, nor a part of the <hi>foundation.</hi> Neither will a wiſe and good man neglect any one duty, under the vain pretence, that it is not a <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> one; or that his ſpiritual <hi>edifice</hi> will ſtand ſtrong enough without it. And thoſe who excuſe themſelves from known, plain duties, under this hypocritical pretext, will find that they have not <hi>built their houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock,</hi> but only upon the <hi>ſand;</hi> and <hi>great</hi> will be the <hi>fall thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I muſt be a little more particular ſtill, in this account of the chriſtian temper and character, as it reſpects God, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, our neighbour, our ſelves.</p>
            <p>THE ſincere Chriſtian has an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled love and veneration for God, as the beſt and greateſt, and moſt glorious of Beings. He heartily reſpects and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Him; is thankful for His mercies; truſts and hopes in Him; and prizes His favour above all things. Hence it is to him as his meat and his drink to do the will of his Father, who is in heaven. He is patient under adverſity, as being ſent or permitted by Him for wiſe and good ends. In proſperity, he confides not in the uncertain things of this world; <hi>but in the living God, who giveth him all things richly to enjoy.</hi> He is truly grateful to
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:007488_0346_102B920AE05C2A18"/>
Him, as the original author and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of every thing good and deſireable, whether pertaining to life or godlineſs. He is heartily ſorry and penitent for his ſins; confeſſing them, from time to time, with humility and a contrite heart; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the forgiveneſs of them, in the ſpirit of the <hi>Publican;</hi> and imploring the divine aſſiſtance, that he may walk more as becomes a child of God for the future, and be <hi>kept by his power thro' faith unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> To which end, he does not only <hi>pray,</hi> but alſo <hi>watch;</hi> and is diligent in the improvement of all the means which God has appointed, in order thereto; thinking it great preſumption and impiety to truſt in God for ſalvation, in any other way than that which He has ordained.</p>
            <p>THE true diſciple of Chriſt, loves <hi>Him</hi> alſo in ſincerity; and heartily eſteems and honors him, as being the <hi>image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God,</hi> the <hi>brightneſs of his glory,</hi> the <hi>expreſs image of his perſon.</hi> He conſiders him as the great Ambaſſador and Prince of peace, whom God ſent into this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, guilty world, to ſave ſinners; to ſave that which was <hi>loſt.</hi> This he accounts <hi>a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation;</hi> as <hi>good tidings of great joy to all people.</hi> He loves and honors this great Miniſter of heaven, as One who has ſhown the moſt
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:007488_0347_102B920CC3EFEF40"/>
amazing kindneſs and condeſcention to guilty men, in becoming incarnate; in undergoing poverty and reproach, and <hi>enduring the contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf;</hi> in pouring out his ſoul unto death, and <hi>bearing our ſins in his own body on the tree.</hi> The true diſciple of Chriſt cannot think of theſe things, without being filled with pleaſing admiration, with holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, love and joy. And having a fixed belief of their truth, and a thorough ſenſe of them upon his heart, he accordingly repoſes his truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, in ſubordination to the Father, who ſent him on this gracious errand. He willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns himſelf into the hands of his great Redeemer, in full confidence that he is <hi>able to ſave them unto the uttermoſt, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> unto God by him;</hi> and that he is faithful to <hi>keep that which is committed to him.</hi> And knowing that God has exalted him, that he might be a <hi>Prince,</hi> as well as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> he conſiders him as his Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, whom he is bound to obey; and accordingly ſubmits to be governed by his laws. Without this he knows that Chriſt can profit him nothing. However this is not the only motive of his obedience; Love and gratitude to One, who has laid him under ſuch mighty obligations, are a ſtrong incentive thereto; and he is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:007488_0348_102B920E4D868258"/>
he can never <hi>live</hi> enough to <hi>Him,</hi> who has <hi>died</hi> for him. From theſe and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like conſiderations, the ſincere Chriſtian chearfully conforms himſelf to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of his Redeemer; often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind the time when the heavens which have received him, ſhall again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him with his mighty angels, in the glory of the Father; to be <hi>admired in all them that believe;</hi> and to render to the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable workers of iniquity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their doings: The contemplation of which final ſcene, and great deciſive day, when the <hi>myſtery of God ſhall be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> fills him with ſacred awe, mixed with holy hope and joy; all conſpiring to make him diligent that he may be found of his Judge in peace, <hi>without ſpot and blameleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRISTIAN obedience may alſo be conſidered with particular reference to our fellow-men. A chriſtian looks upon all men as his <hi>brethren</hi> by nature; as the offspring of the ſame God, the common Father of all. He accordingly bears a hearty good will and benevolence to all; eſpecially when he reflects, that Chriſt ſo loved them, as to <hi>give his life a ranſom for all.</hi> This extenſive charity makes him bear a part both in the joys and ſorrows of others: He is not an indifferent, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:007488_0349_102B92108D262A48"/>
ſpectator of the woes and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that befall his fellow-mortals; or like the rock on the ſea-ſhore, which proudly looks down on the ſhipwreck at its foot, without a groan, or ſympathizing tear. No! He feels for all; <hi>weeping with them that weep,</hi> and <hi>rejoicing with them that do rejoice.</hi> As he has opportunity, he <hi>does good to all men;</hi> but <hi>eſpecially</hi> to them that are of the <hi>houſhold of faith.</hi> He is ſincerely deſirous of acting ſuch a part upon the ſtage of life, as may render him ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the world, whatever ſtation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has aſſigned him;—ſerviceable, more particularly, to thoſe, with whom he has any ſpecial connexion or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. He therefore proceeds, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his capacity, in all the tranſactions of civil and ſocial life, by the rules of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, charity and prudence. Is he a civil ruler? The apoſtle's deſcription is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in him;—<hi>He is the miniſter of God for good; a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well.</hi> Is he a private ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? He is a quiet and peaceable one; being <hi>ſubject for conſcience ſake,</hi> and giving <hi>honor, to whom honor is due; fear, to whom fear; tribute, to whom tribute.</hi> Is he a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? He is a kind and tender one; and endeavours to promote both the preſent and future welfare of his offspring. Is he
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:007488_0350_102B92126E5FF2C0"/>
a child? He <hi>honors his parents in the Lord, knowing that this is right.</hi> Is he a maſter? He is a juſt and reaſonable one, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that he alſo has a <hi>maſter in heaven.</hi> Is he a ſervant? He is faithful and diligent, with good will doing ſervice; knowing that <hi>what good thing ſoever a man doth, the ſame he ſhall receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> The true chriſtian is juſt to all men, <hi>rendering to all their dues:</hi> He is obliging to his friends, grateful to his benefactors, placable to his enemies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate to the poor and afflicted, ſincere in his promiſes, faithful in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; more diſpoſed to cover, with the mantle of charity, the faults and follies of his neighbours, than wantonly to expoſe them. He does not judge, and condemn, and ſet at naught his brother, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of a different perſwaſion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters; this common practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as contrary to the ſpirit and genius, and to the expreſs precepts of the goſpel, as either <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> or <hi>ſtealing, adultery</hi> or <hi>profane ſwearing.</hi> In fine here; the real Chriſtian loves his neighbour as himſelf; and from this principle, does unto all men <hi>whatſoever he would that they ſhould do unto him.</hi> By this grand, comprehenſive max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, he regulates all his ſocial behaviour; even in thoſe caſes where expreſs, poſitive

precepts are wanting, as well as thoſe where they take place.</p>
            <p>LASTLY: Chriſtian obedience may be conſidered with relation to a man's ſelf. And if we conſider it in this light, the true diſciple of Chriſt keeps under his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and brings it into ſubjection: Or in the language of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place, He, <hi>thro' the ſpirit, mortifies the deeds of the body.</hi> The rational and ſpiritual part in him (which is <hi>king by divine right,</hi> in the oeconomy and conſtitution of man) bears ſway over animal nature, reſtraining the ſubject-paſſions, and giving law to them. No ſin <hi>reigns</hi> in his mortal body, ſo that he <hi>obeys</hi> it in the luſts thereof. He is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a gluttonous man, nor a wine-bibber, nor an unclean perſon; but is ſober and temperate in all things, as one that ſtrives for the maſtery. He poſſeſſeth his body in <hi>ſanctification and honor</hi>

            <p>THUS I have conſidered the <hi>extent</hi> of evangelical obedience; and given you a ſhort deſcription of it, as it is found in the hearts and lives of good men.

<pb n="347" facs="unknown:007488_0352_102B921603781790"/>
Some perſons would, probably, have been better pleaſed, if I had talked more of high <hi>flights,</hi> and <hi>raptures,</hi> and <hi>extaſies,</hi> and leſs about the <hi>morality</hi> of the chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But ſuch things, in this kind of painting, I muſt confeſs, appear to me to to be no better than vain <hi>ornaments,</hi> and <hi>flouriſhes,</hi> and a gaudy <hi>drapery;</hi> which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſcure, than heighten and improve, the beauties of a piece. The chriſtian character is ſo amiable in itſelf, without any thing of this ſort, that it ſtands in no need thereof to recommend it to thoſe, who have a true and juſt <hi>taſte.</hi> It is not every chriſtian that is caught up with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> into the <hi>third heaven,</hi> and hears <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable words,</hi> and has a <hi>multitude of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> given to him: And many that only <hi>fancy</hi> this is the caſe with them, are <hi>lifted up above meaſure;</hi> thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that they have no need to be <hi>moral.</hi> In ſhort, to ſpeak of things of this nature, I mean of theſe flights and raptures, as common to ſincere chriſtians, and the evidences of a good eſtate, (as many do) has a direct tendency to miſlead and beguile people; but none at all, to edify them, or make them <hi>wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> For which reaſon I have choſen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf within the limits of ſtrict, ſober truth, in ſpeaking upon this important
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:007488_0353_102B9218B83B4F38"/>
point. Nor can I think that any man has a right, according to the doctrine of the goſpel, to look upon himſelf as a favourite of heaven, and an heir of the promiſes, the temper of whoſe mind, and whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour, does not in general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the account given above. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that kingdom of God which is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> us, conſiſting in righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, is, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, like His external and viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: It is, as a <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed,</hi> (which is the <hi>leaſt</hi> of all) when it firſt takes root in the heart: but it afterwards becometh a <hi>tree,</hi> ſhooting its branches to heaven; and, being watered with the dew thereof, and warmed by the influences of Him, who is a <hi>Sun</hi> as well as <hi>Shield,</hi> it beareth more than <hi>twelve manner of fruit,</hi> grateful to God and man. Hence it comes to paſs, that all truly good men may not be able to ſee, with equal clearneſs, the evidence of their being ſuch; becauſe this muſt depend, in a great meaſure, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the progreſs they have made in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs. However the <hi>new-born babe,</hi> as well as the full-grown <hi>man, in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> has all the features and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a <hi>child</hi> of God: Tho' I have been ſpeaking of the chriſtian temper and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in general, without deſcending to

            <p>I HAVE been laying before you, my Brethren, that <hi>law of liberty,</hi> which is the rule of your obedience, and by which you are to be judged hereafter: I have been holding up to you that ſacred mirrour, which I mentioned to you in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this diſcourſe, in order to your ſeeing and knowing yourſelves. Have you looked into it; and beheld the true features and complexion of your ſouls? your moral and religious characters?

Do your conſciences bear you witneſs, that your hearts are upright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God? and that you come up to the character of thoſe who are <hi>doers of the word?</hi> to the character of Chriſt's faithful diſciples? Has the goſpel had its proper influence upon your hearts, ſo that you do not only <hi>ſeem</hi> to be religious, but are really and <hi>internally</hi> ſo? Do you perform the various <hi>duties</hi> required of you, as well as abſtain from thoſe <hi>ſins</hi> which God has forbidden? Do you pay a due regard both

            <p>BUT however rigorous this doctrine may ſeem to men that are wedded to this world; that are immerſed in ſenſuality and vice, inſtead of being purified in the fountain opened to waſh in, therefrom; I doubt not, but ſome of my hearers judge otherwiſe; and can truly ſay, that both their inward temper, and external conduct,

            <p>THERE are, probably, other Perſons, who are in doubt whether they come up to the character of chriſtians, or not.

But be their real ſtate and character what it will, it will certainly be no <hi>diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> to them, to endeavour to <hi>know</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="unknown:007488_0358_102B92220A28F7A8"/>
what it is; and to <hi>make their calling and election ſure.</hi> To be in <hi>doubt,</hi> in ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting and important a point, muſt needs occaſion great <hi>diſquietude</hi> in the breaſt of every good man; but it may be of <hi>fatal</hi> conſequence for the vicious to come to a <hi>wrong</hi> determination as to themſelves: And this is what they are in danger of, by reaſon of that partiality, which is ſo natural to us all; and to which vicious men are peculiarly ſubject.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding ſelf-condemnation is ſo irkſome and diſagreable; yet it is to be feared that ſome cannot avoid it; the conviction of their wickedneſs being too full and ſtrong upon their minds to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, or evaded.

ALL revealed religion is an <hi>appeal</hi> to the reaſon and conſciences of men; to the law originally written, by the finger of God, upon the fleſhly tables of our hearts.

            <p>THERE are three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the ſubject before us.</p>
            <p>FIRST, What is implied in this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked;</hi> ſo that it is extremely difficult, if not impoſſible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to <hi>know it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, What is to be underſtood by God's <hi>ſearching the heart, and trying the reins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="unknown:007488_0366_102B92326513AF18"/>
THIRDLY, The end hereof, <hi>namely,</hi> That He may give <hi>every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE things comprehend the whole ſubject, which is to employ our thoughts at this time: And, being conſidered, they will lead us to ſome practical reflections of the moſt important and intereſting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Let us conſider, what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this aſſertion, That <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked;</hi> ſo that it is extremely difficult, if not impoſſible, exactly to <hi>know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>heart</hi> of man, in the moral, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and theological ſenſe, intends the mind, or ſoul; that living, active prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within us, which thinks, chooſes, determines; and which is, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the agent in all we do whether good or bad, the body being only its inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; intirely paſſive, and therefore not, in ſtrict propriety, the ſubject of any moral or religious qualities whatever. So that to ſay the hearts of men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and wicked, and to ſay that <hi>men</hi> are ſo themſelves, amounts to the ſame thing at laſt. And accordingly, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſe, when we ſpeak of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and good, a deceitful and honeſt heart,
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:007488_0367_102B9233EFE8BD70"/>
aſcribing one to one man, and the other to another; we intend hereby to diſtinguiſh betwixt the real characters of men, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a religious or moral view; and to give to them reſpectively, that which belongs to them: This is what we deſign, in this manner of ſpeaking, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable it may be, to make ſo free with our neighbours characters, as we often do.</p>
            <p>FROM the foregoing obſervation, it is evident that when it is ſaid, that <hi>the heart is deceitful, &amp;c.</hi> it cannot be intended, that the hearts of all men are ſo: For this would be, in effect, to ſay that all men are <hi>deceitful</hi> above all things, and <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked.</hi> To ſay which, in abſolute terms, and without limitation, would in fact be, to take away that diſtinction which we always make betwixt the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of men, ſaying that theſe are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and good but thoſe falſe and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Which diſtinction betwixt men, is alſo conſtantly ſuppoſed, taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſſerted, in the holy ſcriptures. Can he be a good and upright man, whoſe heart is <hi>deceitful</hi> above all things, and <hi>deſperately wicked!</hi> If he can, he muſt be ſuch a kind of good man, as neither ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor common ſenſe, knows any thing of: So far from it, that in the language of ſcripture and common ſenſe, to ſay
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:007488_0368_102B84AD38EC7AB0"/>
that a perſon's heart, is thus <hi>deceitful,</hi> thus <hi>deſperately</hi> wicked, is to characterize him as a bad man, directly the reverſe of him, whom the ſcripture ſtyles good and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. We muſt therefore, either totally confound all characters, aſſerting that there are no ſincere good man, or elſe we muſt acknowledge that theſe words in the prophet, are ſpoken of the hearts of the wicked, excluſively of others. For it is abſolutely impoſſible to ſhow, who is the good man in diſtinction from the wicked, or who the wicked man, in diſtinction from the good, if it is common to all men to have hearts that are ſo <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>wicked.</hi> You can ſay nothing worſe of the worſt men, than you actually ſay of the beſt, if you apply this to all men in general: So that either your diſtinction betwixt good men and bad, muſt be vain and groundleſs; or elſe you wreſt and pervert the ſenſe of ſcripture, when you apply this worſt of characters to all men without exception. However, it is not deſigned in what is here ſaid, to intimate that the hearts of any men are perfectly upright and good. There is doubtleſs a degree of deceitfulneſs and wickedneſs in the hearts of the beſt. But the ſcripture does not, by any means, authoriſe us to ſpeak in ſuch ſtrong, general terms, as
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:007488_0369_102B9237B65224A8"/>
theſe in the text, concerning the hearts of thoſe, whom our Saviour himſelf diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes from others, by ſaying, that they, have an <hi>honeſt and good heart.</hi>

                  </gap>. 15.</note> Certainly no one man's heart can be both <hi>honeſt and good,</hi> and <hi>deceitful above all things, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked.</hi> To ſay both theſe things of the ſame perſons, at the ſame time, would be as palpable a contradiction as can be named. Were a man to tell me, that my heart was "deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked," how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever true this might be, I ſhould think he called me nothing better than a <hi>Knave</hi> or a <hi>Villain:</hi> And all thoſe who acknowledge this of their <hi>own</hi> hearts, do, in reality, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the ſame character belongs to themſelves; tho' I am perſwaded that many, who expreſs themſelves in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither deſerve ſuch a character, nor would be willing to take it upon them: As to ſome others, I will not be confident.—</p>
            <p>WHEN it is ſaid in the text, that the heart is deceitful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is evident that the prophet had the <hi>Jews</hi> more eſpecially in his eye, whoſe general, national character at this time, was that of a profligate, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned people, in the common groſs ſenſe; in contradiſtinction from a pious and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous people: Such they are repreſented to be, in this very chapter; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:007488_0370_102B92399A5E3A98"/>
in the firſt verſe of it—<q>The ſin of <hi>Judah</hi> is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond; it is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the table of their hearts, and upon the horns of your altars.</q> It might well be ſaid of ſuch a people, in general, that their <hi>hearts were deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked;</hi> tho' there were, doubtleſs, <hi>ſome</hi> men of an <hi>honeſt and good heart</hi> among them, even at this very time. It is evident, therefore, from the context, from the common uſe of words, and from the real diſtinction which there is betwixt characters, (which diſtinction is conſtantly ſuppoſed and aſſerted in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that what is here ſaid of the heart, is not to be refered to the hearts of all men without diſtinction. This can no more be ſuppoſed, than it can, that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, <q>Out of the <hi>heart</hi> proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thefts, falſe-witneſs, blaſphemies;</q>

That <q>there is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good, and <hi>ſinneth not.</hi>
                  </q> Which, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a very different thing from ſaying, that the heart of the holieſt man on earth is "deceitful above all things, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked."</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is to be farther obſerved, That when the heart is ſaid to be deceitful, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and moſt direct meaning, probably, is, that it is deceitful with regard to other perſons; ſo that they cannot know it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, nor ſafely repoſe an intire, abſolute confidence in a man, however juſt he may appear to be: A man may be deceitful and hypocritical in all his pretences to virtue and religion; in all his promiſes; and ſadly diſappoint thoſe who put their truſt in him—This ſenſe ſeems naturally ſuggeſted by the verſes immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding—. <q>Curſed be the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm;
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:007488_0372_102B923D7AA513A8"/>
and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why? Becauſe <hi>the heart is deceitful;</hi> and God alone, who is true and faithful, can be fully and intirely confided in. This ſeems to be the primary, and moſt obvious meaning of the paſſage. However, ſince every man who is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with reference to his neighbour, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in ſome ſenſe, deceitful and falſe to himſelf; and ſince the ſcripture notion of hypocriſy, evidently includes both theſe ſpecies of diſhoneſty; and (I may add) ſince the words of the prophet are ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that they may well enough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend both; I ſhall take the liberty to ſuppoſe, that both may be actually intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. And accordingly we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the deceitfulneſs of the heart in a twofold light; firſt, with reference to <hi>others;</hi> and then, with reference to a man's <hi>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1ſt. WITH reference to <hi>others.</hi> There is ſcarce a man, however deſtitute of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, religion, and honor, who does not, at times, put on ſome ſhew and profeſſion of them: And this is often, tho' not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done, with a fix'd, formal intention to deceive others into a good opinion of him; that ſo he may carry his worldly deſigns and projects into execution more effectually than he could, without the
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:007488_0373_102B92400F294190"/>
conveniency of a maſk. Maſks are not only uſed in <hi>kings courts,</hi> where great men are <hi>gorgeouſly apparalled,</hi> and walk in <hi>ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places;</hi> they are alſo worn in <hi>cottages,</hi> by the ignoble <hi>vulgar.</hi> And they are put on by both, for the ſame end in general; which is, that the Wearer may accompliſh ſome ſiniſter, diſhoneſt purpoſe, which he could not accompliſh ſo well without. Thoſe who pretend to a public ſpirit, to a patriotic principle of conduct, are not always the men they would be tho't to be. No! They are ſometimes as void of true honor, integrity, and love to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as the meaneſt ſycophant and court-paraſite. The maſk will, perhaps, drop off in a little while; and you will ſee theſe raving patriots become as arrant paraſites, as thoſe, againſt whom they raved; bartering all their pretended ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and public ſpirit, for the <hi>wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> or only a <hi>title.</hi> But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from theſe heights, to the inferior ranks of life.

On the other hand, he who does not find in himſelf theſe moral qualities, tho' he ſometimes puts on the ſhew of them, is inclined to think all others who pretend to them, falſe and hypocritical, or at beſt fanciful men; that all is but a maſk, in order to a perſon's carrying on his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſelfiſh deſigns—And whoever thinks thus; whoever tells me that there is no real honor, religion, virtue, or public ſpirit in the world, tells me, in other words,
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:007488_0376_102B92451252E330"/>
that he himſelf has no honor, religion, virtue, or publick ſpirit: And tho' I could believe him, if he ſaid this only of <hi>himſelf;</hi> yet I cannot, when he ſays the ſame of <hi>all</hi> other men. No one, who himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences what is termed honeſty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, religion, charity, can, in the nature of the thing, doubt whether any man can be held and influenced by theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or not. And therefore a man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that any are, or can be, thus held and influenced, is not only a tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but a plain demonſtration, that he himſelf is a wicked man, and a <hi>Villain</hi> at the bottom; and equally ſo, whether he be a <hi>low</hi> or an <hi>high-liv'd</hi> one—But not to digreſs too far—</p>
            <p>THERE is no one virtue or grace, but what is laid claim to by perſons who are deſtitute of all. The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> of whom we read ſo much in the goſpel, were, if we can believe our Saviour, ſuch men. They made many and long prayers; they faſted; they gave alms; they did many good things; ſo that they <hi>outwardly appeared righteous unto men.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mate.</hi> 23 28.</note> But, what ſaid He, who <hi>knew what was in man?</hi> He ſaid they made long prayers for a "pretence"; that they gave alms to be "ſeen of men;" that they were "hypocrites;" that they were like "whited ſepulchres;" and that they

ſhould "receive the greater damnation." Charity, the bond of perfectneſs, was <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s pretence, when he objected againſt the waſte of precious ointment on his Lord; but the truth of the caſe was, that he wanted to have it "ſold for more than three hundred pence," and the money put into the <hi>bag</hi> which he carried, being a <hi>Thief.</hi> It is not he, who pretends to have the greateſt abhorrence of diſhoneſty and kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that is the freeſt from them in his commerce and intercourſe with mankind. Nay; the moſt wicked and treacherous deſigns are often carried on under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of friendſhip: Which long ſince gave occaſion to that obſervation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that "the kiſſes of an enemy are deceitful": And this was remarkably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, when the Son of man himſelf was "betrayed with a kiſs."

               </gap> moſt ſolemn promiſes and engagements of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and friendſhip, are often ſo far from being ſtrong enough to hold him that makes them, that they are made by him, with a formal intent to break them; and to do ſome greater injury to the perſon who relies on them, than could have been done without them. In ſhort, there is no man, who has a mind to deceive, that cannot find many ways of doing it, unleſs he is a fool as well as a knave. Religion
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:007488_0378_102B9249362D1460"/>
itſelf is, perhaps, oftener made a cloke for wickedneſs, than any one thing. Tho' all men who appear religious, are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning hypocrites; yet "gravity is of the very eſſence of impoſture." And many perſons, by an affected gravity, by a ſerious kind of grimace, by a pretended ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity about ſome trivial things, by a ſhew of zeal, and a ſeries of religious tricks and artifices, have cheated the world into an high opinion of their ſanctity, without having one ſingle virtue. And it is to be obſerved, that people ſometimes put on this maſk of religion, with a formal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to impoſe upon the world; that they may indulge their vices, and injure their neighbours without being ſuſpected of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or in danger of detection. There have been ſo many known examples of this groſs hypocriſy, that we can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, infallible dependence upon any man. Thoſe, of whom we have had experience for many years, ſometimes turn out to be the reverſe of what we took them to be: And we do not know, but others may do the like hereafter; ſince we cannot know the heart: So <hi>deceitful</hi> is it, ſo <hi>deſperately wicked!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour has given us the ſureſt criterion, the moſt infallible rule, that we can go by, in forming our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:007488_0379_102B924AC43C6960"/>
about men and characters: <q>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</q> And by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to this, we may ſometimes diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe to be inwardly <hi>ravening wolves,</hi> who come to us, and live amongſt us, in <hi>ſheeps cloathing.</hi> But even this rule is, in one ſenſe, inſufficient; becauſe no rule can make Us infallible in the application of it. It is much eaſier for us to know who are, and muſt be, wicked men, than to know who are certainly good. The former is, in ſome caſes, poſſible: Since he that is viſibly immoral, impious and flagitious in the courſe of his life, cannot poſſibly be good in his heart. But on the other hand, he, whoſe behaviour is, to all human appearance, the moſt pious and unexceptionable, may yet poſſibly not be good: He may ſin where he ought to pray, <hi>in ſecret:</hi> He may be habitually guilty of many vices, which ſhun the obſervation of the world. In which caſe, his heart is certainly bad: Yea, his actions, which appear the moſt ſpecious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to us, may ſpring from ſuch principles as would rather denominate them vicious, than virtuous, in the eye of One who could penetrate to the ſource, and bottom of them.

But</p>
            <p>2dly. IT is now time to conſider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of the heart, in the other point of light propoſed, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> with relation to a man's <hi>ſelf.</hi> There is ſuch a thing as a <hi>deceived</hi> heart, an heart which deceives, and impoſes upon, <hi>itſelf;</hi> as well as an heart which is deceitful and diſhoneſt with relation to others. There are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom thoſe words of the prophet are applicable, "A deceived heart hath turned him aſide."<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 20.</note> This is a character which we often meet with. Nor is the ſcripture-notion of hypocriſy, only this, that a man ſometimes puts on the ſhew or appearance of religion and virtue, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to delude his neighbours. This hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy is of the groſſeſt kind. Every ſuch man muſt be conſcious to himſelf, that he is only <hi>acting a part.</hi> But there is a more ſubtile and refined kind of deceit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man deludes even himſelf, while he
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:007488_0381_102B924F404B5CF8"/>
is not ſenſible that he is deluding others, nor has any formal intention to do ſo. That we are thus in danger of deluſion from within, from ourſelves, is plainly implied in all thoſe paſſages of ſcripture, where we are admoniſhed not to <hi>deceive our ownſelves;</hi> to <hi>try,</hi> to <hi>prove,</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> ourſelves, and the like. And the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which we are thus warned to guard againſt, is, I ſuppoſe, what the ſcripture more generally intends by hypocriſy, than it does the groſs kind mentioned before.</p>
            <p>THIS will, probably, ſound like a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox to many, For it may be aſked, <q>What we are ſo intimately acquainted with, as with ourſelves? Do we not know what paſſes within us? our own thoughts, and deſigns? the principles and motives upon which we act? Is it not a contradiction to ſuppoſe, that we can be ignorant of theſe; or deceived about them? So that it is ſo far from being difficult for any man to know his heart, that it is impoſſible for him not to know it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT let us proceed deliberately here. Do you know your heart, in the ſenſe of an <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> when he talks about the heart, becauſe you are conſcious of your own thoughts, deſires, volitions, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> You will anſwer, No: this is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:007488_0382_102B9250C7A7F9E8"/>
thing: You muſt ſee a human body opened, the heart diſſected, and view every part of it carefully, before you can know the heart in this ſenſe. Very juſt. Well: You do not any more truly know your heart, in the <hi>moral, ſcriptural</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> ſenſe of the term, merely by being conſcious of your own thoughts, volitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than you know it in the <hi>anatomical</hi> ſenſe: But in order hereto you muſt, if I may uſe the expreſſion, ſee the <hi>ſoul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected;</hi> and examine the parts, or ſeveral powers, faculties and operations of it diſtinctly; compare them together, and the whole, with the rule of moral right. Without this, you may be intirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your hearts, or be deceived as to your own true character and temper; <hi>not knowing what manner of ſpirit you are of,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 55.</note> however conſcious you may be of your own thoughts, deſires, volitions, actions. Is it not probable? is it not certain, that many perſons have been miſtaken as to their own moral and religious character; thinking themſelves good and upright men, when they were the reverſe hereof? Is is not probable that many of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> of old, and many other perſons in later times, were, and are, thus miſtaken in themſelves; thinking their character good and honeſt, tho' really bad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt,
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:007488_0383_102B9252505DC9F0"/>
at the bottom? This will not be denied. Certainly then, there is ſuch a thing as diſhoneſty of heart, which a man is inſenſible of; ſuch a thing as ſelf-deceit; ſuch a thing as a man's impoſing upon, and cheating himſelf, in ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and doing it ſo artfully, that he does not ſtand convicted and condemned of himſelf, afterwards: He is <hi>hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> even while he cries, "<hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord;</hi>" and actually thinks he has a right to ſay to others, as thoſe <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did—<q>Stand by thyſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou.</q>

            </p>
            <p>TO lay open this whole <hi>myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> which has already worked, and, probably, ſtill works, in ſo many perſons, would require much more time than there is for it at preſent. Nothing more is, therefore, to be now expected, than ſome general hints—It is all to be deduced from, as it may all be reſolved into, two well-known principles or affections in human nature: I mean a ſenſe of moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and religion, which all men have in ſome degree, ſo that they cannot but wiſh to <hi>die the death of the righteous;</hi> and a love to this preſent world, ſo that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to enjoy the gains, the honors, the
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:007488_0384_102B93C5CF53FEF8"/>
pleaſures of it. Theſe principles, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes at leaſt, interfere with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo there ariſes a ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt betwixt them, for the dominion and ſovereignty, <hi>the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the ſpirit againſt the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſh;</hi> which <hi>two</hi> being <hi>contrary the one to the other,</hi> a man <hi>cannot do the things which he would.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal</hi> 5 17</note> He <hi>would</hi> be religious, and yet gratify his worldly luſts and paſſions: He would <hi>ſerve two maſters,</hi> both God and Mammon: He would unite thoſe things, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not really be united: He will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all pretenſions to religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for the ſake of the world; nor yet will he renounce the world for the ſake of religion and virtue: He would make the proſecution of both conſiſt together; and be under the joint ſway of two Lords; which, in this caſe, is impoſſible: No ſuch compoſition can be made.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' this is evidently the caſe; yet what is this to the deceitfulneſs of the heart? to hypocriſy? to ſelf-deception? You will preſently ſee. Every man muſt be the ſervant either of God, or of the world: He muſt be either good or bad: He muſt have a certain, determinate <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> character. But thoſe whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is really bad and vicious, are not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee and know it. They could not
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:007488_0385_102B84C489D84380"/>
but be more diſſatisfied with themſelves, if they thoroughly <hi>knew themſelves.</hi> Hence, they open their intellectual eye but half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſquint, wink hard, look aſkaunce, take only ſide-glances, and uſe a magnifying glaſs, if I may ſo expreſs it, when they take a view of any thing which they imagine commendable in themſelves, turning the other end of it, when they look upon their faults. The heart plays ſuch jugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, legerdemain tricks with itſelf! Men that are void of fairneſs and probity of mind, evidently put deceptions upon themſelves, in various ways; inſenſibly flattering themſelves, that they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly good, and upright, while they certainly are not; but live in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of flagrant immoralities, which every one almoſt, except themſelves, ſees plainly enough. So deceitful are men, even with regard to themſelves! And the clue mentioned, if purſued, would lead us thro' all the doublings, and labyrinths of a diſhoneſt heart; that <hi>den</hi> of brutal luſts and paſſions; that <hi>cage of unclean birds;</hi> that <hi>dark vault,</hi> which is <hi>full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanneſs,</hi> tho' the <hi>monument</hi> over it may appear white and beautiful.</p>
            <p>THE principle of conſcience ſometimes operates ſo ſtrongly in a man, that he cannot go directly counter to it, with his
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:007488_0386_102B84C6143BFE20"/>
eyes wide open: And yet the worldly and vicious principle is ſo much ſtronger, that he <hi>muſt</hi> obey the latter, and ſtill <hi>ſeem</hi> to himſelf to be religious; or, at leaſt, not very vicious. Hence ſuch a man will have numerous evaſions and palliations, by the help of which he will juſtify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to himſelf, in his evil practices. He can make human frailty, perhaps, a ſalvo for almoſt any thing: "His faith is quite orthodox, ſo that he abhors the very name of <hi>

                  </gap>ns:</hi> Or, if that will not, certainly the righteouſneſs of Chriſt will: This or that precept of the goſpel, he thinks, needs not be ſo rigorouſly interpreted, ſince we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, not the law: Altho' ſuch and ſuch things would be criminal in other circumſtances; yet this caſe is peculiar,

               </gap> it." By ſuch ſubterfuges and tergiverſations; by ſuch twiſtings and ſerpentine windings, a man that is not truly upright, will often evade thoſe religious and moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which every honeſt, good man, ſees and feels, and is influenced by: To him, darkneſs will be light, and light darkneſs; bitter will be ſweet, and ſweet bitter; evil good, and good evil. He will pacify his conſcience ſo far, that he will not much cenſure himſelf, if at all, for the greateſt immoralities and impieties. Yea, he will think he is <hi>doing God ſervice,</hi> by ſhedding the blood of his ſaints: He will, perhaps, vent his unholy pride, his ſpleen and malice againſt man, even in his prayers to God; condemning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to expoſe another, as an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, an hypocrite, and a wicked man; thinking that this is all <hi>true Zeal</hi> for God and pure religion—So when the <hi>Phariſee</hi> &amp; <hi>Publican</hi> went up into the temple to pray, the former ſaid, <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men,—or even as this publican.</hi>

honeſt at the bottom, <hi>deceive their ownſelves:</hi> Thus will they behold, or think they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a mote in their brother's eye; and yet not ſee the beam that is in their own: They would not do thus, were they not hypocrites; if they had a <hi>ſingle</hi> eye, inſtead of an <hi>evil</hi> one: For honeſty as well as charity, begins at home. Under a ſpecious ſhew of ſanctity, and zeal for God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there often lurks a corrupt, <hi>phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> heart; but yet ſo diſguiſed, that the unhappy owner of it does not <hi>know it.</hi> So <hi>deceitful</hi> is the <hi>heart!</hi> ſo <hi>deſperately wicked!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE hypocriſy here ſpoken of, is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different from that, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in putting on the garb and form of Godlineſs, with a premeditated deſign to impoſe upon, and to delude, others.—When a man does thus, he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf, that he is a deceiver and impoſtor: But this other kind of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, conſiſts in ſelf-deception; in a man's accounting his vices, no vices; his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, counterfeit virtues, ſterling and genuine; and ſo in miſtaking his own moral and religious character. However, the former kind of hypocriſy, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, often ends in the latter, being quite ſwallowed up and abſorbed therein: I mean that men who, at firſt, put on the maſk
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:007488_0389_102B8514CFEC1490"/>
of virtue and religion chiefly for the ſake of deceiving others, wear it 'till they come, by degrees, to think it is not a maſk at all, but true religion: So that they are at length as much deceived in themſelves, as others were miſtaken in them before. This may be illuſtrated by that which I take to be a juſt, as well as common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <abbr>

            <p>THIS kind of hypocriſy, when it has taken deep poſſeſſion, and ſtrong hold of a man, renders him almoſt proof againſt conviction; ſo that his caſe is really more deſperate than that of people, who hardly make any pretenſions to virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Perſons, being thus intrenched and fortified, thoſe ſpiritual weapons which are mighty thro' God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds in other men, are uſed to little purpoſe, in order to the battering down their high-towering imaginations; <hi>and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>

idea when theſe terms are uſed with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Him that is "perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;" and by whom <q>actions are weighed.</q> The ſenſe in general is, that however deceitful men's hearts are; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficult or impoſſible it is for <hi>Us</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to know either the hearts of others, or even our own; yet God has the moſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, immediate, and perfect knowledge of them.

GOD judges of men's characters, not by outward appearances, but by their hearts: His eye penetrates into the moſt ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of our ſouls; and therefore His "judgment is according to truth." He takes cognizance of our hearts in all we do. When we come before him to ſerve him, and "ſit before him as his people ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth," he obſerves whether we do it in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and devotion, or whether our hearts are ſtill "far from him." When we pray to, or praiſe him, he obſerves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we worſhip him "in ſpirit and in truth," or for a <hi>pretence</hi> only; and that we may get leave of our conſciences to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our luſts. When we impart of our temporal ſubſtance to the neceſſitous, he obſerves whether this is done in chriſtian charity, and ſingleneſs of heart, or that we "may be ſeen of men." Whatever good things we do, and whatever ſins we abſtain from, he obſerves whether we do thus from a ſenſe of duty, and a regard to his authority, or merely from ſome prudential and worldly conſiderations. He diſcriminates exactly betwixt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward characters of all men; knowing who are truly good and upright, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their numerous imperfections and failings; and who are at the bottom ſtill vicious, notwithſtanding ſome things
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:007488_0393_102B851CF6F37970"/>
which may appear good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them.</p>
            <p>NOR does ſuch a perfect knowledge of our hearts, as is here intended, only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in general, that God diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good men and bad; but alſo that he obſerves in what degree either of theſe characters belongs to us; what enhances the guilt of ſome; what leſſens that of others; what exalts and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bles our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; what tarniſhes and ſullies them. It farther implies, that God ſees our good and bad purpoſes, whether we have ever an opportunity to put them in execution or not. On one hand, he takes notice if there be a <hi>willing mind,</hi> altho' a man has it not in his power to do according to his wiſhes. On the other hand, he ſees our evil devices, purpoſes and inclinations, altho' they never become effect. In fine here, when God is ſaid to ſearch our hearts, and try our reins, the meaning is, that none of thoſe artifices and diſguiſes which men uſe, in order to impoſe upon one another; nor any of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This mighty "Judge of all the earth, will do <hi>right;</hi>" finally rendering to every man that which is fitting and proper, whether it be good or evil; and this, in due meaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

and proportioned all things in the natural world, I ſay, with the utmoſt care and exactneſs, from whence there reſults ſuch an aſtoniſhing order, beauty and harmony; This moſt glorious Being cannot, ſurely, be leſs exact in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relates to the intellectual and moral world, for the ſake of which alone, the other was created. Happineſs and miſery will eventually be dealt out by Him to thoſe, to whom they reſpectively belong; and this in exact weight, meaſure and proportion, <hi>according to every man's ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;</hi> in a manner befitting the great Author, the all-powerful, all-wiſe, all-juſt, all-good and merciful Governor of the world.</p>
            <p>NOR could He do what is right, fit and equal, in this ſenſe, unleſs he <hi>ſearched our hearts, and tried our reins.</hi> This is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a moral Governor; in order to a proper diſtribution of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, happineſs and miſery. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our words and external actions only, would not (if I may uſe ſuch an expreſſion concerning God) <hi>qualify</hi> him to judge the world; and to render to moral, religious creatures, that which is right and fitting. For the goodneſs or badneſs of a moral and religious creature, ſuch as man, evidently depends, in a great meaſure, if
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:007488_0397_102B9259F902C1D0"/>
not wholly, upon the internal frame and temper, the turn and diſpoſition of his <hi>heart.</hi> The love of Goodneſs is plainly eſſential to a good character: So that if we could, any ways, certainly know, That that man, whoſe moral and religious conduct, externally conſidered, is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and good, (ſuch as it ought to be) had yet no regard to religion and virtue in his heart, no ſincerity or uprightneſs, but was only acting a part; ſhould not we ourſelves be far from looking upon his character as good, in the ſenſe now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended? Should we account any one a pious man, becauſe he often ſaid his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if we knew him to be an Atheiſt in his heart? or only knew, that he had no love and reverence for that God, to whom he prayed? Should we account any one a true chriſtian, becauſe he "named the name of Chriſt," if we knew that he did not believe in him? that he did not reſpect and honor him? Should we think any one truly charitable, becauſe he "gave his goods to feed the poor," if we knew that he had no fixed principle of benevolence in him; but "did alms to be ſeen of men?" Should we think any one temperate and ſober, in the moral and religious ſenſe, becauſe he abſtained from acts of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, if we knew that this proceeded
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:007488_0398_102B851EE33AB128"/>
ſolely from a regard to his health and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? Certainly we ſhould not. Well; this may all be true with reſpect to ſome perſons, altho' we do not know it to be ſo. Yea, ſome parts, at leaſt, of this good behaviour externally conſidered, may proceed from a bad principle; from ſome ſiniſter, vicious deſign. For a man may <q>bring even his prayers to God with a wicked mind.</q> How then muſt ſuch a man's character ſtand in the eye of Omniſcience? Or how could God "give every man according to his ways, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fruit of his doings;" if he did not "ſearch the heart, and try the reins?" Under a perfect moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt not the <hi>heart</hi> be the ſtandard of the man; ſo that he ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed according as <hi>that</hi> is good or bad? upright or deceitful? and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it is either? No actions can be deemed good, under ſuch a government, any farther than there is an honeſt, good temper within, which correſponds to them: Nothing truly bad and culpable, any farther than there is ſomewhat wrong and vicious in the heart. We ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have tho't of ſettling and determining the moral and religious characters of men, by their outward conduct, had it not been for our own neceſſary imperfection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:007488_0399_102B925C0154CA30"/>
we cannot ſee the heart, we muſt judge by the outward appearance. This is the beſt rule for us to judge by; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance being a probable indication, tho' not an infallible one in all caſes, of the internal, real character. But a perfect, all-knowing Being, ſtands in no need of ſuch a clue: He looketh directly at the <hi>heart: There</hi> he ſeeth the character as it really is; and he will give every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own, whatever it be.</p>
            <p>FOR the farther illuſtration of what is here intended, let us ſuppoſe a perſon born with ſuch natural infirmities, or placed in ſuch diſadvantageous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that he could perform none of thoſe actions which the world uſually calls good and virtuous. This perſon might, nevertheleſs, be bleſſed with a pious and virtuous mind, a good and upright heart: Would he not, then, be one of a pious and good character, and as rewardable under a righteous moral government, as if he had been in a capacity to "bring forth good things, out of the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his heart?" Or will you ſay, his character is vicious, and that he is of ill deſert, merely becauſe he does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe good works which others do? and which he himſelf would perform, were it in his power! Suppoſe another
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:007488_0400_102B925E9CAC2620"/>
perſon labouring under the like infirmities and diſadvantages; ſo that he has never had it in his power to do any harm; to do any one action which the world calls impious or immoral. This perſon might, nevertheleſs, have an impious, malicious turn of mind; his heart might be full of envy and malice; he might have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination to do the evil which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Is not his character, then, bad and vicious; ſo that he as truly deſerves puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from a perfect moral Governor, as if he had been externally vicious? Certainly he does. Theſe ſuppoſitions are made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhow, that a man's character, is really good or bad only in proportion as his heart is ſo; and that it muſt finally be well or ill with him accordingly. And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be no need of God's <hi>ſearching the heart,</hi> in order to his <hi>giving every man according to his ways.</hi> For this he might do without knowing the heart, if external actions made the character; and men were no farther either rewardable or puniſhable, than they are outwardly virtuous or vicious. Why need the heart itſelf be ſearched, unleſs the heart itſelf is to be <q>brought into judgment, with every ſecret thing?</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is evidently the doctrine of the goſpel, and, I think, the dictate of reaſon
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:007488_0401_102B926025324338"/>
alſo. Upon any other ſuppoſition, what will you make of St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s doctrine, that <hi>tho' a man give all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be burned, and have not charity, he is nothing?</hi> What will you make of St. <hi>John'</hi>s doctrine, that <hi>whoſo hateth his brother is a murderer?</hi> What will you make of our Saviour's own doctrine—<hi>He that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>—<hi>hath committed adultery—already in his heart?</hi> Apply what is ſaid in theſe paſſages, to all other inſtances of virtue and vice, and it will hold equally true. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good deeds a man does; yet if he has not a correſponding good temper, <hi>he is nothing:</hi> Whatever ſins and luſts a man's heart is ſet upon, of thoſe he is guilty in the ſight of Him, who <hi>looketh at the heart,</hi> and will give to every man according to what he ſees <hi>therein.</hi> I ſhall juſt add here, that it may be taken for granted, every man is internally vicious, at leaſt in the ſame degree that he is externally ſo. But it cannot be ſuppoſed, on the other hand, that every man is internally good and pious, in the ſame proportion that he ſeemeth to be ſo, for this plain reaſon; Becauſe, were this fact, there could be no ſuch thing as hypocriſy, or deceitfulneſs of heart; as there manifeſtly is, in that twofold ſenſe which has been conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

UPON the whole: We are aſſured that God "hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man, whom he hath ordained." In that day the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of all hearts, which are not even now <hi>ſecrets</hi> to our Maker, will be diſcloſed to all: And it ſhall fare with men according to their real goodneſs or badneſs, their internal character. It is indeed, often ſaid in the holy ſcriptures, That men ſhall be "judged according to their works;" "according to their deeds;" according to "the things done in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy." But it is ſo expreſſed, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that men's hearts correſpond to their works; or, <hi>vice verſa,</hi> their works to their hearts: Which, in general, may be taken for granted, not withſtanding any thing that has been ſaid in this diſcourſe. But there are manifeſtly ſome exceptions: And it is equally manifeſt, that in thoſe caſes where there is not ſuch a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt men's hearts and their deeds, a man's heart, not his deeds, is what muſt be regarded by the righteous Judge of all. All men ſhall be dealt with, according to what they really are in the eſtimation of the all-knowing, all-juſt and good Governor of the world; not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward appearances, or the falſe judgments which any form either of themſelves or others.</p>

THE reflections which, I ſuppoſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſe out of this ſubject, are ſuch as follow.</p>
            <p>WE are hereby cautioned not to place any undue truſt or confidence in men; but to exerciſe a degree of warineſs and circumſpection in all our intercourſe with them. <q>It is better to truſt in the Lord than to put confidence in man: It is better to truſt in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.</q> Common <hi>prudence,</hi> which ought to be reckoned among the virtues, requires this caution and circumſpection; ſince men may be very different from what they appear to be. <q>Counſel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of underſtanding will draw it out. Moſt men will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim every one his own goodneſs;<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 5, 6.</note> but a faithful man who can find!</q> Thus ſaid the wiſeſt, if not the beſt of men. A diſtruſt of our fellow-men may, indeed, be carried to an extreme: (Which is moſt frequently done by men that are themſelves deſtitute of honor, honeſty and virtue:) Without a conſiderable degree of mutual truſt, faith and confidence, it is manifeſt that there can ſcarce be any ſuch thing as ſocial happineſs, and a friendly, agreable intercourſe with our neighbour. And a good man would rather ſtrain a
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:007488_0404_102B92666030C0D0"/>
point, <hi>hope all things,</hi> and expoſe himſelf to ſome diſadvantages and impoſitions, than, by an univerſal diſtruſt and ſuſpicion of others, cut himſelf off from the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thinking he is converſing with thoſe that are as upright as himſelf. It is to be added, that the daily commerce, and various affairs of the world, could not be carried on in a manner the moſt beneficial to the Whole, were jealouſy, and diffidence of man to man, univerſally to take place. The preſent ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, however imperfect, plainly requires ſome degree of mutual faith and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. However, there is, in ſome ſenſe, an extreme even in virtue. Intire, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved confidence is to be placed in God alone: And thoſe who place it indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in others, may poſſibly have reaſon to lament their eaſy credulity; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the truth of the prophet's words—<hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT ſince men's hearts are, in ſome ſenſe, treacherous and deceitful even with regard to themſelves; we are hereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to examine our <hi>own;</hi> to ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize them with the utmoſt care, and to <hi>keep them with all diligence:</hi> For out of them are the <hi>iſſues</hi> both of life and death. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, that "he that truſteth his own heart is a fool." His meaning is, that
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:007488_0405_102B9267E73C6B18"/>
ſince there is great deceitfulneſs in the hearts of wicked men, and a degree of it in the hearts of all men, it is folly in any One to be unſuſpicious, or not jealous, concerning the integrity of his <hi>own.</hi> A truly wiſe man will be, in ſome degree, faithleſs and unbelieving towards his own heart. But you will ſay, perhaps, <q>My heart is good and honeſt: Why, then, ſhould I be ſo injurious as to diſtruſt it?</q> It is true, your heart <hi>may</hi> be good and honeſt; but how do you know it is ſo, unleſs you have examined it? unleſs you have <hi>put it to the queſtion?</hi> unleſs you have tryed how it will bear the torture of being ſevered from the world? unleſs you have denied yourſelf as to thoſe ſins and luſts, which moſt <hi>eaſily</hi> beſet you? unleſs you have taken up your croſs, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Saviour? This is the teſt of an honeſt heart. And if you have never done thus; if you have never diſtruſted your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor do ſo at preſent, it is almoſt a demonſtration that you are one of thoſe <hi>unwiſe</hi> men, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; and that, however charitable you may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your own heart, it is ſtill <hi>deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> Some <hi>other</hi> perſons, you allow, are miſtaken in thinking their hearts good and upright, while they are not: May not this poſſibly be your <hi>own</hi> caſe?—</p>

BUT whatever ſome perſons may think, it would be a great abuſe of this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-doctrine, That the heart is deceitful, to infer from it, that a man, by ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, by attending to the operations of his heart, and bringing it to the teſt of ſcripture and reaſon, under that influence of the good Spirit of God, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, cannot come to a ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, rational, and ſatisfactory determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation concerning his own heart, whether it be good or bad. The poſſibility of this, in the way of rational deduction and inference, (to ſay nothing of the <hi>Witneſs of the Spirit</hi>) is plainly preſuppoſed in all thoſe paſſages, where we are admoniſhed to prove and examine ourſelves to this end, that we may know <hi>ourſelves:</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <q>Examine yourſelves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own ſelves. <hi>Know ye not your own ſelves,</hi> how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates?<note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 15.</note>

tho' briefly, conſidered, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will be cloſed with ſome practical inferences and reflections.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Let us conſider the brevity of life. Our days are ſaid to be as an <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth,</hi> one of the ſhorteſt meaſures in uſe: And our age is as <hi>nothing</hi> before God; before Him, with whom <q>one day is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day.</q> With relation to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, omniſcient, all-comprehending Mind, the longeſt limited duration muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as <hi>nothing.</hi> When the Prophet ſpeaks of the greatneſs, the power and majeſty of God, he ſays that <q>all nations before Him are as <hi>nothing;</hi> and are counted to him <hi>leſs</hi> than <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </q> And when we contemplate Him, who is God <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting,</hi> the King <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>immortal;</hi> and then conſider the ſhort ſpan of human life, we may adopt the ſame prophetic ſtyle, and ſay, that our age before God is not only as <hi>nothing,</hi> but even <hi>leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the duration of this our mortal life is as nothing, even with relation to ſome finite Beings: I mean thoſe which were preſent, and miniſtring ſpirits to God, when the foundations of the earth were laid; and when it was ſaid, <q>Let US make man. The <hi>Angels,</hi> thoſe

            <p>THE days of man are now as an <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth,</hi> even compared with the age of man in the firſt periods of the world.

How ſhort then is human life, in this age of the world, compared to <hi>Their'</hi>s!</p>
            <p>AND in the next period after the flood, men commonly lived four or five hundred years; as appears from <hi>Moſes'</hi>s account of the <hi>generations of Shem,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Noah.</hi>

that the age of man in <hi>Abraham'</hi>s days, may be computed to be about an hundred and fifty years.

<pb n="424" facs="unknown:007488_0429_102B92968816E088"/>
we fondly deceive ourſelves; and gather thorns inſtead of roſes. It is as impoſſible for a reaſonable, moral creature, to be truly happy in the enjoyment of ſenſual and worldly objects, as it is for the eye to be pleaſed with the ſound of a viol, or the ear charmed with a beautiful landſkip. Thoſe objects, in the enjoyment of which alone, ſuch a creature as man can reſt and be happy, are thoſe of an intellectual and moral kind. Others have no ſimilitude, no analogy or agreement, to the ſuperior and moſt excellent part of our nature; So that the immortal ſpirit will ſtill pine, and languiſh, and crave more, crying, <hi>Give, Give,</hi> 'till it is <q>filled with all the fulneſs of God.</q> Thoſe perſons who are the moſt ſucceſsful in purſuing worldly happineſs, and whom many may be apt to envy, are not (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it!) really the happy men they are often taken to be.

They walk in a <hi>vain ſhew,</hi> and <hi>diſquiet themſelves in vain.</hi> It is only the ſhew, the appearance of felicity, which they have; a gaudy out-ſide ſhew, the form of happineſs without the power. And the more anxious we are to obtain
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:007488_0430_102B92982B4481F0"/>
felicity in this world, independently of God, the great ſource thereof, the <hi>fountain of living waters,</hi> the more do we diſquiet ourſelves in vain: In the language of the prophet, we <hi>ſpend our money for that which is not bread, and our labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> We have wants which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed, deſires and affections which cannot be ſatisfied, by terreſtrial things: So that we are wretched even in ſpite of that pride, which prompts us to eſteem our condition happy. And if ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, worldly men, would but ſpeak out the plain truth, they would join with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>—"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, and vexation of ſpirit;" and confeſs, that even in the midſt of <hi>laughter</hi> their hearts are often <hi>ſorrowful.</hi>

            <p>BUT the vanity, vexation and diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, from which human life is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ariſes not merely from the <hi>want</hi> of proper objects here below, to gratify the various affections and cravings of our compound nature, and to fill up the mighty void in our breaſts: There are many <hi>poſitive</hi> evils and calamities, to which we are unavoidably ſubjected.

if they eat it all; to toil hard only for a tolerable ſubſiſtence and living here.

<pb n="435" facs="unknown:007488_0440_102B92ABF40C5740"/>
that will never end. Let us, therefore, now draw ſome practical inferences and reflections from this ſubject.</p>
            <p>AND here, in the firſt place: Altho' it may be natural for us to lament our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and ſorrowful condition in this world; yet ſince this is by the appointment of God, we ought humbly to acquieſce in it, without murmuring. Our duty is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not complaining or finding fault. God had an indiſputable right either to give us life and being, or not; to give it to us either for a longer or ſhorter time; and to make our condition either more or leſs happy, as ſeemed proper to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring wiſdom and goodneſs. We have no demand upon his juſtice for a longer or happier life, than that which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon us in this world, ſhort and unhappy as it is. Nor ſhould it be ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, that perfect wiſdom, righteouſneſs and goodneſs, are the rule of his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations towards his creatures. The State we are now in, is ſuch a one as God judged proper to place us in, in order to manifeſt to Us, if not to other beings in other worlds, his holineſs and righteous ſeverity; his juſt diſpleaſure againſt the workers of iniquity. It is a ſignal mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his anger againſt the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of his law in this world; and a
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:007488_0441_102B92ADDD304658"/>
perpetual <hi>memento</hi> to Us, their poſterity. In a manner ſomewhat analogous hereto, it is, that the children of traitors and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to their earthly Sovereigns, are often deprived of the inheritance which, by the conſtitution of the government, would otherwiſe have deſcended to them; and are ſubjected to divers inconveniences; yea, to a degree of ſhame and infamy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' themſelves tranſgreſs not <hi>after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of their anceſtors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, God, who has thus ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to mortality, to vanity and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſorrow, on account of the original rebellion and treaſon of our firſt parents, when they hearkened to the devil, has ſubjected us in <hi>hope.</hi> Our condition is not <hi>deſperate:</hi> So far from it, that God has made ample proviſion for our deliverance from this ſtate of bondage, corruption and death, <hi>into the glorious liberty of his Sons.</hi> For as in <hi>Adam</hi> we die, ſo in <hi>Chriſt</hi> we may be made alive: And <hi>as we have born the image of the earthy,</hi> ſo may <hi>we alſo bear the image of the heavenly.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 40.</note> How joyfully does it become ſuch creatures, in ſuch a ſtate, to receive the glad tidings of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' Chriſt, who has <q>aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to light thro' the Goſpel?</q> Sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would be our condition, ſubjected to

            <p>Again:</p>
            <p>SINCE this world is ſo full of vanity and ſorrow; ſince there is ſo little of ſolid
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:007488_0451_102B92C19371B4F8"/>
happineſs to be expected from it, we ought not, ſurely, to be very fond of living long in it. If God had made our days leſs than an hand-breadth, it is not eaſy to ſee why good men ſhould be much dejected at this reflection, unleſs the preſent life had been much leſs vain and unquiet than it really is. It is very incongruous for thoſe, who are daily complaining of the ſorrows of life, to be ſo fond of living, as men uſually are. Why are we backward to leave that world, where we can find no reſt for the ſole of our foot; and are as uneaſy as <hi>Noah'</hi>s dove, before the waters ſubſided? Shall I tell you the true reaſon, why profeſſed Chriſtians are generally ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of living, and ſo afraid of dying? It is becauſe they have ſome miſ-givings; ſome apprehenſions that they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for another world; or at leaſt, not for that, which they would chooſe to go; and that if they ſhould make an exchange, it muſt, probably, be for the worſe. And, indeed, it muſt be confeſſed, that they who have no rational grounds to believe, but that if they die, they muſt die the death of the unrighteous, and their laſt end be like his, have great reaſon to be deſirous of living longer here, as troubleſome and vexations as this life is. But what cauſe have good men to be fond of life, or afraid
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:007488_0452_102B92C42678B970"/>
of death? they, who have a well-grounded hope in the exceeding great and precious promiſes of the goſpel, whereby they are already "made partakers of a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?" Is there any thing on this ſide the grave, very deſireable? any thing in, or beyond it, very terrible, to them? Do we fear the grave will be always victorious? Do we fear, that the angels, when they receive our departing ſpirits, will loſe their way, and not convoy us ſafely to <hi>Abraham'</hi>s boſom? Do we dread the tho't of being again united to our dear friends, who died in the Lord; and who are gone before us to the paradiſe of God? Are we loth to become communicants with the church triumphant of the Firſt Born, which are both written and bleſſed in heaven? In fine, do we dread the tho't of going to the general aſſembly of juſt men made perfect? to the innumerable company of angels? to Jeſus the Mediator of the new-covenant? to God the Judge of All? to Him, with whom is the ſpring of life; in whoſe preſence there is fulneſs of joy; and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures forever more? There ſeems not to be any thing very terrible in theſe things; nor any thing in death, which ſhould make a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian, thro' fear of it, all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time "ſubject unto bondage." If it is theſe

bodies which we now inhabit that we are ſo fond of, even they ſhall ſhortly be reſtored to us: The ſea, death and hades, will be faithful to their truſt; and deliver up the dead which are in them, when He who is Lord both of the dead and living, <q>ſhall appear the ſecond time, without ſin unto ſalvation.</q> But theſe bodies we ſhall receive, in the renovation of all things, not groſs and vile, as they are when laid in the grave; but fitted up and repaired, and made more ſuitable for the habitation of purified, immortal ſpirits.

In this point, the high and low, the rich and poor, bond and free; in this the young and the old, male and female, people of all conditions, occupations and characters, are well united. Good men and bad, are not at variance here; both generally conſenting in the ſame wiſh and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho', perhaps, induced thereto by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, or even contrary, principles. They who deſpiſe this world, and they who court and adore it; Saints and Sinners, here ſhake hands; and even the Atheiſt is not ſingular: For he will pray to <hi>Nature,</hi> and his <hi>Stars,</hi> tho' not to GOD, to grant him many days on earth. That life is a deſireable good, might, then, be an article in every perſon's creed; and indeed, the leſs people believe of <hi>other things,</hi> the more firmly do they generally believe <hi>this;</hi> ſo that the greateſt <hi>Sceptics</hi> are, here, the
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:007488_0462_102B92E133AB5350"/>
greateſt <hi>bigots;</hi> being attached to this life and world, in the ſame proportion that they doubt of another. We might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore change and invert the Pſalmiſt's queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſk—<q>What man is he that deſireth <hi>not</hi> life, and loveth <hi>not</hi> many days?</q> And, indeed, the queſtion thus put, does, I ſuppoſe, as fully and exactly expreſs his meaning, as it does in the other way; the negative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle making no real alteration in the ſenſe of ſuch interrogatories; the true intent of which, can be determined only by the nature of the ſubject, to which they relate.</p>
            <p>IT is farther to be obſerved, that the royal Pſalmiſt does not here ſpeak with ſuch an air, as would lead one to ſuſpect, that he diſapproved or condemned this common deſire of living to old age. He ſpeaks of it, not as being in itſelf criminal; but as what was natural to man, and therefore innocent; at leaſt under certain reſtrictions and limitations. Mortality and death, are unnatural; as unnatural as diſobedience to God, which was the original cauſe thereof. And mere nature cannot but be fond of life, and deſirous of removing death to as great a diſtance as poſſible. When I ſay, that mere <hi>nature</hi> cannot but do ſo, I mean that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, unleſs he is influenced by ſome high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:007488_0463_102B92E555F798A0"/>
principle than that of natural reaſon and ſenſe; or elſe lies under the preſſure of ſome heavy calamity, which makes life a burden to him. The former is the caſe of thoſe good men, whoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and heart and hope are in heaven, <q>whither the Fore-Runner is for them entered, even Jeſus:</q> The latter is the caſe of thoſe wretched, thoſe deſperate men, who ſeek an aſſylum from pain and ſorrow here, in a tragical, voluntary death. Had the deſire of long life been in itſelf criminal, we cannot ſuppoſe, that the Pſalmiſt would have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged this deſire in us, by telling us, in the next words, what is the moſt likely way to prolong it, and render it happy—<q>Keep thy tongue from evil; and thy lips from ſpeaking guile: depart from evil, and do good, &amp;c.</q> That is, Let him that loveth many days, that he may ſee good, keep his tongue, &amp;c. This is the coherence and natural connexion of the Pſalmiſt's words.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo obſervable, That long life is often ſpoken of in ſcripture, as a good, a real bleſſing, the reward of piety. You know the ſtory of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he was "ſick unto death." And God ſometimes encourages the obedience of the young, with the hopes of living long.—<q>Honor
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:007488_0464_102B92E90B8A5498"/>
thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long</q>—Thus alſo God ſays of the good man, <q>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, I will deliver him—with long life will I ſatisfy him, and ſhew him my ſalvation.</q>

                  </gap>
               </note> So length of days is ſaid to be in the right hand of wiſdom. And you know, that to die in youth; to be cut off in the midſt of One's days, by a premature death, is uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in ſcripture, under the notion of a real evil: and it is ſometimes repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the effect of God's diſpleaſure. To which purpoſe are the following paſſages—<q>Bloody and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their days—Be not wicked over much; for why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time.</q> Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages might be added to theſe: But it is needleſs. As long life is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all in general; ſo the ſcripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it as being no unreaſonable, to beſure no criminal, deſire: It is ſpoken of as the reward of piety; good men are encouraged with the hopes of it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely, or premature death, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is often conſidered as an evil; and threatned as a curſe.</p>
            <p>NOW it may be uſeful, in farther diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon this ſubject, to inquire, In what reſpects long life is a bleſſing? or
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:007488_0465_102B92ECD042B070"/>
why it ſhould be accounted ſo? It will then be ſhown, that the practice of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion tends to prolong the life of man, and to make it happy: So that it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon all, who love many days that they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee good, to depart from evil and do good, to fear God and keep his commandments: For <q>the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his ears are open unto their cry.</q> Theſe things being done, the ſubject will be cloſed with ſome practical reflections, as the time will allow.</p>
            <p>SINCE we all naturally deſire to live long, it were to be wiſhed, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired this upon rational motives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which it becomes ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we are, to be influenced by. Let us therefore inquire, as was propoſed,</p>
            <p>FIRST, In what reſpects long life is deſireable? why it ſhould be accounted a bleſſing? and how far it is really ſo? In order to our making a proper eſtimate of life, it is neceſſary that we conſider it as it is; that we conſider it with thoſe advantages, and thoſe equally real diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, with which the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> poſſeſs it; that we conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which this life has to another; to the true ends and purpoſes of life; and that we conſider what influence our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="461" facs="unknown:007488_0466_102B92F07AFA5F98"/>
behaviour, will have into our future happineſs or miſery, according to the principles of religion. Without having all theſe things before us, and keeping them conſtantly in view, it is impoſſible we ſhould judge juſtly upon this ſubject: We ſhall not reaſon, but only rave; and bewilder our ſelves in an endleſs maze of uncertainty and error. If the foundation be not properly laid, the ſuperſtructure, however regularly built upon it, will be only as an airy caſtle in the land of Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If we conſider the preſent life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as more or leſs happy than it really is; or if we detach it from futurity, as having no connexion with another ſtate; we ſhall never come to a juſt concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the point before us: We ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know in what reſpects life is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; how far it is ſo; how it is to be conducted in order to make the moſt and beſt of it: We ſhall always either under or over-rate its value; and the reſult of all, will be no better than a dream or reverie; at leaſt, it will not be real wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſalutary truth.</p>
            <p>LET me therefore remind you of a few facts, and well-known principles, which are to be taken along with us; and which are ſo fundamental, that without them we cannot duly eſtimate the value of life; but
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:007488_0467_102B92F2CF5049C0"/>
muſt needs wander far from the truth.</p>
            <p>IT is to be premiſed, then, That the preſent life is, at beſt, a ſcene of great trouble and diſquietude. This world was originally deſigned for a place of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by our Creator: But man's apoſtacy from God, has changed it, tho' not into an hell, yet into an habitation of much ſorrow and vexation. For notwithſtand-ſtanding the many delights, (far more, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, than we could claim as our due) which Providence beſtows upon us here; yet ſo numerous, various, and inceſſant, are the adverſities to which we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that we cannot but groan under them, as under a load and burden, from which we would gladly be delivered, were it poſſible without putting off theſe bodies.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo to be obſerved, with relation to the pleaſures of this life, that they are flattened and diminiſhed by old age. Youth is the principal ſeaſon for reliſhing and enjoying thoſe, which are properly called animal, ſenſitive and worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as contradiſtinguiſhed from rational, moral, and religious. It is ſaid with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar propiety—<q>Rejoice, O <hi>young</hi> Man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth:</q> For after people get paſt the meridian of life,
<pb n="463" facs="unknown:007488_0468_102B92F696978608"/>
the reliſh for ſuch enjoyments gradually fails; much in the ſame proportion that animal nature itſelf decays. To which it is to be added, that old age is uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many poſitive pains peculiar to itſelf, youth being a ſtranger to them, tho' not to all others. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome exceptions, that is doubtleſs a juſt repreſentation of advanced age in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which the Pſalmiſt gives: <q>If, by reaſon of ſtrength, they be fourſcore years; yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow.</q> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> has dwelt longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this gloomy theme of old age; and painted the ſcene with deeper ſhades. The years are then come, when the moſt ſay, that they have no pleaſure;<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 12. 1.—</note> when the ſun and the light, the moon and the ſtars are darkened; when the keepers of the houſe tremble, and the ſtrong men bow themſelves; when the grinders ceaſe becauſe they are few, and thoſe that look out of the windows are darkned; when they riſe up at the voice of the bird! and all the daughters of muſic are brought low; when they are afraid of that which is high, and fears are in the way; when the almond-tree flouriſheth, and the graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper is a burden; and deſire itſelf fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. This is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s deſcription of that old age, with its common infirmities and
<pb n="464" facs="unknown:007488_0469_102B92FA6A251FA0"/>
pains, to which we are ſo deſirous of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And tho' we ſhould attain to it; yet it is to be remember'd, that we are not immortal; but muſt unavoidably die at laſt, how long ſoever our lives may be protracted.</p>
            <p>WE muſt alſo remember, that whether we die young or old, we are to live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after this mortal courſe is finiſhed; and either be inexpreſſibly happy in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate, in the favour and loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; or inconceivably wretched, under his righteous diſpleaſure. This is our time of trial and probation. Tho' we are a ſinful, apoſtate race, yet we are candidates for heaven; ſo that if we are here reconciled to our Maker, thro' Him that was <hi>made ſin for us;</hi> and ſerve God faithfully, we become his children; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <q>heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt</q> to an incorruptible inheritance. And the greater degrees of true wiſdom, of holineſs and virtue, we attain to in this world; by ſo much the brighter crown of glory, will the righteous Judge of all, give us hereafter. On the other hand, thoſe who live and die in their ſins, are of courſe and conſequence, heirs of the <hi>ſecond death;</hi> and muſt be miſerable in proportion as they have abuſed the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffering of
<pb n="465" facs="unknown:007488_0470_102B92FC52CC0AD0"/>
God; and miſemployed the talents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their truſt.</p>
            <p>THE things which have been briefly premiſed, are the common, well-known principles of religion; how little ſoever they are attended to in a practical ſenſe. And theſe principles, it is neceſſary for us to keep continually in our eye, in order to our forming a proper judgment of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life; in order to our knowing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther length of days is deſirable, or not; and if it is, for what reaſons, and how far it is ſo.</p>
            <p>AND in conformity to theſe maxims, it may be laid down for a certain truth, That long life is very little, if at all, to be deſired for its own ſake, or upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any happineſs to be attained here, which is purely of a worldly nature, detached from religion, and the hopes of a better life to come. If this is really an happy ſtate, upon the whole, conſidered in itſelf, and without any reference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; it muſt, indeed, be acknowledged to be a deſireable one in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and long life might be wiſhed for, were it only in reſpect of that felicity which is to be reaped here. I do not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deny this to be the caſe: But, alas! when we ballance the account; when we come to weigh the common
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:007488_0471_102B9300B01EB1F0"/>
ſorrows of life, againſt the common joys of it, the ſcale of happineſs will, I believe, very little preponderate, if at all, as to the greater part of mankind. Many of the pains of life are, probably, far more intenſe and vivid, than any of its pleaſures, and they are, certainly, of much longer duration. People ſometimes lie in extreme torture for whole days, weeks, and months, if not years together, with ſcarce any intermiſſion: In compariſon of which pains, all ſenſual, and worldly pleaſures, are very ſhort-liv'd; and the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, probably, the ſhorteſt. We never find ourſelves, nor ſee others, for any conſiderable time together ſwallowed up in joy and rapture, as we often ſee them ſwallowed up of ſorrow and anguiſh.</p>
            <p>BUT leave uncommon, extraordinary examples both of proſperity and adverſity, out of the queſtion for the preſent; and conſider mankind in general, the main body of the ſpecies as they riſe. They always have been, now are, and always muſt be, poor and low in the world; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to toil hard, to riſe early, and ſet up late, in order to get a livelihood for themſelves and families, eating the bread of carefulneſs. In them eſpecially is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the prediction and threatning, when the ground was curſed for man's ſake—"In
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:007488_0472_102B9304D0F67FB0"/>
ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it:" What do the lower claſſes of mankind enjoy? what can they hope to enjoy, which ſhould make ſuch a life as this, conſidered in itſelf, very deſireable to them! If from the land, you turn your eyes to another element; to them that <q>go down to the ſea in ſhips, that do buſineſs in great waters;</q> is Their kind of life any freer from care, diſquietude or danger? They have not always <hi>halcyon</hi> days; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the ſtormy wind and tempeſt. <q>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths, their ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble. They reel to and fro—and are at their wits end.</q>

Has not the merchant, for example, various cares and perplexities in his calling; ſo that quiet often flies him by day, and ſleep by night? and ſo as to make his life almoſt one continued hurry, and ſcene of diſquietude? And, perhaps, after having made himſelf a ſlave almoſt all his days, to heap up uncertain riches, he either never obtains them, or having obtained them, they ſuddenly <q>take to themſelves wings and flee away;</q>
               <pb n="468" facs="unknown:007488_0473_102B9308A920B3A8"/>
leaving him only poverty, diſappointment, and blaſted hopes, to reward his pains! Reflect upon the man of literature, and ſtudious of philoſophical wiſdom and knowledge: <hi>Solomon,</hi> the greateſt proficient in this kind of wiſdom, long ſince obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he that "increaſeth knowledge," does, in ſome reſpects, "increaſe ſorrow" alſo. So far is it from making a man tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy! The joy and tranſport of an EUREEKA, is of ſhort continuance: And there are ſo many things which we deſire to <hi>find out,</hi> but cannot, that there is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as much diſappointment and ſorrow, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of ſolid happineſs and contentment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from theſe reſearches; the wiſeſt men having the moſt thorough, feeling ſenſe of their ignorance. Behold one Sage leaping into the Ocean, for grief that he cannot comprehend its ebbing and flowing! See another, precipitating himſelf into AEtna, for ſorrow that he could not underſtand its ſires and eruptions! Were they not more tortured on account of what they did not know, than ſatisfied with what they did? The plain Peaſant and Mechanic do not feel theſe pains of ignorance; nor run thus learnedly out of their wits.</p>
            <p>CONSIDER, next, the man of ambition, who "ſeeketh great things for himſelf,"

power and dignity, and high preferments in the ſtate; and let him be one, whoſe birth, qualifications and fortune, (to ſpeak in the language of the world) give him ſome reaſonable proſpect of ſucceſs in the purſuit. But there are many rivals and pretenders, ſome of whom muſt fail, if not the greater part of them. And then the diſappointed candidate, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſtung and tormented with reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and envy. But thoſe who ſucceed in theſe purſuits, aſcending to the heights they aſpired at, generally do ſo, in one reſpect, as the ſaints enter into reſt, <q>thro' much tribulation;</q> thro' a long ſeries of vexatious conflicts; for if they do not often wreſtle againſt <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> yet they wreſtle againſt <hi>temporal</hi> 
               <q>wickedneſſes in high places.</q> And after all, the victors do not find that reſt to their ſouls, which they promiſed themſelves in their eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtations. New deſires, new cares, and ſollicitudes, ſpring up from the <hi>root of bitterneſs,</hi> to perplex and trouble them. And what ſlippery places do they walk in? being often raiſed by one prince, as it were only to be thrown down by his ſucceſſor, or perhaps by himſelf. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing cares haunt the courts and palaces of ſovereigns; where gorgeous apparel is often nothing but the ſplendid covering
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:007488_0475_102B930D9C1D8E38"/>
of woe. Fools may ſtare, and envy, thinking thoſe who appear ſo gay and ſmiling, muſt needs be very happy: But wiſe men know better. Even thoſe who wear a crown, and hold a ſcepter, often tremble leſt one ſhould fall from their head, and the other be wreſted from their hand: And he that is ſo ſucceſsful in his politics and wars, as to conquer one world, weeps becauſe there is not another for him to ravage, mixing his tears with his triumph.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the troubles and vexations which are attendant upon all the different ranks and ſtations of life, and peculiar to them reſpectively; there are others, which are common to them all in general: Such as bodily pains and diſeaſes; and the griefs which ſpring out of the natural relations of life; even out of its neareſt alliances, and cloſeſt connexions.<note n="*" place="bottom">

"ſprings eternal in the human breaſt," rather than any poſitive happineſs and enjoyment, which makes people ſo fond of this life. By this hope we are led on from goal to goal, from one ſtage of life to another, ſtill expecting to find ſome greater good and ſatisfaction than we have found already; which hope u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually proves abortive in the end. So that thoſe who have lived long, who have had all the means of procuring worldly happineſs which any ever had, and gone the round of every ſenſitive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, have at laſt been compelled to own, that all is but <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>vexation of ſpirit;</hi> that what the world calls happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſcarce more than a ſhadow or a dream: And it is wiſe in others to truſt Their experience, leſt themſelves ſhould alſo be diſappointed in the end.</p>
            <p>THE reſult of what has been ſaid, is, That the preſent life, conſidered in itſelf, if it may be properly called an happy one upon the whole, is yet ſo but in a very low degree; and therefore, that long life is but little to be deſired, for the ſake of any happineſs that can, probably, be attained to here: (Tho' I will not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the common opinion of the world ſo much as to ſay, that the ſorrows of life are, generally ſpeaking, more than a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:007488_0479_102B931CA1C30160"/>
to the enjoyments of it, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from hope:) From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that life itſelf, and length of days up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, are a bleſſing, chiefly, conſidered with relation to futurity; as this ſtate is introductory to another, and as long life here gives us greater opportunity and advantage than a ſhort one, for acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves with God; for ſerving Him, and our generation according to his will; for working out our ſalvation, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ourſelves a happy immortality af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. Such a life as the preſent, however long, unleſs conſidered in this connexion with futurity, and ſomewhat that is to ſucceed it, would, I think, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand no great thanks to the Author of it; it being but an inconſiderable good in itſelf. But taken with its proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions and references, it cannot but be looked upon as a great bleſſing, which demands our ſincere praiſe and thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bountiful Donor thereof. It is a price put into our hands to get that true wiſdom; to do that good in the world; to gain thoſe religious qualities and good habits, which will make us in ſome meaſure happy even now, and which will, thro' the goodneſs and grace of God, inſure to us, and terminate in, eternal felicity. It is chiefly in theſe
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:007488_0480_102B9322019B06A8"/>
reſpects, that long life is deſireable. To be candidates for immortal bliſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and put in a way of obtaining them, is certainly a great privilege. And length of days, or a long preparatory, probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate, where ſo much is depending as there is upon the preſent life, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly preferable to a ſhort one. The more time is allowed us, the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually we may provide for our future well-being; the more we may acquaint ourſelves with God and his ways; the greater improvement we may make in piety and virtue. And this will give us greater peace and hope in our latter end; and both qualify us for, and intitle us to, a brighter crown of immortality, than a lower degree of goodneſs would have done.</p>
            <p>SURELY, when we have ſo great an intereſt at ſtake; when the ſalvation of our ſouls depends upon our becoming truly wiſe and good here, it is both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and reaſonable to deſire, that this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for making proviſion for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, for an<note n="*" place="bottom">There is no ground to think, taking the holy ſcriptures for our guide, that thoſe who live and die in their ſins, ſhall ever have a future opportunity to redeem their preſent miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; or any other time of trial, after this life is terminated. So far as I am able to ſee, the utmoſt which theſe fooliſh, miſerable men can hope for, is to be <hi>annihilated</hi> after ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unutterable torments: Tho' I do not aſſert, that they can, according to the ſcripture account, hope for ſo great a favour as even this would be, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> to be <hi>utterly blotted out of being!</hi> However, it muſt be confeſſed, that ſome expreſſions of ſcripture ſeem, at firſt view, to countenance this ſuppoſition.</note>

be protracted as long as may be; as long as is conſiſtent with the good pleaſure of God, and this our mortal condition. The making due preparation for another world, however practicable it may be ſuppoſed to be in a ſhort time, is yet a buſineſs of ſo great importance, as no conſiderate man would chooſe to have hurried over, or crowded into a little narrow ſpace, if it could be avoided. Poſſibly a perſon may be ſo fooliſh and improvident, as to neglect in childhood and youth, which are vanity, this moſt important of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments: And when this is the caſe, as God knows it too often is, is it not a great favour to have a farther time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this purpoſe; that ſo we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem in maturer life, or in old age, the follies and miſconduct of our youth; and may do that work at laſt, which ought to have been done at firſt? Aſk a man who apprehends he is juſt going out of the world, and is conſcious that he has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto lived a wicked, profligate life, what he would give for two or three years more, in which to make his peace with God? He will tell you, That if he
<pb n="477" facs="unknown:007488_0482_102B9329D90332C0"/>
was owner of a million times as many worlds as ever God created, he would freely give them all for a ſingle year. And even good men, when they have the proſpect of a ſpeedy diſſolution, unleſs they have already attained to a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith and hope, cannot well help making the prayer which the Pſalmiſt did in his ſickneſs, <q>O! ſpare me, that I may recover ſtrength before I go hence, and be no more.</q>

                  <hi>viz,</hi>
               </abbr> the greater advantage and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which length of days gives for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for another ſtate of exiſtence, and making our <hi>calling and election ſure.</hi> A fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate being out of the queſtion, there is ſo little ſolid happineſs to be enjoyed here, and ſo many afflictions to be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the common courſe of things, that it may well be queſtioned whether life is a bleſſing at all, or not; or a long one, preferable to a ſhort one.</p>
            <p>UPON theſe principles it follows, That a good man, <hi>knowing himſelf to be ſuch,</hi> and that he is intitled to the great and precious promiſes of the goſpel, has no reaſon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="478" facs="unknown:007488_0483_102B932D557FC4D8"/>
his own account, to deſire to live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, how young ſoever he may be. The great end of life is accompliſhed as to himſelf; ſo that for him to die would be gain. If ſuch a man ſtill prefers life to death, it muſt be ſolely upon a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of benevolence to others, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs to the will of God; that he may be inſtrumental of further promoting his glory in this world, and ſerviceable to his neighbours, to his offspring, to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, to thoſe, with whom he has ſome ſpecial connexions, and whoſe good he is deeply concerned for. And it is only upon the principles here laid down, that any tolerable ſenſe can be put upon the apoſtle's words to his beloved <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi>—<q>Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain. But if I live in the fleſh, this is the fruit of my labour: Yet what I ſhall chooſe, I know not. For I am in a ſtrait betwixt two; having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt; for this is far better: But to abide in the fleſh, is more needful for you.</q>

a man, whether he lives few or many days here; only as this life has reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to another; and the longer we live, the more effectually we may provide for our future well-being. Aſſoon as we are prepared for another world, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if this matter is put beyond doubt to ourſelves, we have no reaſon to wiſh to live longer for our own ſakes, and can do ſo only upon a principle of charity, and ſubmiſſion to the will and providence of God; <hi>waiting all the days of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time 'till our change come.</hi>

            <p>PEOPLE are ſo univerſally deſirous of living long in this world; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves ſo much happineſs from it, that it will, doubtleſs, appear fanciful and romantic to many, to ſay there is ſcarce any thing to be enjoyed here, for which it is worth while to live. But ſtill
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:007488_0486_102B9338004F3558"/>
this is the truth of the caſe: This world is a ſcene of folly and confuſion, of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and ſorrow. It's pleaſures are precarious, ſuperficial and tranſient; its troubles are certain, ſubſtantial, and almoſt uninterrupted. So that, were there to be an end of us at death, few or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate men, could ever expect to enjoy much good; or, conſequently, much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live long here. Such is this life, when conſidered in itſelf: But the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect clears up, when we conſider the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which the preſent ſtate has to, and its connexion with, another after death. Life is valuable, and length of days to be wiſhed for, as it gives us an opportunity to acquaint ourſelves with God, and to ſecure eternal felicity to ourſelves, when our days here ſhall be numbered and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. In any other reſpect, whether we live long, or die ſoon; yea, whether we live at all or not, ſeems to be no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intereſting point. But this matter was ſpoken of in the preceeding diſcourſe. It was propoſed to ſhow, in the</p>
            <p>SECOND Place, That if we are deſirous of living long, and of making the beſt of life while it laſts, it becomes us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ourſelves by the maxims of religion: Or, in the language of the Pſalmiſt, to <q>keep our tongues from evil, and our
<pb n="482" facs="unknown:007488_0487_102B933A77D3DEC0"/>
lips from ſpeaking guile; to depart from evil, and do good; to ſeek peace and purſue it.</q> The practice of pure, undefiled religion, has a natural tendency to prolong human life, and to render it, in ſome degree, happy. For the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are not only intitled to the favour of almighty God hereafter, but to his peculiar care and guardianſhip in this world. Even here, <q>the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his ears are open unto their cry.</q> Godlineſs hath promiſe both of <hi>the life that now is,</hi> and alſo of that which is <hi>to come;</hi> ſo that it is <hi>profitable unto all things:</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> And all kinds of arguments are uſed in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to induce us thereto. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of them, are thoſe which are drawn from a future ſtate of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But thoſe that may be drawn from preſent convenience and inconvenience, tho' of far leſs weight and force with a wiſe man, are not wholly paſſed over in the ſacred oracles: And, indeed, the latter may poſſibly have a greater influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome minds, than the former.</p>
            <p>THE Pſalmiſt takes it for granted, that the reaſon why men generally deſire life, and love many days, is, that they may <hi>ſee good:</hi> They do not deſire life, merely for the ſake of living; but in hopes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="483" facs="unknown:007488_0488_102B933E520A2A00"/>
happily. And he aſſures us, that the moſt likely means, both of prolonging our lives, and of making them quiet and happy, is to purſue the paths of piety and virtue. This being the manifeſt ſcope and drift of the paſſage under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this ſecond head of diſcourſe, I think, naturally reſolves itſelf into two propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz,</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the practice of religion is the moſt probable means of <hi>lengthening</hi> out our lives: And</p>
            <p>THAT it is alſo the moſt likely way for us to <hi>ſee good,</hi> or to live happily. God has connected the duty and intereſt of men together, not only ſo that they ſhall, in the reſult of things, find themſelves gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by ſerving Him; but ſo that religion is advantageous to them in the <hi>Interim,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this world; only the caſe of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. THE practice of religion is the moſt likely means of <hi>prolonging</hi> human life. It has a direct natural tendency to lengthen out a man's days; while irreligion and vice have plainly a contrary one. All kinds of intemperance, debauchery and exceſs, tend to the death of the body, as well as to the deſtruction of the ſoul; ſo that they who "live after the fleſh," often
<pb n="484" facs="unknown:007488_0489_102B9342C5E7E2F8"/>
               <hi>die</hi> even a temporal death, much ſooner than they would otherwiſe have done. Voluptuouſneſs and ſenſuality diſorder all the ſprings, and poiſon the fountain of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life, bringing diſeaſes upon the body, and moſt certainly ſhortening a man's days in a greater or leſs degree. How many perſons, have, by their criminal exceſſes, impaired their health; and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ruined their conſtitution, ſo that they have ſcarce "lived out half their days?" There are, perhaps, as many, even in Chriſtendom, who have died martyrs to the <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> of the Pagans, as have ever died martyrs to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>ALL irregular affections, and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſions, ſuch as anger, malice, pride and envy, prey alſo upon the ſpirits and life; tho' not ſo apparently, perhaps, as bodily exceſſes. Theſe mental diſorders are the ſickneſs of the ſoul; and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that union and ſympathy, which there is between the ſoul and body, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the health of the latter alſo. Even thoſe vices of the mind, from which we may not ſuſpect any preſent harm, ſap and undermine us; gradually wearing away the ſtrength, the vigor, and the lives of men. So that all the luſts both of the fleſh and of the ſpirit, may be conſidered as a ſlow conſumption, (tho', indeed, not
<pb n="485" facs="unknown:007488_0490_102B9346342DBA20"/>
a very ſlow one in ſome perſons!) which will prove mortal at laſt, tho' not feared at preſent. For notwithſtanding ſome very diſſolute men; men, none of whoſe paſſions have been under due reſtraint, have lived to a great age; yet, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, theſe very perſons might have lived a conſiderable time longer, had they been ſober and <hi>temperate in all things,</hi> as thoſe that <hi>ſtrive for the maſtery.</hi> Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all corporeal gratifications and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and a mind freed from inordinate affections, from extravagant deſires, from irregular, ungovernable paſſions, are life both to the body and the ſoul; they are <q>health to the navel and marrow to the bones.</q>

            <p>UPON the whole, it is manifeſt that "righteouſneſs tendeth unto life" in this world, and ſin unto death. Had man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind perſevered, from the firſt, in their obedience to God, in their original inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, death would not have entered into the world at all: For "righteouſneſs is immortal." And altho' we are all now under the ſentence of death, it being <q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto men once to die</q>; yet the execution of that ſentence is naturally haſtened on the faſter, the more we deviate from the paths of righteouſneſs. And tho' religion cannot make us immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal here, yet it has a very obvious ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, in divers reſpects, to protract our days upon the earth. But</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. THE practice of religion is alſo the moſt probable means of rendering life <hi>eaſy</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> to us, cauſing us to <hi>ſee good.</hi> It is, indeed, no great, degree of felicity that any of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> can reaſonably hope for, in this imperfect ſtate. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, while we live, it is our wiſdom to make the beſt of life, to paſs thro' it with as little ſorrow, and as much peace and ſatisfaction, as is conſiſtent with ſuch a ſtate. And if we aim at doing ſo, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to live under a ſenſe of God and
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:007488_0492_102B934DC9BA3C00"/>
religion; to keep another world in mind, and to regulate our tempers and manners with a view thereto. It is in this way, if in any, that happineſs is to be ſound: And indeed, <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had long and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tried all others, tho' to no purpoſe, came at laſt to this concluſion, That to <q>fear God and keep his commandments, is the whole of man:</q> That the ways of wiſdom are <q>ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her paths peace; that ſhe is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and that happy is every one who retaineth her.</q>

                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 17. 18.</note> The paths of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and vice are full of briars and thorns, like the earth after God had cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it. Whatever diſſolute men may i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, it is only wiſdom, in the practical ſenſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that will be productive of true peace and felicity. Sincere hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs grows not upon folly and vice; this is a ſoil under the divine malediction. Men may <q>weary themſelves in the way of wickedneſs;</q> but they will not find the way of peace, or any reſt to their ſouls, 'till they find the way of virtue, and walk therein. Vice and folly as certainly make men miſerable in a degree, even now, as they will terminate in irretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ruin: Religion as certainly contributes to the happineſs of human life now, as it
<pb n="488" facs="unknown:007488_0493_102B93521FF27780"/>
will iſſue in eternal felicity. For</p>
            <p>IT is to be obſerved, That in the ſame proportion that religion tends to health and length of days, it is alſo productive even of temporal happineſs. The felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of animal life, ſuch as it is, has a cloſe connexion with health and ſoundneſs of body; and is, indeed, inſeparable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. The corporeal diſeaſes which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and other vices bring upon men, and by which their lives are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed, alſo diminiſh their happineſs; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them incapable of reliſhing and enjoying even thoſe animal pleaſures, which are the grand object of their purſuit. Do you imagine that he who, by crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal indulgences and exceſſes, and a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine courſe of life, has enfeebled his body, and impaired his health, can receive as much happineſs from thoſe objects which God has accommodated to our nature, conſidered as ſenſitive creatures, as One who, by obſerving the rules of ſobriety and moderation, preſerves himſelf in health and vigor? Far from it! Such a man fruſtrates his own aim: and while he is criminally graſping at more pleaſure than he ought, deprives himſelf in a great meaſure, even of that which he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently enjoy; yea, often brings ſuch pains and diſeaſes upon himſelf, as make
<pb n="489" facs="unknown:007488_0494_102B935650A8A9E8"/>
life inſupportable to him. There is a great variety of evils, too many to be now enumerated, which are naturally conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon theſe libertine indulgences. <q>Who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? who hath contentions? who hath bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling? who hath wounds without cauſe? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine—At the laſt it biteth like a ſerpent and ſtingeth like an adder—Thine eye ſhall behold ſtrange women, and thine heart ſhall utter perverſe things. Yea thou ſhall be as he that lieth down in the midſt of the ſea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a maſt.</q>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro</hi> 23. 29.</note> In ſhort, nothing is more manifeſt, than that what is uſually called a life of pleaſure, by a ſtrange catachreſis and abuſe of language, is really a life of pain and wretchedneſs; and that men cannot enjoy the happineſs for which they are deſigned, conſidered only as animals, in its greateſt height and perfection, while they violate the laws of virtue in the purſuit of it.</p>
            <p>RELIGION and virtue are alſo condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the felicity of life, as they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally procure the eſteem and good will of men; even of thoſe, who have little or no religion themſelves. They promote that peace and good underſtanding betwixt
<pb n="490" facs="unknown:007488_0495_102B9357F478DC80"/>
man and man, in which happineſs here very much conſiſts. <q>When a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</q> This is not, indeed, univerſally the caſe. Even our bleſſed Saviour and his apoſtles, were as much or more maligned by the world, than any other perſons who were ever in it. Here were ſome peculiar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But in general it is unqueſtionably true, that a religious and virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct attracts the good-will, and procures the good offices of mankind. A good man is far leſs likely to get into trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome contentions and broils, and to have enemies, than a proud, ambitious, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or wrathful one. Daily obſervation confirms this. And there are ſome vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which have a more immediate and direct tendency to conciliate the friendſhip of men; to promote and to eſtabliſh that good harmony which is ſo conducive to happineſs: I mean thoſe virtues, which are more eſpecially alluded to in the text—Let him that would <hi>ſee good,</hi> 
               <q>keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guile let him depart from evil, and do good; ſeek peace, and purſue it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is moreover, and indeed very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to be obſerved, That inward peace, and tranquility of mind, is not to
<pb n="491" facs="unknown:007488_0496_102B935BDA509E38"/>
be obtained but by the practice of religion. We are moral and accountable creatures; and have an immediate conſciouſneſs and feeling of our being ſo. And 'till a man has taken a fatal opiate, and laid his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſleep, it will frequently call him to a ſevere reckoning for his evil deeds. It is an accuſer, witneſs and judge, which he can neither fly from, nor eaſily bribe. And how unhappy is that man, whoſe own heart condemneth him? who, inſtead of being able to look up to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with confidence, cannot even look himſelf in the face, without bluſhing and trembling? This, in general, is the caſe of wicked men; there is no peace to them. Even in their greateſt proſperity, they are frequently diſquieted by conſcious guilt; and in adverſity, that God, who is the <q>confidence of the ends of the earth,</q> is a terror to them. Thus are they <q>like the troubled ſea, when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</q>

work of righteouſneſs is peace: and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</q> But</p>
            <p>RELIGION is more eſpecially fruitful of happineſs, as it gives the glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of endleſs felicity in the world to come. <q>We are the children of God, ſays the Apoſtle; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt—For I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</q>

very hard upon a man's ſpirits, leaving but little room for mirth and joy: But with it, all things are tolerable; it lightens every burden; it inhances every bleſſing; it mitigates every ſorrow; it gilds the moſt gloomy ſcenes of life; and is a perpetual cordial to the fainting ſoul. It animates a good man, in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it gives him ſtrength to do, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to bear all things. It delights at home and abroad; in company and in ſolitude: It brightens our days, and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our nightly ſlumbers. From youth to age, it preſerves the good in perfect peace, their minds being ſtayed upon God. Thro' this, they are happy even without thoſe poſſeſſions and enjoyments, in which others place all their felicity; ſo that <q>having nothing, they poſſeſs all things.</q> It at once diſarms both life and death of their ſting and terrors—O bleſſed hope! it is thou which turneſt mourning into gladneſs of heart, darkneſs into light, and death into life: It is thou which turneſt the ſufferings of time, into the triumphs of immortality; and cauſeſt us, even in this vale of tears, <q>to rejoice with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory!</q>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> religion tends naturally both to lengthen out our lives, and to make them happy
<pb n="494" facs="unknown:007488_0499_102B936604E14868"/>
and that vice and irreligion have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tendency, to ſhorten, and make them miſerable. But when I ſpeak of religion as having ſuch a natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, this is not deſigned, by any means, to exclude the providence of God, his care and guardianſhip of the righteous. Things have no other tendency, than what God himſelf has given them: It is He that has eſtabliſhed all their connexions, and who conſtantly maintains them by his power and providence, "working all in all." If the lives of thoſe who fear and ſerve God, are <hi>prolonged;</hi> or if ſuch perſons <hi>ſee more good</hi> than others, it is becauſe <q>the eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry;</q> as it is expreſſed in the text. On the other hand, if the wicked <hi>die in youth;</hi> or if they live an <hi>unquiet, joyleſs</hi> life, it is becauſe <q>the face of the LORD is againſt them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth;</q> as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the verſe immediately following. God's providence is minutely concerned in every thing that happens to us: And both the prayers of the righteous, and the blaſphemies of the wicked, are loud and vocal in his ears. They are heard from the depths of the earth to the height of heaven, "going up for a memorial before
<pb n="495" facs="unknown:007488_0500_102B936ACDDA7688"/>
God"; the one for good, the other for evil. And altho' this is not a ſtate of retribution, but of diſcipline; yet God even now knoweth them that are his, and ſhews them his peculiar favour; while he, in ſome degree, chaſtizes the impious and vicious, in the courſe of his providence. He has actually connected our duty and our happineſs together, even in this world; at leaſt ſo far as to manifeſt, that He is the righteous moral governor of the world; and that <hi>They</hi> alone can be happy, who truly fear him, and work righteouſneſs. Irreligious, diſſolute men, may flatter and deceive themſelves, if they pleaſe: But even they, in their <hi>lucid intervals,</hi> know that this is true—It is the immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of heaven, that none ſhall find their account, even at preſent, in departing from the living God; from the <q>fountain of living waters</q>! They may, indeed, hew out unto themſelves ciſterns; but they will prove leaky, <q>broken ciſterns, which can hold no water</q>; which will not retain a drop of pure, unadulterated hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but tranſmit it all thro', leaving only the ſcum, the dregs, and the filth behind. That fooliſh prodigal who leaves his Father's houſe, <q>where there is bread enough, and to ſpare, tho' he would fain fill his belly with the huſks
<pb n="496" facs="unknown:007488_0501_102B937178EA9650"/>

            <p>BUT I muſt now cloſe this ſubject with ſome reflections, as was propoſed.</p>
            <p>THOSE perſons who have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to old age, agreably to their wiſhes in youth, have great cauſe of thankfulneſs to the God of their lives. It is becauſe they have obtained help from Him, that they yet ſurvive. This, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhown, is a great favour and bleſſing; if not on account of any happineſs of a
<pb n="497" facs="unknown:007488_0502_102B93751DEDE168"/>
worldly nature, yet, at leaſt, in reſpect of the opportunity which length of days gives men, for acquainting themſelves with God, and providing for their eternal welfare. And certainly thoſe who are thus favoured of heaven, ought to return their grateful acknowledgments thither.</p>
            <p>THOSE of us alſo, whoſe friends, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whoſe Parents (commonly our beſt friends) are preſerved to old age, ought to bleſs God upon this account. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our gratitude, both as it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to them, whom we ought to eſteem and reverence, and alſo to ourſelves. The young need the counſels, the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and good example of the aged: And ought to look upon it as a great bleſſing of heaven, when their pious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are thus preſerved to them. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead hereof, ſome ungracious children ſeem to think it a burden and misfortune to them, when thoſe, from whom they immediately derived their own being, live to a great age; having their tho'ts more fixed, probably, upon an earthly, than upon an heavenly <hi>inheritance.</hi> But it is certainly very inconſiſtent with the honor which we owe to our <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother, that our own days may be long</hi> in the world, to think the time long and tedious till <hi>They</hi> are taken out of it. And all ſuch
<pb n="498" facs="unknown:007488_0503_102B937A12FC9880"/>
diſreſpectful, undutiful children, better deſerve the title of <hi>baſtards</hi> than of <hi>ſons,</hi> could it be given them without an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit reflection upon thoſe, for whom they ought to have a greater regard and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. He whoſe breaſt is warmed with true filial piety, will be deſirous of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the life of his parents as long as may be; and of rendering age and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as ſupportable and agreeble to them as he can, even after he can no longer expect to receive any conſiderable benefit from them. The death of a parent will always rather ſeem too early, than too long deferred, in the opinion of ſuch perſons. However, they will alſo remember, that men are born to die; and ſubmiſſively bear the ſeparating ſtroke, when it comes: Knowing, that tho' Father and Mother forſake them, they have a Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, eternal and immortal, tho' inviſible; and whoſe paternal care is exerciſed over all <hi>his offspring;</hi> eſpecially over thoſe who <q>have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father!</q>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.</note>—But to proceed with our reflections—</p>
            <p>IT deſerves the ſerious conſideration of the Aged, whether they have lived ſo long to any good purpoſe? whether they have given their attention to the great ends of life? and made ſuch an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="499" facs="unknown:007488_0504_102B937D96088C78"/>
of their time, that they can give a good account of it to God, when he calls them to appear before Him? Which time is now near at hand, even at the door; ſince they cannot expect to ſurvive much longer. It becomes not One, who is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf young, to be very officious in cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing or counſelling the Old: But, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, if I were myſelf old, I ſhould judge it proper to catechiſe myſelf, in ſome ſuch manner as this—How have I employed thoſe years which have rolled over my head: how demeaned myſelf under that goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering, which God has exerciſed towards me? Have I conſidered life as the gift and bleſſing of God, to be employed chiefly in learning his will, in acquainting myſelf with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and in doing his commandments, in order to my <q>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving right to eat of the tree of life</q>? Have I glorified God in the world? and laid myſelf out, to be ſerviceable to my fellow men, in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the talents committed to me? Has it been my daily care and concern to approve myſelf to Him, who ſearcheth the hearts of men; and who will finally <q>give to every man according to his deeds</q>? Has the ſalvation of my ſoul been the grand object of my attention, as
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:007488_0505_102B938201AC19C0"/>
almoſt the only thing that is worthy of it? Have all other deſires and purſuits been habitually ſubordinated to this? What proficiency in true goodneſs and holineſs have I made, during this long probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate? Have I gained the maſtery of my luſts and paſſions; and, <hi>thro' the Spirit, mortified the deeds of the body,</hi> ſo that I am now prepared to leave that world, in which I have lived ſo long? How many of my <hi>contemporaries</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready numbered with the dead; while I am ſtill among the living? Where ſhould I now have been, had God taken me out of the world in middle age, or in youth, with <hi>them?</hi> in the paradiſe of God, or in the regions of woe! Such queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe ſeem proper for every aged perſon to put to himſelf. Nor is it to be doubted, but that many could truly anſwer them in the manner, in which no one could help wiſhing them reſolved for himſelf; all being deſirous, whenever they die, to <q>die the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</q> But, alas! is there not reaſon to think, that ſome could not anſwer ſuch inquiries to their ſatisfaction? Is there not reaſon to fear, that many have ſpent their days in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? in purſuing the vanities of this world, without any ſerious, habitual concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="501" facs="unknown:007488_0506_102B9385E9F97BC0"/>
another? And that even now, when gray hairs are here and there upon them, they conſider it not? I would obſerve the apoſtle's direction, <q>not <hi>rebuking</hi> all <hi>Elder,</hi> but intreating him as a <hi>Father,</hi> and the younger men as brethren.</q> Let me beſeech the Aged, with all due reſpect, to look both backward and forward; to reflect upon the life which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lived, and almoſt ſpent; and to conſider that other life and ſtate, which they are ſo ſoon to enter upon, according to the common courſe of nature. Poſſibly ſome of them may, upon a little reflexion, ſee that tho' they have lived ſo long, they have not lived to ſo good purpoſe as they might have done: And others, that they have not yet lived to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all; but neglected the grand buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and concernment of life, 'till life is now almoſt brought to a period. If there are any of them, who have not yet num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered their days aright, nor applied their hearts to wiſdom, it behoves them to do it now, and to redeem the time. Their days which now remain may, probably, in one ſenſe, be very eaſily numbered!—</p>
            <p>THERE is ſcarce a more melancholly ſight to a perſon of ſober reflection, than a man who is juſt dropping into his grave with old age, ſtill tho'tleſs of God, and
<pb n="502" facs="unknown:007488_0507_102B938A23C2D8A0"/>
another ſtate. It is matter of great grief to the wiſe and good, to ſee the Young thus inconſiderate; thus forgetful of the God that made them; thus regardleſs of their future intereſt: But to ſee the Aged ſo, is much more ſorrowful. There is conſiderable ground to hope, that the Young may live to ſee the error of their ways, and become wiſe unto ſalvation. But when life is already, in a manner, run out; when men have, as it were, one foot in the grave; and are ſtill purſuing vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtraws and bubbles, with all the tho't<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs levity and wantonneſs of youth; there is, alas! but little ground for hope with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them. If their caſe is not quite deſperate, it is not far from being ſo. And ſurely thoſe who have ſpent a long life in ſin and folly, muſt have a much more aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account to give of themſelves at laſt, than they who have ſpent only a ſhort one in the ſame manner. They have <q>heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed treaſure together for the laſt days;</q>

            <p>BUT this ſubject muſt now be applied to the Young, to whom, indeed, it moſt properly belongs—<hi>My Brethren,</hi> do you <q>deſire life, and love many days, that you may ſee good?</q> I know you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. Hearken then to the counſel of divine wiſdom: <q>Keep your tongues from evil, and your lips from ſpeaking guile; depart from evil and do good</q>—Be aſſured from reaſon, from the experience of others, and eſpecially from the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble word of God, that <hi>that</hi> long life and happineſs, of which you are ſo deſirous, cannot be wiſely and ſucceſsfully ſought after in any other courſe, than that of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber religion and virtue. The Young are generally hard to be perſuaded of this truth, however certain, and however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant it is to them, both with relation to this world and another, to time and to eternity. They pleaſe themſelves with falſe notions of happineſs; of an happineſs independent of God, the ſource of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of all good;—of happineſs in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance which a man poſſeſſeth; of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in worldly honors and preferments; of happineſs in a ſenſual courſe of life. All theſe imaginations, depend upon it, if God is true, are mere deluſions of the

Devil, both God's enemy and your's.

            <p>IN fine; Let all bear in mind the great end of life; and let us all, young men and maidens, old men and children, praiſe the name of the Lord; ſerving the God of our Fathers, with a perfect heart, and with a ready mind. Tho' religion allows us, while we live here, to be converſant about our ſecular affairs; and altho' even ſome good men often give a great part of their attention to this world, (indeed much more than they ought to do) yet it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the Chriſtian character, that a man's heart and hope are habitually in heaven. The Mariner's needle, when du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched by the magnet, has a direction and tendency to the North: And tho' it may be diſturbed, ſo that it will tremble and waver for a time betwixt the two poles, or even ſeem to incline moſt to the ſouth; will yet fix and come to a ſtand, only where it ought to do. Thus the ſoul of a good man, being thoroughly
<pb n="509" facs="unknown:007488_0514_102B93A329DB0EB0"/>
touched by the ſpirit of the living God, will ever tend towards Him, and point to heaven. Tho' it may be diſturbed by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions from below; and waver for a moment betwixt God and the world, or even ſeem to incline more to earth than heaven; yet it will come to a ſtand, and fix, towards no other point in the hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere beſides the <hi>Zenith;</hi> whither He, who once deſcended, is again aſcended, even far above all principality and power; whither He is gone to prepare a place, a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the ſtorms and diſturbances of this impure, inclement region, for all his faithful ſervants; <hi>that where He is, they may be alſo, and behold his glory.</hi> If the great end of life is anſwered; if we truly know God and Jeſus Chriſt; if we are <q>accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to obtain THAT world, and the reſurrection from the dead;</q>
               <note n="§" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 20. 35.</note> it is not very material whether we die in youth, or in advanced age. The death of thoſe who live the longeſt, is ſadly premature, if they die in ſin and folly: It is, in the worſt of ſenſes, to die before our time, to be taken out of this world unprepared for another, unleſs it is by being fitted for deſtruction, and becoming ripe for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance!

they die truly wiſe and virtuous. To be fit for heaven, is in effect, to be old, and ripe for the grave. And ſome are ſo happy, as even in early life, to attain to that ſubſtantial wiſdom and goodneſs, to which old age is often a ſtranger: So that you ſee <q>Honourable age is not that which ſtandeth in length of time, or that is meaſured by number of years: But wiſdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unſpotted life is old age.</q>
