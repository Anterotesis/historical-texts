            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>MY mind hath often been affected with ſorrow, on account of the prevailing of that ſpirit, which leads from an humble waiting on the inward teaching of Chriſt, to purſue ways of living, attended with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary labour, and which draws forth the minds of many people to ſeek after outward power, and to ſtrive for riches, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently introduce oppreſſion, and bring forth wars and grievous calamities.</p>
            <p>It is with reverence that I acknowledge the mercies of our heavenly Father, who, in infinite love, did viſit me in my youth, and wrought a belief in me, that through true obedience a ſtate of inward purity may be known in this life, in which we may love mankind in the ſame love with which our Redeemer loveth us, and therein learn reſignation to endure hardſhips, for the real good of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>While the eye is ſingle, the whole body is full of light,</hi> Matt. vi. 22; but for want of this, ſelfiſh deſires, and an imaginary ſuperiority,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011124_0003_0F85366B506A7808"/>darken the mind; hence injuſtice frequently proceeds; and where this is the caſe, to convince the judgment, is the moſt effectual remedy.</p>
            <p>Where violent meaſures are purſued in oppoſing injuſtice, the paſſions, and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the injured, frequently operate in the proſecution of their deſigns; and after conflicts productive of very great calamities, the minds of contending parties often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as little acquainted with the pure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divine love, as they were before; but where people walk in that pure light in which all their <hi>works are wrought in God,</hi> John iii. 21, and under oppreſſion perſevere in the meek ſpirit, and abide firm in the cauſe of truth, without actively complying with oppreſſive demands, through thoſe the Lord hath often manifeſted his power, in opening the underſtandings of others, to the promoting righteouſneſs in the earth.</p>
            <p>A time, I believe, is coming, wherein this divine work will ſo ſpread and prevail, that <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, nor learn war any more,</hi> Iſaiah ii. And as we, through the tender mercies of God, do feel that this precious work is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, I am concerned to encourage my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters in a holy care and diligence,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011124_0004_0F85366C0C40D358"/>that each of us may ſo live, under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying power of truth, as to be redeemed from all unneceſſary cares; that our eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingle to him, no cuſtoms, however pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, which are contrary to the wiſdom from above, may hinder us from faithfully following his holy leadings, in whatſoever he may graciouſly appoint for us.</p>

               <hi>On</hi> PURE WISDOM, <hi>and</hi> HUMAN POLICY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O have our truſt ſettled in the Lord, and not to ſeek after, nor deſire outward treaſures, any further than his holy ſpirit leads us therein, is a happy ſtate, as ſaith the prophet, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pure wiſdom leads people into lowlineſs of mind, in which they learn reſignation to the divine will, and contentment in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his cauſe, when they cannot keep a clear conſcience without ſuffering.</p>
            <p>In this pure wiſdom the mind is attentive to the root, and original ſpring of motions and deſires, and as we know <hi>the Lord to be our refuge,</hi> and find no ſafety, but in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly walking before him, we feel an holy engagement, that every deſire which leads therefrom may be brought to judgment.</p>
            <p>While we proceed in this precious way, and find arden longings for a full deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011124_0006_0F85366DA701F258"/>from every thing which defiles, all proſpects of gain, that are not conſiſtent with the wiſdom from above, are conſidered as ſnares, and an inward concern is felt, that we may live under the croſs, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend to that holy ſpirit, which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to preſerve out of them.</p>
            <p>When I have conſidered that ſaying of Chriſt, Matt. vi. 19, <hi>Lay not up for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves treaſures upon earth,</hi> his omnipotence hath often occurred to my mind.</p>
            <p>While we believe that he is every where preſent with his people, and that perfect goodneſs, wiſdom and power, are united in him, how comfortable is the conſideration.</p>
            <p>Our wants may be great, but his power is greater. We may be oppreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, but he is able to turn our patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings into profit to ourſelves, and to the advancement of his work on earth. His people, who feel the power of his croſs, to crucify all that is ſelfiſh in them, who are engaged in outward concerns, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement that it is their duty, and reſign themſelves, and their treaſures, to him; theſe feel that it is dangerous to give way to that in us, which craves riches and greatneſs in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011124_0007_0F85366E446AFB40"/>
As the heart truly contrite, earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires <hi>to know Chriſt, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings,</hi> Phil. iii. 10, ſo far as the Lord for gracious <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds may lead into them; as ſuch feel that it is their intereſt to put their truſt in God, and to ſeek no gain but that which he, by his holy ſpirit, leads into; ſo, on the contrary, they who do not reverently wait for this divine teacher, and are not humbly concerned, according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>to fill up that which is behind of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Chriſt,</hi> Col. i. 24, in patiently ſuffering for the promoting righteouſneſs in the earth; but have an eye toward the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of men, and the outward advantage of wealth, theſe are often attentive to thoſe employments which appear profitable, even though the gains ariſe from ſuch trade and buſineſs which proceeds from the workings of that ſpirit, which is eſtranged from the ſelf-denying life of an humble contrite Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>While I write on this ſubject, I feel my mind tenderly affected toward thoſe honeſtly diſpoſed people, who have been brought up in employments attended with thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.</p>
            <p>To ſuch I may ſay, in the feeling of our heavenly Father's love, and number myſelf
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011124_0008_0F85366F42924F58"/>with you, O that our eyes may be ſingle to the Lord! may we reverently wait on him for ſtrength, to lay aſide all unneceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of every kind, and learn contentment, in a plain ſimple life.</p>
            <p>May we, in lowlineſs, ſubmit to the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his ſpirit, and enter upon any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward employ which he graciouſly points out to us, and then whatever difficulties ariſe, in conſequence of our faithfulneſs, I truſt they will work for our good.</p>
            <p>Small treaſure to a reſigned mind is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. How happy is it to be content with a little, to live in humility, and feel that in us, which breathes out this language, Abba! Father.</p>
            <p>If that, called the wiſdom of this world, had no reſemblance of true wiſdom, the name of wiſdom, I ſuppoſe, had not been given to it.</p>
            <p>As waſting outward ſubſtance, to gratify vain deſires, on one hand; ſo ſlothfulneſs and neglect, on the other, do often involve men and their families in trouble, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to want and diſtreſs; to ſhun both theſe oppoſite vices, is good in itſelf, and hath a reſemblance of wiſdom; but while people thus provident, have it principally in view to get riches, and power, and the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011124_0009_0F85366FF69F4E90"/>friendſhip of this world, and do not humbly wait for the ſpirit of truth to lead them in purity; theſe, through an anxious care to obtain the end deſired, reach forth for gain in worldly wiſdom, and, in regard to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate, fall into divers temptations and ſnares. And though ſuch may think of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying wealth to good purpoſes, and to uſe their power to prevent oppreſſion, yet wealth and power is often applied otherwiſe; nor can we depart from the leadings of our holy ſhepherd, without going into confuſion.</p>
            <p>Great wealth is frequently attended with power, which nothing but divine love can qualify the mind to uſe rightly; and as to the humility, and uprightneſs of our children after us, how great is the uncertainty! If, in acquiring wealth, we take hold on the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from beneath, and depart from the leadings of truth, and example our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren herein, we have great cauſe to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that wealth may be a ſnare to them; and prove an injury to others, over whom their wealth may give them power.</p>
            <p>To be redeemed from that wiſdom which is from beneath, and walk in the light of the Lord, is a precious ſituation; thus his people are brought to put their truſt in him; and in this humble confidence in his wiſdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="12" facs="unknown:011124_0010_0F853670C3825890"/>and power, the righteous find a refuge in adverſities, ſuperior to the greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helps, and a comfort more certain than any worldly advantages can afford.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING from my childhood been uſed to bodily labour for a living, I may expreſs my experience therein.</p>
            <p>Right exerciſe affords an innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the time of it, and prepares us to enjoy the ſweetneſs of reſt; but from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes each way, ariſe inconveniences.</p>
            <p>Moderate exerciſe opens the pores, gives the blood a lively circulation, and the better enables us to judge rightly reſpecting that portion of labour which is the true medium.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fowls of the Air ſow not, nor gather into barns, yet our heavenly father feedeth them,</hi> Matt. vi. 26; nor do I believe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs and power would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted labour to us, had he not ſeen that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was proper for us in this life.</p>
            <p>The original deſign, and true medium of labour, is a ſubject that, to me, appears wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011124_0011_0F853671C2305168"/>
Idle men are often a burden to themſelves, neglect the duty they owe to their families, and become burdenſome to others alſo.</p>
            <p>As outward labour, directed by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from above, tends to our health, and adds to our happineſs in this life; ſo, on the contrary, entering upon it in a ſelfiſh ſpirit, and purſuing it too long, or too hard, hath a contrary effect.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that too much labour not only makes the underſtanding dull, but ſo intrudes upon the harmony of the body, that after ceaſing from our toil, we have another to paſs through, before we can be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as to enjoy the ſweetneſs of reſt.</p>
            <p>From too much labour in the heat, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proceeds immoderate ſweats, which do often, I believe, open the way for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and impair our conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>When we go beyond the true medium, and feel wearineſs approaching, but think buſineſs may ſuffer if we ceaſe, at ſuch a time ſpirituous liquors are frequently taken, with a view to ſupport nature under theſe fatigues.</p>
            <p>I have found that too much labour in the ſummer heats the blood, that taking ſtrong drink to ſupport the body under ſuch labour, increaſeth that heat, and though a perſon

            <p>Thus toiling in the heat, and drinking ſtrong liquor, makes men more reſolute, and leſs conſiderate, and tends very much to diſqualify from ſucceſsfully following him who is meek and low of heart.</p>
            <p>As laying out buſineſs, more than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with pure wiſdom, is an evil, ſo this evil frequently leads into more. Too much buſineſs leads to hurry. In the hurry and toil too much ſtrong drink is often uſed, and hereby many proceed to noiſe and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſome, tho' more conſiderate, do often ſuffer loſs, as to a true compoſedneſs of mind.</p>
            <p>I feel ſincere deſires in my heart that no rent, nor intereſt, might be laid ſo high as to be a ſnare to tenants. That no deſires of gain may draw any too far in buſineſs. That no cares to ſupport cuſtoms, which have not their foundation in pure wiſdom, may have place in our minds, but that we may build on the ſure foundation, and feel our holy ſhepherd to lead us, who alone is able to preſerve us, and bring forth from every thing which defiles.</p>

Having ſeveral times, in my travels, had opportunity to obſerve the labour and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life of great numbers of ſlaves, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me that the true medium is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably neglected by many, who aſſign them their portion of labour.</p>
            <p>Without ſaying much at this time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning buying and ſelling men for term of life, who have as juſt a right to liberty as we have; nor about the great miſeries, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of blood, conſequent to promoting the ſlave-trade, and to ſpeak as favourably as may be, with regard to continuing thoſe in bondage who are amongſt us, we cannot ſay there is no partiality in it; for whatever ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs may be manifeſted by individuals in their life time toward them, yet for people to be tranſmitted from a man to his poſterity, in the helpleſs condition of ſlaves, appears inconſiſtent with the nature of the goſpel ſpirit. From ſuch proceedings it often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that perſons in the decline of life, are deprived of monies equitably due to them, and committed to the care, and ſubjected to the abſolute power of young unexperienced men, who know but little about the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of old age, nor underſtand the language of declining life.</p>

Where parents give their eſtates to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and then depend on them for a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, they ſometimes meet with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; but if the power of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, thus obtained, doth often reverſe the obligations of gratitude and filial duty, and makes manifeſt, that youth are often ignorant of the language of old age, how hard is the caſe of antient Negroes, who, deprived of the wages equitably due to them, are left to young people, who have been uſed to look upon them as their inferiors.</p>
            <p>For men to behold the fruits of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour withheld from them, and poſſeſſed by others, and in old age find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of thoſe comfortable accommodations, and that tender regard which their time of life requires:</p>
            <p>When they feel pains, and ſtiffneſs in their joints and limbs, weakneſs of appetite, and that a little labour is weariſome, and ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold themſelves in the neglected uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition of a ſlave, and oftentimes to a young unſympathiſing man:</p>
            <p>For men to be thus treated from one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another, who, beſides their own diſtreſſes, think on the ſlavery entailed on their poſterity, and are grieved! what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable thoughts muſt they have of the

            <p>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God, <hi>Mark x. 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To encourage children to do things with a view to get praiſe of men, to me appears an obſtruction to their being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly acquainted with the ſpirit of truth. For it is the work of the Holy Spirit to direct the mind to God, that in all our proceedings we may have a ſingle eye to him. To give alms in ſecret, to faſt in ſecret, and labour to keep clear of that diſpoſition reproved by our Saviour, <hi>All their works which they do is for to be ſeen of men,</hi> Matt. xxiii. 5.</p>
            <p>That divine light which enlightens all men, I believe, does often ſhine in the minds of children very early, and to humbly wait for wiſdom, that our conduct toward them may tend to forward their acquaintance with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011124_0016_0F853675569EC580"/>it, and ſtrengthen them in obedience thereto, appears to me to be a duty on all of us.</p>
            <p>By cheriſhing the ſpirit of pride, and the love of praiſe in them, I believe they may ſometimes improve faſter in learning, than otherwiſe they would, but to take meaſures to forward children in learning, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tend to divert their minds from true humility, appears to me to ſavour of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this world.</p>
            <p>If tutors are not acquainted with ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſpirit, nor experienced in an humble waiting for the leadings of truth, but follow the maxims of the wiſdom of this world, ſuch children who are under their tuition, appear to me to be in danger of imbibing thoughts, and apprehenſions, reverſe to that meekneſs, and lowlineſs of heart, which is neceſſary for all the true fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Children at an age fit for ſchools, are in a time of life which requires the patient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of pious people, and if we commit them to the tuition of ſuch, whoſe minds we believe are not rightly prepared to <hi>train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> we are in danger of not acting the part of faithful parents toward them; for our heavenly father doth not require us to do
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011124_0017_0F853675DBCB47B8"/>evil, that good may come of it; and it is needful that we deeply examine ourſelves, leſt we get entangled in the wiſdom of this world, and, through wrong apprehenſions, take ſuch methods in education, as may prove a great injury to the minds of our children.</p>
            <p>It is a lovely ſight to behold innocent children! and when they are ſent to ſuch ſchools where their tender minds are in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of being led aſtray by tutors, who do not live a ſelf-denying life, or by the converſation of ſuch children who do not live in innocence, it is a caſe much to be lamented.</p>
            <p>While a pious tutor hath the charge of no more children than he can take due care of, and keeps his authority in the truth, the good ſpirit in which he leads and governs, works on the minds of ſuch who are not hardened, and his labours not only tend to bring them forward in outward learning, but to open their underſtandings with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the true chriſtian life; but where a perſon hath charge of too many, and his thoughts and time are ſo much employed in the outward affairs of his ſchool, that he does not ſo weightily attend to the ſpirit and conduct of each individual, as to be enabled to adminiſter rightly to all in due ſeaſon;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011124_0018_0F853676B707EFB8"/>through ſuch emiſſion he not only ſuffers, as to the ſtate of his own mind, but the minds of the children are in danger of ſuffering alſo.</p>
            <p>To watch the ſpirit of children, to nurture them in goſpel love, and labour to help them againſt that which would mar the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them; and a faithful performance of our duty, not only tends to their laſting benefit, and our own peace, but alſo to render their company agreeable to us.</p>
            <p>Inſtruction, thus adminiſtred, reaches the pure witneſs in the minds of ſuch children who are not hardened, and begets love in them toward thoſe who thus lead them on; but where too great a number are committed to a tutor, and he, through much cumber, omits a careful attention to the minds of children, there is danger of diſorders gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing amongſt them, till the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appear in their conduct, too ſtrong to be eaſily remedied.</p>
            <p>A care hath lived on my mind, that more time might be employed by parents at home, and by tutors at ſchool, in weightily attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſpirit and inclinations of children, and that we may ſo lead, inſtruct, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, in this tender part of life, that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011124_0019_0F8536774FBD4FE8"/>nothing may be omitted in our power, to help them on their way to become the children of our father, who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Meditating on the ſituation of ſchools in our provinces, my mind hath, at times, been affected with ſorrow, and under theſe exerciſes it hath appeared to me, that if thoſe who have large eſtates, were faithful ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and laid no rent, nor intereſt, nor other demand, higher than is conſiſtent with univerſal love, and thoſe in lower circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would, under a moderate employ, ſhun unneceſſary expence, even to the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt article; and all unite in humbly ſeeking to the Lord, he would graciouſly inſtruct us, and ſtrengthen us, to relieve the youth from various ſnares, in which many of them are entangled.</p>

               <hi>On the</hi> RIGHT USE <hi>of the</hi> LORD'S OUTWARD GIFTS.</head>
            <p>As our underſtandings are opened by the pure light, we experience that, through an inward approaching to God, the mind is ſtrengthened in obedience; and that by
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011124_0020_0F85367813CC15B0"/>gratifying thoſe deſires which are not of his begetting, thoſe approaches to him are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and the deceivable ſpirit gains ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Theſe truths, being as it were engraven upon our hearts, and our everlaſting intereſt in Chriſt evidently concerned herein, we become fervently engaged, that nothing may be nouriſhed which tends to feed pride or ſelf-love in us. Thus in pure obedience, we are not only inſtructed in our duty to God, but alſo in the affairs which neceſſarily relate to this life, and the ſpirit of truth which guides into all truth, leavens the mind with a pious concern, that <hi>whatſoever we do in word or deed, may be done in his name,</hi> Col. iii. 17.</p>
            <p>Hence ſuch buildings, furniture, food, and raiment, as beſt anſwer our neceſſities, and are the leaſt likely to feed that ſelfiſh ſpirit which is our enemy, are the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to us.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate the mind is tender, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly watchful, that the love of gain draw us not into any buſineſs, which may weaken our love to our heavenly father, or bring unneceſſary trouble to any of his creatures.</p>
            <p>Thus the way gradually opens to ceaſe from that ſpirit which craves riches and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011124_0021_0F853678CB0077A0"/>things fetched far, which ſo mixeth with the cuſtoms of this world, and ſo intrudes upon the true harmony of life, that the right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of labour is very much departed from. And as the minds of people are ſettled in a ſteady concern, not to hold nor poſſeſs any thing but what may be held conſiſtent with the wiſdom from above, they conſider what they poſſeſs as the gift of God, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly exerciſed, that in all parts of their conduct they may act agreeable to the nature of the peaceable government of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A little ſupports ſuch a life; and in a ſtate truly reſigned to the Lord, the eye is ſingle, to ſee what outward employ he leads into, as a means of our ſubſiſtance, and a lively care is maintained to hold to that without launching further.</p>
            <p>There is a harmony in the ſeveral parts of this divine work in the hearts of people; he who leads them to ceaſe from thoſe gainful employments, carried on in that wiſdom which is from beneath, delivers alſo from the deſire after worldly greatneſs, and reconciles the mind to a life ſo plain, that a little doth ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Here the real comforts of life are not leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened. Moderate exerciſe, in the way of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011124_0022_0F8536798B47F468"/>true wiſdom, is pleaſant both to mind and body.</p>
            <p>Food and raiment ſufficient, though in the greateſt ſimplicity, is accepted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and gratitude.</p>
            <p>The mutual love, ſubſiſting between the faithful followers of Chriſt, is more pure than that friendſhip which is not ſeaſoned with humility, how ſpecious ſoever the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>Where people depart from pure wiſdom in one caſe, it is often an introduction to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it in many more; and thus a ſpirit which ſeeks for outward greatneſs, and leads into worldly wiſdom to attain it, and ſupport it, gets poſſeſſion of the mind.</p>
            <p>In beholding the cuſtomary departure from the true medium of labour, and that unneceſſary toil which many go through, in ſupporting outward greatneſs, and procuring delicacies:</p>
            <p>In beholding how the true calmneſs of life is changed into hurry, and that many, by eagerly purſuing outward treaſure, are in great danger of withering as to the inward ſtate of the mind:</p>
            <p>In meditating on the works of this ſpirit, and on the deſolations it makes amongſt the profeſſors of chriſtianity, I may thankfully
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011124_0023_0F85367A480C7878"/>acknowledge, that I often feel pure love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get longings in my heart, for the exaltation of the peaceable kingdom of Chriſt, and an engagement to labour according to the gift beſtowed on me, for the promoting an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, plain, temperate way of living. A life where no unneceſſary cares, nor expences, may encumber our minds, nor leſſen our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do good; where no deſires after riches, or greatneſs, may lead into hard deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; where no connections with worldly minded men, may abate our love to God, nor weaken a true zeal for righteouſneſs. A life, wherein we may diligently labour for reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to do, and ſuffer, whatever our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father may allot for us, in reconciling the world to himſelf.</p>
            <p>When the prophet Iſaiah had uttered his viſion, and declared that a time was coming wherein <hi>ſwords ſhould be beat into plowſhares, and ſpears into pruning hooks, and that nation ſhould not lift up ſword againſt nation, nor learn war any more;</hi> he immediately direct the minds of people to the divine teacher, in this remarkable language, <hi>O houſe Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light the Lord,</hi> Iſaiah ii. 5.</p>
            <p>To wait for the direction of this light, in all temporal as well as ſpiritual concerns, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <pb n="26" facs="unknown:011124_0024_0F85367B05F4E700"/>neceſſary; for if in any caſe we enter lightly into temporal affairs, without feeling this ſpirit of truth to open our way therein, and through the love of this world proceed on, and ſeek for gain by that buſineſs or traffic, which <hi>is not of the father, but of the world,</hi> 1 John ii. 16, we fail in our teſtimony to the purity and peace of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and get into that which is for chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>This matter hath lain heavy on my mind, it being evident, that a life leſs humble, leſs ſimple and plain, than that which Chriſt leads his ſheep into, does neceſſarily require a ſupport, which pure wiſdom does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for; hence there is no probability of our being <hi>a peculiar people, ſo zealous of good works, as to have no fellowſhip with works of darkneſs,</hi> Titus ii. 14. Epheſ. v. 11, while we have wants to ſupply which have their foundation in cuſtom, and do not come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the meaning of thoſe expreſſions, <hi>your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
