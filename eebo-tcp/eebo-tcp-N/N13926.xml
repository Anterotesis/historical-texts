            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>MY dog had made a point on a piece of lee-ground, and led the Curate and me two or three hundred yards over that and ſome ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>It was a falſe point, and our labour was in vain: yet, to do Rover juſtice, (for he is an excellent dog. though I have loſt his pedigree) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſtopped and cried Hem! The Curate is fatter than me; he wiped the ſweat from his brow.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſtate where one is apter to pauſe and look round them, than after ſuch a diſappointment. Nay, it is even ſo in life. When we have been hurrying on, led by ſome warm wiſh or other, looking neither to the right hand or to the left—we ſhall find of a ſudden that all our gay hopes are flown; and the only ſlender conſolation that ſome friend can give us, is to point where they were once to be ſound.

                  <p>I looked round with ſome ſuch grave apothegm in my mind, when I diſcovered, for the firſt time, a venerable looking pile, to which the incloſure belonged. An air of melancholy hung about it. There was a languid ſtillneſs in the day, and a ſingle crow, that ſat on an old tree at the ſide of the gate, ſeemed to delight in the echo which its croaking cauſed.</p>
                  <p>I leaned on my gun and looked; but I had not breath enough to aſk the Curate a queſtion. I obſerved carving on the bark of ſome of the trees: it was indeed the only mark of human art about the place, except that ſome branches appeared to have been lopped, to give a view of the caſcade, which was formed by a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Juſt at that inſtant I ſaw paſs between the trees, a young lady with a book in her hand. I ſtood upon a ſtone to obſerve her; but the Curate ſat himſelf down on the graſs, and leaning his back where I ſtood, told me, "That was the daughter of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentleman of the name of WALTON, whom he had ſeen walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there more than once.</p>

                  <p>"Soon after I was made Curate, he left the pariſh, and went no body knows where; and in his room was found a bundle of papers, which was brought to me by his landlord.

                     <p>His remarks were few, and made only to his familiar friends; but they were ſuch as the world might have heard with veneration: and his honeſt heart, uncorrupted by its ways, was ever warm in the cauſe of virtue and his friends. He is now forgotten and gone! The laſt time I was at Silton Hall, I ſaw his chair ſtand in its corner by the fire-ſide; there was an additional cuſhion on it,

                     <p>Give me leave to correct the expreſſion of your metaphor, ſaid Mr. Silton: It is not always ruſt which is acquired by the inactivity of the body on which it preys; ſuch, perhaps, is the caſe with me, though in deed I was never cleared from my youth; but (taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <head>CHAP. XII. Of worldly intereſts.</head>
                     <p>THERE are certain intereſts which the world ſuppoſes every man to have, and which therefore are properly enough term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worldly; but the world is apt to make an erroneous eſtimate: ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the diſpoſitions which conſtitute our happineſs or misery, they bring to an undiſtinguiſhed ſcale the means of the one, as connected with power, wealth, or grandeur, and of the other with their contraries. Philoſophers and poets have often proteſted againſt this deciſion: but their arguments have been deſpiſed as declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or ridiculed as romantic.</p>
                     <p>There are never wanting to a young man ſome grave and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent friends to ſet him right in this particular, if he need it: to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ideas as they riſe, and point them to thoſe objects which a wiſe man ſhould never forget.</p>
                     <p>Harley did not want for ſome monitors of this fort. He was frequently told of men, whoſe fortunes enabled them to command all the luxuries of life, whoſe fortunes were of their own acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; his envy was endeavoured to be excited by a deſcription of their happineſs, and his emulation by a recital of the means which had procured it.</p>
                     <p>Harley was too apt to hear theſe lectures with indifference; nay ſometimes they got the better of his temper; and as the inſtances were not always amiable, provoked, on his part, ſome reflections, which I am perſuaded his good nature would elſe have avoided.</p>

                        </gap>, will be too often quarrelling with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of things, to reliſh that ſhare which is allotted to himſelf. I do not mean, however, to inſinuate this to have been the caſe with Harley; on the contrary, if we might rely on his own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the conceptions he had of pomp and grandeur, ſerved to endear the ſtate which Providence had aſſigned him.</p>
                     <p>He loſt his father, the laſt ſurviving of his parents, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related, when he was a boy. The good man, from a fear of offending, as well as a regard to his ſon, named him a variety of tutors; one conſequence of which was, that they ſeldom met to conſider of their pupil's affairs at all; and that when they did meet, their opinions were ſo oppoſite, that the only method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation poſſible, was the mediatory power of a dinner and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which commonly interrupted, not ended, the diſpute; and after that interruption ceaſed, left the conſulting parties in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017579_0008_0FA12F0A4EBAF730"/>
not very proper for adjuſting it. His education therefore had been but indifferently attended to; and after being taken from a country ſchool, at which he had been boarded, the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ſuffered to be his own maſter in the ſubſequent branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of literature, with ſome aſſiſtance from the parſon of the pariſh in languages and philoſophy, and from the exciſeman in arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and book-keeping. One of his tutors indeed, who, in his youth, had been an inhabitant of the Temple, ſet him to read Coke upon Littleton; a book which is very properly put into the hands of beginners in that ſcience, as its ſimplicity is accomodated to their underſtandings, and its ſize to their inclination. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited but little by the peruſal; but it was not without its uſe in the family: for his maiden aunt applied it commonly to the laudable purpoſe of preſſing her rebellious linens to the folds ſhe had allotted them.</p>
                     <p>There were particularly two means of increaſing his fortune, which might have occurred to people of leſs foreſight than thoſe counſellors we have mentioned. One of theſe was the expectation of ſucceeding to an old lady, a diſtant relation of Harley's, who was known to be poſſeſſed of a very large ſum in the ſtocks: but in this their hopes were diſappointed; for the young man was ſo untoward in his diſpoſition, that, notwithſtanding the inſtructions he daily received, his viſits rather tended to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>nate than gain the good will of his kinſwoman. He ſometimes looked grave when the old lady told the jokes of her youth; he often refuſed to eat when ſhe preſſed him, and was ſeldom or never provided with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or liquorice when ſhe was ſeized with a fit of coughing: nay, he had once the rudeneſs to fall aſleep, while ſhe was deſcribing the compoſition and virtues of her favourite cholic water. In ſhort, he accommodated himſelf ſo ill to her humour, that ſhe died, and did not leave him a farthing.</p>
                     <p>The other method pointed out to him was, an endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> get a leaſe of ſome crown lands, which lay contiguous to his little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal eſtate. This, it was imagined, might be eaſily enough procured, as the crown did not draw ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent as Harley could afford to give, with very conſiderable profit to himſelf; and the then leſſee had rendered himſelf ſo obnoxious to the miniſtry, by the diſpoſal of his vote at an election, that he could not expect a renewal. This, however, needed ſome intereſt with the great, which Harley or his father never poſſeſſed.</p>
                     <p>His neighbour, Mr. Walton, having heard of his affair, gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offered him his aſſiſtance to accompliſh it. He told him that though he had long been a ſtranger to courtiers, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, there were ſome of them who might pay regard to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation; and that, if he thought it worth the while to take a London journey upon the buſineſs, he would furniſh him with a letter of introduction to a baronet of his acquaintance, who had a great deal to ſay with the firſt lord of the treaſury.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017579_0009_0FA12F0AF868F2D0"/>
When his friends heard of this offer, they preſſed him with the utmoſt earneſtneſs to accept of it. They did not fail to enumerate the many advantages which a certain degree of ſpirit and aſſurance gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Harley, though he had no great reliſh for the attempt, yet could not reſiſt the torrent of motives that aſſaulted him; and as he needed but little preparation for his journey, a day, not very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, was fixed for his departure.</p>

                     <p>She was now arrived at that period of life which takes, or is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take, from the ſlippancy of girlhood thoſe ſprightlineſſes which ſome good natured old maids oblige the world with at three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore.

                     <p>As her father had for ſome years retired to the country, Harley had frequent opportunities of ſeeing her. He looked on her for ſome time merely with that reſpect and admiration which her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſeemed to demand, and the opinion of others conferred upon her; from his cauſe perhaps, and from that extrem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He heard her ſentiments with peculiar attention, ſometimes with looks very expreſſive of approbation; but ſeldom declared his opinion on the ſubject, much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                        </gap> compliments to the lady on the juſtneſs of her remarks.</p>
                     <p>From this very reaſon it was, that Miſs Walton frequently took more particular notice of him than of other viſitors, who, by the laws of precedency, were better entitled to it: it was a mode of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe had peculiarly ſtudied, to bring to the line of that Equality, which is ever neceſſary for the eaſe of our gueſts, thoſe whoſe ſenſibility had placed them below it.</p>
                     <p>Harley ſaw this; for though he was a child in the drama of the world, yet was it not altogether owing to a want of knowledge in his part; on the contrary, the moſt delicate conſciouſneſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety often raiſed that bluſh which marred the performance of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this raiſed his eſteem ſomething above what the moſt ſanguine deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions of her goodneſs had been able to do; for certain it is, that notwithſtanding the laboured definitions which very wiſe men have given us of the inherent beauty of virtue, we are always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think her handſomeſt when ſhe condeſcends to ſmile upon ourſelves.</p>

love: in the boſom of Harley there ſcarce needed a tranſition; for there were certain ſeaſons when his ideas were fluſhed to a degree much above their common complexion. In times not credulous of inſpiration, we ſhould account for this from ſome natural cauſe: but we do not mean to account for it at all; it were ſufficient to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe its effects; but they were ſometimes ſo ludicrous, as might derogate from the dignity of the ſenſations which produced them to deſcribe, They were treated, indeed, as ſuch by moſt of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In ſome of theſe paroxiſms of fancy, Miſs Walton did not fail to be introduced; and the picture which had been drawn amidſt the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding objects of unnoticed levity, was now ſingled out to be viewed through the medium of romantic imagination: it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of courſe, and eſteem was a word inexpreſſive of the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it excited.</p>

                     <p>He ſat down on a large ſtone to take out a little pebble from his ſhoe, when he ſaw, at ſome diſtance, a beggar approaching him. He had on a looſe ſort of coat, mended with different-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured rags, amongſt which the blue and the ruſſet were predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

                     <p>WE have related, in a former chapter, the little ſucceſs of his firſt viſit to the great man, for whom he had the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory letter from Mr. Walton.

                     <p>In ſome of their letters, therefore, which he received ſoon after, they expreſſed their ſurpriſe at his not having been more urgent in his application, and again recommended the bluſhleſs aſſiduity of ſuceſsful merit.</p>
                     <p>He reſolved to make another attempt at the baronet's; fortified with higher notions of his own dignity, and with leſs apprehenſion of a repulſe. In his way to Groſvenor-ſquare he began to ruminate on the folly of mankind, who affixed thoſe ideas of ſuperiority to riches, which reduced the minds of men, by nature equal with the more fortunate, to that ſort of ſervility which he felt in his own. By the time he had reached the Square, and was walking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ong the pavement which led to the baronet's, he had brought his reaſoning on the ſubject to ſuch a point, that the concluſion, by every rule of logic, ſhould have led him to a thorough indifference in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to a fellow-mortal, whether that fellow-mortal was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſix or ſix thouſand pounds a year.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, however, that the premiſes had been improperly formed; for it is certain, that when he approached the great man's door, he felt his heart agitated by an unuſual pulſation.</p>
                     <p>He had almoſt reached it, when he obſerved a young gentleman coming out, dreſſed in a white frock, and a red-laced waiſtcoat, with a ſmall ſwitch in his hand, which he ſeemed to manage with a particular good grace. As he paſſed him on the ſteps, the ſtranger very politely made him a bow, which Harley returned, though he could not remember ever having ſeen him before. He aſked him, in the ſame civil manner, if he was going to wait on his friend the Barone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Harley thanked him for his information; and was turning from the door, when the other obſerved, that it would be proper to leave his name, and very obligingly knocked for that purpoſe. "Here is a gentleman, Tom, who meant to have waited on your maſter."</p>
                     <p>"Your name, if your pleaſe, Sir?" "Harley.—You'll remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Tom, Harley.—The door was ſhut. "Since we are here, ſaid he, we ſhall not loſe our walk, if we add a little to it by a turn or two in Hyde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Park." He accompanied this propoſal with a ſecond bow, and Harley accepted of it by another in return:</p>
                     <p>The converſation, as they walked, was brilliant on the ſide of his companion. The playhouſe, the opera, with every occurrence in high-life, he ſeemed perfectly maſter of; and talked of ſome reigning beauties of quality, in a manner the moſt feeling in the world. Harley admired the happineſs of his vivacity; and, though it was oppoſite to the reſervedneſs of his own nature, began to be much pleaſed with its effects.</p>
                     <p>Though I am not of opinion with ſome wiſe men, that the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of objects depends on idea; yet, I am convinced, that their appearance is not a little influenced by it. The optics of ſome minds are in ſo unlucky a perſpective, as to throw a certain ſhade on every picture that is preſented to them; while thoſe of others (of which number wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Harley) like the mirrors of the ladies, have a wonderful effect in bettering their complexions. Through ſuch a medium perhaps he was looking on his preſent companion.</p>
                     <p>When they had finiſhed their walk, and were returning by the corner of the Park, they obſerved a board hung out of a window, ſignifying, "An excellent ORDINARY Saturdays and Sundays." It happened to be Saturday, and the table was covered for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. "What if we ſhould go in and dine here, if you happen not to be engaged, Sir? ſaid the young gentleman. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but we ſhall meet with ſome original or other; it is a ſort of humour I like hugely." Harley made no objection; and the ſtranger ſhewed him the way into the parlour.</p>
                     <p>He was placed, by the curteſy of his introductor, in an armed chair that ſtood at one ſide of the fire. Over againſt him was ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man of a grave conſidering aſpect, with that look of ſober prudence which indicates what is commonly called a warm man.

marked, that wet lodging was unwholeſome for man or beaſt. He looked round at the ſame time for a poker to ſtir the fire with, which, he at laſt obſerved to the company, the people of the houſe had removed, in order to ſave their coals.</p>
                     <p>This difficulty, however, he overcame, by the help of Harley's ſtick, ſaying, "that as they ſhould, no doubt, pay for their fire in ſome ſhape or other, he faw no reaſon why they ſhould not have the uſe of it while they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The door was now opened for the admiſſion of dinner."I don't know how it is with you, gentlemen, ſaid Harley's new acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but I am afraid I ſhall not be able to get down a morſel at this horrid mechanical hour of dining." He ſat down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, and did not ſhew any want of appetite by his eating. He took on him the carving of the meat, and criticiſing on the goodneſs of the pudding.</p>
                     <p>When the table-cloth was removed, he propoſed calling for ſome punch, which was readily agreed to; he ſeemed at firſt inclined to make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When the punch was brought, he undertook to fill the glaſſes and call the toaſts.—"The king."—That toaſt naturally produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed politics.

The man who ſat oppoſite to Harley (who by this time, partly from himſelf and partly from his acquaintance on this left hand, was diſcovered to be a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier) obſerved, "That it was a ſhame for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Both ſeemed to be ſilenced, however, by this intelligence, and, while the remainder of the punch laſted, the converſation was wholly engroſſed by the gentleman with the fine waiſtcoat, who told a great many "immenſe comical ſtories," and "con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At laſt, the grazier, pulling out a watch, of a very unuſual ſize, and telling the hour, ſaid, that he had an appointment.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"Is it ſo late? ſaid the young gentleman; then I am afraid I have miſſed an appointment already: but the truth is, I am curſedly given to miſſing of appointments."</p>
                     <p>When the grazier and he were gone, Harley turned to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining man of the company, and aſked him, if he knew that young gentleman? "A gentleman! ſaid he; ay, he is one of your gentlemen at the top of an affidavit. I knew him, ſome years ago, in the quality of a foot-man; and, I believe, he had ſometimes the honour to be a pimp. At laſt, ſome of the great folks, to whom he had been ſerviceable in both capacities, had him made a gauger; in which ſtation he ſtill remains, and has the aſſurance to pretend an acquaintance with men of quality. The impudent dog! with a few ſhillings in his pocket, he will talk you three times as much as my friend Mundy there, who is worth nine thouſand, if he's worth a farthing. But I know the raſcal, and deſpiſe him, as he deſerves."</p>
                     <p>Harley began to deſpiſe him too, and to conceive ſome indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at having ſat with patience to hear ſuch a fellow ſpeak nonſenſe.

Their conductor led them firſt to the diſmal manſions of thoſe who are in the moſt horrid ſtate of incurable madneſs. The clank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of chains, the wildneſs of their cries, and the imprecations which ſome of them uttered, formed a ſcene inexpreſſibly ſhocking.

                     <p>Harley had fallen behind his companions, looking at a man, who was making pendulums with bits of thread, and little balls of clay. He had delineated a ſegment of a circle on the wall with chalk, and marked their different vibrations, by interſecting it with croſs lines.</p>
                     <p>A decent-looking man came up, and ſmiling at the maniac, turned to Harley, and told him, that gentleman had once been a very celebrated mathematician. "He fell a ſacrifice, ſaid he, to the theory of comets; for, after having, with infinite labour, formed a table on the conjectures of Sir Iſaac Newton, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in the return of one of thoſe luminaries, and was very ſoon after obliged to be placed here by his friends.

                     <p>The next perſon they came up to had ſcrawled a variety of fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures on a piece of ſlate. Harley had the curioſity to take a nearer view of them. They conſiſted of different columns, a-top of which were marked South Sea annuities, India ſtock, and Three per cent. annuities conſol. "This, ſaid Harley's inſtructor, was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well known in Change-Alley.</p>

                     <p>Harley was a good deal ſtruck by this diſcovery; he had pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, however, to conceal his amazement, and bowing as low to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Separate from the reſt ſtood one, whoſe appearance had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſuperior dignity. Her face, though pale and waſted, was leſs ſqualid than thoſe of the others, and ſhewed a dejection of that decent kind, which moves our pity unmixed with horror: upon her, therefore, the eyes of all were immediately turned. The keeper, who accompanied them, obſerved it: "This, ſaid he, is a young lady, who was born to ride in her coach and ſix, She was beloved, if the ſtory I have heard is true, by a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, her equal in birth, but by no means her match as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: but Love, they ſay, is blind, and ſo ſhe fancied him as much as he did her.</p>
                     <p>Her father, it ſeems, would not hear of their marriage, and threatened to turn her out of doors, if ever ſhe ſaw him again. Upon this the young gentleman took a voyage to the Weſt-Indies, in hopes of bettering his fortune, and obtaining his miſtreſs; but he was ſcarcely landed, when he was ſeized with one of the fevers which are common in thoſe iſlands, and died in a few days, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by every one that knew him.

                     <p>Though this ſtory was told in very plain language, it had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attracted Harley's notice: he had given it the tribute of ſome tears.</p>

                     <p>THE friend, who had conducted him to Moorfields, called on him again the next evening. After ſome talk on the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the preceding day; "I carried you yeſterday, ſaid he to Harley, to viſit the mad; let me introduce you to-night, at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to one of the wiſe: but you muſt not look for any thing of the Socratic pleaſantry about him; on the contrary, I warn you, to expect the ſpirit of a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ogenes. That you may be ſomewhat prepared for his extraordinary manner, I will let you into ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>"He is the eldeſt of two ſons of a gentleman of conſiderable eſtate in the country. Their father died when they were young: both were remarkable at ſchool for quickneſs of parts, and extent of genius; this one had been bred to no profeſſion, becauſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fortune, which deſcended to him, was thought ſufficient to ſet him above it; the other was put an apprentice to an eminent attorney.</p>
                     <p>"In this the expectations of his friends were more conſulted than his own inclination; for both his brother and he had feelings of that warm ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, that could ill brook a ſtudy ſo dry as the law, eſpecially in that department of it which was allotted to him. But the difference of their tempers made the characteriſtical diſtinction between them.</p>
                     <p>"The younger, from the gentleneſs of his nature, bore with patience a ſituation entirely diſcordant to his genius and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At times, indeed, his pride would ſuggeſt, of how little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance thoſe talents were, which the partiality of his friends had often extolled: they were now incumbrances in a walk of life where the dull and the ignorant paſſed him at every turn; his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and his feeling, were invincible obſtacles to eminence in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, where his fancy had no room for exertion, and his feeling experienced perpetual diſguſt.</p>
                     <p>"But theſe murmurings he never ſuffered to be heard; and that he might not offend the prudence of thoſe who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the choice of his profeſſion, he continued to labour in it for ſeveral years, till, by the death of a relation, he fell into an eſtate of little better than 100<hi>l,</hi> a year, with which, and the ſmall patrimony left him by his father, he retired into the country, and made a love-match with a young lady of a temper ſimilar to his own.</p>
                     <p>"But his elder brother, whom you are to ſee at ſupper, if you will do us the favour of your company, was naturally impetuous, deciſive, and overbearing. He entered into life with thoſe ardent expectations which young men are commonly deluded by: in his friendſhips, warm to exceſs; and equally violent in his diſlikes.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017579_0022_0FA12F162C0D4860"/>
He was on the brink of marriage with a young lady, when one of thoſe friends, for whoſe honour he would have pawned his life, made an elopement with this very goddeſs; and left him beſides deeply engaged for ſums which his extravagance had ſquandered.</p>
                     <p>"The dreams he had formerly enjoyed were now changed for ideas of a very different nature. He abjured all confidence in any thing of human form; ſold his lands in the country, which ſtill produced him a very large reverſion, came to town, and immured himſelf with a woman who had been his nurſe, in little better than a garret; and has ever ſince applied his talents to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vilifying of his ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>"One thing I muſt take the liberty to inſtruct you in; however different your ſentiments may be (and different they muſt be) you will ſuffer him to go on without contradiction; otherwiſe he will be ſilent immediately, and we ſhall not be able to get a word from him all the night after."</p>
                     <p>Harley promiſed to remember this injunction, and accepted the invitation of his friend.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the houſe, they were informed that the gentleman was already come, and had been ſhewn into the parlour. They found him ſitting with a daughter of his friend's, about three years old, on his knee, whom he was teaching the alphabet from a horn-book: at a little diſtance ſtood a ſiſter of hers, ſome years older.</p>
                     <p>"Get you away, Miſs, ſaid he to this laſt, you are a pert goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſip, and I will have nothing to do with you." "Nay, anſwered ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nancy is your favourite; you are quit in love with Nancy." "Take away that girl, ſaid he to her father, whom he now obſerved to have entered the room, ſhe has woman about her already." The children were accordingly diſmiſſed.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt that and ſupper-time he did not utter a ſyllable. When ſupper came, he quarrelled with every diſh at table, but eat of them all; only exempting from his cenſures a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>allad, which you have not ſpoiled, ſaid he, becauſe you have not attempted to cook it.</p>
                     <p>When the wine was ſet upon the table he took from his pocket a particular ſmoking apparatus, and filled up his pipe, without taking any more notice of Harley, or his friend, than if no ſuch people had been in the room.</p>
                     <p>Harley could not help ſtealing a look of ſurprize at him; but his friend, who knew his humour, returned it, by annihilating his preſence in the like manner, and, leaving him to his own medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, addreſſed himſelf entirely to Harley.</p>
                     <p>In their diſcourſe ſome mention happened to be made of an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character, and the words <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>politeneſs</hi> were applied to it. Upon this the gentleman, laying down his pipe, and changing the tone of his countenance, from an ironical grin to ſomething more intently contemptuous: "Honour, ſaid he, Honour and Politeneſs! this is the coin of the world, and paſſes current with the fools of it.</p>

He was ſilenced by the thought.—</p>
                     <p>The philoſopher turned his eye upon him: he examined him from top to toe, with a ſort triumphant contempt. Harley's coat happened to be a new one; the other's was as ſhabby as could poſſibly be ſuppoſed to be on the back of a gentleman: there was much ſignificancy in his look with regard to this coat: it ſpoke of the ſleekneſs of folly, and the thread bareneſs of wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>"Truth, continued he, the moſt amiable, as well as the moſt natural of virtues, you are at pains to eradicate. Your very nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries are ſeminaries of falſehood; and what is called Faſhion in manhood completes the ſyſtem of avowed inſincerity. Mankind, in the groſs, is a gaping monſter, that loves to be deceived, and has ſeldom been diſappointed: nor is their vanity leſs fallacious to your philoſophers, who adopt modes of truth to follow them through the paths of error, and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe are they whom ye term Ingenious; it is a phraſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation I deteſt; it implies an attempt to impoſe on my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by flattering my imagination: yet theſe are they whoſe works are read by the old with delight, which the young are taught to look on as the codes of knowledge and philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, the education of your youth is every way prepoſterous: you waſte at ſchool years in improving talents, without having ever ſpent an hour in diſcovering them; one promiſcuous line of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is followed, without regard to genius, capacity, or probable ſituation in the commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>From this <hi>menagerie</hi> of the pedagogue, a raw unprincipled boy is turned looſe upon the world to travel; without any ideas but thoſe of improving his dreſs at Paris, or ſtarting into taſte by gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome paintings at Rome.</p>

                     <p>THE company at the baronet's removed to the playhouſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and Harley took his uſual route into the Park. He obſerved, as he entered, a freſh looking elderly gentleman in converſation with a beggar, who, leaning on his cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This was a very intereſting <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> to Harley; he was rude enough therefore to ſlacken his pace as he approached, and at laſt to make a full ſtop at the gentleman's back, who was juſt then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his compaſſion for the beggar, and regretting that he had

not a farthing of change about him. At ſaying this he looked piteouſly on the fellow: there was ſomething in his phyſiognomy which catched Harley's notice: indeed phyſiognomy was one of Harley's foibles, for which he had been often rebuked by his aunt in the country; who uſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But he was too apt to forget this caution; and now, it ſeems, it had not occured to him: ſtepping up, therefore, to the gentleman, who was lamenting the want of ſilver, "Your inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ing. The other returned a ſuitable compliment, and extolled the benevolence of Harley. They kept walking together, and benevolence grew the topic of diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger was fluent on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>"There is no uſe of money, ſaid he, equal to that of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: with the profuſe, it is loſt; and even with thoſe who lay it out according to the prudence of the world, the objects acquired by it pall on the ſenſe, and have ſcarce become our own till they loſe their value with the power of pleaſing; but here the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grows on reflection, and our money is moſt truly ours, when it ceaſes being in our poſſeſſion."</p>
                     <p>"Yet I agree in ſome meaſure, anſwered Harley, with thoſe who think, that charity to our common beggars is often miſplaced: there are objects leſs obtruſive whoſe title is a better one."</p>
                     <p>"We cannot eaſily diſtinguiſh, ſaid the ſtranger; and even of the worthleſs, are there not many whoſe impudence, or whoſe vice, may have been one dreadful conſequence of misfortune?"</p>
                     <p>Harley looked again in his face, and bleſſed himſelf for his ſkill in phyſiognomy.</p>
                     <p>By this time they had reached the end of the walk: the old gentleman leaned on the rails to take breath, and in the mean time they were joined by a younger man, whoſe figure was much above the appearence of his dreſs, which was poor and ſhabby: Harley's former companion addreſſed him as an acquaintance, and they turned on the walk together.</p>
                     <p>The oldeſt of the ſtrangers complained of the cloſeneſs of the evening, and aſked the other, if he would go with him into a houſe hard by, and take one draught of excellent cider. "The man who keeps this houſe, ſaid he to Harley, was once a ſervant of mine: I could not think of turning looſe upon the world a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful old fellow, for no other reaſon but that his age had incapacitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; ſo I give him an annuity of ten pounds, with the help of which he has ſet up this little place here, and his daughter goes and ſells milk in the city, while her father manages his tap-room, as he calls it, at home. I can't well aſk a gentleman of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to accompany me to ſo paltry a place."—"Sir, replied
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017579_0027_0FA12F19ECA609D8"/>
Harley, interrupting him, I would much rather enter it than the moſt celebrated tavern in town: to give to the neceſſitous, may ſometimes be a weakneſs in the man; to encourage induſtry, is a duty in the citizen." They entered the houſe accordingly.</p>
                     <p>On a table, at the corner of the room, lay a pack of cards, looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown together. The old gentleman reproved the man of the houſe for encouraging ſo idle an amuſement: Harley attempted to defend him from the neceſſity of accommodating himſelf to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his gueſts, and taking up the cards, began to ſhuffle them backwards and forwards in his hand. "Nay, I don't think cards ſo unpardonable an amuſement as ſome do, replied the other; and ſometimes, about this time of the evening, when my eyes begin to fail me for my book, I divert myſelf with a game at piquet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding my morals a bit relaxed by it. Do you play piquet, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o Harley) Harley anſwered in the affirmative; and the other propoſed playing a pool at a ſhilling the game, doubling the ſtakes: adding, that he never played higher with any body.</p>
                     <p>Harley's good nature could not refuſe this to the benevolent old man; and the younger ſtranger, though he at firſt pleaded a prior engagement, yet being earneſtly ſolicited by his friend, at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When they began to play, the old gentleman, ſomewhat to the ſurpriſe of Harley, produced ten ſhillings to ſerve for markers of his ſcore. "He had no change for the beggar, ſaid Harley to himſelf; but I can eaſily account for it: it is curious to obſerve the affection that inanimate things will acquire from us by a long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: if I may judge from my own feelings, the old man would not part with one of theſe counters for ten times its intrinſic value; it even got the better of his benevolence! I myſelf have a pair of old braſs ſleeve-buttons—Here he was interrupted by being told, that the old gentleman had beat the younger, and that it was his turn to take up the conqueror.</p>
                     <p>"Your game has been ſhort," ſaid Harley. "I repiqued him," anſwered the old man, with joy ſparkling in his countenance."</p>
                     <p>Harley wiſhed to be repiqued too, but he was diſappointed; for he had the ſame good fortune againſt his opponent. Indeed never did fortune, mutable as ſhe is, delight in mutability ſo much as at that moment: the victory was ſo quick, and ſo conſtantly alternate, that the ſtake, in a ſhort time, amounted to no leſs a ſum than 12 <hi>

                     <p>Now, however, he told them, that he had an appointment with ſome gentlemen, and it was within a few minutes of his hour. The young ſtranger had gained one game, and was engaged in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond with the other: they agreed therefore that the ſtake ſhould be divided, if the old gentleman won that; which was more than probable, as his ſcore was 90 to 35, and he was eldeſt hand; but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017579_0028_0FA12F1AADC5DD70"/>
a momentous repique decided it in favour of his adverſary, who ſeemed to enjoy his victory mingled with regret, for having won too much, while his friend, with great ebullience of paſſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praiſes of his own good play, and many maledictions on the power of chance, took up the cards, and threw them into the fire.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVII. His ſkill in phyſiognomy is doubted.</head>
                     <p>AFTER he had been ſome time amongſt the company with whom he had appointed to meet, and the laſt bottle was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, he firſt recollected that he ſhould be again at a loſs how to diſcharge his ſhare of the reckoning. He applied therefore to one of them, with whom he was moſt intimate, acknowledging that he had not a farthing of money about him; and upon being jocularly aſked the reaſon, acquainted them with the two adventures we have juſt now related. One of the company aſked him, If the old man in Hyde-Park did not wear a browniſh coat, with a narrow gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edging, and his companion an old green frock, with a buff colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waiſtcoat.</p>

                     <p>Harley anſwered, "That he could not but fancy the gentleman was miſtaken, as he never ſaw a face promiſe more honeſty than the old man's he had met with."—"His face!" ſaid a grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking man, who ſat oppoſite to him, ſquirting the juice of his tob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>"Gentlemen ſaid Harley, you are diſpoſed to be merry; it may be as you imagine, for I confeſs myſelf ignorant of the town: but there is one thing which makes me bear the loſs of my money with temper; the young fellow who won it was certainly miſerably poor; I obſerved him borrow money for the ſtake from his friend; he had diſtreſs and hunger in his countenance: be his character what it may, his neceſſities at leaſt may plead for him.—At this there was a louder laugh than before.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, ſaid the lawyer, one of whoſe converſations with Harley we have already recorded, here's a very pretty fellow for you: to have heard him talk ſome nights ago, as I did, you might have ſworn he was a ſaint; yet now he games with ſharpers, and loſes his money; and is bubbled by a fine ſtory invented by a whore, and pawns his watch; here are ſanctified doings with a witneſs!"</p>
                     <p>"Young gentleman, ſaid his friend on the other ſide of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let me adviſe you to be a little more cautious for the future; and as for faces—you may look into them to know, whether a man's noſe be a long or a ſhort one."</p>

                     <p>THE laſt night's raillery of his companions was recalled to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> remembrance when he awoke, and the colder homilies of prudence began to ſuggeſt ſome things which were nowiſe favourable for a performance of his promiſe to the unfortunate female he had met with before. He roſe uncertain of his purpoſe; but the torpor of ſuch conſiderations was ſeldom prevalent over the warmth of his nature. He walked ſome turns backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in his room; he recalled the languid form of the fainting wretch to his mind; he wept at the recollection of her tears.</p>
                     <p>"Though I am the vileſt of beings, I have not forgotten every virtue; gratitude, I hope, I ſhall ſtill have left."—</p>
                     <p>"He took a larger ſtride—"Powers of mercy that ſurround me! cry'd he, do ye not ſmile upon deeds like theſe? to calculate the chances of deception is too tedious a buſineſs for the life of man!"—The clock ſtruck ten!—When he was got down ſtairs, he found that he had forgot the note of her lodgings; he gnawed his lips at the delay: he was fairly on the pavement, when he recollected having left his purſe; he did but juſt prevent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from articulating an imprecation. He ruſhed a ſecond time up into his chamber. "What a wretch I am, ſaid he; ere this time perhaps—"It was a perhaps not to be borne:—two vibrations of a pendulum would have ſerved him to lock his bureau;—but they could not be ſpared.</p>
                     <p>When he reached the houſe, and inquired for Miſs Atkins, for that was the lady's name, he was ſhewn up three pair of ſtairs into a ſmall room lighted by one narrow lattice, and patched round with ſhreds of different coloured paper. In the darkeſt corner ſtood ſomething like a bed, before which a tattered coverlet hung by way of curtain. He had not waited long when ſhe appeared. Her face had the gliſter of new-waſhed tears on it.</p>
                     <p>"I am aſhamed, Sir, ſaid ſhe, that you ſhould have taken this freſh piece of trouble about one ſo little worthy of it; but, to the humane, I know there is a pleaſure in goodneſs for its own ſake: if you have patience for the recital of my ſtory, it may palliate, though it cannot excuſe, my faults." Harley bowed, as a ſign of aſſent; and ſhe began as follows:</p>
                     <p>"I am the daughter of an officer, whom a ſervice of forty years had advanced no higher than to the rank of captain. I have had hints from himſelf, and been informed by others, that it was in ſome meaſure owing to thoſe principles of rigid honour, which it was his boaſt to poſſeſs, and which he early inculcated on me, that he had been able to arrive at no better ſtation, My mother died when I was a child; old enough to grieve for her death, but inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of remembering her precepts of advice.</p>
                     <p>Though my father was doatingly fond of her, yet there were ſome ſentiments in which they materially differed: She had been

bred from her infancy in the ſtricteſt principles of religion, and took the morality of her conduct from the motives which an ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to theſe principles ſuggeſted. My father, who had been in the army from his youth, affixed an idea of puſillanimity to that virtue, which was formed by the doctrines excited by the rewards, or guarded by the terrors of revelation; his darling idol was the honour of a ſoldier; a term which he held in ſuch revere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ce, that he commonly uſed it for his moſt ſacred aſſeveration.</p>
                     <p>When my mother died, I was for ſome time ſuffered to continue in thoſe ſentiments which her inſtructions had produced; but ſoon after, though from reſpect to her memory, my father did not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ridicule them, yet he ſhewed, in his diſcourſe to others, ſo little regard to them, and, at times, ſuggeſted to me motives of action ſo different, that I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>on weaned from opinions, which I began to look on as the dreams of ſuperſtition, or the artful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of deſigning hypocriſy.</p>
                     <p>My mother's books were left behind at the different quarters we removed to, and my reading was principally confined to plays, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and thoſe poetical deſcriptions of the beauty of virtue and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which the circulating libraries eaſily afforded.</p>
                     <p>"As I was generally reckoned handſome, and the quickneſs of my parts extolled by all our viſitors, my father had a pride in ſhewing me to the world. I was young, giddy, open to adulation, and vain of thoſe talents which acquired it.</p>
                     <p>"After the laſt war, my father was reduced to half-pay; with which we retired to a village in the country, which the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome genteel families who reſided in it, and the cheapneſs of living, particularly recommended. My father rented a ſmall houſe, with a piece of ground ſufficient to keep a horſe for him, and a cow for the benefit of his family.</p>
                     <p>"An old man ſervant managed his ground; while a maid, who had formerly been my mother's, and had ſince been mine, undertook the care of our little dairy: they were aſſiſted in each of their provinces by my father and me, and we paſſed our time in a ſtate of tranquillity, which he had always talked of with delight, and my train of reading had taught me to admire.</p>
                     <p>"Though I had never ſeen the polite circles of the metropolis, the company my father had introduced me into had given me a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of good-breeding, which ſoon diſcovered a ſuperiority over the young ladies of our village. I was quoted as an example of politeneſs, and my company courted by moſt of the conſiderable families in the neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>"Amongſt the houſes where I was frequently invited, was Sir George Winbrook's. He had two daughters nearly of my age, with whom, though they had been bred up in thoſe maxims of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar doctrine, which my ſuperior underſtanding could not but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe, yet as their good nature led them to an imitation of my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in every thing elſe, I cultivated a particular friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:017579_0033_0FA12F1FED6FFD10"/>
"Some months after our firſt acquaintance, Sir George's eldeſt ſon came home from his travels. His figure, his addreſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, were not unlike thoſe warm ideas of an accompliſhed man which my favourite novels had taught me to form; and his ſentiments, on the article of religion, were as liberal as my own: when any of theſe happened to be the topic of our diſcourſe, I, who before had been ſilent, from a fear of being ſingle in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now kindled at the fire he raiſed, and defended our mutual opinions with all the eloquence I was miſtreſs of.</p>
                     <p>"He was commonly reſpectfully attentive all the while; and when I had ended, would raiſe his eyes from the ground, look at me with a gaze of admiration, and expreſs his applauſe in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrain of encomium. This was an incenſe the more pleaſing, as I ſeldom or never had met with it before; for the young gentlemen who viſited Sir George were for the moſt part of that athletic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the pleaſure of whoſe lives is derived from fox-hunting: theſe are ſeldom ſolicitous to pleaſe the women at all; or if they were, would never think of applying their flattery to the mind.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Winbrooke obſerved the weakneſs of my ſoul, and took every occaſion of improving the eſteem he had gained. He aſked my opinion of every author, of every ſentiment, with that ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diffidence, which ſhewed an unlimited confidence, in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. I ſaw myſelf reverend, as a ſuperior ſort of being, by one whoſe judgment my vanity told me was not likely to err; preferred by him to all the other viſitors of my ſex, whoſe ſuperior fortunes and rank ſhould have entitled them to a much higher degree of notice, I ſaw their little jealouſies at the diſtinguiſhed attention he paid me; it was gratitude, it was pride, it was love! Love which had made too fatal a progreſs in my heart, before any declaration on his part ſhould have warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a return: but I interpreted every look of attention, every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of compliment, to the paſſion I imagined him inſpired with, and imputed to his ſenſibility that ſilence which was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of art and deſign.</p>
                     <p>"At length, however, he took an opportunity of declaring his love: he now expreſſed himſelf in ſuch ardent terms, that prudence might have ſuſpected their ſincerity; but prudence is rarely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the ſituation I had been unguardedly led into; beſides, that the courſe of reading to which I had been accuſtomed, did not lead me to conclude, that his expreſſions could be too warm to be ſincere: nor was I even alarmed at the manner in which he talked of marriage, a ſubjection, he often hinted, to which genuine love ſhould ſcorn to be confined.</p>
                     <p>"The woman, he would often ſay, who had me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it like mine to fix his affection, could eaſily command it for ever. That honour too which I revered, was often called in to enforce his ſentiments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did not, however, abſolutely aſſent to them; but I found my regard for the oppoſite ones diminiſh by degrees. If it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017579_0034_0FA12F20B25EE9A8"/>
to be convinced, it is ever dangerous to liſten; for our reaſon is ſo much of a machine, that it will not always be able to reſiſt, when the ear is perpetually aſſailed.</p>
                     <p>"In ſhort, Mr. Harley, (for I tire you with a relation, the cataſtrophe of which you will already have imagined) I fell a prey to his artifices. He had not been able ſo thoroughly to convert me, that my conſcience was ſilent on the ſubject; but he was ſo aſſiduous to ſhew repeated proofs of unabated affection, that I huſhed its ſuggeſtions as they roſe.</p>
                     <p>"The world, however, I knew, was not to be ſilenced; and therefore I took ſome occaſion to expreſs my uneaſineſs to my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, and intreat him, as he valued the peace of one to whom he profeſſed ſuch an attachment, to remove it by a marriage. He made an excuſe from the dependance he was under on the will of his father, but quieted my fears by the promiſe of endeavouring to win his aſſent.</p>
                     <p>"My father had been ſome days abſent on a journey to ſee a relation, who was thought to be dying, from whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable expectations. I was left at home, with no other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny than my books: my books I found were not now ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as they uſed to be; I was reſtleſs, melancholy, unſatisfied with myſelf. But judge my ſituation when I received a billet from Mr. Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I read this letter a hundred times over. Alone, helpleſs, conſcious of guilt, and abandoned by every better thought, my mind was one dreadful ſcene of terror, confuſion, and remorſe. A thouſand expedients ſuggeſted themſelves, and a thouſand fears told me they would be vain: at laſt, in an agony of deſpair, I packed up a few clothes, took what money and trinkets were in the houſe, and ſet out for London, where I underſtood he was gone, pretending to my maid, that I had received letters from my father requiring my immediate attendance. I had no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion than a boy, a ſervant to the man from whom I hired my horſes. I arrived in London within an hour of of Mr. Winbrooke, and accidentally alighted at the very inn where he was.</p>
                     <p>"He ſtarted and turned pale when he ſaw me; but recovered himſelf in time enough to make many new proteſtations of regard, and beg me to make myſelf eaſy under a diſappointment which was equally afflicting to him. He procured me lodgings, where I ſlept, or rather endeavoured to ſleep, for that night.

"It was ſituated in a dirty lane, furniſhed with a taudry affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of finery, with ſome old family pictures hanging on walls which their own cobwebs would have better ſuited. I was ſtruck with a ſecret dread at entering; nor was it leſſened by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the landlady, who had that look of ſelfiſh ſhrewdneſs, which, of all others, is the moſt hateful to thoſe whoſe feelings are untinctured with the world. A girl, who ſhe told us was her niece, ſat beſide her, playing on a guitar, and ſhe herſelf was ſewing, with the aſſiſtance of ſpectacles, and had a prayer book, with the leaves folded down in ſeveral places, lying on the table before her. Perhaps, Sir, I tire you with my minuteneſs; but the place, and every circumſtance about it, is ſo impreſſed on my mind, that I ſhall never forget it.</p>
                     <p>"I dined that day with Mr. Winbrooke alone. He loſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that reſtraint which I perceived too well to hang about him before, and, with his former gaiety and good-humour, repeated the flattering things, which though they had once been fatal, I durſt not now diſtruſt. At laſt, taking my hand and kiſſing it,</p>
                     <p>"It is thus, ſaid he, that love will laſt, while freedom is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; thus let us ever be bleſt, without the galling thought that we are tied to a condition where we may ceaſe to be ſo." I anſwered,</p>
                     <p>"That the world thought otherwiſe; that it had certain ideas of good fame, which it was impoſſible not to wiſh to maintain."</p>
                     <p>"The world, ſaid he, is a tyrant; they are ſlaves who obey it: let us be happy without the pale of the world. To-morrow I ſhall leave this quarter of it, for one, where the talkers of the world ſhall be foiled, and loſe us. Could not my Emily accompany me? my friend, my companion, the miſtreſs of my ſoul! Nay, do not look ſo, Emily! your father may grieve for a while, but your father ſhall be taken care of; this bank-bill I intend as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for his daughter."</p>
                     <p>"I could contain myſelf no longer: Wretch, I exclaimed, doſt thou imagine that my father's heart could brook dependance on the deſtoryer of his child, and tamely accept of a baſe equivalent for her honour and his own!" "Honour, my Emily, ſaid he, is the word of fools, or of thoſe wiſer men who cheat them. It is a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic bauble that does not ſuit the gravity of your father's age; but, whatever it is, I am afraid it can never be perfectly reſtored to you: exchange the word then, and let pleaſure be your object now." At theſe words he claſped me in his arms, and preſſed his lips rudely to my boſom. I ſtarted from my ſeat, "Perfidious villain! ſaid I, who dareſt inſult the weakneſs thou haſt undone; were that father here, thy coward ſoul would ſhrink from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of his honour! Curſt be that wretch who has deprived him of it! oh! doubly curſt, who has dragged on his hoary head the infamy which ſhould have cruſhed her own!"

You have been put to ſome fooliſh expence in this journey on my account; allow me to reimburſe you." So ſaying, he laid a bank-bill, of what amount I had no patience to ſee, upon the table. Shame, grief, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, choaked my utterance; unable to ſpeak my wrongs, and unable to bear them in ſilence, I fell in a ſwoon at his feet.</p>
                     <p>"What happened in the interval I cannot tell; but when I came to myſelf, I was in the arms of the landlady, with her niece chaffing, my temples, and doing all in her power for my recovery. She had much compaſſion in her countenance: the old woman aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the ſofteſt look ſhe was capable of, and both endeavoured to bring me comfort. They continued to ſhew me many civilities, and even the aunt began to ſeem agreeable in my ſight.

                     <p>"Mean time my money was faſt ſpent, nor did I attempt to conceal my wants from their knowledge. I had frequent thoughts of returning to my father: but the dread of a life of ſcorn is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable. I avoided therefore going abroad when I had a chance of being ſeen by any former acquaintance, nor indeed did my health for a great while permit it; and ſuffered the old woman, at her own ſuggeſtion, to call me niece at home, where we now and then ſaw (when they could prevail on me to leave my room) one or two other elderly women, and ſometimes a grave buſineſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like man, who ſhewed great compaſſion for my indiſpoſition, and made me very obligingly an offer of a room at his country-houſe for the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This offer I did not chooſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; but told my landlady, "that I ſhould be glad to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any way of buſineſs which my ſkill in needle-work could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to; confeſſing, at the ſame time, that I was afraid I ſhould ſcarce be able to pay her what I already owed for board and lodging, and that for her other good offices, I had nothing but thanks to give her."</p>
                     <p>"My dear child, ſaid ſhe, do not talk of paying; ſince I loſt my own ſweet girl, (here ſhe wept) your very picture ſhe was, Miſs Emily, I have no body, except my niece, to whom I ſhould leave any little thing I have been able to ſave: you ſhall live with me, my dear, and I have ſometimes a little millinery work, which, when you are inclined to it, you may aſſiſt us in.

                     <p>"It was a pity you refuſed his offer of a room at his country-houſe; my niece, you know, was to have accompanied you, and you might have fancied yourſelf at home: a moſt ſweet place it is, and but a ſhort mile beyond Hampſtead. Who knows Miſs Emily,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017579_0037_0FA12F22EDCBE468"/>
what effects ſuch a viſit might have had: if I had half your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſhould not waſte it pining after e'er a worthleſs fellow of them all."</p>
                     <p>I felt my heart ſwell at her words; I would have been angry if I could; but I was in that ſtupid ſtate which is not eaſily awakened to anger: when I would have chid her, the reproof ſtuck in my throat; I could only weep!</p>
                     <p>"Her want of reſpect increaſed, as I had not ſpirit to aſſert it; my work was now rather impoſed than offered, and I became a drudge for the bread I eat: but my dependance and ſervility grew in proportion, and I was now in a ſituation which could not make any extraordinary exertions to diſengage itſelf from either; I found myſelf with child.</p>
                     <p>"At laſt the wretch, who had thus trained me to deſtruction, hinted the purpoſe for which theſe means had been followed. I diſcovered her to be an artful procureſs for the pleaſures of thoſe, who are men of decency to the world in the midſt of debauchery. I rouſed every ſpark of courage within me at the horrid propoſal. She treated my paſſion at firſt ſomewhat mildly; but when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to exert it, ſhe reſented it with inſult, and told me plainly, That if I did not ſoon comply with her deſires, I ſhould pay her every farthing I owed, or rot in a gaol for life.</p>
                     <p>"I trembled at the thought; ſtill, however, I re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I was conveyed to priſon, weak from my condition, weaker from that ſtruggle of grief and miſery which for ſome time I had ſuffered. A miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was the conſequence.</p>
                     <p>"Amidſt all the horrors of ſuch a ſtate, ſurrounded with wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es callous to feeling, loſt alike to humanity and to ſhame, think, Mr. Harley, think, what I endured: nor wonder that I at laſt yielded to the ſolicitations of that miſcreant I had ſeen at her houſe, and ſunk to the proſtitution which he offered. But that was happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs compared to what I have ſuffered ſince. He ſoon abandoned me to the common uſe of the town, and I was caſt among thoſe miſerable beings in whoſe ſociety I have ſince remained.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! did the daughters of virtue know our ſufferings! did they ſee our hearts torn with anguiſh amidſt the affectation of gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which our faces are obliged to aſſume! our bodies tortured by diſeaſe, our minds with that conſciouſneſs which they cannot loſe! Did they know, did they think of this, Mr. Harley!—their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are juſt; but their pity perhaps might ſpare the wretches whom their juſtice ſhould condemn.</p>
                     <p>"Laſt night, but for an exertion of benevolence which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our infamy prevents even in the humane, had I been thruſt out from this miſerable place which misfortune has yet left me; expoſed to the brutal inſults of drunkenneſs, or dragged by that juſtice which I could not bribe, to the puniſhment which may correct, but, alas! can never amend the abandoned objects of its terrors. From that, Mr. Harley, your goodneſs has relieved me."</p>

                     <p>She had ſcarce uttered the word, when the door burſt open, and a man entered in the garb of an officer. When he diſcovered his daughter and Harley, he ſtarted back a few paces; his look aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a furious wildneſs! he laid his hand on his ſword. The two objects of his wrath did not utter a ſyllable.</p>

                     <p>Harley had by this time ſome power of utterance. "Sir, ſaid he, if you will be a moment calm"—"Infamous coward! interrupted the other, doſt thou preach calmneſs to wrongs like mine?" He drew his ſword.</p>
                     <p>"Sir, ſaid Harley, let me tell you"—The blood ran quicker to his cheek—his pulſe beat one—no more—and regained the temperament of humanity!—</p>
                     <p>"You are deceived, Sir, ſaid he, you are much deceived; but I forgive ſuſpicions which your misfortunes have juſtified: I would not wrong you, upon my ſoul I would not, for the deareſt grati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication of a thouſand worlds; my heart bleeds for you!"</p>

"Calmly, my dear Sir, ſaid Harley, did you know by what complicated misfortunes ſhe has fallen to that miſerable ſtate in which you now behold her, I ſhould have no need of words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your compaſſion. Think, Sir, of what once ſhe was! Would you abandon her to the inſults of an unfeeling world, deny her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for penitence, and cut off the little comfort that ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for your afflictions and her own!"</p>

                        </gap>"—The deſperation that ſupported her was loſt; ſhe fell to the ground, and bathed his feet with her tears!</p>
                     <p>Harley undertook her cauſe: he related the treacheries to which ſhe had fallen a ſacrifice, and again ſolicited the forgiveneſs of her father. He looked on her for ſome time in ſilence; the pride of a ſoldier's honour checked for a while the yearnings of his heart: but nature at laſt prevailed, he fell on her neck, and mingled his tears with hers. Harley, who diſcovered from the dreſs of the ſtranger that he was juſt arrived from a journey, begged that they would both remove to his lodgings, till he could procure others for them. Atkins looked at him with ſome marks of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. His daughter now firſt recovered the power of ſpeech:</p>

                        </gap>."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, young gentleman, ſaid Atkins, I fear my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wronged you."</p>
                     <p>"Never, never, Sir, ſaid Harley; if it had, your reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your daughter were an atonement a thouſand fold." He then repeated his requeſt that he might be allowed to conduct them to his lodgings, to which Mr. Atkins at laſt conſented.</p>
                     <p>He took his daughter's arm, "Come, my Emily, ſaid he, we can never, never recover that happineſs we have loſt; but time may teach us to remember our misfortunes with patience."</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the houſe where Harley lodged, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the firſt floor was then vacant, and that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his daughter might be accommodated there. While he was upon this inquiry, Miſs Atkins informed her father more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what ſhe owed to his benevolence. When he returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room where they were, Atkins ran and embraced him; begged him again to forgive the offence he had given him, and made the warmeſt proteſtations of gratitude for his favours. We would attempt to deſcribe the joy which Harley felt on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did it not occur to us, that one half of the world could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it though we did; and the other half will, by this time, have underſtood it without any deſcription at all.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Atkins now retired to her chamber, to take ſome reſt from the violence of theſe emotions ſhe had ſuffered. When ſhe was gone, her father, addreſſing himſelf to Harley, ſaid, "You have a right, Sir. to be informed of the preſent ſituation of one who

owes ſo much to your compaſſion for his misfortunes. My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I find has informed you what that was at the fatal period when they began.</p>
                     <p>Her diſtreſſes you have heard, you have pitied as they deſerved; mine perhaps I cannot ſo eaſily make you acquainted with. You have a feeling heart, Mr. Harley; I bleſs it that it has ſaved my child; but you never were a father; a father torn by that moſt dreadful of calamities, the diſhonour of a child he doated on! You have been already informed of ſome of the circumſtances of her elopement.</p>
                     <p>I was then from home, called by the death of a relation, who, though he would never advance me a ſhilling on the utmoſt exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his life-time, left me all the gleanings of his frugality at his death. I would not write this intelligence to my daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I intended to be the bearer of the news myſelf; and ſoon as my buſineſs would allow me, I ſet out on my return, winged with all the haſte of paternal affection. I fondly built thoſe ſchemes of future happineſs, which the flattery of preſent proſperity is ever buſy to ſuggeſt: my Emily was concerned in them all.</p>
                     <p>As I approached our little dwelling, my heart throbbed with the anticipation of joy and welcome. I imagined the cheering ſire, the bliſsful contentment of a frugal meal, made luxurious by a daughter's ſmiles: I painted to myſelf her ſurprize at the tidings of our new-acquired riches, our fond diſputes about the diſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"The road was ſhortened by the dreams of happineſs I enjoyed, and it began to de dark as I reached the houſe: I alighted from my horſe, and walked ſoftly up ſtairs to the room we commonly ſat in. I was ſomewhat diſappointed at not finding my daughter there. I rung the bell; her maid appeared, and ſhewed no ſmall ſigns of wonder at the ſummons. She bleſſed herſelf as ſhe entered the room: I ſmiled at her ſurprize. "Where is Miſs Emily, Sir?" ſaid ſhe, "Emily!" "Yes, Sir; ſhe has been gone from hence ſome days, upon receipt of theſe letters you ſent her." "Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!" ſaid I. "Yes, Sir; ſo ſhe told me, and went off in all haſte that very night."</p>

                     <p>"I had not remained long in this ſituation, when the arrival of a friend, who had accidentally heard of my return, put an end to my doubts, by the recital of my daughter's diſhonour. He told me he had his information from a young gentleman, to whom Winbrooke had boaſted of his having ſeduced her.</p>
                     <p>"I ſtarted from my ſeat, with broken curſes on my lips, and without knowing whither I ſhould purſue them, ordered my ſervant to load my piſtol, and ſaddle my horſes.

of a parent flutters round the child he loves, they would be leſs apt to conſtrue into harſhneſs that delicate concern for their conduct, which they often complain of as laying reſtraint upon things, to the young, the gay, and the thoughtleſs, ſeemingly harmleſs and indifferent. Alas! I fondly imagined that I needed not even theſe common cautions! my Emily was the joy of my age, and the pride of my ſoul!—Theſe things are now no more! they are loſt for ever! Her death I could have borne! but-the death of her honour has added obloquy and ſhame to that ſorrow which bends my grey hairs to the duſt!"</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke theſe laſt words, his voice trembled in his throat; it was now loſt in his tears! He ſat with his face half turned from Harley, as if he would have hid the ſorrow which he felt. Harley was in the ſame attitude himſelf; he durſt not meet his eye with a tear; but gathering his ſtifled breath, "Let me intreat you, Sir, ſaid he, to hope better things. The world is ever tyrannical; it warps our ſorrows to edge them with keener affliction: let us not be ſlaves to the names it affixes to motive or to action. I know an ingenuous mind cannot help feeling when they ſting: but theſe are conſiderations by which it may be overcome; its fantaſtic ideas vaniſh as they riſe; they teach us—to look beyond it."</p>

                     <p>THE company in the ſtage-coach conſiſted of a grocer and his wife, who were going to pay a viſit to ſome of their country friends; a young officer, who took this way of marching to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; a middle-aged gentlewoman, who had been hired as a houſe-keeper to ſome family in the country; and an elderly well looking man, with a remarkably old faſhioned periwig.</p>
                     <p>Harley, upon entering, diſcovered but one vacant ſeat, next the grocer's wife, which, from his natural ſhyneſs of temper, he made no ſcruple to occupy, though he knew that being driven back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſagreed with him.</p>
                     <p>Though his inclination to phyſiognomy had met with ſome rubs in the metropolis, he had not yet loſt his attachment to that ſcience: he ſet himſelf therefore to examine the countenances of his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, as uſual.

                     <p>All this afforded ample fund for converſation, if converſation it might, be called, that was carried on ſolely by the before-mentioned lady, nobody offering to interrupt her, except that the officer ſometimes ſignified his approbation by a variety of oaths, a ſort of phraſeology he ſeemed extremely converſant in.</p>
                     <p>She appealed indeed frequently to her huſband as to the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of certain facts, which the good man as often proteſted his entire ignorance of; but as he was always called fool, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very like it, for his pains, he at laſt contrived to aſſiſt the credit of his wife without prejudice to his conſcience, and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aſſent by a noiſe not unlike the grunting of that animal which in ſhape and fatneſs he ſomewhat reſembled. The houſe-keeper, and the old gentleman who ſat next to Harley, were now
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017579_0045_0FA12F29AC608110"/>
obſerved to be faſt aſleep; at which the lady, who had been at ſuch pains to entertain them, muttered ſome words of diſpleaſure, and, upon the officer's whiſpering to ſmoak the old put, both ſhe and her huſband purſed up their mouths into a contemptuous ſmile, Harley looked ſternly on the grocer: "You are come, Sir, ſaid he, to thoſe years when you might have learned ſome reverence for age: as for this young man, who has ſo lately eſcaped from the nurſery, he may be allowed to divert himſelf." "Dam'me, Sir, ſaid the officer, do you call me young?" ſtriking up the front of his hat, and ſtretching forward on his ſeat, till his face almoſt touched Harley's. It is probable, however, that he diſcovered ſomething there which tended to pacify him; for, on the lady's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them not to quarrel, he very ſoon reſumed his poſture and calmneſs together, and was rather leſs profuſe of his oaths during the reſt of the journey. It is poſſible the old gentleman had waked time enough to hear the laſt part of this diſcourſe; at leaſt (whether from that cauſe, or that he too was a phyſiognomiſt) he wore a look remarkably complacent to Harley, who, on his part, ſhewed a particular obſervance of him: indeed they had ſoon a better opportunity of making their acquaintance, as the coach arrived that night at the town where the officer's regiment lay, and the places of deſtination of their other fellow-travellers, it ſeems, were at no great diſtance; for next morning the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and Harley were the only paſſengers remaining.</p>
                     <p>When they left the inn in the morning, Harley, pulling out a little pocket book, began to examine the contents, and make ſome corrections with a pencil. "This, ſaid he, turning to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, is an amuſement I ſometimes paſs idle hours at an inn with: theſe are quotations from thoſe humble poets, who truſt their fame to the brittle tenure of windows and drinking-glaſſes."</p>
                     <p>"From our inns, returned the gentleman, a ſtranger might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we were a nation of poets; machines at leaſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with the motion of a journey emptied of their contents: is it from the vanity of being thought men of genius, or a mere mechanical imitation of the cuſtom of others, that we are led to ſcrawl rhime upon ſuch places?"</p>
                     <p>"Whether vanity is the cauſe of our becoming rhimeſters or not, anſwered Harley, it is a pretty certain effect of it. An old man of my acquaintance, who deals in apophthegms, uſed to ſay, That he had known few men without envy, few wits without ill-nature, and no poet without vanity; and I believe his remark is a pretty juſt one: vanity has been immemorially the charter of poets. In this the ancients were more honeſt than we are; the old poets fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make boaſtful predictions of the immortality their works ſhall acquire them; ours, in their dedications and prefatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, employ much eloquence to praiſe their patrons, with much ſeeming modeſty to condemn themſelves, or at leaſt to apologize for their productions to the world: but this, in my opinion, is the moſt aſſuming manner of the two; for of all the garbs, I ever
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017579_0046_0FA12F2A6DAE4E30"/>
ſaw pride put on, that of her humility is to me the moſt diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <p>"It is natural enough for a poet to be vain, ſaid the ſtranger: the little worlds which he raiſes, the inſpiration which he claims, may eaſily be productive of ſelf-importance; though that inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fabulous, it brings on egotiſm, which is always the parent of vanity."</p>
                     <p>"It may be ſuppoſed, anſwered Harley, that inſpiration of old was an article of religious faith; in modern times it may be tranſlated a propenſity to compoſe; and I believe it is not always moſt readily found where the poets have fixed its reſidence, amidſt groves and plains, and the ſcenes of paſtoral retirement. The mind may be there unb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> from the cares of the world; but it will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, at the ſame time, be unnerved from any great exertion: it will feel imperfect ideas which it cannot expreſs, and wander without effort over the regions of reflection."</p>
                     <p>"There is at leaſt, ſaid the ſtranger, one advantage in the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inclination, that it is an incentive to philanthrophy. There is a certain poetical ground, on which a man cannot tread without feelings that enlarge the heart, the cauſes of human depravity vaniſh before the romantic enthuſiaſm he profeſtes; and many who are not able to reach the Parnaſſian heights, may yet approach ſo near as to be bettered by the air of the climate."</p>
                     <p>"I have always thought ſo, replied Harley; but this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with the prudent againſt it: they urge the danger of unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the world."</p>
                     <p>"I allow it, returned the other; but I believe it is not always rightfully imputed to the bent for poetry: this is only one effect of the common cauſe.—Jack, ſays his father, is indeed no ſcholar; nor could all the drubbings from his maſter ever bring him one bit forward in his grammar or his ſyntax: but I intend him for a merchant.—Allow the ſame indulgence to Tom.—</p>
                     <p>"Tom reads Virgil and Horace when he ſhould be caſting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; and but t'other day he pawned his great coat for an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Shakeſpeare.—But Tom would have been as he is, though Virgil and Horace had never been born, though Shakeſpeare had died a link boy; for his nurſe will tell you, that when he was a child, he broke his rattle, to diſcover what it was that ſounded within it; and burnt the ſticks of his go-cart, becauſe le liked to ſee the ſparkling of timber in the fire.—</p>
                     <p>"It is a ſad caſe; but what is to be done?—Why Jack ſhall grow rich, dine on veniſon, and drink claret.—Ay, but Tom—Tom ſhall dine with his brother, when his pride will let him; at other times, he ſhall bleſs God over a half-pint of ale and a Welſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbit; and both ſhall go to heaven as they may.—That's a poor proſpect for Tom, ſays the father.—To go to heaven! I cannot agree with him."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps, ſaid Harley, we now a-days diſcourage the romantic turn a little too much. Our boys are prudent too ſoon. Miſtake

me not, I do not mean to blame them for want of levity or diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but their pleaſures are thoſe of hackneyed vice, blunted to every finer emotion by the repetition of debauch; and their deſire of pleaſure is warped to the deſire of wealth, as the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it.</p>
                     <p>"The immenſe riches acquired by individuals has erected a ſtandard of ambition, deſtructive of private morals, and of public virtue. The weakneſses of vice are left us; but the moſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of our failings we are taught to deſpiſe. Love, the paſſion moſt natural to the ſenſibility of youth, has loſt the plaintive digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he once poſſeſſed, for the unmeaning ſimper of a dangling cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb; and the only ſerious concern, that of a dowry, is ſettled, even amongſt the beardleſs leaders of the dancing-ſchool The Frivolous and the Intereſted (might a ſatyriſt ſay) are the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical features of the age; they are viſible even in the eſſays of our philoſophers.</p>

This I hold to be an alarming criſis in the corruption of a ſtate; when not only is virtue declined and vice prevailing, but when the praiſes of virtue are forgotten, and the infamy of vice unfelt."</p>
                     <p>They ſoon after arrived at the next inn upon the route of the ſtage coach, when the ſtranger told Harley, that his brother's houſe to which he was returning, lay at no great diſtance, and he muſt therefore unwillingly bid him adieu.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the ſtage coach arrived at the place of its deſtination, Harley began to conſider how he ſhould proceed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his journey. He was very civilly accoſted by the maſter of the inn where he alighted, who offered to accomodate him either with a poſt-chaiſe or horſes, to any diſtance he had a
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017579_0048_0FA12F2BEFED0718"/>
mind: but as he did things frequently in a way different from what other people call natural, he refuſed theſe offers, and ſet out immediately a foot, having firſt put a ſpare ſhirt in his pocket, and given directions for the forwarding of his portmanteau.</p>
                     <p>This was a method of travelling which he was accuſtomed to take; it ſaved the trouble of proviſion for any animal but himſelf, and left him at liberty to chooſe his quarters, either at an inn, or at the firſt cottage in which he ſaw a face he liked: nay, when he was not peculiarly attracted by the reaſonable creation, he would ſometimes conſort with a ſpecies of an inferior rank, and lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down to ſleep by the ſide of a rock, or on the banks of a rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. He did few things without a motive, but his motives were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eccentric; and the uſeful and expedient were terms which he held to be very indefinite, and which therefore he did not always apply to the ſenſe they are commonly underſtood in.</p>
                     <p>The ſun was now in his decline, and the evening remarkably ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, when he entered a hollow part of the road, which winded between the ſurrounding banks, and ſeamed the ſward in different lines, as the choice of travellers had directed them to tread it. It ſeemed to be little frequented now, for ſome of theſe had partly recovered their former verdure. The ſcene was ſuch as induced Harley to ſtand and enjoy it; when, turning round, his notice was attracted by an object, which the fixture of his eye on the ſpot he walked had before prevented him from obſerving.</p>
                     <p>An old man, who from his dreſs ſeemed to have been a ſoldier, lay faſt aſleep on the ground; a knapſack was reſted on a ſtone at his right hand, while his ſtaff and braſs hilted ſword were croſſed at his left.</p>
                     <p>Harley looked on him with the moſt earneſt attention. He was one of thoſe figures which Salvator would have drawn; nor was the ſurrounding ſcenery unlike the wildneſs of that painter's back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds. The banks on each ſide were covered with fantaſtic ſhrub-wood, and at a little diſtance, on the top of one of them, ſtood a finger poſt, to mark the directions of two roads which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verged from the point where it was placed. A rock, with ſome dangling wild flowers, jutted out above where the ſoldier lay, on which grew the ſtump of a large tree, white with age, and a ſingle twiſted branch ſhaded his face as he ſlept. His face had the marks of manly comelineſs impaired by time; his forehead was not altogether bald, but its hairs might have been numbered; while a few white locks behind croſſed the brown of his neck with a contraſt the moſt venerable to a mind like Harley's.</p>
                     <p>"Thou art old, ſaid he to himſelf, but age has not brought thee reſt for its infirmities; I fear theſe ſilver hairs have not found ſhelter from thy country, though that neck has been bronzed in its ſervice." The ſtranger waked. He looked on Harley with the appearance of ſome confuſion: it was a pain which he knew too well to think of cauſing in another; he turned and went on. The old man re-adjuſted his knapſack, and fellowed in one of the tracts on the oppoſite ſide of the road.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:017579_0049_0FA12F2CAD4DDAC8"/>
When Harley heard the tread of his feet behind him, he could not help ſtealing back a glance at his fellow-traveller. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bend under the weight of his knapſack: he halted on his walk, and one of his arms was ſupported by a ſling, and lay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs acroſs his breaſt. He had that ſteady look of ſorrow which indicates that its owner has gazed upon his griefs till he has forgotten to lament them; yet not without thoſe ſtreaks of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, which a good mind will ſometimes throw into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, through all the incumbent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of its depreſſion.</p>
                     <p>He had now advanced nearer to Harley, and, with an uncertain ſort of voice, begged to know what it was o'clock; "I fear, ſaid he, ſleep has beguiled me of my time, and I ſhall hardly have light enough left to carry me to the end of my journey." "Father! ſaid Harley, (who by this time ſound the romantic enthuſiaſm ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing within him) how far do you mean to go!" "But a little way, Sir, returned the other; and indeed it is but a little way I can manage now: it is juſt four miles from the height to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage where I am going." "I am going there too, ſaid Harley; we may make the road ſhorter to one another. You ſeem to have ſerved your country, Sir, to have ſerved it hardly too; it is a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have the higheſt eſteem for.—I would not be impertinently inquiſitive; but there is that in your appearance which excites my curioſity to know ſomething more of you: in the mean time ſuffer me to carry that knapſack."</p>
                     <p>The old man gazed on him; a tear ſtood in his eye! "Young gentleman, ſaid he, you are too good; may heaven bleſs you for an old man's ſake, who has nothing but his bleſſing to give! but my knapſack is ſo familiar to my ſhoulders, that I ſhould walk the worſe for wanting it; and it would be troubleſome to you, who have not been uſed to its weight." "Far from it, anſwered Harley, I ſhould tread the lighter; it would be the moſt honourable badge I ever wore."</p>
                     <p>"Sir, ſaid the ſtranger, who had looked earneſtly in Harley's face during the laſt part of his diſcourſe, is not your name Harley?" "It is, replied he; I am aſhamed to ſay I have forgotten your's." "You may well have forgotten my face, ſaid the ſtranger, it is a long time ſince you ſaw it; but poſſibly you may remember ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of old Edwards."—"Edwards! cried Harley, Oh! heavens! and ſprung to embrace him; let me claſp thoſe knees on which I have ſat ſo often: Edwards!—I ſhall never forget that fire ſide, round which I have been ſo happy! But where, where have you been? where is Jack? where is your daughter? How has it fared with them, when fortune, I fear, has been ſo unkind to you?"—"It is a long tale, replied Edwards; but I will try to tell it you as we walk.</p>

                        </gap> that farm had been poſſeſſed by my father, grandfather, and great grandfather, which laſt was a younger brother of that very man's anceſtor who is now lord of the manor. I thought I managed it as they had done, with prudence; I paid
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017579_0050_0FA12F2D6D935BC0"/>
my rent regularly as it became due, and had always as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind as gave bread to me and my children. But my laſt leaſe was out ſoon after you left that part of the country; and the ſquire, who had lately got a London attorney for his ſteward, would not renew it, becauſe, he ſaid, he did not chooſe to have any farm under 300<hi>l.</hi> a year value on his eſtate; but offered to give me the preference on the ſame terms with another, if I chooſe to take the one he had marked out, of which mine was a part.</p>
                     <p>"What could I do, Mr. Harley? I feared the undertaking was too great for me; yet to leave, at my age, the houſe I had lived in from my cradle! I could not, Mr. Harley, I could not; there was not a tree about it that I did not look on as my father, my brother, or my child: ſo I even ran <hi>t</hi>he riſque, and took the ſquire's offer of the whole. But I had ſoon reaſon to repent of my bargain: the ſteward had taken care that my former farm ſhould be the beſt land of the diviſion: I was obliged to hire more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and I could not have my eye over them all; ſome unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſeaſons followed one another, and I found my affairs entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on my hands.</p>
                     <p>"To add to my diſtreſs, a conſiderable corn-factor turned bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with a ſum of mine in his poſſeſſion: I failed paying my rent ſo punctually as I was wont to do, and the ſame ſteward had my ſtock taken in execution in a few days after. So, Mr. Harley, there was an end of my proſperity. However, there was as much produced from the ſale of my effects as paid my debts, and ſaved me from a gaol: I thank God I wronged no man, and the world could never charge me with diſhoneſty.</p>
                     <p>"Had you ſeen us, Mr. Harley, when we were turned out of South-hill, I am ſure you would have wept at the ſight. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member old Truſty, my ſhag houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dog; I ſhall never forget it while I live; the poor creature was blind with age, and could ſcarce crawl after us to the door; he went however as far as the gooſeberry-buſh; that you may remember ſtood on the left hand of the yard; he was wont to baſk in the ſun there: when he had reached that ſpot, he ſtopped; we went on: I called to him, he wagged his tail, but did not ſtir: I called again; he lay down: I whiſtled, and cried Truſty, he gave a ſhort howl, and died! I could have lain down and died too, but God gave me ſtrength to live for my children."</p>
                     <p>The old man now pauſed a moment to take breath. He looked on Harley's face; it was bathed in 'tears: it was a tale he had been accuſtomed to think often on; he dropped one tear and no more.</p>
                     <p>"Though I was poor, continued he, I was not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out credit. A gentleman in the neighbourhood, who had a ſmall farm unoccupied at the time, offered to let me have it, on giving ſecurity for the rent, which I made ſhift to procure. It was a piece of ground which needed management to make any thing of; but it was nearly within the compaſs of my ſon's labour and my own. We exerted all our induſtry to bring it into ſome heart. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

to ſucceed tolerably well, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lived contented on its produce, when an unlucky accident brought us under the diſpleaſure of a neighbouring juſtice of the peace, and broke all our family happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs again.</p>
                     <p>"My ſon was a remarkable good ſhooter; he had always kept a pointer on our former farm, and thought no harm in doing ſo now; when one day, having ſprung a covey of birds on our own ground, the dog, of his own accord, followed them into the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice's. My ſon laid down his gun, and went after his dog to bring him back: the game keeper, who had marked the birds, came up, and ſeeing the pointer, ſhot him juſt as my ſon approached. The creature fell; my ſon ran up to him: he died with a complaining ſort of cry at his maſter's feet. Jack could bear it no longer; but flying at the game-keeper, wrenched his gun out of his hand, and with the butt-end of it felled him to the ground.</p>
                     <p>"He had ſcarce got home, when a conſtable came with a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and dragged him to priſon; there he lay, for the juſtices would not take bail, till he was tried at the quarter-ſeſſions for the aſſault and battery. His fine was ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"An officer with preſs-orders came down to our county, and having met with the juſtices, agreed that they ſhould pitch on a certain number, who could moſt eaſily be ſpared from the county, whom he would take care to make it rid of: my ſon's name was in the juſtice's liſt.</p>
                     <p>"It was on a Chriſtmas-eve, and the birth-day too of my ſon's little boy. The night was piercing cold, and it blew a ſtorm, with ſhowers of hail and ſnow. We had made up a cheering fire in an inner room; I ſat before it in my wickerchair, bleſſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that had ſtill left a ſhelter for me and my children. My ſon's two little ones were holding their gambols around us; my heart warmed at the ſight; I brought a bottle of my beſt ale, and all our misfortunes were forgotten.</p>
                     <p>"It had long been our cuſtom to play a game at blind man's buff on that night, and it was not omitted now; ſo to it we fell, I, and my ſon, and his wife, the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, who happened to be with us at the time, the two children, and an old maid ſervant, that had lived with me from a child. The lot fell on my ſon to be blindfolded: we had continued ſome time in our game, when he groped his way into an outer-room in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſome of us, who, he imagined, had taken ſhelter there; we kept ſnug in our places, and enjoyed his miſtake. He had not been long there, when he was ſuddenly ſeized from behind; "I ſhall have you now," ſaid he, and turned about. "Shall you ſo, maſter, anſwered the ruffian who had laid hold of him; we ſhall make you play at another ſort of game by and by."—At theſe words Harley ſtarted with a convulſive ſort of motion, and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Edwards's ſword, drew it half out of the ſcabbard, with a look of the moſt frantic wildneſs. Edwards gently replaced it in its ſheath, and went on with his relation.</p>
                     <p>"On hearing theſe words in a ſtrange voice, we all ruſhed out to diſcover the cauſe; the room by this time was almoſt full of the gang. My daughter-in-law fainted at the ſight, the maid and I ran to aſſiſt her, while my poor ſon remained motionleſs, gazing by turns on his children and their mother.

The money we could juſt muſter up in the houſe, by the aſſiſtance of the maid, who produced, in a green bag, all the little ſavings of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but the man we could not expect to find.

"I put the money in his hand; and coming back to my children, "Jack, ſaid I, you are free; live to give your wife and theſe little ones bread; I will go, my child, in your ſtead: I have but little life to loſe, and if I ſtaid, ſhould add one to the wretches you left behind."</hi>

He conducted me to a party of new raiſed recruits, who lay at village in the neighbourhood; and we ſoon after joined the regiment. I had not been long with it, when we were ordered to the Eaſt Indies, where I was ſoon made a ſerjeant, and might have picked up ſome money, if my heart had been as hard as ſome others were; but my nature was never of that kind, that could think of making rich at the expence of my conſcience.</hi>

Are all thy gay tenants gone; do I hear their hum no more; Edwards, look there, look there! the ſcene of my infant joys, my earlieſt friendſhips, laid waſte and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous! That was the very ſchool where I was boarded when you were at South-hill: it is but a twelvemonth ſince I ſaw it ſtanding, and its benches filled with little cherubims: that oppoſite ſide of the road was the green on which they ſported; ſee it now plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up! I would have given fifty times its value to have ſaved it from the ſacrilege of that plow."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Sir, replied Edwards, perhaps they have left it from choice, and may have got another ſpot as good." "They cannot, ſaid Harley, they cannot; I ſhall never ſee the ſward covered with its daiſies, nor preſſed by the dance of the dear innocents: I ſhall never ſee that ſtump decked with the garlands which their little hands had gathered. Theſe two long ſtones which now lie at the foot of it, were once the ſupports of a hut I myſelf aſſiſted to rear: I have ſat on the ſods within it, when we had ſpread our banquet of apples before us, and been more bleſt.—Oh! Edwards! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more bleſt than ever I ſhall be again."</p>
                     <p>Juſt then a woman paſſed them on the road, and diſcovered ſome ſigns of wonder at the attitude of Harley, who ſtood, with his hands folded together, looking with a moiſtened eye on the fallen pillars of the hut. He was too much intranced in thought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her at all; but Edwards civilly accoſting her, deſired to know, if that had not been the ſchool-houſe, and how it came into that condition they now ſaw it in? "Alack a-day! ſaid ſhe, it was the ſchool-houſe indeed; but to be ſure, Sir, the ſquire has pulled it down, becauſe it ſtood in the way of his proſpects."—"What! how! proſpects! pulled down! cried Harley."—Yes, to be ſure, Sir; and the green, where the children uſed to play, he has ploughed up, becauſe, he ſaid, they hurt his fence on the other ſide of it."—"Curſes on his narrow heart, cried Harley, that could violate a right ſo ſacred! Heaven blaſt the wretch!

But I need not, Edwards, I need not, (recovering himſelf a little) he is curſed enough already: to him the nobleſt ſource of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is denied; and the cares of his ſordid ſoul ſhall g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

thou ſitteſt over a brown cruſt, ſmiling on theſe mangled limbs that have ſaved your ſon and his children!" "If you want any thing with the ſchool miſtreſs, Sir, ſaid the woman, I can ſhew you the way to her houſe." He followed her without knowing whither he went.</p>
                     <p>They ſtopped at the door of a ſnug-looking houſe, where ſat an elderly woman with a boy and a girl before her, with each a ſupper of bread and milk in their hands. "There, Sir, is the ſchool-miſtreſs."—"Madam, ſaid Harley, was not an old venerable-looking man ſchool-maſter here ſome time ago?" "Yes, Sir, he was; poor man! the loſs of his former ſchool-houſe, I believe, broke his heart, for he died ſoon after it was taken down; and as another has not yet been found, I have that charge in the mean time."—"And this boy and girl, I preſume, are your pupils?"—"Ay, Sir, they are poor orphans, put under my care by the pariſh; and more promiſing children I never ſaw." "Orphans!" ſaid Harley. "Yes, Sir, of honeſt creditable parents as any in the pariſh; and it is a ſhame for ſome folks to forget their relations, at a time when they have moſt need to remember them."—"Madam, ſaid Harley, let us never forget that we are all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons." He kiſſed the children.</p>
                     <p>"Their father, Sir, continued ſhe, was a farmer here in the neighbourhood, and a ſober induſtrious man he was; but nobody can help misfortunes; what with bad crops, and bad debts, which are worſe, his affairs went to wreck, and both he and his wife died of broken hearts. And a ſweet couple they were, Sir; there was not a properer man to look on in the county than John Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſo indeed were all the Edwardſes." "What Edward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?" cried the old ſoldier haſtily "The Edwardſes of South-hill; and a worthy family they were."—"South-hill!" ſaid he in a languid voice, and fell back into the arms of the aſtoniſhed Harley.</p>
                     <p>The ſchool-miſtreſs ran for ſome water, and a ſmelling-bottle, with the aſſiſtance of which they ſoon recovered the unfortunate Edwards. He ſtared wildly for ſome time, then folding his orphan grand-children in his arms, "Oh! my children, my children! he cried, have I found you thus? My poor Jack! art thou gone? I thought thou ſhouldeſt have carried thy father's grey hairs to the grave! And theſe little ones"—his tears choaked his utterance, and he fell again on the necks of the children.</p>
                     <p>"My dear old man! ſaid Harley, Providence has ſent thee to relieve them; it will bleſs me, if I can be the means of aſſiſting you."—"Yes indeed, Sir, anſwered the boy; father, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, bade God bleſs us; and prayed, that if grandfather lived, he might ſend him to ſupport us."—"Where did they lay my boy?" ſaid Edwards. "In the Old Church-Yard, replied the woman, hard by his mother."—"I will ſhew it you, anſwered the boy; for I have wept over it many a time, when firſt I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſtrange folks." He took the old man's hand, Harley laid
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:017579_0056_0FA12F336B95EDB0"/>
hold of his ſiſter's, and they walked in ſilence to the church-yard. There was an old ſtone, with the corner broken off, and ſome letters, half covered with moſs, to denote the names of the dead: there was a cyphered R. E. plainer than the reſt: it was the tomb they ſought.</p>
                     <p>"Here it is, grandfather," ſaid the boy. Edwards gazed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it without uttering a word: the girl, who had only ſighed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now wept out-right; her brother ſobbed, but he ſtifled his ſobbing. "I have told ſiſter, ſaid he, that ſhe ſhould not take it ſo to heart; ſhe can knit already, and I ſhall ſoon be able to dig: we ſhall not ſtarve, ſiſter, indeed we ſhall not, nor ſhall grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father neither."—The girl cried afreſh; Harley kiſſed off her tears as they flowed, and wept between every kiſs.</p>

                     <p>IT was with ſome difficulty that Harley prevailed on the old man to leave the ſpot where the remains of his ſon were laid. At laſt, with the aſſiſtance of the ſchool-miſtreſs, he prevailed; and ſhe accommodated Edwards and him with beds in her houſe, there being nothing like an inn nearer than the diſtance of ſome miles. In the morning, Harley perſuaded Edwards to come, with the children, to his houſe, which was diſtant but a ſhort day's journey.</p>
                     <p>The boy walked in his grand-father's hand; and the name of Edwards procured him a neighbouring farmer's horſe, on which a ſervant mounted, with the girl ſeated on a pillow before him.</p>
                     <p>With this train Harley returned to the abode of his fathers: and we cannot but think, that his enjoyment was as great as if he had arrived from the tour of Europe, with a Swiſs valet for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and half a dozen ſnuff-boxes, with inviſible hinges, in his pocket. But we take our ideas from ſounds which folly has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; Faſhion, Bon-ton, and Vertu, are the names of certain idols, to which we ſacrifice the genuine pleaſures of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oul: in this world of ſemblance, we are contented with perſonating happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to feel it, is an art beyond us.</p>
                     <p>It was otherwiſe with Harley: he ran up ſtairs to his aunt, with the hiſtory of his fellow-travellers glowing on his lips. His aunt was an oeconomiſt; but ſhe knew the pleaſure of doing charitable things, and withal was fond of her nephew, and ſolicitous to oblige him. She received old Edwards therefore with a look of more complacency than is perhaps natural to maiden ladies of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, and was remarkably attentive to his grand-children: ſhe roaſted apples with her own hands for their ſupper, and made up a little bed beſide her own for the girl. Edwards made ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:017579_0057_0FA12F342BE59838"/>
towards an acknowledgment for theſe favours; but his young friend ſtopped them in their beginnings. "Whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth any of theſe children"—ſaid his aunt; for her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with her bible was habitual.</p>
                     <p>Early next morning, Harley ſtole into the room where Edwards lay: he expected to have found him a bed; but in this he was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: the old man had riſen, and was leaning over his ſleeping grandſon, with the tears flowing down his checks. At firſt he did not perceive Harley; when he did, he endeavoured to hide his grief, and croſſing his eyes with his hand, expreſſed his ſurpriſe at ſeeing him ſo early aſtir. "I was thinking of you, ſaid Harley, and your children: I learned laſt night that a ſmall farm of mine in the neighbourhood is now vacant; if you will occupy it, I ſhall gain a good neighbour, and be able in ſome meaſure to repay you the notice you took of me when a boy; and as the furniture of the houſe is mine, it will be ſo much trouble ſaved." Edwards's tears guſhed afreſh, and Harley led him to ſee the place he intended for him.</p>
                     <p>The houſe upon this farm was indeed little better than a hut; its ſituation, however, was pleaſant, and Edwards, aſſiſted by the beneficence of Harley, ſet about improving its neatneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. He ſtaked out a piece of the green before for a garden, and Peter, who acted in Harley's family as valet, butler, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, had orders to furniſh him with parcels of the different ſeeds he choſe to ſow in it. I have ſeen his maſter at work in this little ſpot, with his coat off, and his dibble in his hand: it was a ſcene of tranquil virtue to have ſtopped an angel on his errands of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! Harley had contrived to lead a little bubbling brook through a green walk in the middle of the ground, upon which he had erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mill in miniature for the diverſion of Edward's infant grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and made ſhift in its conſtruction to introduce a pliant bit of wood, that anſwered with its fairy clack to the murmuring of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ill that turned it. I have ſeen him ſtand, liſtening to theſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſounds, with his eye fixed on the boy, and the ſmile of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious ſatisfaction on his cheek; while the old man, with a look half turned to Harley, and half to heaven, breathed an ejaculation of gratitude and piety.</p>
                     <p>Father of mercies! I alſo would thank thee! that not only haſt thou aſſigned eternal rewards to virtue, but that, even in this bad world, the lines of our duty, and our happineſs, are ſo frequently woven together.</p>

It is there indeed where the wiſhes of their friends aſſign them eminence, where the queſtion of their country is pointed at their return. When ſhall I ſee a commander return from India in the pride of honourable poverty?—You deſcribe the victories they have gained; they are ſullied by the cauſe in which they fought: you enumerate the ſpoils of theſe victories; they are covered with the blood of the vanquiſhed!</p>
                        <p>"Could you tell me of ſome conqueror giving peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to the conquered! did he accept the gifts of their princes to uſe them for the comfort of thoſe whoſe fathers, ſons, or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, fell in battle? did he uſe his power to gain ſecurity and freedom to the regions of oppreſſion and ſlavery? did he endear the Britiſh name by examples of generoſity, which the moſt deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are rarely able to reſiſt? did he return with the conſciouſneſs of duty diſcharged to his country, and humanity to his fellow-creatures? did he return with no lace on his coat, no ſlaves in his retinue, no chariot at his door, and no Burgundy at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?—theſe were laurels which princes might envy—which an honeſt man would not condemn!"</p>
                        <p>"Your maxims, Mr. Harley, are certainly right, ſaid Edwards. I am not capable of arguing with you; but I imagine there are
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017579_0059_0FA12F35B4F88FE8"/>
great temptations in a great degree of riches, which it is no eaſy matter to reſiſt: theſe a poor man like me cannot deſcribe, becauſe he never knew them; and perhaps I have reaſon to bleſs God that I never did; for then, it is likely, I ſhould have withſtood them no better than my neighbours. For you know, Sir, that it is not the faſhion now, as it was in former times, that I have read of in books, when your great generals died ſo poor, that they did not leave wherewithal to buy them a coffin; and people thought the better of their memories for it: if they did ſo now-a-days, I queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if any body, except yourſelf, and ſome few ſuch, would thank them a whit."</p>
                        <p>"I am ſorry, replied Harley, that there is ſo much truth in what you ſay; but however the general current of opinion may point, the feelings are not yet loſt that applaud benevolence, and cenſure inhumanity. Let us endeavour to ſtrengthen them in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and we, who live ſequeſtered from the noiſe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, have better opportunities of liſtening undiſturbed to their voice."</p>
                        <p>They now approached the little dwelling of Edwards. A maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, whom he had hired to aſſiſt him in caring for his grand-children, met them a little way from the houſe: "There is a young lady within with the children," ſaid ſhe. Edwards expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <p>This young lady then was no other than Miſs Walton. She had heard the old man's hiſtory from Harley, as we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Curioſity, or ſome other motive, prompted her to deſire to ſee his grand-children: this ſhe had an opportunity of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon, the children, in ſome of their walks, having ſtrolled as far as her father's avenue. She put ſeveral queſtions to both; ſhe was delighted with the ſimplicity of their anſwers, and promiſed, that if they continued to be good children, and do as their grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father bid them, ſhe would ſoon ſee them again, and bring ſome preſent or other for their reward.</p>
                        <p>This promiſe ſhe had performed now: ſhe came attended only by her maid, and brought with her a complete ſuit of green for the boy, and a chintz gown, a cap, and a ſuit of ribbands, for his ſiſter. She had time enough, with her maid's aſſiſtance, to equip them in their new habiliments before Harley and Edwards return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The boy heard his grand-father's voice, and, with that ſilent joy which his preſent finery inſpired, ran to the door to meet him: and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Harley fixed his eye on Miſs Walton; her's were turned to the ground;—in Edwards's there was a beamy moiſture.—He folded his hands together—"I cannot ſpeak, young lady, ſaid he, to thank you." Nor could Harley neither. There were a thouſand ſentiments;—but they guſhed ſo impetuouſly on his heart, that he could not utter a ſyllable.—</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>deſire of communicating knowledge or intelligence, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with thoſe who hold that man is naturally a ſocial animal. It is indeed one of the earlieſt propenſities we diſcover; but it may be doubted whether the pleaſure (for pleaſure there certainly is) ariſing from it be not often more ſelfiſh than ſocial: for we frequently obſerve the tidings of Ill communicated as eagerly as the annunciation of Good. Is it that we delight in obſerving the effects of the ſtronger paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? for we are all philoſophers in this reſpect; and it is perhaps amongſt the ſpectators at Tyburn that the moſt genuine are to be found.</hi>

                        <hi>Was it from this motive that Peter came one morning into his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's room with a meaning face of recital? His maſter indeed did not at firſt obſerve it; for he was ſitting, with one ſhoe buckled, buſied in delineating portraits in the fire. "I have bruſhed theſe clothes, Sir, as you ordered me."—Harley nodded his head; but Peter obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his hat wanted bruſhing too: his maſter nodded again. At laſt Peter bethought him, that the fire needed ſtirring; and, taking up the poker, demoliſhed the turband-head of a Saracen, while his maſter was ſeeking out a body for it. "The morning is main cold, Sir," ſaid Peter. "Is it?" ſaid Harley. "Yes, Sir; I have been as far as Tom Dowſon's to fetch ſome barberries he had picked for Mrs. Margery.

"why, it may not be true, Sir, for all that; but Tom's wife told it me, and to be ſure the ſervants told her, and their maſter told them, as I gueſs, Sir; but it may not be true for all that, as I ſaid before."—"Have done with your idle information, ſaid Harley:—Is my aunt come down into the parlour to breakfaſt?"—"Yes, Sir"—"Tell her I'll be with her immediately."—</hi>

                        <hi>When Peter was gone, he ſtood with his eyes fixed on the ground, and the laſt words of his intelligence vibrating in his ears. "Miſs Walton married!" he ſighed—and walked down ſtairs, with his ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His aunt, however, was pretty well accuſtomed to theſe appearances of abſence; beſides, that the natural gravity of her temper, which was commonly called into exertion by the care of her houſehold concerns, was ſuch, as not eaſily to be diſcompoſed by any circumſtance of accidental impropriety. She too had been informed of the intended match between Sir Harry Benſon and Miſs Walton. "I have been thinking, ſaid ſhe, that they are

Harley anſwered drily, that it might be ſo; but that he never troubled himſelf about theſe matters.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Harley was in no very good humour for entering into a diſcuſſion of this queſtion; but he always entertained ſo much parental reſpect for his aunt, as to attend to her diſcourſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"We blame the pride of the rich, ſaid he; but are not we aſhamed of our poverty?"</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Why, one would not chooſe, replied his aunt, to make a much worſe figure than one's neighbours; but, as I was ſaying before, the times (as my friend Mrs. Dorothy Walton obſerves) are ſhamefully degenerated in this reſpect. There was but the other day, at Mr. Walton's, that fat fellow's daughter, the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Merchant, as he calls himſelf, though I have heard that he was little better than the keeper of a chandler's ſhop:—We were leaving the gentlemen to go to tea. She had a hoop forſooth as large and as ſtiff—and it ſhewed a pair of bandy legs as thick as two—I was nearer the door by an apron's length, and the pert huſſy bruſhed by me, as who ſhould ſay, make way for your betters, and with one of her London bobs—but Mrs. Dorothy did not let her paſs with it; for all the time of drinking tea, ſhe ſpoke of the precedency of family, and the diſparity there is between people who are come of ſomething, and your muſhroom-gentry who wear their coats of arms in their purſes."</p>
                     <p>Her indignation was interrupted by the arrival of her maid with a damaſk table cloth, and a ſet of napkins, from the loom, which had been ſpun by her miſtreſs's own hand. There was the family creſt in each corner, and in the middle a view of the battle of Worceſter, where one of her anceſtors had been a captain in the king's forces; and, with a ſort of poetical licenſe as to perſpective, there was ſeen the Royal Oak, with more wig than leaves on it.</p>
                     <p>All this the good lady was very copious on and took up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining intervals of filling tea, to deſcribe its excellencies to Harley; adding, that ſhe intended this as a preſent for his wife, when he ſhould get one. He ſighed and looked fooliſh, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſerenity of the day, walked out into the garden.</p>
                     <p>He ſat down on a little ſeat which commanded an extenſive proſpect round the houſe. He leaned on his hand, and ſcored the ground with his ſtick: "Miſs Walton married! ſaid he; but
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:017579_0062_0FA12F396F36CAC0"/>
what is that to me? May ſhe be happy! her virtues deſerve it; to me her marriage is otherwiſe indifferent:—I had romantic dreams! they are fled! it is perfectly indifferent."</p>
                     <p>Juſt at that moment he ſaw a ſervant, with a knot of ribbands in his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſtood a moment liſtening in this breathleſs ſtate of palpitation: Peter came out by chance. "Did your honour want any thing?"—"Where is the ſervant that came juſt now from Mr. Walton's?"—"From Mr. Walton's, Sir! there is none of his ſervants here that I know of."—"Nor of Sir Harry Benſon's?"—He did not wait for an anſwer; but having by this time obſerved the hat with its party-coloured ornament hanging on a peg near the door, he preſſed forwards into the kitchen, and addreſſing himſelf to a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whom he ſaw there, aſked him, with no ſmall tremor in his voice, If he had any commands for him? The man looked ſilly, and ſaid, That he had nothing to trouble his honour with. "Are not you a ſervant of Sir Harry Benſon's?"—"No, Sir."—"You'll pardon me, young man; I judged by the favour in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Recruiting!" his eyes gliſtened at the word: he ſeized the ſoldier's hand, and ſhaking it violently, ordered Peter to fetch a bottle of his aunt's beſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>am. The bottle was brought: "You ſhall drink the king's health, ſaid Harley, in a bumper."—"The king and your honour."—"Nay, you ſhall drink the king's health by itſelf; you may drink mine in another." Peter looked in his maſter's face, and filled with ſome little reluctance. "Now to your miſtreſs." The man excuſed himſelf—"to your miſtreſs! you cannot refuſe it." It was Mrs. Margery's beſt dram! Peter ſtood with the bottle a little inclined, but not ſo as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a drop of its contents: "Fill it, Peter, ſaid his maſter, fill it to the brim." Peter filled it; and the ſoldier having named Sukey Simſon, diſpatched it in a twinkling. "Thou art an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fellow, ſaid Harley, and I love thee;" and ſhaking his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, deſired Peter to make him his gueſt at dinner, and walked up into his room with a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce much quicker and ſpringy than uſual. This agreeable diſappointment however he was not long ſuffered to felicitate himſelf upon.</p>
                     <p>The curate happened that day to dine with him: his viſits indeed were more properly to the aunt than the nephew; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the intelligent ladies in the pariſh, who, like ſome very great philoſophers, have the happy knack at accounting for every thing, gave out, that there was a particular attachment between them, which wanted only to be maturated by ſome more years of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to end in the tendereſt connection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:017579_0063_0FA12F3A2D9A06C8"/>
In this concluſion indeed, ſuppoſing the premiſes to have been true, they were ſomewhat juſtified by the known opinion of the lady, who frequently declared herſelf a friend to the <hi>etiquette</hi> of former times, when a lover might have ſighed ſeven years at his miſtreſs's feet, before he was allowed the liberty of kiſſing her hand. It is true Mrs. Margery was now about her grand climacteric; but that is nothing: for it is juſt the age when we expect to grow younger. But I verily believe there was nothing in the report; the curate's connection was only as a genealogiſt; for in that ſcience he was no ways inferior to Mrs. Margery herſelf. He dealt alſo in the preſent times; for he was a politician and a news-monger.</p>
                     <p>He had hardly ſaid grace after dinner, when he told Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, that ſhe might ſoon expect a pair of white gloves, as Sir Harry Benſon, he was very well informed, was juſt going to be married to Miſs Walton. Harley ſpilt the wine he was carrying to his mouth: he had time however to recollect himſelf before the curate had finiſhed the different minutiae of his intelligence, and ſummoning up all the heroiſm he was maſter of, filled a bumper and drank to Miſs Walton.</p>
                     <p>"With all my heart, ſaid the curate, the bride that is to be." Harley would have ſaid bride too; but the word Bride ſtuck in his throat. His confuſion indeed was manifeſt: but the curate began to enter on ſome point of deſcent with Mrs. Margery, and Harley had very ſoon after an opportunity of leaving them, while they were deeply engaged in a queſtion, whether the name of ſome great man in the time of Henry the Seventh was Richard or Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey.</p>
                     <p>He did not ſee his aunt again till ſupper; the time between he ſpent in walking, like ſome troubled ghoſt, round the place where his treaſure lay. He went as far as a little gate, that led into a copſe near Mr. Walton's houſe, to which that gentleman had been ſo obliging us to let him have a key.</p>
                     <p>He had juſt begun to open it, when he ſaw, on a terraſs below, Miſs Walton walking with a gentleman in a riding-dreſs, whom he immediately gueſſed to be Sir Harry Benſon. He ſtopped of a ſudden; his hand ſhook ſo much that he could hardly turn the key; he opened the gate however, and advanced a few paces. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's lap-dog pricked up its ears, and barked: he ſtopped again.—
<q>
                           <l>—<hi>" the little dogs and all,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, ſee they bark at me!"</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
His reſolution failed; he ſlunk back, and locking the gate as ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he could, ſtood on tiptoe looking over the wall till they were gone. At that inſtant a ſhepherd blew his horn: the romantic melancholy of the ſound quite overcame him!—it was the very note that wanted to be touched—he ſighed! he dropped a tear!—and returned.</p>
                     <p>At ſupper his aunt obſerved that he was duller than uſual; but ſhe did not ſuſpect the cauſe: indeed it may ſeem odd that ſhe was
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:017579_0064_0FA12F3AEC9763D8"/>
the only perſon in the family who had no ſuſpicion of his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Miſs Walton. It was frequently matter of diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſervants: perhaps her maiden coldneſs—but theſe things need not be accounted for.</p>
                     <p>In a day or two he was ſo much maſter of himſelf as to be able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hime upon the ſubject. The following paſtoral he left, ſome time after, on the handle of a tea-kettle, at a neighbouring houſe where we were viſiting; and as I filled the tea-pot after him, I happened to put it in my pocket by a ſimilar act of forgetfulneſs. It is ſuch as might be expected from a man who makes verſes for amuſement.</p>
                     <p>I am pleaſed with ſomewhat of good-nature that runs through it, becauſe I have commonly obſerved the writers of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints beſtow ſome epithets on their loſt miſtreſſes rather too harſh for the mere liberty of choice, which led them to prefer another to the poet himſelf: I do not doubt the vehemence of their paſſion; but alas! the ſenſations of love are ſomething more than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of gratitude.</p>

                     <p>[At this place had the greateſt depredations of the curate began. There were ſo very few connected paſſages of the ſubſequent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters remaining, that even the partiality of an editor could not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to the public. I diſcovered, from ſome ſcattered ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that they were of much the ſame tenor with thoſe preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; recitals of little adventures, in which the diſpoſitions of a man, ſenſible to judge, and ſtill more warm to feel, had room to unfold themſelves. Some inſtruction, and ſome example, I make no doubt, they contained; but it is likely that many of thoſe, whom chance hath led to a peruſal of what I have already preſented them with, may have read it with little pleaſure, and will feel no diſappointment from the want of thoſe parts which I have been unable to procure: to ſuch as may have expected the intricacies of a novel, a few incidents in a life undiſtinguiſhed, except by ſome features of the heart, cannot have afforded much entertainment.</p>
                     <p>Harley's own ſtory, from the mutilated paſſages I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as well as from ſome inquiries I was at the trouble of making in the country, I found to have been ſimple to exceſs. His miſtreſs I could perceive was not married to Sir Harry Benſon: but it would ſeem, by one of the following chapters, which is ſtill entire, that Harley had not profited on the occaſion by making any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his own paſſion, after thoſe of the other had been unſucceſsful. The ſtate of his health for ſome part of this period,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:017579_0068_0FA12F3DEA5D7D50"/>
appears to have been ſuch as to forbid any thoughts of that kind: he had been ſeized with a very dangerous fever, catched by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old Edwards in one of an infectious kind. From this he had recovered but imperfectly, and though he had no formed complaint, his health was manifeſtly on the decline.</p>
                     <p>It appears that the ſagacity of ſome friend had at length point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to his aunt a cauſe from which this might be ſuppoſed to proceed, to wit, his hopeleſs love for Miſs Walton; for according to the conceptions of the world, the love of a man of Harley's fortune for the heireſs of 4000<hi>l.</hi> a year, is indeed deſperate. Whether it was ſo in this caſe may be gathered from the next chapter, which, with the two following, concluding the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, have eſcaped thoſe accidents which were fatal to the reſt.]</p>

                        <p>I have not, under theſe grey hairs, forgotten that I was once a young man, warm in the purſuit of pleaſure, but meaning to be honeſt as well as happy.</p>
                        <p>I had ideas of virtue, of honour, of benevolence, which I had never been at the pains to define; but I felt my boſom heave at the thoughts of them, and I made the moſt delightful ſoliloquies—It is impoſſible, ſaid I, that there can be half ſo many rogues as they imagine.</p>
                        <p>"I travelled, becauſe it is the faſhion for young men of my fortune to travel: I had a travelling tutor, which is the faſhion too; but my tutor was a gentleman, which it is not always the faſhion for tutors to be. His gentility indeed was all he had from his father, whoſe prodigality had not left him a ſhilling to ſupport it.</p>
                        <p>"I have a favour to aſk you, my deard Mountford, ſaid my father, which I will not be refuſed: You have travelled as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man; neither France nor Italy have made any thing of Mountford, which Mountford before he left England would have been aſhamed of: my ſon Edward goes abroad, would you take him under your protection?"—He bluſhed—my father's face was ſcarlet—he preſſed his hand to his boſom, as if he had ſaid,—my heart does not mean to offend you. Mountford ſighed twice—I am a proud fool, ſaid he, and you will pardon it;—(there he ſighed again) I can hear of dependance, ſince it is dependance

on my Sedley."—"Dependance! anſwered my father; there can be no ſuch word between us; what is there in 9000<hi>l.</hi> a year that ſhould make me unworthy of Mountford's friendſhip!"—They embraced; and ſoon after I ſet out on my travels, with Mountford for my guardian.</p>
                        <p>"We were at Milan, where my father happened to have an Italian friend, to whom he had been of ſome ſervice in England. The count, for he was of quality, was ſolicitous to return the obligation, by a particular attention to his ſon: We lived in his palace, viſited with his family, were careſſed by his friends, and I began to be ſo well pleaſed with my entertainment, that I thought of England as of ſome foreign country.</p>
                        <p>"The count had a ſon not much older than myſelf. At that age a friend is an eaſy acquiſition: we were friends the firſt night of our acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>"He introduced me into the company of a ſet of young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe fortunes gave them the command of pleaſure, and whoſe inclinations incited them to the purchaſe. After having ſpent ſome joyous evenings in their ſociety, it became a ſort of habit which I could not miſs without uneaſineſs; and our meetings, which before were frequent, were now ſtated and regular.</p>
                        <p>"Sometimes, in the pauſes of our mirth, gaming was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as an amuſement: it was an art in which I was a notice; I received inſtruction, as other novices do, by loſing pretty largely to my teachers. Nor was this the only evil which Mountford fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would ariſe from the connection I had formed; but a lecture of ſour injunctions was not his method of reclaiming.

Mountford ſeemed to rejoice at my good fortune, and begged that I would introduce him to their acquaintance. At the next meeting I introduced him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                        <p>"The converſation was as animated as uſual; they diſplayed all that ſprightlineſs and good humour which my praiſes had led Mountford to expect; ſubjects too of ſentiment occurred, and their ſpeeches, particularly thoſe of our friend the ſon of count Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpino, glowed with the warmth of honour, and ſoftened into the tenderneſs of feeling.</p>

                        <p>"In going to their place of rendezvous, he took me a little out of the road, to ſee, as he told me, the performances of a young ſtatuary. When we were near the houſe in which Mountford ſaid

Mountford entered with a look in which was pictured the benign aſſurance of a ſuperior being. I followed in ſilence and amazement.</p>
                        <p>"On ſomething like a bed, lay a man, with a face ſeemingly emaciated with ſickneſs, and a look of patient dejection; a bundle of dirty ſhreds ſerved him for a pillow; but he had a better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port—the arm of a female who kneeled beſide him, beautiful as an angel, but with a fading languor in her countenance, the ſtill life of melancholy, that ſeemed to borrow its ſhade from the object on which ſhe gazed.</p>
                        <p>There was a tear in her eye! the ſick man kiſſed it off in its bud, ſmiling through the dimneſs of his own!—when ſhe ſaw Mountford, ſhe crawled forward on the ground and claſped his knees; he raiſed her from the floor; ſhe threw her arms round his neck, and ſobbed out a ſpeech of thankfulneſs, eloquent beyond the power of language."</p>
                        <p>"Compoſe yourſelf, my love, ſaid the man on the bed; but he, whoſe goodneſs has cauſed that emotion, will pardon its effects."—"How is this, Mountford? ſaid I; what do I ſee? what muſt I do?"—"You ſee, replied the ſtranger, a wretch, ſunk in poverty, ſtarving in priſon, ſtretched on a ſick bed! but that is little:—there are his wife and children, wanting the bread which he has not to give them! Yet you cannot eaſily imagine the conſcious ſerenity of his mind; in the gripe of affliction, his heart ſwells with the pride of virtue! it can even look down with pity on the man whoſe cruelty has wrung it almoſt to burſting.

                        <p>"He promiſed me affluence in exchange for honour; and threatened miſery, as its attendant, if I kept it.

But his revenge was not thus to be diſappointed: in the little dealings of my trade I had contracted ſome debts, which he had made himſelf maſter of for my ruin; I was confined here at his ſuit, when not yet recovered from the wounds I had received; that dear woman, and theſe two boys, followed me, that we might ſtarve together; but Providence interpoſed, and ſent Mr. Mountford to our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: he was relieved my family from the gnawings of hunger, and reſcued me from death, to which a fever, conſequent on my wounds, and increaſed by the want of every neceſſary had nearly reduced me."</p>

                     <p>When I entered his apartment, I found him ſitting on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of thoughtful inſpiration. His look had always an open benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which commanded eſteem; there was now ſomething more—a gentle triumph in it.</p>
                     <p>He roſe, and met me with his uſual kindneſs. When I told him the good accounts I had from his Phyſician, "I am fooliſh enough ſaid he, to rely but little, in this inſtance, upon Phyſic: my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment may be falſe: but I think I feel myſelf approaching to my end, by ſteps ſo easy, that they woo me to approach it.</p>
                     <p>"There is a certain dignity in retiring from life at a time, when the infirmities of age have not ſapped our faculties. This world, my dear Charles, was a ſcene in which I never much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.

virtue. I look back on the tenor of my life, with the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſew great offences to account for. There are blemiſhes, I confeſs, which deform in ſome degree the picture. But I know the benignity of the Supreme Being, and rejoice at the thoughts of its exertion in my favour. My mind expands at the thought I ſhall enter into the ſociety of the bleſſed, wiſe as angels, with the ſimplicity of children." He had by this time claſped my hand, and found it wet by a tear which had juſt fallen on it.—His eye began to moiſten too—we ſat for ſome time ſilent.—At laſt, with an attempt to a look of more compoſure, "There are ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances (ſaid Harley) which riſe involuntarily on my heart, and make me almoſt wiſh to live.</p>
                     <p>"I have been bleſſed with a few friends, which redeem my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inion of mankind. I recollect the ſcenes of pleaſure! have paſſed among them with the tendereſt emotion; but we ſhall meet again, my friend, never to be ſeparated. There are ſome feelings which perhaps are too tender to be ſuffered by the world. The world is in general ſelfiſh, intereſted, and unthinking, and throws the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of romance or melancholy on every temper more ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than its own.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot think but in theſe regions which I contemplate, if there is any thing of mortality left about us, that theſe feelings will ſubſiſt;—they are called,—perhaps they are—weakneſſes here;—but there may be ſome better modifications of them in heaven, which may deſerve the name of virtues." He ſighed as he ſpoke theſe laſt words. He had ſcarcely finiſhed them, when the door opened, and his aunt appeared leading in Miſs Walton.</p>
                     <p>"My dear, ſays ſhe, here is Miſs Walton, who has been ſo kind as to come and inquire for you herſelf." I could obſerve a tranſient glow upon his face. He roſe from his ſeat—"If to know Miſs Walton's goodneſs, ſaid he, be a tittle to deſerve it, I have ſome claim." She begged him to reſume his ſeat, and placed herſelf on the ſofa beſide him. I took my leave. Mrs. Margery accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me to the door. He was left with Miſs Walton alone. She inquired anxiouſly about his health. "I believe ſaid he, from the accounts which my phyſicians unwillingly give me, that they have no great hopes of my recovery.—</p>
                     <p>She ſtarted as he ſpoke; but recollecting herſelf immediately, endeavoured to flatter him into a belief that his apprehenſions were groundleſs. "I know, ſaid he, that it is uſual with perſons at my time of life to have theſe hopes which your kindneſs ſuggeſts; but I would not wiſh to be deceived. To meet death as becomes a man, is a privilege beſtowed on few.—I would endeavour to make it mine;—nor do I think that I can ever be better prepared for it than now:—It is that chiefly which determines the fitneſs of its approach."—"Theſe ſentiments, anſwered Miſs Walton, are juſt: but your good ſenſe, Mr. Harley, will own that life has its proper value.—As the province of virtue, life is enobled; as
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:017579_0074_0FA12F432CA09368"/>
ſuch, it is to be deſired.—To virtue has the Supreme Director of all things aſſigned rewards enough, even here to fix its attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
                     <p>The ſubject began to overpower her.—Harlay lifted his eyes from the ground—"There are, ſaid he, in a very low voice, there are attachments, Miſs Walton"—His glance met her's—They both betrayed a confuſion, and were both inſtantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn—He pauſed ſome moments—"I am in ſuch a ſtate as calls for ſincerity, let that alſo excuſe it—It is perhaps the laſt time we ſhall ever meet. I feel ſomething particularly ſolemn in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, yet my heart ſwells to make it, awed as it is by a ſenſe of my preſumption, by a ſenſe of your perfections"—He pauſed again—"Let it not offend you to know their power over one ſo unworthy—It will, I believe, ſoon ceaſe to beat, even with that feeling which it ſhall loſe the lateſt.—To love Miſs Walton could not be a crime;—if to declare it is one—the expiation will be made."—Her tears were now flowing without controul.—"Let me intreat you, ſaid ſhe, to have better hopes—Let not life be ſo indifferent to you; if my wiſhes can put any value on it—I will not pretend to miſunderſtand you—I know your worth—I have known it long—I have eſteemed it—What would you have me ſay?—I have loved it as it deſerved."—He ſeized her hand—a languid colour reddened his cheek—a ſmile brightened faintly in his eye. As he gazed on her, it grew dim, it fixed, it cloſed—He ſighed, and fell back on his ſeat.—Miſs Walton ſcreamed at the ſight—His aunt and the ſervants ruſhed into the room—They found them lying motionleſs together.—His phyſician happened to call at that inſtant. Every art was tried to recover them—With Miſs Walton they ſucceeded—But Harley was gone for ever!</p>

                  <p>TO embelliſh with taſte the compoſitions of genius, is a talent which Bouſſeau poſſeſſes in a ſuperior degree: Whether, declaiming in ſtrains of the moſt ſublime eloquence, he walks the academic grove;—or, glowing with the enthuſiaſm of benevolence, he breaks aſunder the ſhackles of opinion;—or, ſeizing with the eye of fancy the true and the beautiful, he draws, with the hand of a maſter, nature in all her ſimplicity and elegance, <q>luxuriant yet modeſt, and true to virtue, though courted by the paſſions.</q>

His theme is ST. PREUX, paſſionate, vehement, tender, ſentimental,—making with Lord Anſon the tour of the globe, to recover his diſtracted mind by the view of the grandeſt ſight the eye of man can behold.—St. Preux, full of that noble elevation, that <hi>fiert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How comes it then that authors of high eſtimation complain that no kind of compoſition, ſince the revival of letters, has been leſs ſucceſsfully cultivated?

                  <p>IT is by no means intended to be inſinuated that the following elegy is of this kind.

Theſe are thrown together at the end to prevent the diſagreeable diſtraction which notes, at the foot of a page, eſpecially in poetry, are apt to occaſion.—For the reſt, the author is ſo far from apologizing for them, that with Mr. Addiſon<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                     </note>, though with infinitely more propriety, he wiſhes his excerpts and quotations may not make the only good part of his performance.</p>
                  <p>AND reſpecting the title of the Poem (for, at this time, even that will not eſcape without ſtricture) the author can only ſay, that the SENTIMENTAL SAILOR, hackney'd as the epithet may be thought of late to have been, appeared to him to give ſome ſort of idea of the nature of a performance which is not merely a love-elegy;—That had it been ſo, he muſt have little attended to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar genius which characterizes the perſonage whoſe ſingular ſituation is attempted to be deſcribed, marked as it is with ſuch originality by the Promethean hand of Rouſſeau:—And, laſtly, that a title, however unhappily choſen, can never detract from the merit of a Work, if indeed it has any.</p>
                  <p>IT has been ſaid that the ſtory of St. Preux and Eloiſa is abſurd, excentric, impoſſible. Let ſuch critics however remember that love is not a cold and inſipid galantry; but the ſtrongeſt, and when in deſpair, the moſt terrible of all the paſſions; putting the ſoul into tumults, and raiſing, not unfrequently, dreadful tempeſts in life; that under its powerful illuſion the mind creates to itſelf another univerſe, filled with objects, and ſurrounded with images that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt not but in imagination.—In fine, let them read the following beautiful paſſage of an author, whoſe knowledge of human nature will not be diſputed: <note n="*" place="bottom">

                           <p>"BESIDE the ebb and flood, there is a current or eddy in the Norway ſea called Maelſtrom, or Moſcoeſtrom.

                           <p>EVEN animals which have come too near to vortex have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the utmoſt terror when they find the ſtream irreſiſtible.

                     <p>"BESIDE the ebb and flood, there is a current or eddy in the Norway ſea called Maelſtrom, or Moſcoeſtrom. The iſland Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe, from whence this ſtream derives its name, lies between the mountain Heſleggin in Lofoden and the iſland Ver, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one league diſtant; and between the iſland and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſo ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as not to afford paſſage for a ſmall ſhip. When it is flood, the ſtream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moſcoe with a hoiſterous rapidity; and when it is ebb, returns to the ſea, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it, it is immediately drawn irreſiſtibly into the whirl, and then diſappears; being abſorbed and carried down to the bottom in a moment, where it is daſhed to pieces againſt the rocks: and juſt at the return of ebb and flood, when the water becomes ſtill for about a quarter of an hour, it riſes again in ſcattered fragments ſcarcely to be known for the parts of a ſhip. When it is agitated by a ſtorm, it has reached veſſels at the diſtance of more than a Norway mile, where the crews have thought themſelves in perfect ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>PERHAPS it is hardly in the power of fancy to conceive a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more horror than of being thus driven forward, by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violence of an impetuous torrent, to the vortex of a whirlpool, of which the noiſe and turbulence ſtill encreaſing as it is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are an earneſt of quick and inevitable deſtruction; while the wretched victims in an agony of deſpair and terror, cry out for that help which they know to be impoſſible, and ſee before them the dreadful abyſs into which they are about to be plunged and daſhed againſt the rocks at the bottom.</p>
                     <p>EVEN animals which have come too near to vortex have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the utmoſt terror when they find the ſtream irreſiſtible. Whales are frequently carried away; and the moment they feel the force of the water, they ſtruggle againſt it with all their might, howling and bellowing in a frightful manner. The like happens frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bears, who attempt to ſwim to the iſland to prey upon the ſheep.</p>
                     <p>IT is the opinion of Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cher that the Maelſtrom is a ſea-vortex which attracts the flood under the ſhore of Norway, and diſcharges it again into the gulf of Bothnia: But this opinion is now known to be erroneous by the return of the ſhattered fragments of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happens to be ſucked down by it.
