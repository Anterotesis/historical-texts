            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I ≈øtopped and cried Hem! The Curate is fatter than me; he wiped the ≈øweat from his brow.</p>
                  <p>There is no ≈øtate where one is apter to pau≈øe and look round them, than after ≈øuch a di≈øappointment. Nay, it is even ≈øo in life.

                  <p>I looked round with ≈øome ≈øuch grave apothegm in my mind, when I di≈øcovered, for the fir≈øt time, a venerable looking pile, to which the inclo≈øure belonged.

                     <head>CHAP. XII. Of worldly intere≈øts.</head>
                     <p>THERE are certain intere≈øts which the world ≈øuppo≈øes every man to have, and which therefore are properly enough term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worldly; but the world is apt to make an erroneous e≈øtimate: ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the di≈øpo≈øitions which con≈øtitute our happine≈øs or misery, they bring to an undi≈øtingui≈øhed ≈øcale the means of the one, as connected with power, wealth, or grandeur, and of the other with their contraries. Philo≈øophers and poets have often prote≈øted again≈øt this deci≈øion: but their arguments have been de≈øpi≈øed as declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or ridiculed as romantic.</p>
                     <p>There are never wanting to a young man ≈øome grave and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent friends to ≈øet him right in this particular, if he need it: to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Harley did not want for ≈øome monitors of this fort. He was frequently told of men, who≈øe fortunes enabled them to command all the luxuries of life, who≈øe fortunes were of their own acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; his envy was endeavoured to be excited by a de≈øcription of their happine≈øs, and his emulation by a recital of the means which had procured it.</p>
                     <p>Harley was too apt to hear the≈øe lectures with indifference; nay ≈øometimes they got the better of his temper; and as the in≈øtances were not always amiable, provoked, on his part, ≈øome reflections, which I am per≈øuaded his good nature would el≈øe have avoided.</p>

I do not mean, however, to in≈øinuate this to have been the ca≈øe with Harley; on the contrary, if we might rely on his own te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the conceptions he had of pomp and grandeur, ≈øerved to endear the ≈øtate which Providence had a≈ø≈øigned him.</p>
                     <p>He lo≈øt his father, the la≈øt ≈øurviving of his parents, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related, when he was a boy. The good man, from a fear of offending, as well as a regard to his ≈øon, named him a variety of tutors; one con≈øequence of which was, that they ≈øeldom met to con≈øider of their pupil's affairs at all; and that when they did meet, their opinions were ≈øo oppo≈øite, that the only method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation po≈ø≈øible, was the mediatory power of a dinner and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which commonly interrupted, not ended, the di≈øpute; and after that interruption cea≈øed, left the con≈øulting parties in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017579_0008_0FA12F0A4EBAF730"/>
not very proper for adju≈øting it. His education therefore had been but indifferently attended to; and after being taken from a country ≈øchool, at which he had been boarded, the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ≈øuffered to be his own ma≈øter in the ≈øub≈øequent branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of literature, with ≈øome a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from the par≈øon of the pari≈øh in languages and philo≈øophy, and from the exci≈øeman in arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and book-keeping. One of his tutors indeed, who, in his youth, had been an inhabitant of the Temple, ≈øet him to read Coke upon Littleton; a book which is very properly put into the hands of beginners in that ≈øcience, as its ≈øimplicity is accomodated to their under≈øtandings, and its ≈øize to their inclination. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited but little by the peru≈øal; but it was not without its u≈øe in the family: for his maiden aunt applied it commonly to the laudable purpo≈øe of pre≈ø≈øing her rebellious linens to the folds ≈øhe had allotted them.</p>
                     <p>There were particularly two means of increa≈øing his fortune, which might have occurred to people of le≈øs fore≈øight than tho≈øe coun≈øellors we have mentioned. One of the≈øe was the expectation of ≈øucceeding to an old lady, a di≈øtant relation of Harley's, who was known to be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a very large ≈øum in the ≈øtocks: but in this their hopes were di≈øappointed; for the young man was ≈øo untoward in his di≈øpo≈øition, that, notwith≈øtanding the in≈øtructions he daily received, his vi≈øits rather tended to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

He ≈øometimes looked grave when the old lady told the jokes of her youth; he often refu≈øed to eat when ≈øhe pre≈ø≈øed him, and was ≈øeldom or never provided with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or liquorice when ≈øhe was ≈øeized with a fit of coughing: nay, he had once the rudene≈øs to fall a≈øleep, while ≈øhe was de≈øcribing the compo≈øition and virtues of her favourite cholic water. In ≈øhort, he accommodated him≈øelf ≈øo ill to her humour, that ≈øhe died, and did not leave him a farthing.</p>
                     <p>The other method pointed out to him was, an endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>In ≈øome of their letters, therefore, which he received ≈øoon after, they expre≈ø≈øed their ≈øurpri≈øe at his not having been more urgent in his application, and again recommended the blu≈øhle≈øs a≈ø≈øiduity of ≈øuce≈øsful merit.</p>
                     <p>He re≈øolved to make another attempt at the baronet's; fortified with higher notions of his own dignity, and with le≈øs apprehen≈øion of a repul≈øe. In his way to Gro≈øvenor-≈øquare he began to ruminate on the folly of mankind, who affixed tho≈øe ideas of ≈øuperiority to riches, which reduced the minds of men, by nature equal with the more fortunate, to that ≈øort of ≈øervility which he felt in his own. By the time he had reached the Square, and was walking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>It is probable, however, that the premi≈øes had been improperly formed; for it is certain, that when he approached the great man's door, he felt his heart agitated by an unu≈øual pul≈øation.</p>
                     <p>He had almo≈øt reached it, when he ob≈øerved a young gentleman coming out, dre≈ø≈øed in a white frock, and a red-laced wai≈øtcoat, with a ≈ømall ≈øwitch in his hand, which he ≈øeemed to manage with a particular good grace. As he pa≈ø≈øed him on the ≈øteps, the ≈øtranger very politely made him a bow, which Harley returned, though he could not remember ever having ≈øeen him before.

Harley thanked him for his information; and was turning from the door, when the other ob≈øerved, that it would be proper to leave his name, and very obligingly knocked for that purpo≈øe. "Here is a gentleman, Tom, who meant to have waited on your ma≈øter."</p>
                     <p>"Your name, if your plea≈øe, Sir?" "Harley.‚ÄîYou'll remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Tom, Harley.‚ÄîThe door was ≈øhut. "Since we are here, ≈øaid he, we ≈øhall not lo≈øe our walk, if we add a little to it by a turn or two in Hyde<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Park." He accompanied this propo≈øal with a ≈øecond bow, and Harley accepted of it by another in return:</p>
                     <p>The conver≈øation, as they walked, was brilliant on the ≈øide of his companion. The playhou≈øe, the opera, with every occurrence in high-life, he ≈øeemed perfectly ma≈øter of; and talked of ≈øome reigning beauties of quality, in a manner the mo≈øt feeling in the world. Harley admired the happine≈øs of his vivacity; and, though it was oppo≈øite to the re≈øervedne≈øs of his own nature, began to be much plea≈øed with its effects.</p>
                     <p>Though I am not of opinion with ≈øome wi≈øe men, that the exi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of objects depends on idea; yet, I am convinced, that their appearance is not a little influenced by it.

                     <p>When they had fini≈øhed their walk, and were returning by the corner of the Park, they ob≈øerved a board hung out of a window, ≈øignifying, "An excellent ORDINARY Saturdays and Sundays."

Harley made no objection; and the ≈øtranger ≈øhewed him the way into the parlour.</p>
                     <p>He was placed, by the curte≈øy of his introductor, in an armed chair that ≈øtood at one ≈øide of the fire.

                     <p>When the grazier and he were gone, Harley turned to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining man of the company, and a≈øked him, if he knew that young gentleman? "A gentleman! ≈øaid he; ay, he is one of your gentlemen at the top of an affidavit.

At la≈øt, ≈øome of the great folks, to whom he had been ≈øerviceable in both capacities, had him made a gauger; in which ≈øtation he ≈øtill remains, and has the a≈ø≈øurance to pretend an acquaintance with men of quality.

                     <p>He led them next to that quarter where tho≈øe re≈øide, who, as they are not dangerous to them≈øelves or others, enjoy a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of freedom, according to the ≈ølate of their di≈øtemper.</p>
                     <p>Harley had fallen behind his companions, looking at a man, who was making pendulums with bits of thread, and little balls of clay. He had delineated a ≈øegment of a circle on the wall with chalk, and marked their different vibrations, by inter≈øecting it with cro≈øs lines.</p>
                     <p>A decent-looking man came up, and ≈ømiling at the maniac, turned to Harley, and told him, that gentleman had once been a very celebrated mathematician. "He fell a ≈øacrifice, ≈øaid he, to the theory of comets; for, after having, with infinite labour, formed a table on the conjectures of Sir I≈øaac Newton, he was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in the return of one of tho≈øe luminaries, and was very ≈øoon after obliged to be placed here by his friends.

Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley bowed, and accepted of his offer.</p>
                     <p>The next per≈øon they came up to had ≈øcrawled a variety of fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures on a piece of ≈ølate. Harley had the curio≈øity to take a nearer view of them. They con≈øi≈øted of different columns, a-top of which were marked South Sea annuities, India ≈øtock, and Three per cent. annuities con≈øol. "This, ≈øaid Harley's in≈øtructor, was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well known in Change-Alley.</p>
                     <p>He was once worth fifty thou≈øand pounds, and had actually agreed for the purcha≈øe of an e≈øtate in the we≈øt, in order to realize his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but he quarrelled with the proprietor about the repairs of the garden wall, and ≈øo returned to town to follow his old trade of ≈øtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobbing a little longer; when an unlucky fluctuation of ≈øtock, in which, he was engaged to an immen≈øe extent, reduced him at once to poverty and to madne≈øs.</p>

                     <p>"It is a ≈øpondee, and I will maintain it," interrupted a voice on his left hand. This a≈ø≈øertion was followed by a very rapid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of ≈øome ver≈øes from Home<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"In this the expectations of his friends were more con≈øulted than his own inclination; for both his brother and he had feelings of that warm ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"The younger, from the gentlene≈øs of his nature, bore with patience a ≈øituation entirely di≈øcordant to his genius and di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At times, indeed, his pride would ≈øugge≈øt, of how little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance tho≈øe talents were, which the partiality of his friends had often extolled: they were now incumbrances in a walk of life where the dull and the ignorant pa≈ø≈øed him at every turn; his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and his feeling, were invincible ob≈øtacles to eminence in a ≈øitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, where his fancy had no room for exertion, and his feeling experienced perpetual di≈øgu≈øt.</p>
                     <p>"But the≈øe murmurings he never ≈øuffered to be heard; and that he might not offend the prudence of tho≈øe who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the choice of his profe≈ø≈øion, he continued to labour in it for ≈øeveral years, till, by the death of a relation, he fell into an e≈øtate of little better than 100<hi>l,</hi> a year, with which, and the ≈ømall patrimony left him by his father, he retired into the country, and made a love-match with a young lady of a temper ≈øimilar to his own.</p>
                     <p>"But his elder brother, whom you are to ≈øee at ≈øupper, if you will do us the favour of your company, was naturally impetuous, deci≈øive, and overbearing. He entered into life with tho≈øe ardent expectations which young men are commonly deluded by: in his friend≈øhips, warm to exce≈øs; and equally violent in his di≈ølikes.

He was on the brink of marriage with a young lady, when one of tho≈øe friends, for who≈øe honour he would have pawned his life, made an elopement with this very godde≈øs; and left him be≈øides deeply engaged for ≈øums which his extravagance had ≈øquandered.</p>
                     <p>"The dreams he had formerly enjoyed were now changed for ideas of a very different nature. He abjured all confidence in any thing of human form; ≈øold his lands in the country, which ≈øtill produced him a very large rever≈øion, came to town, and immured him≈øelf with a woman who had been his nur≈øe, in little better than a garret; and has ever ≈øince applied his talents to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vilifying of his ≈øpecies.</p>
                     <p>"One thing I mu≈øt take the liberty to in≈øtruct you in; however different your ≈øentiments may be (and different they mu≈øt be) you will ≈øuffer him to go on without contradiction; otherwi≈øe he will be ≈øilent immediately, and we ≈øhall not be able to get a word from him all the night after."</p>
                     <p>Harley promi≈øed to remember this injunction, and accepted the invitation of his friend.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the hou≈øe, they were informed that the gentleman was already come, and had been ≈øhewn into the parlour. They found him ≈øitting with a daughter of his friend's, about three years old, on his knee, whom he was teaching the alphabet from a horn-book: at a little di≈øtance ≈øtood a ≈øi≈øter of hers, ≈øome years older.</p>
                     <p>"Get you away, Mi≈øs, ≈øaid he to this la≈øt, you are a pert go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øip, and I will have nothing to do with you."

                     <p>Betwixt that and ≈øupper-time he did not utter a ≈øyllable. When ≈øupper came, he quarrelled with every di≈øh at table, but eat of them all; only exempting from his cen≈øures a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Harley could not help ≈øtealing a look of ≈øurprize at him; but his friend, who knew his humour, returned it, by annihilating his pre≈øence in the like manner, and, leaving him to his own medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, addre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf entirely to Harley.</p>
                     <p>In their di≈øcour≈øe ≈øome mention happened to be made of an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character, and the words <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>politene≈øs</hi> were applied to it.

Harley, interrupting him, I would much rather enter it than the mo≈øt celebrated tavern in town: to give to the nece≈ø≈øitous, may ≈øometimes be a weakne≈øs in the man; to encourage indu≈øtry, is a duty in the citizen." They entered the hou≈øe accordingly.</p>

                     <p>My mother's books were left behind at the different quarters we removed to, and my reading was principally confined to plays, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and tho≈øe poetical de≈øcriptions of the beauty of virtue and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which the circulating libraries ea≈øily afforded.</p>
                     <p>"As I was generally reckoned hand≈øome, and the quickne≈øs of my parts extolled by all our vi≈øitors, my father had a pride in ≈øhewing me to the world. I was young, giddy, open to adulation, and vain of tho≈øe talents which acquired it.</p>
                     <p>"After the la≈øt war, my father was reduced to half-pay; with which we retired to a village in the country, which the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ≈øome genteel families who re≈øided in it, and the cheapne≈øs of living, particularly recommended. My father rented a ≈ømall hou≈øe, with a piece of ground ≈øufficient to keep a hor≈øe for him, and a cow for the benefit of his family.</p>
                     <p>"An old man ≈øervant managed his ground; while a maid, who had formerly been my mother's, and had ≈øince been mine, undertook the care of our little dairy: they were a≈ø≈øi≈øted in each of their provinces by my father and me, and we pa≈ø≈øed our time in a ≈øtate of tranquillity, which he had always talked of with delight, and my train of reading had taught me to admire.</p>
                     <p>"Though I had never ≈øeen the polite circles of the metropolis, the company my father had introduced me into had given me a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of good-breeding, which ≈øoon di≈øcovered a ≈øuperiority over the young ladies of our village. I was quoted as an example of politene≈øs, and my company courted by mo≈øt of the con≈øiderable families in the neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>"Among≈øt the hou≈øes where I was frequently invited, was Sir George Winbrook's.

"Some months after our fir≈øt acquaintance, Sir George's elde≈øt ≈øon came home from his travels. His figure, his addre≈øs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation, were not unlike tho≈øe warm ideas of an accompli≈øhed man which my favourite novels had taught me to form; and his ≈øentiments, on the article of religion, were as liberal as my own: when any of the≈øe happened to be the topic of our di≈øcour≈øe, I, who before had been ≈øilent, from a fear of being ≈øingle in oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now kindled at the fire he rai≈øed, and defended our mutual opinions with all the eloquence I was mi≈øtre≈øs of.</p>
                     <p>"He was commonly re≈øpectfully attentive all the while; and when I had ended, would rai≈øe his eyes from the ground, look at me with a gaze of admiration, and expre≈øs his applau≈øe in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ≈øtrain of encomium. This was an incen≈øe the more plea≈øing, as I ≈øeldom or never had met with it before; for the young gentlemen who vi≈øited Sir George were for the mo≈øt part of that athletic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the plea≈øure of who≈øe lives is derived from fox-hunting: the≈øe are ≈øeldom ≈øolicitous to plea≈øe the women at all; or if they were, would never think of applying their flattery to the mind.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Winbrooke ob≈øerved the weakne≈øs of my ≈øoul, and took every occa≈øion of improving the e≈øteem he had gained. He a≈øked my opinion of every author, of every ≈øentiment, with that ≈øubmi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive diffidence, which ≈øhewed an unlimited confidence, in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding. I ≈øaw my≈øelf reverend, as a ≈øuperior ≈øort of being, by one who≈øe judgment my vanity told me was not likely to err; preferred by him to all the other vi≈øitors of my ≈øex, who≈øe ≈øuperior fortunes and rank ≈øhould have entitled them to a much higher degree of notice, I ≈øaw their little jealou≈øies at the di≈øtingui≈øhed attention he paid me; it was gratitude, it was pride, it was love!

                     <p>"At length, however, he took an opportunity of declaring his love: he now expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in ≈øuch ardent terms, that prudence might have ≈øu≈øpected their ≈øincerity; but prudence is rarely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"In ≈øhort, Mr. Harley, (for I tire you with a relation, the cata≈øtrophe of which you will already have imagined) I fell a prey to his artifices.

                     <p>"I read this letter a hundred times over.

"Calmly, my dear Sir, ≈øaid Harley, did you know by what complicated misfortunes ≈øhe has fallen to that mi≈øerable ≈øtate in which you now behold her, I ≈øhould have no need of words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your compa≈ø≈øion.

                     <p>Harley undertook her cau≈øe: he related the treacheries to which ≈øhe had fallen a ≈øacrifice, and again ≈øolicited the forgivene≈øs of her father. He looked on her for ≈øome time in ≈øilence; the pride of a ≈øoldier's honour checked for a while the yearnings of his heart: but nature at la≈øt prevailed, he fell on her neck, and mingled his tears with hers.

                     <p>"Pardon me, young gentleman, ≈øaid Atkins, I fear my pa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wronged you."</p>
                     <p>"Never, never, Sir, ≈øaid Harley; if it had, your reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your daughter were an atonement a thou≈øand fold." He then repeated his reque≈øt that he might be allowed to conduct them to his lodgings, to which Mr. Atkins at la≈øt con≈øented.</p>
                     <p>He took his daughter's arm, "Come, my Emily, ≈øaid he, we can never, never recover that happine≈øs we have lo≈øt; but time may teach us to remember our misfortunes with patience."</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the hou≈øe where Harley lodged, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the fir≈øt floor was then vacant, and that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his daughter might be accommodated there. While he was upon this inquiry, Mi≈øs Atkins informed her father more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what ≈øhe owed to his benevolence. When he returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room where they were, Atkins ran and embraced him; begged him again to forgive the offence he had given him, and made the warme≈øt prote≈øtations of gratitude for his favours. We would attempt to de≈øcribe the joy which Harley felt on this occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did it not occur to us, that one half of the world could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand it though we did; and the other half will, by this time, have under≈øtood it without any de≈øcription at all.</p>
                     <p>Mi≈øs Atkins now retired to her chamber, to take ≈øome re≈øt from the violence of the≈øe emotions ≈øhe had ≈øuffered. When ≈øhe was gone, her father, addre≈ø≈øing him≈øelf to Harley, ≈øaid, "You have a right, Sir. to be informed of the pre≈øent ≈øituation of one who

owes ≈øo much to your compa≈ø≈øion for his misfortunes. My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I find has informed you what that was at the fatal period when they began.</p>
                     <p>Her di≈øtre≈ø≈øes you have heard, you have pitied as they de≈øerved; mine perhaps I cannot ≈øo ea≈øily make you acquainted with. You have a feeling heart, Mr. Harley; I ble≈øs it that it has ≈øaved my child; but you never were a father; a father torn by that mo≈øt dreadful of calamities, the di≈øhonour of a child he doated on! You have been already informed of ≈øome of the circum≈øtances of her elopement.</p>
                     <p>I was then from home, called by the death of a relation, who, though he would never advance me a ≈øhilling on the utmo≈øt exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his life-time, left me all the gleanings of his frugality at his death. I would not write this intelligence to my daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I intended to be the bearer of the news my≈øelf; and ≈øoon as my bu≈øine≈øs would allow me, I ≈øet out on my return, winged with all the ha≈øte of paternal affection. I fondly built tho≈øe ≈øchemes of future happine≈øs, which the flattery of pre≈øent pro≈øperity is ever bu≈øy to ≈øugge≈øt: my Emily was concerned in them all.</p>
                     <p>As I approached our little dwelling, my heart throbbed with the anticipation of joy and welcome. I imagined the cheering ≈øire, the bli≈øsful contentment of a frugal meal, made luxurious by a daughter's ≈ømiles: I painted to my≈øelf her ≈øurprize at the tidings of our new-acquired riches, our fond di≈øputes about the di≈øpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"The road was ≈øhortened by the dreams of happine≈øs I enjoyed, and it began to de dark as I reached the hou≈øe: I alighted from my hor≈øe, and walked ≈øoftly up ≈øtairs to the room we commonly ≈øat in. I was ≈øomewhat di≈øappointed at not finding my daughter there. I rung the bell; her maid appeared, and ≈øhewed no ≈ømall ≈øigns of wonder at the ≈øummons. She ble≈ø≈øed her≈øelf as ≈øhe entered the room: I ≈ømiled at her ≈øurprize. "Where is Mi≈øs Emily, Sir?" ≈øaid ≈øhe, "Emily!" "Yes, Sir; ≈øhe has been gone from hence ≈øome days, upon receipt of the≈øe letters you ≈øent her." "Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!" ≈øaid I.

                     <p>All this afforded ample fund for conver≈øation, if conver≈øation it might, be called, that was carried on ≈øolely by the before-mentioned lady, nobody offering to interrupt her, except that the officer ≈øometimes ≈øignified his approbation by a variety of oaths, a ≈øort of phra≈øeology he ≈øeemed extremely conver≈øant in.</p>
                     <p>She appealed indeed frequently to her hu≈øband as to the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of certain facts, which the good man as often prote≈øted his entire ignorance of; but as he was always called fool, or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very like it, for his pains, he at la≈øt contrived to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the credit of his wife without prejudice to his con≈øcience, and ≈øignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his a≈ø≈øent by a noi≈øe not unlike the grunting of that animal which in ≈øhape and fatne≈øs he ≈øomewhat re≈øembled. The hou≈øe-keeper, and the old gentleman who ≈øat next to Harley, were now
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017579_0045_0FA12F29AC608110"/>
ob≈øerved to be fa≈øt a≈øleep; at which the lady, who had been at ≈øuch pains to entertain them, muttered ≈øome words of di≈øplea≈øure, and, upon the officer's whi≈øpering to ≈ømoak the old put, both ≈øhe and her hu≈øband pur≈øed up their mouths into a contemptuous ≈ømile, Harley looked ≈øternly on the grocer: "You are come, Sir, ≈øaid he, to tho≈øe years when you might have learned ≈øome reverence for age: as for this young man, who has ≈øo lately e≈øcaped from the nur≈øery, he may be allowed to divert him≈øelf." "Dam'me, Sir, ≈øaid the officer, do you call me young?" ≈øtriking up the front of his hat, and ≈øtretching forward on his ≈øeat, till his face almo≈øt touched Harley's. It is probable, however, that he di≈øcovered ≈øomething there which tended to pacify him; for, on the lady's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them not to quarrel, he very ≈øoon re≈øumed his po≈øture and calmne≈øs together, and was rather le≈øs profu≈øe of his oaths during the re≈øt of the journey. It is po≈ø≈øible the old gentleman had waked time enough to hear the la≈øt part of this di≈øcour≈øe; at lea≈øt (whether from that cau≈øe, or that he too was a phy≈øiognomi≈øt) he wore a look remarkably complacent to Harley, who, on his part, ≈øhewed a particular ob≈øervance of him: indeed they had ≈øoon a better opportunity of making their acquaintance, as the coach arrived that night at the town where the officer's regiment lay, and the places of de≈øtination of their other fellow-travellers, it ≈øeems, were at no great di≈øtance; for next morning the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and Harley were the only pa≈ø≈øengers remaining.</p>
                     <p>When they left the inn in the morning, Harley, pulling out a little pocket book, began to examine the contents, and make ≈øome corrections with a pencil. "This, ≈øaid he, turning to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, is an amu≈øement I ≈øometimes pa≈øs idle hours at an inn with: the≈øe are quotations from tho≈øe humble poets, who tru≈øt their fame to the brittle tenure of windows and drinking-gla≈ø≈øes."</p>
                     <p>"From our inns, returned the gentleman, a ≈øtranger might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we were a nation of poets; machines at lea≈øt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained with the motion of a journey emptied of their contents: is it from the vanity of being thought men of genius, or a mere mechanical imitation of the cu≈øtom of others, that we are led to ≈øcrawl rhime upon ≈øuch places?"</p>
                     <p>"Whether vanity is the cau≈øe of our becoming rhime≈øters or not, an≈øwered Harley, it is a pretty certain effect of it. An old man of my acquaintance, who deals in apophthegms, u≈øed to ≈øay, That he had known few men without envy, few wits without ill-nature, and no poet without vanity; and I believe his remark is a pretty ju≈øt one: vanity has been immemorially the charter of poets. In this the ancients were more hone≈øt than we are; the old poets fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make boa≈øtful predictions of the immortality their works ≈øhall acquire them; ours, in their dedications and prefatory di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes, employ much eloquence to prai≈øe their patrons, with much ≈øeeming mode≈øty to condemn them≈øelves, or at lea≈øt to apologize for their productions to the world: but this, in my opinion, is the mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuming manner of the two; for of all the garbs, I ever

≈øaw pride put on, that of her humility is to me the mo≈øt di≈øgu≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <p>"It is natural enough for a poet to be vain, ≈øaid the ≈øtranger: the little worlds which he rai≈øes, the in≈øpiration which he claims, may ea≈øily be productive of ≈øelf-importance; though that in≈øpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fabulous, it brings on egoti≈øm, which is always the parent of vanity."</p>
                     <p>"It may be ≈øuppo≈øed, an≈øwered Harley, that in≈øpiration of old was an article of religious faith; in modern times it may be tran≈ølated a propen≈øity to compo≈øe; and I believe it is not always mo≈øt readily found where the poets have fixed its re≈øidence, amid≈øt groves and plains, and the ≈øcenes of pa≈øtoral retirement. The mind may be there unb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"There is at lea≈øt, ≈øaid the ≈øtranger, one advantage in the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inclination, that it is an incentive to philanthrophy. There is a certain poetical ground, on which a man cannot tread without feelings that enlarge the heart, the cau≈øes of human depravity vani≈øh before the romantic enthu≈øia≈øm he profe≈øtes; and many who are not able to reach the Parna≈ø≈øian heights, may yet approach ≈øo near as to be bettered by the air of the climate."</p>
                     <p>"I have always thought ≈øo, replied Harley; but this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with the prudent again≈øt it: they urge the danger of unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs for the world."</p>
                     <p>"I allow it, returned the other; but I believe it is not always rightfully imputed to the bent for poetry: this is only one effect of the common cau≈øe.‚ÄîJack, ≈øays his father, is indeed no ≈øcholar; nor could all the drubbings from his ma≈øter ever bring him one bit forward in his grammar or his ≈øyntax: but I intend him for a merchant.‚ÄîAllow the ≈øame indulgence to Tom.‚Äî</p>
                     <p>"Tom reads Virgil and Horace when he ≈øhould be ca≈øting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; and but t'other day he pawned his great coat for an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Shake≈øpeare.‚ÄîBut Tom would have been as he is, though Virgil and Horace had never been born, though Shake≈øpeare had died a link boy; for his nur≈øe will tell you, that when he was a child, he broke his rattle, to di≈øcover what it was that ≈øounded within it; and burnt the ≈øticks of his go-cart, becau≈øe le liked to ≈øee the ≈øparkling of timber in the fire.‚Äî</p>
                     <p>"It is a ≈øad ca≈øe; but what is to be done?‚ÄîWhy Jack ≈øhall grow rich, dine on veni≈øon, and drink claret.‚ÄîAy, but Tom‚ÄîTom ≈øhall dine with his brother, when his pride will let him; at other times, he ≈øhall ble≈øs God over a half-pint of ale and a Wel≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbit; and both ≈øhall go to heaven as they may.‚ÄîThat's a poor pro≈øpect for Tom, ≈øays the father.‚ÄîTo go to heaven! I cannot agree with him."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps, ≈øaid Harley, we now a-days di≈øcourage the romantic turn a little too much. Our boys are prudent too ≈øoon. Mi≈øtake

                     <p>"The immen≈øe riches acquired by individuals has erected a ≈øtandard of ambition, de≈øtructive of private morals, and of public virtue. The weakne≈øses of vice are left us; but the mo≈øt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of our failings we are taught to de≈øpi≈øe. Love, the pa≈ø≈øion mo≈øt natural to the ≈øen≈øibility of youth, has lo≈øt the plaintive digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, for the unmeaning ≈øimper of a dangling cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb; and the only ≈øerious concern, that of a dowry, is ≈øettled, even among≈øt the beardle≈øs leaders of the dancing-≈øchool The Frivolous and the Intere≈øted (might a ≈øatyri≈øt ≈øay) are the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtical features of the age; they are vi≈øible even in the e≈ø≈øays of our philo≈øophers.</p>
                     <p>"They laugh at the pedantry of our fathers, who complained of the times in which they lived; they are at pains to per≈øuade us how much the≈øe were deceived; they pride them≈øelves in defending things as they find them, and in exploding the barren ≈øounds which had been reared into motives for action.

                     <p>WHEN the ≈øtage coach arrived at the place of its de≈øtination, Harley began to con≈øider how he ≈øhould proceed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his journey. He was very civilly acco≈øted by the ma≈øter of the inn where he alighted, who offered to accomodate him either with a po≈øt-chai≈øe or hor≈øes, to any di≈øtance he had a

mind: but as he did things frequently in a way different from what other people call natural, he refu≈øed the≈øe offers, and ≈øet out immediately a foot, having fir≈øt put a ≈øpare ≈øhirt in his pocket, and given directions for the forwarding of his portmanteau.</p>
                     <p>This was a method of travelling which he was accu≈øtomed to take; it ≈øaved the trouble of provi≈øion for any animal but him≈øelf, and left him at liberty to choo≈øe his quarters, either at an inn, or at the fir≈øt cottage in which he ≈øaw a face he liked: nay, when he was not peculiarly attracted by the rea≈øonable creation, he would ≈øometimes con≈øort with a ≈øpecies of an inferior rank, and lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf down to ≈øleep by the ≈øide of a rock, or on the banks of a rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. He did few things without a motive, but his motives were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eccentric; and the u≈øeful and expedient were terms which he held to be very indefinite, and which therefore he did not always apply to the ≈øen≈øe they are commonly under≈øtood in.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øun was now in his decline, and the evening remarkably ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, when he entered a hollow part of the road, which winded between the ≈øurrounding banks, and ≈øeamed the ≈øward in different lines, as the choice of travellers had directed them to tread it. It ≈øeemed to be little frequented now, for ≈øome of the≈øe had partly recovered their former verdure. The ≈øcene was ≈øuch as induced Harley to ≈øtand and enjoy it; when, turning round, his notice was attracted by an object, which the fixture of his eye on the ≈øpot he walked had before prevented him from ob≈øerving.</p>
                     <p>An old man, who from his dre≈øs ≈øeemed to have been a ≈øoldier, lay fa≈øt a≈øleep on the ground; a knap≈øack was re≈øted on a ≈øtone at his right hand, while his ≈øtaff and bra≈øs hilted ≈øword were cro≈ø≈øed at his left.</p>
                     <p>Harley looked on him with the mo≈øt earne≈øt attention. He was one of tho≈øe figures which Salvator would have drawn; nor was the ≈øurrounding ≈øcenery unlike the wildne≈øs of that painter's back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds. The banks on each ≈øide were covered with fanta≈øtic ≈øhrub-wood, and at a little di≈øtance, on the top of one of them, ≈øtood a finger po≈øt, to mark the directions of two roads which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verged from the point where it was placed. A rock, with ≈øome dangling wild flowers, jutted out above where the ≈øoldier lay, on which grew the ≈øtump of a large tree, white with age, and a ≈øingle twi≈øted branch ≈øhaded his face as he ≈ølept. His face had the marks of manly comeline≈øs impaired by time; his forehead was not altogether bald, but its hairs might have been numbered; while a few white locks behind cro≈ø≈øed the brown of his neck with a contra≈øt the mo≈øt venerable to a mind like Harley's.</p>
                     <p>"Thou art old, ≈øaid he to him≈øelf, but age has not brought thee re≈øt for its infirmities; I fear the≈øe ≈øilver hairs have not found ≈øhelter from thy country, though that neck has been bronzed in its ≈øervice." The ≈øtranger waked. He looked on Harley with the appearance of ≈øome confu≈øion: it was a pain which he knew too well to think of cau≈øing in another; he turned and went on. The old man re-adju≈øted his knap≈øack, and fellowed in one of the tracts on the oppo≈øite ≈øide of the road.</p>

When Harley heard the tread of his feet behind him, he could not help ≈øtealing back a glance at his fellow-traveller. He ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bend under the weight of his knap≈øack: he halted on his walk, and one of his arms was ≈øupported by a ≈øling, and lay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionle≈øs acro≈øs his brea≈øt. He had that ≈øteady look of ≈øorrow which indicates that its owner has gazed upon his griefs till he has forgotten to lament them; yet not without tho≈øe ≈øtreaks of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, which a good mind will ≈øometimes throw into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, through all the incumbent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>He had now advanced nearer to Harley, and, with an uncertain ≈øort of voice, begged to know what it was o'clock; "I fear, ≈øaid he, ≈øleep has beguiled me of my time, and I ≈øhall hardly have light enough left to carry me to the end of my journey." "Father! ≈øaid Harley, (who by this time ≈øound the romantic enthu≈øia≈øm ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing within him) how far do you mean to go!" "But a little way, Sir, returned the other; and indeed it is but a little way I can manage now: it is ju≈øt four miles from the height to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage where I am going." "I am going there too, ≈øaid Harley; we may make the road ≈øhorter to one another. You ≈øeem to have ≈øerved your country, Sir, to have ≈øerved it hardly too; it is a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have the highe≈øt e≈øteem for.‚ÄîI would not be impertinently inqui≈øitive; but there is that in your appearance which excites my curio≈øity to know ≈øomething more of you: in the mean time ≈øuffer me to carry that knap≈øack."</p>
                     <p>The old man gazed on him; a tear ≈øtood in his eye! "Young gentleman, ≈øaid he, you are too good; may heaven ble≈øs you for an old man's ≈øake, who has nothing but his ble≈ø≈øing to give! but my knap≈øack is ≈øo familiar to my ≈øhoulders, that I ≈øhould walk the wor≈øe for wanting it; and it would be trouble≈øome to you, who have not been u≈øed to its weight." "Far from it, an≈øwered Harley, I ≈øhould tread the lighter; it would be the mo≈øt honourable badge I ever wore."</p>
                     <p>"Sir, ≈øaid the ≈øtranger, who had looked earne≈øtly in Harley's face during the la≈øt part of his di≈øcour≈øe, is not your name Harley?" "It is, replied he; I am a≈øhamed to ≈øay I have forgotten your's." "You may well have forgotten my face, ≈øaid the ≈øtranger, it is a long time ≈øince you ≈øaw it; but po≈ø≈øibly you may remember ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of old Edwards."‚Äî"Edwards! cried Harley, Oh! heavens! and ≈øprung to embrace him; let me cla≈øp tho≈øe knees on which I have ≈øat ≈øo often: Edwards!‚ÄîI ≈øhall never forget that fire ≈øide, round which I have been ≈øo happy!

my rent regularly as it became due, and had always as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind as gave bread to me and my children. But my la≈øt lea≈øe was out ≈øoon after you left that part of the country; and the ≈øquire, who had lately got a London attorney for his ≈øteward, would not renew it, becau≈øe, he ≈øaid, he did not choo≈øe to have any farm under 300<hi>l.</hi> a year value on his e≈øtate; but offered to give me the preference on the ≈øame terms with another, if I choo≈øe to take the one he had marked out, of which mine was a part.</p>
                     <p>"What could I do, Mr. Harley? I feared the undertaking was too great for me; yet to leave, at my age, the hou≈øe I had lived in from my cradle! I could not, Mr. Harley, I could not; there was not a tree about it that I did not look on as my father, my brother, or my child: ≈øo I even ran <hi>t</hi>he ri≈øque, and took the ≈øquire's offer of the whole. But I had ≈øoon rea≈øon to repent of my bargain: the ≈øteward had taken care that my former farm ≈øhould be the be≈øt land of the divi≈øion: I was obliged to hire more ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and I could not have my eye over them all; ≈øome unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ≈øea≈øons followed one another, and I found my affairs entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on my hands.</p>
                     <p>"To add to my di≈øtre≈øs, a con≈øiderable corn-factor turned bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with a ≈øum of mine in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: I failed paying my rent ≈øo punctually as I was wont to do, and the ≈øame ≈øteward had my ≈øtock taken in execution in a few days after. So, Mr. Harley, there was an end of my pro≈øperity. However, there was as much produced from the ≈øale of my effects as paid my debts, and ≈øaved me from a gaol: I thank God I wronged no man, and the world could never charge me with di≈øhone≈øty.</p>
                     <p>"Had you ≈øeen us, Mr. Harley, when we were turned out of South-hill, I am ≈øure you would have wept at the ≈øight. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member old Tru≈øty, my ≈øhag hou≈øe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> dog; I ≈øhall never forget it while I live; the poor creature was blind with age, and could ≈øcarce crawl after us to the door; he went however as far as the goo≈øeberry-bu≈øh; that you may remember ≈øtood on the left hand of the yard; he was wont to ba≈øk in the ≈øun there: when he had reached that ≈øpot, he ≈øtopped; we went on: I called to him, he wagged his tail, but did not ≈øtir: I called again; he lay down: I whi≈øtled, and cried Tru≈øty, he gave a ≈øhort howl, and died! I could have lain down and died too, but God gave me ≈øtrength to live for my children."</p>
                     <p>The old man now pau≈øed a moment to take breath. He looked on Harley's face; it was bathed in 'tears: it was a tale he had been accu≈øtomed to think often on; he dropped one tear and no more.</p>
                     <p>"Though I was poor, continued he, I was not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out credit. A gentleman in the neighbourhood, who had a ≈ømall farm unoccupied at the time, offered to let me have it, on giving ≈øecurity for the rent, which I made ≈øhift to procure.

                     <p>"My ≈øon was a remarkable good ≈øhooter; he had always kept a pointer on our former farm, and thought no harm in doing ≈øo now; when one day, having ≈øprung a covey of birds on our own ground, the dog, of his own accord, followed them into the ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice's.

                     <p>"It was on a Chri≈øtmas-eve, and the birth-day too of my ≈øon's little boy. The night was piercing cold, and it blew a ≈øtorm, with ≈øhowers of hail and ≈ønow.

                     <head>CHAP. XXXV. He mi≈ø≈øes an old acquaintance.‚ÄîAn adventure con≈øequent upon it.</head>
                     <p>WHEN they had arrived within a little way of the village they journeyed to, Harley ≈øtopped ≈øhort, and looked ≈øted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa≈øtly on the mouldering walls of a ruined hou≈øe that ≈øtood on the road-≈øide: "Oh heavens! he cried, what do I ≈øee! ≈øilent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roofed, and de≈øolate! Are all thy gay tenants gone; do I hear their hum no more; Edwards, look there, look there! the ≈øcene of my infant joys, my earlie≈øt friend≈øhips, laid wa≈øte and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous! That was the very ≈øchool where I was boarded when you were at South-hill: it is but a twelvemonth ≈øince I ≈øaw it ≈øtanding, and its benches filled with little cherubims: that oppo≈øite ≈øide of the road was the green on which they ≈øported; ≈øee it now plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up! I would have given fifty times its value to have ≈øaved it from the ≈øacrilege of that plow."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Sir, replied Edwards, perhaps they have left it from choice, and may have got another ≈øpot as good." "They cannot, ≈øaid Harley, they cannot; I ≈øhall never ≈øee the ≈øward covered with its dai≈øies, nor pre≈ø≈øed by the dance of the dear innocents: I ≈øhall never ≈øee that ≈øtump decked with the garlands which their little hands had gathered. The≈øe two long ≈øtones which now lie at the foot of it, were once the ≈øupports of a hut I my≈øelf a≈ø≈øi≈øted to rear: I have ≈øat on the ≈øods within it, when we had ≈øpread our banquet of apples before us, and been more ble≈øt.‚ÄîOh! Edwards! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ble≈øt than ever I ≈øhall be again."</p>
                     <p>Ju≈øt then a woman pa≈ø≈øed them on the road, and di≈øcovered ≈øome ≈øigns of wonder at the attitude of Harley, who ≈øtood, with his hands folded together, looking with a moi≈øtened eye on the fallen pillars of the hut. He was too much intranced in thought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve her at all; but Edwards civilly acco≈øting her, de≈øired to know, if that had not been the ≈øchool-hou≈øe, and how it came into that condition they now ≈øaw it in? "Alack a-day! ≈øaid ≈øhe, it was the ≈øchool-hou≈øe indeed; but to be ≈øure, Sir, the ≈øquire has pulled it down, becau≈øe it ≈øtood in the way of his pro≈øpects."‚Äî"What! how! pro≈øpects! pulled down! cried Harley."‚ÄîYes, to be ≈øure, Sir; and the green, where the children u≈øed to play, he has ploughed up, becau≈øe, he ≈øaid, they hurt his fence on the other ≈øide of it."‚Äî"Cur≈øes on his narrow heart, cried Harley, that could violate a right ≈øo ≈øacred!

                     <p>They ≈øtopped at the door of a ≈ønug-looking hou≈øe, where ≈øat an elderly woman with a boy and a girl before her, with each a ≈øupper of bread and milk in their hands. "There, Sir, is the ≈øchool-mi≈øtre≈øs."‚Äî"Madam, ≈øaid Harley, was not an old venerable-looking man ≈øchool-ma≈øter here ≈øome time ago?" "Yes, Sir, he was; poor man! the lo≈øs of his former ≈øchool-hou≈øe, I believe, broke his heart, for he died ≈øoon after it was taken down; and as another has not yet been found, I have that charge in the mean time."‚Äî"And this boy and girl, I pre≈øume, are your pupils?"‚Äî"Ay, Sir, they are poor orphans, put under my care by the pari≈øh; and more promi≈øing children I never ≈øaw." "Orphans!" ≈øaid Harley. "Yes, Sir, of hone≈øt creditable parents as any in the pari≈øh; and it is a ≈øhame for ≈øome folks to forget their relations, at a time when they have mo≈øt need to remember them."‚Äî"Madam, ≈øaid Harley, let us never forget that we are all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons." He ki≈ø≈øed the children.</p>
                     <p>"Their father, Sir, continued ≈øhe, was a farmer here in the neighbourhood, and a ≈øober indu≈øtrious man he was; but nobody can help misfortunes; what with bad crops, and bad debts, which are wor≈øe, his affairs went to wreck, and both he and his wife died of broken hearts. And a ≈øweet couple they were, Sir; there was not a properer man to look on in the county than John Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ≈øo indeed were all the Edward≈øes." "What Edward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes?" cried the old ≈øoldier ha≈øtily "The Edward≈øes of South-hill; and a worthy family they were."‚Äî"South-hill!" ≈øaid he in a languid voice, and fell back into the arms of the a≈øtoni≈øhed Harley.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øchool-mi≈øtre≈øs ran for ≈øome water, and a ≈ømelling-bottle, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of which they ≈øoon recovered the unfortunate Edwards. He ≈øtared wildly for ≈øome time, then folding his orphan grand-children in his arms, "Oh! my children, my children! he cried, have I found you thus? My poor Jack! art thou gone? I thought thou ≈øhoulde≈øt have carried thy father's grey hairs to the grave! And the≈øe little ones"‚Äîhis tears choaked his utterance, and he fell again on the necks of the children.</p>
                     <p>"My dear old man! ≈øaid Harley, Providence has ≈øent thee to relieve them; it will ble≈øs me, if I can be the means of a≈ø≈øi≈øting you."‚Äî"Yes indeed, Sir, an≈øwered the boy; father, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, bade God ble≈øs us; and prayed, that if grandfather lived, he might ≈øend him to ≈øupport us."‚Äî"Where did they lay my boy?" ≈øaid Edwards. "In the Old Church-Yard, replied the woman, hard by his mother."‚Äî"I will ≈øhew it you, an≈øwered the boy; for I have wept over it many a time, when fir≈øt I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt ≈øtrange folks." He took the old man's hand, Harley laid

hold of his ≈øi≈øter's, and they walked in ≈øilence to the church-yard. There was an old ≈øtone, with the corner broken off, and ≈øome letters, half covered with mo≈øs, to denote the names of the dead: there was a cyphered R. E. plainer than the re≈øt: it was the tomb they ≈øought.</p>
                     <p>"Here it is, grandfather," ≈øaid the boy. Edwards gazed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it without uttering a word: the girl, who had only ≈øighed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now wept out-right; her brother ≈øobbed, but he ≈øtifled his ≈øobbing. "I have told ≈øi≈øter, ≈øaid he, that ≈øhe ≈øhould not take it ≈øo to heart; ≈øhe can knit already, and I ≈øhall ≈øoon be able to dig: we ≈øhall not ≈øtarve, ≈øi≈øter, indeed we ≈øhall not, nor ≈øhall grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father neither."‚ÄîThe girl cried afre≈øh; Harley ki≈ø≈øed off her tears as they flowed, and wept between every ki≈øs.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXVI. He returns home.‚ÄîA de≈øcription of his retinue.</head>
                     <p>IT was with ≈øome difficulty that Harley prevailed on the old man to leave the ≈øpot where the remains of his ≈øon were laid. At la≈øt, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the ≈øchool-mi≈øtre≈øs, he prevailed; and ≈øhe accommodated Edwards and him with beds in her hou≈øe, there being nothing like an inn nearer than the di≈øtance of ≈øome miles. In the morning, Harley per≈øuaded Edwards to come, with the children, to his hou≈øe, which was di≈øtant but a ≈øhort day's journey.</p>
                     <p>The boy walked in his grand-father's hand; and the name of Edwards procured him a neighbouring farmer's hor≈øe, on which a ≈øervant mounted, with the girl ≈øeated on a pillow before him.</p>
                     <p>With this train Harley returned to the abode of his fathers: and we cannot but think, that his enjoyment was as great as if he had arrived from the tour of Europe, with a Swi≈øs valet for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and half a dozen ≈ønuff-boxes, with invi≈øible hinges, in his pocket. But we take our ideas from ≈øounds which folly has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; Fa≈øhion, Bon-ton, and Vertu, are the names of certain idols, to which we ≈øacrifice the genuine plea≈øures of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It was otherwi≈øe with Harley: he ran up ≈øtairs to his aunt, with the hi≈øtory of his fellow-travellers glowing on his lips. His aunt was an oeconomi≈øt; but ≈øhe knew the plea≈øure of doing charitable things, and withal was fond of her nephew, and ≈øolicitous to oblige him. She received old Edwards therefore with a look of more complacency than is perhaps natural to maiden ladies of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcore, and was remarkably attentive to his grand-children: ≈øhe roa≈øted apples with her own hands for their ≈øupper, and made up a little bed be≈øide her own for the girl. Edwards made ≈øome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:017579_0057_0FA12F342BE59838"/>
towards an acknowledgment for the≈øe favours; but his young friend ≈øtopped them in their beginnings. "Who≈øoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth any of the≈øe children"‚Äî≈øaid his aunt; for her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with her bible was habitual.</p>
                     <p>Early next morning, Harley ≈øtole into the room where Edwards lay: he expected to have found him a bed; but in this he was mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: the old man had ri≈øen, and was leaning over his ≈øleeping grand≈øon, with the tears flowing down his checks. At fir≈øt he did not perceive Harley; when he did, he endeavoured to hide his grief, and cro≈ø≈øing his eyes with his hand, expre≈ø≈øed his ≈øurpri≈øe at ≈øeeing him ≈øo early a≈øtir. "I was thinking of you, ≈øaid Harley, and your children: I learned la≈øt night that a ≈ømall farm of mine in the neighbourhood is now vacant; if you will occupy it, I ≈øhall gain a good neighbour, and be able in ≈øome mea≈øure to repay you the notice you took of me when a boy; and as the furniture of the hou≈øe is mine, it will be ≈øo much trouble ≈øaved." Edwards's tears gu≈øhed afre≈øh, and Harley led him to ≈øee the place he intended for him.</p>
                     <p>The hou≈øe upon this farm was indeed little better than a hut; its ≈øituation, however, was plea≈øant, and Edwards, a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the beneficence of Harley, ≈øet about improving its neatne≈øs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. He ≈øtaked out a piece of the green before for a garden, and Peter, who acted in Harley's family as valet, butler, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, had orders to furni≈øh him with parcels of the different ≈øeeds he cho≈øe to ≈øow in it. I have ≈øeen his ma≈øter at work in this little ≈øpot, with his coat off, and his dibble in his hand: it was a ≈øcene of tranquil virtue to have ≈øtopped an angel on his errands of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! Harley had contrived to lead a little bubbling brook through a green walk in the middle of the ground, upon which he had erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mill in miniature for the diver≈øion of Edward's infant grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and made ≈øhift in its con≈øtruction to introduce a pliant bit of wood, that an≈øwered with its fairy clack to the murmuring of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>They now approached the little dwelling of Edwards.

                        <p>This young lady then was no other than Mi≈øs Walton. She had heard the old man's hi≈øtory from Harley, as we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Curio≈øity, or ≈øome other motive, prompted her to de≈øire to ≈øee his grand-children: this ≈øhe had an opportunity of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øoon, the children, in ≈øome of their walks, having ≈øtrolled as far as her father's avenue. She put ≈øeveral que≈øtions to both; ≈øhe was delighted with the ≈øimplicity of their an≈øwers, and promi≈øed, that if they continued to be good children, and do as their grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father bid them, ≈øhe would ≈øoon ≈øee them again, and bring ≈øome pre≈øent or other for their reward.</p>
                        <p>This promi≈øe ≈øhe had performed now: ≈øhe came attended only by her maid, and brought with her a complete ≈øuit of green for the boy, and a chintz gown, a cap, and a ≈øuit of ribbands, for his ≈øi≈øter. She had time enough, with her maid's a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, to equip them in their new habiliments before Harley and Edwards return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>THE <hi>de≈øire of communicating knowledge or intelligence, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with tho≈øe who hold that man is naturally a ≈øocial animal. It is indeed one of the earlie≈øt propen≈øities we di≈øcover; but it may be doubted whether the plea≈øure (for plea≈øure there certainly is) ari≈øing from it be not often more ≈øelfi≈øh than ≈øocial: for we frequently ob≈øerve the tidings of Ill communicated as eagerly as the annunciation of Good. Is it that we delight in ob≈øerving the effects of the ≈øtronger pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions? for we are all philo≈øophers in this re≈øpect; and it is perhaps among≈øt the ≈øpectators at Tyburn that the mo≈øt genuine are to be found.</hi>

                        <hi>Was it from this motive that Peter came one morning into his ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's room with a meaning face of recital? His ma≈øter indeed did not at fir≈øt ob≈øerve it; for he was ≈øitting, with one ≈øhoe buckled, bu≈øied in delineating portraits in the fire. "I have bru≈øhed the≈øe clothes, Sir, as you ordered me."‚ÄîHarley nodded his head; but Peter ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his hat wanted bru≈øhing too: his ma≈øter nodded again. At la≈øt Peter bethought him, that the fire needed ≈øtirring; and, taking up the poker, demoli≈øhed the turband-head of a Saracen, while his ma≈øter was ≈øeeking out a body for it. "The morning is main cold, Sir," ≈øaid Peter. "Is it?" ≈øaid Harley. "Yes, Sir; I have been as far as Tom Dow≈øon's to fetch ≈øome barberries he had picked for Mrs. Margery.

                        <hi>When Peter was gone, he ≈øtood with his eyes fixed on the ground, and the la≈øt words of his intelligence vibrating in his ears. "Mi≈øs Walton married!" he ≈øighed‚Äîand walked down ≈øtairs, with his ≈øho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His aunt, however, was pretty well accu≈øtomed to the≈øe appearances of ab≈øence; be≈øides, that the natural gravity of her temper, which was commonly called into exertion by the care of her hou≈øehold concerns, was ≈øuch, as not ea≈øily to be di≈øcompo≈øed by any circum≈øtance of accidental impropriety.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Harley was in no very good humour for entering into a di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of this que≈øtion; but he always entertained ≈øo much parental re≈øpect for his aunt, as to attend to her di≈øcour≈øe.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>"Why, one would not choo≈øe, replied his aunt, to make a much wor≈øe figure than one's neighbours; but, as I was ≈øaying before, the times (as my friend Mrs. Dorothy Walton ob≈øerves) are ≈øhamefully degenerated in this re≈øpect. There was but the other day, at Mr. Walton's, that fat fellow's daughter, the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Merchant, as he calls him≈øelf, though I have heard that he was little better than the keeper of a chandler's ≈øhop:‚ÄîWe were leaving the gentlemen to go to tea.

                     <p>Her indignation was interrupted by the arrival of her maid with a dama≈øk table cloth, and a ≈øet of napkins, from the loom, which had been ≈øpun by her mi≈øtre≈øs's own hand. There was the family cre≈øt in each corner, and in the middle a view of the battle of Worce≈øter, where one of her ance≈øtors had been a captain in the king's forces; and, with a ≈øort of poetical licen≈øe as to per≈øpective, there was ≈øeen the Royal Oak, with more wig than leaves on it.</p>
                     <p>All this the good lady was very copious on and took up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining intervals of filling tea, to de≈øcribe its excellencies to Harley; adding, that ≈øhe intended this as a pre≈øent for his wife, when he ≈øhould get one. He ≈øighed and looked fooli≈øh, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ≈øerenity of the day, walked out into the garden.</p>
                     <p>He ≈øat down on a little ≈øeat which commanded an exten≈øive pro≈øpect round the hou≈øe. He leaned on his hand, and ≈øcored the ground with his ≈øtick: "Mi≈øs Walton married! ≈øaid he; but

what is that to me? May ≈øhe be happy! her virtues de≈øerve it; to me her marriage is otherwi≈øe indifferent:‚ÄîI had romantic dreams! they are fled! it is perfectly indifferent."</p>
                     <p>Ju≈øt at that moment he ≈øaw a ≈øervant, with a knot of ribbands in his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ≈øtood a moment li≈øtening in this breathle≈øs ≈øtate of palpitation: Peter came out by chance. "Did your honour want any thing?"‚Äî"Where is the ≈øervant that came ju≈øt now from Mr. Walton's?"‚Äî"From Mr. Walton's, Sir! there is none of his ≈øervants here that I know of."‚Äî"Nor of Sir Harry Ben≈øon's?"‚ÄîHe did not wait for an an≈øwer; but having by this time ob≈øerved the hat with its party-coloured ornament hanging on a peg near the door, he pre≈ø≈øed forwards into the kitchen, and addre≈ø≈øing him≈øelf to a ≈øtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whom he ≈øaw there, a≈øked him, with no ≈ømall tremor in his voice, If he had any commands for him? The man looked ≈øilly, and ≈øaid, That he had nothing to trouble his honour with. "Are not you a ≈øervant of Sir Harry Ben≈øon's?"‚Äî"No, Sir."‚Äî"You'll pardon me, young man; I judged by the favour in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Recruiting!" his eyes gli≈øtened at the word: he ≈øeized the ≈øoldier's hand, and ≈øhaking it violently, ordered Peter to fetch a bottle of his aunt's be≈øt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>am. The bottle was brought: "You ≈øhall drink the king's health, ≈øaid Harley, in a bumper."‚Äî"The king and your honour."‚Äî"Nay, you ≈øhall drink the king's health by it≈øelf; you may drink mine in another." Peter looked in his ma≈øter's face, and filled with ≈øome little reluctance. "Now to your mi≈øtre≈øs." The man excu≈øed him≈øelf‚Äî"to your mi≈øtre≈øs! you cannot refu≈øe it." It was Mrs. Margery's be≈øt dram! Peter ≈øtood with the bottle a little inclined, but not ≈øo as to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a drop of its contents: "Fill it, Peter, ≈øaid his ma≈øter, fill it to the brim." Peter filled it; and the ≈øoldier having named Sukey Sim≈øon, di≈øpatched it in a twinkling. "Thou art an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt fellow, ≈øaid Harley, and I love thee;" and ≈øhaking his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, de≈øired Peter to make him his gue≈øt at dinner, and walked up into his room with a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ce much quicker and ≈øpringy than u≈øual. This agreeable di≈øappointment however he was not long ≈øuffered to felicitate him≈øelf upon.</p>
                     <p>The curate happened that day to dine with him: his vi≈øits indeed were more properly to the aunt than the nephew; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the intelligent ladies in the pari≈øh, who, like ≈øome very great philo≈øophers, have the happy knack at accounting for every thing, gave out, that there was a particular attachment between them, which wanted only to be maturated by ≈øome more years of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip to end in the tendere≈øt connection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:017579_0063_0FA12F3A2D9A06C8"/>
In this conclu≈øion indeed, ≈øuppo≈øing the premi≈øes to have been true, they were ≈øomewhat ju≈øtified by the known opinion of the lady, who frequently declared her≈øelf a friend to the <hi>etiquette</hi> of former times, when a lover might have ≈øighed ≈øeven years at his mi≈øtre≈øs's feet, before he was allowed the liberty of ki≈ø≈øing her hand. It is true Mrs. Margery was now about her grand climacteric; but that is nothing: for it is ju≈øt the age when we expect to grow younger. But I verily believe there was nothing in the report; the curate's connection was only as a genealogi≈øt; for in that ≈øcience he was no ways inferior to Mrs. Margery her≈øelf. He dealt al≈øo in the pre≈øent times; for he was a politician and a news-monger.</p>
                     <p>He had hardly ≈øaid grace after dinner, when he told Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, that ≈øhe might ≈øoon expect a pair of white gloves, as Sir Harry Ben≈øon, he was very well informed, was ju≈øt going to be married to Mi≈øs Walton. Harley ≈øpilt the wine he was carrying to his mouth: he had time however to recollect him≈øelf before the curate had fini≈øhed the different minutiae of his intelligence, and ≈øummoning up all the heroi≈øm he was ma≈øter of, filled a bumper and drank to Mi≈øs Walton.</p>
                     <p>"With all my heart, ≈øaid the curate, the bride that is to be." Harley would have ≈øaid bride too; but the word Bride ≈øtuck in his throat. His confu≈øion indeed was manife≈øt: but the curate began to enter on ≈øome point of de≈øcent with Mrs. Margery, and Harley had very ≈øoon after an opportunity of leaving them, while they were deeply engaged in a que≈øtion, whether the name of ≈øome great man in the time of Henry the Seventh was Richard or Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey.</p>
                     <p>He did not ≈øee his aunt again till ≈øupper; the time between he ≈øpent in walking, like ≈øome troubled gho≈øt, round the place where his trea≈øure lay. He went as far as a little gate, that led into a cop≈øe near Mr. Walton's hou≈øe, to which that gentleman had been ≈øo obliging us to let him have a key.</p>
                     <p>He had ju≈øt begun to open it, when he ≈øaw, on a terra≈øs below, Mi≈øs Walton walking with a gentleman in a riding-dre≈øs, whom he immediately gue≈ø≈øed to be Sir Harry Ben≈øon. He ≈øtopped of a ≈øudden; his hand ≈øhook ≈øo much that he could hardly turn the key; he opened the gate however, and advanced a few paces. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's lap-dog pricked up its ears, and barked: he ≈øtopped again.‚Äî

                        </q>
His re≈øolution failed; he ≈ølunk back, and locking the gate as ≈øoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he could, ≈øtood on tiptoe looking over the wall till they were gone. At that in≈øtant a ≈øhepherd blew his horn: the romantic melancholy of the ≈øound quite overcame him!‚Äîit was the very note that wanted to be touched‚Äîhe ≈øighed! he dropped a tear!‚Äîand returned.</p>

the only per≈øon in the family who had no ≈øu≈øpicion of his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Mi≈øs Walton. It was frequently matter of di≈øcour≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the ≈øervants: perhaps her maiden coldne≈øs‚Äîbut the≈øe things need not be accounted for.</p>
                     <p>In a day or two he was ≈øo much ma≈øter of him≈øelf as to be able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There were ≈øo very few connected pa≈ø≈øages of the ≈øub≈øequent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters remaining, that even the partiality of an editor could not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to the public. I di≈øcovered, from ≈øome ≈øcattered ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that they were of much the ≈øame tenor with tho≈øe preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; recitals of little adventures, in which the di≈øpo≈øitions of a man, ≈øen≈øible to judge, and ≈øtill more warm to feel, had room to unfold them≈øelves. Some in≈øtruction, and ≈øome example, I make no doubt, they contained; but it is likely that many of tho≈øe, whom chance hath led to a peru≈øal of what I have already pre≈øented them with, may have read it with little plea≈øure, and will feel no di≈øappointment from the want of tho≈øe parts which I have been unable to procure: to ≈øuch as may have expected the intricacies of a novel, a few incidents in a life undi≈øtingui≈øhed, except by ≈øome features of the heart, cannot have afforded much entertainment.</p>

His mi≈øtre≈øs I could perceive was not married to Sir Harry Ben≈øon: but it would ≈øeem, by one of the following chapters, which is ≈øtill entire, that Harley had not profited on the occa≈øion by making any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his own pa≈ø≈øion, after tho≈øe of the other had been un≈øucce≈øsful. The ≈øtate of his health for ≈øome part of this period,

appears to have been ≈øuch as to forbid any thoughts of that kind: he had been ≈øeized with a very dangerous fever, catched by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old Edwards in one of an infectious kind.

                        <p>"On ≈øomething like a bed, lay a man, with a face ≈øeemingly emaciated with ≈øickne≈øs, and a look of patient dejection; a bundle of dirty ≈øhreds ≈øerved him for a pillow; but he had a better ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port‚Äîthe arm of a female who kneeled be≈øide him, beautiful as an angel, but with a fading languor in her countenance, the ≈øtill life of melancholy, that ≈øeemed to borrow its ≈øhade from the object on which ≈øhe gazed.</p>

                     <p>THIS alludes to a ≈øublime pa≈ø≈øage in the Lu≈øiade of Camoens; an epic poem concerning the fir≈øt voyages and di≈øcoveries of the Portugue≈øe to the Ea≈øt indies, by the Cape of Good Hope. This poem, ≈øays the Pre≈øident Monte≈øquieu in the ≈øpirit of Laws, makes us feel ≈øomething of the charms of the Ody≈ø≈øey, and magnificence of the Aeneid.</p>

                     <p>"BESIDE the ebb and flood, there is a current or eddy in the Norway ≈øea called Mael≈øtrom, or Mo≈øcoe≈øtrom. The i≈øland Mo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe, from whence this ≈øtream derives its name, lies between the mountain He≈øleggin in Lofoden and the i≈øland Ver, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one league di≈øtant; and between the i≈øland and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>PERHAPS it is hardly in the power of fancy to conceive a ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more horror than of being thus driven forward, by the ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violence of an impetuous torrent, to the vortex of a whirlpool, of which the noi≈øe and turbulence ≈øtill encrea≈øing as it is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are an earne≈øt of quick and inevitable de≈øtruction; while the wretched victims in an agony of de≈øpair and terror, cry out for that help which they know to be impo≈ø≈øible, and ≈øee before them the dreadful aby≈øs into which they are about to be plunged and da≈øhed again≈øt the rocks at the bottom.</p>
                     <p>EVEN animals which have come too near to vortex have expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the utmo≈øt terror when they find the ≈øtream irre≈øi≈øtible.
