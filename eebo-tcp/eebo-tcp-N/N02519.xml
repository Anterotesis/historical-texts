            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible,</hi> is the <hi>only wiſe GOD.</hi> There is but One only living and true GOD, and infinite Wiſdom is eſſential to Him. <hi>He is the light, and in Him is no darkneſs at all. Wiſdom</hi> in general is reckon'd to conſiſt, in pitching upon ſome <hi>ſuitable &amp; proper end,</hi> and then taking the <hi>beſt method</hi> to obtain that end. The higheſt &amp; beſt <hi>end</hi> (according to our conception) that GOD Himſelf can pitch upon, is <hi>His own Glory. He hath made all things for Himſelf. Of him, thro' him, to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.</hi> GOD <hi>glorifies Himſelf,</hi> in <hi>exerting</hi> &amp; <hi>manifeſting</hi> his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Power, Holineſs, Goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo far as the marks or ſignatures of GOD's perfections appear in his works (whether Men duely obſerve them or not) ſo far they ſhew forth <hi>His glory.</hi> Pſal. <hi>19.1. The heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work.</hi> And the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD very particularly appears, in ſo contriving, directing, or attempering (if we may ſo expreſs it) the manifeſtation of the divine Attributes, that there ſhall be no Inconſiſtence or

Jarring, but the moſt beautiful conſent, harmony and agreement between them. This Harmony is apparent in all GOD's works, <hi>(Pſal. 104.24. O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all,)</hi> but very brightly and conſpicuouſly ſhines forth, even in the moſt lively colours, in the great affair of Redeeming Sinful Men, thro' <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> our <hi>LORD. Pſal. 85.10. Mercy and Truth are met together; Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs &amp; Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truth is well illuſtrated, demonſtrated, and applied in the following Sermons, compos'd (as I think is very evident) with much diligent ſtudy, and by the gracious aſſiſtances of the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>who is the wiſdom of GOD, &amp; the power of GOD;</hi> and in whom are bid, <hi>all the Treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi> As theſe Sermons muſt needs have caſt the Reverend Author much study &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in compoſing them, ſo they tend directly (by the divine bleſſing) to yield great profit to ſerious and diligent Readers; being well adapted &amp; ſuited, to inſtruct the Ignorant, and alarm the hardened, to rouze &amp; awaken the ſtupid &amp; ſecure, to guide the doubting, to unhinge ſelf-confident Hypocrites, to comfort the feeble-minded, to ſupport the weak: Indeed to animate to the Mortification of every corruption, and to the exerciſe of every Grace, and practice of every Duty. As theſe Sermons evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Author <hi>ſtudies to ſhew himſelf approved unto GOD, a workman that need not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, and faithfully diſpenſing the myſteries of GOD</hi>; ſo alſo do his other miniſterial performances publick

and private: ſo that I have often thought, it's a great favour not only to the Church and Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>College</hi> (and therein to the whole Province) that he is fixed in that publick Poſt and Station, aſſign'd by Providence to him. I pray GOD long to continue his Life and Health, and make him more and more a bleſſing to all he's concern'd with. Tho' he's but <hi>Young,</hi> yet his labours are very Inſtructive and Profitable.</p>
            <p>And here I would take occaſion to ſay, 'tis with great pleaſure &amp; delight, that I've read the printed Diſcourſes of many of the <hi>Younger Miniſters</hi> in the Province. They ſo plainly teach, and urge the belief of Scripture-truths; ſo earneſtly preſs a compliance with what the Goſpel requires, in the moſt Important Articles of <hi>Repentance of Sin, Faith in CHRIST, and Obedience to Him;</hi> ſo zealouſly diſſwade from all Wickedneſs, and exhort to all Holineſs in Heart and Life; that I've taken great ſatisfaction in reading of them. To me it looks like an hopeful ſymptom, that GOD yet has Mercy in ſtore for this poor, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, degenerate People (among whom the Power of Godlineſs is much decay'd) in that He raiſes up (as others are taken off by Death) ſo many able and faithful Miniſters among them. The LORD greatly increaſe the Number of ſuch, and multiply the Gifts and Graces of His Spirit to them! May it pleaſe the LORD more and more to aſſiſt and ſucceed His Miniſters, and make them Inſtrumental of ſaving good, to vaſt multitudes of Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002987_0005_0FE6AEE20F78D890"/>And as our <hi>College</hi> and <hi>Schools</hi> have hitherto been great bleſſings to this Land, in training up able &amp; faithful Miniſters to diſpenſe the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of GOD; ſo, may the divine ſmiles long continue thoſe Seminaries, even to lateſt Poſterity, that there may proceed from thence, ſtreams making glad the city of GOD, even many Sons of Renown, who ſhall take this People by the Hand, and lead them in the right ways of the LORD!</p>

who <hi>excel</hi> in Wiſdom as well as <hi>Strength,</hi> he <hi>charges with folly,</hi> Job. 4.18. GOD has made very bright and clear diſcoveries of this Perfection in all his Works. There are viſible marks, and Characters of it in every Creature that he has made; and if we would but take pains to view the World, and obſerve the wonderful contrivance there is in every part of it, how they are ſuited to one another, and how they are all accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to anſwer their various intentions; we ſhould all break forth in holy admiration with the devout Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi> But now in none of the Works of GOD does this Perfection appear more Glorious than in the Work of our <hi>Redemption</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt. In this, ſays the Apoſtle in the Text, <hi>He has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded toward us in all wiſdom and prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle, in the foregoing Verſes of this Chapter, we find Bleſſing and Praiſing GOD for <hi>all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Christ</hi>; which GOD had bleſſed his People with. And here he Inſtances, Firſt, in their <hi>Election and Predeſtination,</hi> as the ſpring and fountain of all other Bleſſings; and then in their Regeneration, and Sanctification, their Adoption, their Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with GOD, and their Pardon. And now all theſe benefits and bleſſings of Redemption, he tells us, are <hi>in and thro' the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus they were <hi>choſen in him,</hi> that is in Chriſt, <hi>that they ſhould be holy and without blame, v.</hi> 4. So they were <hi>Predeſtinated to the Adoption of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002987_0008_0FE6AEECC1B40518"/>
Children by Chriſt Jeſus. v.</hi> 5. And they are ſaid to be <hi>accepted in the beloved, that is,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son of GOD, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and to have <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' his blood, even the forgiveneſs of their Sins, v.</hi> 7. And now as our Redemption is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Chriſt, as what he had purchaſed by his Blood: ſo is it at the ſame time aſcribed to the free rich and ſovereign Grace of GOD. Thus we are ſaid to be Adopted by Chriſt Jeſus; but it is <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his Will.</hi> And we are ſaid to be accepted, in the Beloved, but it is <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace.</hi> And altho' we have Redemption thro' his blood, even the forgiveneſs of Sins: Yet this is <hi>according to the riches of his Grace.</hi> As in the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned verſes. And now the Apoſtle conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how our Redemption was purchaſed by Chriſt, and ſo Divine Juſtice ſatisfied, and at the ſame time, and by the ſame act, Divine Grace, and the riches of it magnified; he obſerves, as in our Text, that <hi>herein</hi> GOD had <hi>abounded towards us in all wiſdom and prudence.</hi> That is, in this work of our Redemption he has not only abounded towards us in Grace and Mercy, but in all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>And therefore from theſe Words I propoſe to conſider ſomething of the Infinite Wiſdom of GOD in our Redemption. I ſay, <hi>Something</hi> of this Wiſdom: for it is impoſſible for us to ſearch into the depths of Divine Wiſdom in this grand affair. There are ſuch Depths of Wiſdom, and ſuch Unſearchable Myſteries in it, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002987_0009_0FE6AEECD6478978"/>
thoſe bright Intelligences, with the greateſt earneſtneſs and intenſneſs are looking into them; yet they cannot fathom them: much leſs can it be expected from ſuch ſhallow ſhort ſighted Creatures as we. However a ſerious Meditation of theſe things, may ſerve to enlarge our thoughts of GOD in this Wonderful Contrivance, and may raiſe our Hearts in the higheſt Admiration and Adoration of what we cannot comprehend. And therefore this is the Doctrine that by Divine Aſſiſtance I propoſe to ſpeak to from the words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DOCT. <hi>In the Method GOD has taken, for the Redemption of Mankind, there are Glorious Manifeſtations of Infinite Wiſdom, and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Text tells us that herein GOD has abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards us, in all Wiſdom and Prudence: there are abundant riches, unfathomable depths of Wiſdom, in this wonderful work.</p>
               <p>What I propoſe for the clearing this Doctrine, is,—</p>
               <p n="1">I. Briefly to explain the <hi>Nature of Wiſdom</hi>; and ſhow what it is, and wherein it conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>And then,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Prove the Doctrine</hi>: and ſhow there are Glorious Manifeſtations of Wiſdom in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod GOD has taken for the Redemption of Man.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>I am to explane the</hi> Nature <hi>of Wiſdom; and ſhow what it is, or wherein it conſiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002987_0010_0FE6AEF16A0D1B30"/>Now in General; Wiſdom conſiſts in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the moſt <hi>Noble Ends</hi>: and then in project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proſecuting the moſt proper, and ſuitable <hi>Means</hi> for the accompliſhment of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wiſdom conſiſts in propoſing the moſt noble Ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wiſdom belongs only to National Beings: only to ſuch as are capable of actual deſign, &amp; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: of aiming at, and propoſing ſomething as their end in what they do. And now the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſuch a Being partly conſiſts in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch ends, and having ſuch things in view, that are the moſt <hi>Excellent</hi> and worthy of the aims, and deſigns of ſuch a Being. Thus Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as applied to Man, conſiſts in his conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Nature, the dignity and capacity of it; and in aiming at thoſe things that are ſuitable to, and worthy of ſuch a Nature. And now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what GOD is in himſelf; and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſtands in to us; the glorifying and the enjoying of him are the higheſt and the nobleſt ends we can propoſe for our ſelves. Accordingly for a Man to aim at theſe things, principally, and at other things only in a Subordination and Subſerviency to theſe; is ſo far a point of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Whereas on the other hand; he that is thoughtleſs, and unconcerned about theſe things, and has his thoughts and deſigns carried no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than to the gratifications of his luſts, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſires; is guilty of folly, and is looked upon as a fool in the ſight of GOD, and of every truly wiſe Man. But then Wiſdom don't altogether
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002987_0011_0FE6AEF184805BE8"/>
conſiſt in the bare <hi>aiming</hi> at ſomething that is great and excellent; for a Man may oftentimes have very good aims and deſigns; by which altho' he may obtain the Character of an honeſt, yet not of a wiſe Man. For</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wiſdom conſiſts in pitching upon the moſt proper means, for accompliſhing the ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a Man propoſes any thing that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Man, to propoſe and aim at: and when he is able to lay all things together in his own Mind, to ſee the difficulties, and inconveniences on one ſide; and the dangers on the other: and is able to pitch upon the moſt direct, the moſt eaſy, and the moſt effectual methods, to accompliſh his purpoſes; ſo as to ſteer clear of all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, or difficulties that attend either ſide: I ſay, in thus fixing upon the beſt rules and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the accompliſhing any affair, lies a great part of Wiſdom. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It conſiſts in proſecuting theſe Methods, for the accompliſhing the end propoſed, with ſuch vigour, diligence, and conſtancy, as the nature of the thing requires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wiſdom is not meerly Speculative: but Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. He is not the wiſe Man that aims well; or projects a good Scheme, for the accompliſhing his end: but he that practiſes upon it, puts his Scheme into execution, and proſecutes his deſigns in proportion to the neceſſity and importance of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002987_0012_0FE6AEF892CE83A0"/>
them. When he purſues things of the greateſt Moment and Importance, &amp; wherein there is the greateſt danger of miſcarrying, with the great care, watchfulneſs &amp; aſſiduity; while he purſues matters of an inferiour Nature in a more ſlack and moderate manner. Such an one may be juſtly termed a Wiſe Man, a Man of Prudence.</p>
               <p>But then Wiſdom appears more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, according to the nature, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Affair about which it is exerciſed. Thus if it be a plain and eaſy caſe; attended with little or no difficulty in the contrivance, or management of it: if it be a caſe that Men are acquainted with: and the way wherein it muſt be managed, lies plain before us, without any ſtudy or deep thought about it; this Wiſdom wont ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very conſpicuous. But when the caſe is difficult, and greatly perplexed, when almoſt every one that thinks of it, is poſed and puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about it, and knows not which way to turn, but there appears inſuperable difficulties in the way; then for a Man in ſuch a caſe, to ſee clearly into it, to contrive and purſue a way wherein he may ſteer clear of all the difficulties that ſeem to lie in it, and accompliſh his end; this makes his Wiſdom to ſhine, and appear glorious in the eyes of others. So that it is in perplexed, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult caſes, that Wiſdom is to be tried, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and the fulleſt proofs, and manifeſtations given of it.—Now theſe hints may ſerve to give ſome Idea of the Nature of Wiſdom in general, and wherein it conſiſts. And ſo I proceed to the Second thing propoſed, which was,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002987_0013_0FE6AEF8A6B2FB80"/>II. To Prove the Doctrine; <hi>and ſhow that in in Method GOD has taken for the Redemption of Mankind there are Glorious Manifestation, of Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this truth will appear, if we conſider theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The End propoſed by GOD, in the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Difficulties, and ſeeming Impoſſibilities to any created eye, to accompliſh this end in the Salvation of Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we conſider how fully and effectually the end has been anſwered, and accompliſhed, in the Method GOD has taken for our Redemption.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there have been glorious diſcoveries of Divine Wiſdom will appear, if we conſider the END propoſed by GOD in our Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in General the End propoſed by GOD here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, was <hi>the advancement of his own Glory.</hi> Not his Eſſential Glory: for that was Infinite from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp; ſo can receive no additions to, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions from it. But it was the Advancement of his declarative Glory (as it is ſometimes called by Divines) That is, to ſpeak intelligibly; He did not propoſe to add to his Perfections; for that he knew was impoſſible, but he propoſed to make his Perfections <hi>appear</hi> more Glorious and Conſpicuous to all his Rational, and Intelligent Creatures, that are capable of beholding his Works, and obſerving thoſe Divine Perfections that are Exerciſed, and Manifeſted in them. Indeed GOD's manifeſting his Glory in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002987_0014_0FE6AEFC4A0F9790"/>
is what he aims at in all his Works: this was what he had in view, in the Work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and his end was anſwered by it. For the <hi>Inviſible things of him,</hi> that is, his being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>from the Creation of the World, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made: even his Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.20. And it is the ſame thing he had in view, in the work of our Redemption. The main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign of GOD herein was, to manifeſt and diſplay the Glory of all his Perfections, and not any one of them in particular; &amp; make them all ſhine more Glorious in the Eyes of his Creatures. It was to make known his almighty power, his unſpotted holineſs, his inflexible juſtice, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable depths of wiſdom, and knowledge, and the immenſe riches of his goodneſs, and grace.</p>
               <p>And now what more noble end; and more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of GOD than this, could he propoſe? For as I ſaid before: He could not propoſe to advance his eſſential glory and happineſs, becauſe it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. And now next to <hi>that,</hi> what could he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo proper and ſuitable, as to have this his Glory manifeſted, &amp; acknowleg'd among his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? to let them ſee and behold more, and more of his Greatneſs and his Glory? What greater, or better thing could GOD propoſe, than to manifeſt his Glory ſo to all his Rational Creatures, in Heaven, and Earth, as that they may be moved, and excited thereby, to give him the glory due unto his Name; to adore him as the moſt High GOD; to love and fear him; to obey and ſerve him, to ſubmit to him; to place their Happineſs in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002987_0015_0FE6AEFC5E0BC1D8"/>
enjoyment of him, and to place their confidence in him! Surely if any thing, this is worthy of GOD to aim at; in any of his Works: nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is nothing elſe worthy of the great GOD, to aim at in his works; ſave in a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency and ſubordination to this. And thus ſo far as a good end and deſign will go; the Wiſdom of GOD appeared in our Redemption. For the higheſt, and nobleſt end that could be, was propoſed in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Wiſdom of GOD in our Redemption appears, by <hi>conſidering the Difficulty and ſeeming Impoſſibility of obtaining the end propoſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD (as I obſerved before) propoſed to advance the glory, not only of ſome, but of all his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our Redemption. He propoſed not only to make known the riches of his Mercy and Grace, but alſo his power, juſtice, truth and holineſs. But here lay the difficulty: <hi>viz.</hi> in not only maintaining the harmony of theſe attributes; but in making them all appear more Glorious than ever, in the Salvation and Recovery of fallen Man. And it was a difficulty that all the Men on Earth, or all the Angels in Heaven, could never overcome. They could not find out a way to reconcile them; much leſs to advance the glory of them in ſuch a work. For we muſt underſtand, that Man had wilfully ſinned, and ſo deſtroyed himſelf: he had broken Covenant with GOD, and turned Rebel againſt him; and had thereby expoſed himſelf to the Penalties of the Law, that were threatned in caſe of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and now if GOD had without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002987_0016_0FE6AF03B7EE92B0"/>
overlooked the willful violation of his law, which was ſuch a practical contempt of his Authority, and abuſe of his Goodneſs: and had pardoned and acquitted Sinful and Rebellious Man; it would indeed have magnified and illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Infinite Grace, and Mercy of GOD; it would have ſhown him to be a GOD of Infinite compaſſion: but what would have become of all the other Perfections? How could the honour of them have been ſecured; if GOD had pardoned and ſaved Sinners? How would he have ſecured the honour of his Juſtice, which inclines and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him, to aſſert, and maintain the Rights and prerogatives that belong unto him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to ſee to it, that every Tranſgreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve a juſt recompence of reward? And how could he have ſecured the honour of his holineſs, and ſhow that hatred and abhorrence of ſin, which his holineſs obliges him unto; and yet embrace the Sinner in his Arms of Mercy and Favour? And then again, how could he have ſecured the honour of his truth and veracity, when he had ſo plainly and poſitively threatned Death to the Sinner, if he had ſaved their Souls from Death? Here I ſay, lay difficulties beyond the brighteſt Angel in Heaven to have cleared up. Who could have found out a way wherein GOD might be merciful to the Sinner, and yet juſt to himſelf, and receive full ſatisfaction for all the wrong done to him by ſin? Who could have contrived a way wherein he could ſhow infinite love to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and at the ſame time, and by the ſame action, manifeſt an infinite hatred, and abhorrence
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002987_0017_0FE6AF03D07F1D30"/>
of the ſin it ſelf? Who could find out a way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in GOD might releaſe the Sinner from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet fully execute the threatning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him? Who could have pitched upon a Method wherein GOD ſhould exerciſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite tenderneſs, and compaſſionateneſs to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and by the ſame act fill them with a dread of his Majeſty, and with the moſt convincing apprehenſions of what a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living GOD? Theſe difficulties lay in the way, when GOD enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoughts of Mercy concerning us; and ſurely nothing but Infinite Wiſdom could recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe ſeeming contradictions: much leſs could any thing ſhort of Infinite Wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way that would diſplay all the Divine Perfections: but yet thus it is in the caſe before us. So then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Wiſdom of GOD appears gloriouſly in our Redemption, <hi>if we conſider how fully he has anſwered the end propoſed in the Method he has pitched upon for our Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The End propoſed by GOD (as I hinted before) was not only to maintain the harmony of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with each other; but to make them all ſhine the more gloriouſly. And now this end is fully obtained in the method that GOD has taken for it. For in this Work all the Perfections ſhine with a greater brightneſs, and luſtre than ever: herein <hi>mercy and truth not only meet together, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace kiſs each other:</hi> but they are all magnified and become more illuſtrious. That
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002987_0018_0FE6AF076A0BEA80"/>
the Mercy and Grace of GOD is magnified, and diſplayed herein, every one muſt acknowledge; who will but juſt conſider what a wretched, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, and undone condition we were in by reaſon of Sin; what infinite provocation we had given to GOD, and how unworthy we were of his favour; and how much coſt and pains he has been at to redeem and ſave us: and what a glorious and compleat Salvation is wrought out for us. But then not only the Mercy, but the Juſtice of GOD has been greatly magnified, and advanced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as does moſt evidently appear, by GOD's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon a full ſatisfaction for Sin, before ever he would pardon the Sinner: if not from the Perſon of the Sinner; yet from a ſurety, or one in his ſtead. He inſiſted ſo much upon a compleat and full ſatisfaction, that when there was none but his own Son could ſatisfie the demands of Juſtice; rather than forgive, before the debt was paid to the utmoſt farthing, he gave him up to be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us. And then again, it is certain that GOD never appeared more glorious in Holineſs; than in the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt when he was purchaſing Redemption for us. For what could diſcover a greater hatred of Sin and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt it, than the putting his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and dearly beloved Son into ſuch inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible agonies, and diſtreſſes, when our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were laid upon him! And to mention no more; as for the Truth &amp; Veracity of the Divine Nature: He that conſiders how GOD inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of our Subſtitute, or Surety; (and alſo that all Mankind are now brought into a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002987_0019_0FE6AF0784DBA318"/>
mortal dying State, and that by an irreverſible, and irreſiſtable decree, it is appointed for all men once to die; cannot but ſee, that GOD has had a peculiar regard for the honour of his truth in our Redemption. For altho he redeems and ſaves ſome of the Children of Men from the Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence of the Law; yet in effect, yea and to all intents and purpoſes, the threatning was executed: but then if to this we add the many promiſes he has made in times paſt, concerning Chriſt and the Redemption to be wrought out by him, which he has ſo fully accompliſhed; we ſhall be fully ſatisfied that GOD has made clear manifeſtations of <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>he is a GOD of truth and without iniquity,</hi> yea that <hi>it is Impoſſible for GOD to lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I might go on to all the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: for they are all diſplayed, and the glory of GOD advanced in every article; by the method of Redemption, GOD has pitched upon. Inſomuch that the Multitudes of the heavenly Hoſt unite in giving glory to Him on that account; Singing as they did upon our Saviour's coming into the world to accompliſh this wonderful work, Luke 2.14. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> Chriſt's coming into the world, as it brought <hi>Peace on Earth and ſhewed good will towards men,</hi> ſo it brought <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if the manifeſting the glory of the Divine Perfections, be the higheſt, &amp; the nobleſt end, that GOD can propoſe: and if the obtaining this end in the Redemption of Man was attended with the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002987_0020_0FE6AF1116520510"/>
utmoſt difficulties; difficulties inſuperable to any created reaſon: and if GOD notwithſtanding the difficulties, has fully accompliſhed his end in the method he has pitched upon; then according to the foregoing deſcription of Wiſdom, it follows that GOD has abounded towards us in all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence; and has proved himſelf to be the Infinitely and the only wiſe GOD.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for a general proof of the Doctrine. But as particular Inſtances of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, in the grand affair of our Redemption, will ſerve to give a more clear and convincing demonſtration of the infinite Wiſdom of GOD in this matter; ſo I propoſe, as GOD ſhall enable and give opportunity, to deſcend into ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances of the manner of GOD's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Redemption of Man, and obſerve to you as I go along what Wiſdom and Contrivance there was in managing it after ſuch a particular manner: by taking notice of the Wiſe, the Great and the Good Ends that are anſwered thereby. But I ſhall not enter on theſe at preſent; but conclude with a brief</p>

What we have heard concerning <hi>Wiſdom in general,</hi> may ſerve to inform us, <hi>Who are the truly wiſe Men, and how we must manage our ſelves, if we would obtain this Character.</hi> Surely they are not the wiſe Men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with little mean and inferiour views and deſigns; altho' they purſue never
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002987_0021_0FE6AF112A317F98"/>
ſuch proper means to accompliſh them. They may eſteem themſelves wiſe, and a fooliſh world may call them ſo, who are prudent and politick in temporal Affairs; who make their worldly intereſt the higheſt mark they aim at, and purſue this with utmoſt diligence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: but now ſuch worldly wiſdom will be found in the concluſion to be egregious folly. For if we conſider the dignity of our Natures, the ſuperiour powers and faculties with which they are endowed; we ſhall be ſenſible that it is beneath and unworthy ſuch rational, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls as ours, to let our views and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns terminate in worldly objects; and have our concerns carried no higher than the fading, periſhing enjoyments of this preſent life. And therefore if we would be juſtly accounted wiſe not only in the fight of Men, but in the fight of GOD, who is the beſt judge of true Wiſdom; we muſt take off our affections from the things here below, and not fix <hi>our eyes upon that which is not.</hi> Our grand concern muſt not be about the world, nor the things of it; but we muſt conſider there are greater things for us to have in view: even the Glory of GOD, and the eternal Salvation of our immortal Souls. Theſe are the only things worthy to be the chief End, and ſcope of rational Beings; and as the beſt and only way to accompliſh theſe Ends, is the keeping the Commandments of GOD revealed in his word: ſo if we would be truly wiſe Men, we muſt above every thing elſe aim at the glory of GOD, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002987_0022_0FE6AF124858A478"/>
enjoyment of him. And theſe deſigns we muſt according to the nature &amp; importance of the things, proſecute with utmoſt ſpeed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and conſtancy, by thoſe unerring rules laid down in the Oracles of GOD. In ſhort, we muſt be truly Religious; and then we ſhall be truly Wiſe. Job 28.28. <hi>And unto man he ſaid, behold the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What we have heard of the nature of Wiſdom may ſerve to recommend it to us, and quicken us to a more diligent ſearch after it.</hi> He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Nature of true Wiſdom, will find it a moſt excellent vertue; greatly, and above all, to be deſired. This is that which inriches, and enobles a Man, and makes him more excellent than his Neighbour. For as reaſon raiſes a Man above the level of Beaſts: ſo wiſdom raiſes one Man above another, makes him really a better Man in the fight of GOD, who is the beſt able to judge in ſuch a matter. This then is what we ſhould all be ambitious of, and earneſtly endeavouring after. Prov. 4.7. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the principal thing, therefore get wiſdom, and with all thy getting get understanding.</hi> And ſurely, <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtanding; for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of it is better than the merchandize of ſilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold,</hi> Prov. 3.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, There are many uſeful and practical Inferences might be drawn from what
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002987_0023_0FE6AF125F2F6DD0"/>
has been ſaid of the Wiſdom and Prudence of GOD, that has abounded in the work of our Redemption; but I ſhall leave them to cloſe the ſubject withal; and ſhall at preſent only ſay in general: —</p>
                  <p>Since GOD, in the affair of our Redemption, has abounded towards us in all Wiſdom, and Prudence, <hi>Let us give him the glory of it.</hi> Let us acknowledge, and adore him as the only wiſe GOD, who is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in working. Let us apply our ſelves to him, as to the fountain of wiſdom, for all that wiſdom that is profitable, and neceſſary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in all our ways; agreable to the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Encouragement given by the Apoſtle, James 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and up-braideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, from the infinite Wiſdom of GOD appearing in the work of our Redemption; let us be convinced, that every thing is ordered by conſummate Wiſdom, and Prudence: and let us accordingly acquieſce, and reſt ſatisfied in all the diſpenſations of his Providence; how dark and unaccountable ſo ever they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us; believing and realizing <hi>this,</hi> that altho' we can't ſee thro' many of GOD's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſpenſations to us; yet that <hi>he</hi> does, and that nothing befalls us, but what is the reſult of infinite and unerring Wiſdom. And by a ſuitable ſubmiſſion to, and careful improvement of all GOD's dealings, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations to us, we ſhall be brought at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002987_0024_0FE6AF1BF5228A00"/>
length to that bleſſed place, where we ſhall have all the Myſteries of divine Providence unravel'd to us, and ſhall to our unſpeakable admiration and ſatisfaction ſee infinite Wiſdom and Contrivance in every Diſpenſation, and in every Circumſtance of it.</p>

               <p>HAving in the former Diſcourſe, given a general proof of the Doctrine; and ſhown that GOD in the Method he has taken for the Redemption of Man has abounded towards us in all Wiſdom, and Prudence: I propoſed for the more full, clear, and convincing evidence of this truth, to give ſome particular Instances in the affair of our Redemption, and ſhow how the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nifeſted and diſplayed in them; by mentioning ſome of the wiſe, great, and good Ends that are anſwered by them.</p>
               <p>And here,</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>GOD's refuſing to treat with Man, any other way than by a</hi> MEDIATOR, <hi>was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' GOD entertained thoughts, and purpoſes of Mercy concerning us, in our fallen, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Eſtate; yet he did not ſee cauſe to deal with us Immediately, and by himſelf: but in and by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002987_0025_0FE6AF1C0E62B188"/>
a third Perſon, or Mediator. Hence the Apoſtle tells us, that as there is <hi>one God</hi>: ſo there is <hi>one Mediator between God and Man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. Since the fall, GOD has not ſeen cauſe to reveal his mind, and will, or any way to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us, but by a Mediator. Nor will he allow us to come into his preſence; to pay our adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or make our addreſſes unto him, but in and thro' a Mediator that he has appointed for us. Thro' this Mediator only <hi>have we acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 2.18. He does not allow us to come before him in our own Name, to preſent our Prayers, and Praiſes on our own account, and therefore does the Apoſtle direct us in Col. 3.17. <hi>Whatever ye do, in word or deed; do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus</hi> (who is the Mediator) <hi>giving thanks to God, and the Father by him.</hi> And our <hi>Spiritual ſacrifices are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, only thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. And now in this there appears a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence. Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſerves to ſet forth the Infinite purity, and holineſs of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>If GOD (after we had ſinned againſt him, and brought ſuch a dreadful pollution, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement upon our natures) had given us free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of acceſs into his preſence; without the help, mediation, or interceſſion of another: How would he have ſhown, or manifeſted the infinite diſtance between himſelf, and a ſinful creature? Would he not by admitting us into his preſence without a Mediator, have appeared too reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002987_0026_0FE6AF1D3841B7D8"/>
to Sin &amp; Sinners? Would he not have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obſcured the glory of his holineſs, and have given ſome countenance to Sin? If GOD had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an immediate intercourſe with Sinners; how could it have appeared to Men or Angels that GOD bore an infinite hatred of all Sin, as is declared of him? And therefore GOD to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the honour of his holineſs, keeps Man at a diſtance from him. Our iniquities had ſeparated between us, and our GOD, and hid his face from us; and GOD would not ſuffer us to approach unto him, after that, but thro' a Mediator, that he had appointed, to conſecrate a new, and a living way for us. But he looks upon it as daring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in any, to offer up either prayers, or praiſes to him in their own names: and he rejects such offerings with utmoſt deteſtation &amp; abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. By which it plainly appears that he is of <hi>purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> and that <hi>the wicked ſhall not stand in his fight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>treating with Man only in and by a Mediator, ſerves for this good purpoſe,</hi> viz. <hi>to ſet forth the greatneſs of the Divine Majeſty, &amp; to poſſeſs our Souls with an holy awe, &amp; reverence of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When GOD refuſes to have any thing to do with us; or that we ſhould have any thing to do with him, but by a Mediator, it leads us to this apprehenſion of him, that there is ſuch infinite Majeſty and Greatneſs with him, as cant with any propriety admit ſuch duſt and aſhes as we are into his immediate preſence. When an Earthly
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002987_0027_0FE6AF1D52A25ED8"/>
Monarch, keeps his Subjects at ſuch a diſtance as not to permit them to come into his preſence, nor ask to receive any favour from him immediately, but only by the mediation of the Nobility, and the great Men that make his Court; it ſerves to ſet forth the grandure of ſuch a Prince, and raiſes the apprehenſions of his Subjects concerning the ſplendor and greatneſs of his Majeſty, and fills them with fear, and trembling at the thoughts of coming into his preſence.</p>
               <p>Thus the King of Heaven, that we might have ſuitable apprehenſions of his Majeſty, and his glory, keeps us at a diſtance; as he did the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael from Mount Sinai, when he deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, to deliver the Law unto them: and wont ſuffer our approaches to him, any nearer than by a third Perſon, or Mediator: who being GOD as well as Man; is able, and worthy to approach his immediate preſence, which we are not. And now as hereby GOD plainly teaches us, that he will be worſhipped with reverence, and godly fear, that he will be Sanctified by all them that draw near unto him, and before the people he will be glorified: ſo it ſerves to fill us with an holy awe, and reverence towards the infinite Majeſty of Heaven, when ever we are about to wait upon him: which is a moſt wiſe contrivance. For it is highly proper that GOD's <hi>excellency ſhould make us afraid, and his dread fall upon us,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>ſerve the Lord with fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rejoyce with trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>GOD's treating with us only by a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator was an inſtance of Wiſdom; as it was an act of kind condeſention to our Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002987_0028_0FE6AF27400FDE80"/>Such is the Infinite Glory, and Splendor of the Divine Majeſty, that the Angels are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented covering their faces; as not being able to behold the brightneſs of his Glory, much leſs are Men able to endure it. Hence the Apoſtle ſays of him, <hi>that he dwells in the light which no Man can approach unto: whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. It is impoſſible for us to have acceſs into the immediate preſence of the Divine Majeſty without being overcome with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Glory. And therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee GOD's Glory; GOD tells him <hi>Thou cannot ſee my face, for there ſhall no man ſee me and live,</hi> Exod. 33.18, 20. And therefore GOD has conſidered our frame, and remembred that we are but duſt; and ſo has appointed a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, which altho' he be the brighteſt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon; yet his Glory being vailed in our Nature, we may be able to behold him, and approach unto him with our addreſſes, who will preſent them unto his Father: for he is paſſed into the Heavens, to appear in the preſence of GOD for us, which is an inſtance of Wiſdom as well as Grace in GOD.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Another inſtance of Divine Wiſdom, was GOD's inſisting upon a</hi> SATISFACTION <hi>for Sin, in order to his Pardoning, and Saving the Sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Satisfaction for Sin, we are to underſtand ſomething that will repair the wrong done to GOD by Sin. Now GOD is wronged by Sin as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002987_0029_0FE6AF2753D2EBB0"/>
his perfections are practically denied, clouded, and diſhonored by it: and conſequently what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done, or ſuffered, that will vindicate the divine perfections, and make them appear as bright and glorious, as if we had never Sinned; is what I underſtand by <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> And now, That GOD did require a ſuitable ſatisfaction for Sin, that is, for the wrong done to him by Sin, appears from this; that GOD has taken care that ſuch a ſatisfaction ſhould be made, and becauſe all that are juſtified, and ſaved from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſaved by vertue of that Satisfaction. GOD determined that <hi>without ſhedding of blood</hi> to make attonement, <hi>there ſhould be no remiſſion of ſin,</hi> Heb. 9.22. Accordingly Chriſt's ſhedding his blood, and all the ſufferings he underwent, was to make ſatisfaction for ſin. And he that will attend the moſt plain, and obvious ſenſe of many places of Scripture, will be convinced of this truth. Thus we are ſaid to be <hi>bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. And we are ſaid to be <hi>redeemed not with corruptible things, ſuch as ſilver, and gold: but with the precious blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. And we are ſaid to <hi>have redemption thro' his blood, the forgiveneſs of our ſins, in the verſe</hi> proceeding the Text: which plainly teaches us there was ſatisfaction made by the blood of Chriſt, and that upon the account of <hi>that ſatisfaction</hi> it is that GOD ever pardons and ſaves a Sinner. And there are a multitude of other Texts that ſerve to confirm this point. As where Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for us, to be made ſin for us, to be made a curſe for us, and to bear our ſins in his own body on the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002987_0030_0FE6AF289CD3CE78"/>
tree.</hi> But I ſhall not enter into this controverſy with the <hi>Socinians</hi>; who deny the Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction: but ſhall take the thing for granted.</p>
               <p>And now behold the Wiſdom, and the Prudence of GOD in it! Indeed it is not for us ſay ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, GOD could not have pardoned without a Satisfaction: he might for any thing we can tell; by a ſovereign act of Grace hare pardoned all the World, and paſſed by the wrong, and diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our done to him y Sin. But this we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay; that it was much the beſt that there ſhould be a ſuitable price paid for our ranſom. For altho' GOD in pardoning without ſatisfaction might have magnified his goodneſs, his mercy, and his grace: Yet it does not appear to us, how the honour of his other perfections could have been ſecured, much leſs advanced. Nay it ſeems to us, as if ſome reflection would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably have been caſt upon GOD, if he had not inſiſted upon a ſuitable ſatisfaction. Would not his ſpotleſs purity, and holineſs been called in queſtion, and a doubt ariſen among his Rational Creatures, whether he bore ſuch an infinite hatred to Sin, as was declared of him? Or would there not have been ſome diſhonourable reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Juſtice? For how could we imagine GOD to be juſt to himſelf and maintain the rights and prerogatives that belong to him; and yet ſuffer Sin to go unpuniſhed? How could we imagine GOD to be juſt to himſelf, and yet ſuffer his Laws to be violated, and thereby his Authority to be trampled upon, his goodneſs abuſed, and all
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002987_0031_0FE6AF28B38CB760"/>
his perfections implicitly denied; and he demand no ſatisfaction for it, nor take any other notice of it than to forgive the offender and receive him into favour? But ſuppoſing GOD ſhould have eſcaped any reflection, as to his being unjuſt to himſelf; yet if GOD had pardoned without ſatisfaction, would it not be ſaid by ſome, as if GOD had not wiſely contrived the Covenant, that he at firſt made with Man; that he had given a hard and unreaſonable law, and laid too heavy a yoke upon us, or had threatned too ſevere a penalty, or had given too great power to the Devil in tempting our firſt Parents; which GOD being now ſenſible of, forgave them without any Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>But then to ſay no more: If no diſhonour ſhould be reflected on GOD on theſe accounts; yet we cannot ſee but that he would at leaſt be charged with mutability, and changeableneſs of mind. For GOD having poſitively threatned Death, in caſe of ſin, and diſobedience, what leſs could be ſaid but that he had altered his mind, if he had paſſed by their ſin without having Death ſuffered either by themſelves, or by their ſurety, and even this would have been no ſmall diſhonour to GOD: for this is one of the glories of the Divine Nature, that <hi>he is not a man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould repent,</hi> Numb. 23.19. <hi>He is of one mind, and none can turn him,</hi> Job 25.13. <hi>And he is Lord that changes not.</hi> Mal. 3.6. All which being laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether makes it appear how highly proper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not neceſſary, it was, for GOD to inſiſt upon a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002987_0032_0FE6AF2F236DE688"/>
for Sin; before he pardons it. And this alſo ſhows the infinite Wiſdom of GOD, that altho' he was infinite in Mercy, and ready to pardon; yet at the ſame time took care, that Mercy ſhould not prevail to the damage of any other Perfections. For GOD by demanding a Satisfaction for Sin has wiſely, and impartially conſulted the honour of all his attributes. For by demanding Satisfaction for Sin, he remains as holy, and as juſt as ever, even in the eyes of all his Creatures. By this, alſo he ſtands by his own Laws, that he gave to Man at firſt, and aſſerts the holineſs, juſtice, and goodneſs of them, and that nothing hard or unreaſonable was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon us. Moreover by this he ſhows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be immutable; that there is not the leaſt variableneſs, nor ſhaddow of turning, but that he is always of one mind, by this it appears that he has the ſame regard for his own honour as ever, that he has the ſame ſenſe of Sin and of his Laws that ever he had.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly, altho' at firſt view, it may ſeem that there is no great Mercy, or Grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the pardoning Sinners; when there has been a full, and compleat Satisfaction made for all the wrong done by their Sin: Yet if we conſider that GOD might have refuſed any but a Perſonal Satisfaction, and inſiſted upon that rule, <hi>that the Soul that ſins ſhall die</hi>; it appears to be an act of Grace to accept of the Satisfaction made by a ſurety. And if we do but conſider who the Surety was and by whom the Satisfaction for Sin was made; the glory of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002987_0033_0FE6AF2F372101B0"/>
divine grace and mercy will in this way ſhine as bright as any of the Divine Perfections.</p>
               <p>Which leads me to the third Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>GOD's appointing the Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>his only begotten</hi> SON <hi>to be the Mediator, to undertake the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; was another inſtance of Wiſdom, &amp; Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may ſuppoſe a grand Council held by the Sacred THREE that bear record in Heaven; to pitch upon a proper Perſon to undertake the Salvation of Men, and to be a Mediator between us. And here we may ſuppoſe the Father ſaying, as in Iſaiah 6.8. <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us</hi>? To which we may ſuppoſe the Son to reply in the following words, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi> And this was agreed and conſented to: accordingly he was ſent into the World to aſſume our Nature into perſonal union with his Divine Nature. Hence we read John 1.14. <hi>that the word,</hi> that is the Eternal Word, <hi>the word that was with God and the word that was God and by whom all things were made, was made fleſh and dwelt among us.</hi> And now Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was the very perſon. For he was once &amp; again declared by an audible voice from Heaven, to be the beloved Son of GOD. And that Perſon is expreſsly declared to be the Mediator between GOD, and us, 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now GOD's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing his own Son, to be the Mediator was an
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002987_0034_0FE6AF33CDFA5E80"/>
inſtance of conſummate Wiſdom. And that for this reaſon in general; becauſe he was the moſt proper, and ſuitable perſon that could be for this Office. It is certainly an inſtance of prudence to chuſe the moſt proper perſon for any ſervice: and herein appears the Wiſdom of GOD. For the perſon he has conſtituted, and appointed to be Mediator, is the moſt proper perſon that could be for that Office.</p>
               <p>And this will appear if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some of the <hi>Qualifications</hi> neceſſary for a Mediator.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How peculiarly theſe Qualifications centred in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Son of GOD.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us conſider ſame of the neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, by neceſſary Qualifications; I mean ſuch as will capacitate, and enable a perſon fully, and in the beſt manner to anſwer the ends of the Office; ſuch Qualifications as will enable him not only to keep up the harmony but to advance the Glory of all the Divine Perfections, in the Salvaion, and recovery of fallen Man.</p>
               <p>And here it may be ſaid,</p>
               <p n="1">1. One Qualification neceſſary for a Mediator is, that he ſhould be <hi>choſen and approved of GOD.</hi> For as GOD might have inſiſted upon a perſonal Satisfaction from us, and might have refuſed whatever ſhould be offered by another, even altho' it was in it ſelf equivalent; ſo it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould have the choice, &amp; approbation of the perſon whoſe ſacrifice, and offering he would accept on our account.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002987_0035_0FE6AF33E43C65D0"/>2. Another neceſſary Qualification for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is, that <hi>he ſhould be perfectly pure, and holy: free from all manner of Sin, and Guilt of his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if a Mediator ſhould have any Sin of his own, that would be enough and more than he could ſatisfie for; and conſequently his Sufferings how ſevere ſoever, could be of no avail for the Sins of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is further requiſite for a Mediator, <hi>that he be one that was not under a previous obligation to the law, he is to obey in this ſtead of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if he ſhould have been under obligations to fulfill the Law before his undertaking the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, his obedience to the law would be only doing his duty: and ſo could have no merit in it for others. His obedience could not have been a meritorious obedience and ſo could not have been imputed to us for Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another neceſſary Qualification of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is, that <hi>he ſhould be very near and dear to GOD, greatly beloved of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was very neceſſary for the illuſtrating the Divine Perfections in the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus it was neceſſary that the Mediator ſhould be the beloved of GOD's Soul, to manifeſt his holineſs, and hatred of Sin in puniſhing him, when our iniquities were laid upon him: for if it was one that GOD had no particular regard for, it would not appear ſo clearly, when he ſhould be under the Divine Wrath, that it was all for Sins imputed to him. It might look as if GOD pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed him ſo ſeverely more for want of love to him, than thro' hatred of Sin. Moreover impartial,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002987_0036_0FE6AF3DE34E40F8"/>
and inflexible Juſtice appears more conſpicuous in inflicting the full deſert of Sin upon him that is dearly beloved, and for whom we have the moſt tender regards, than on one that we have little or no affection for. And then again, it was very neceſſary for the manifeſtation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace that the perſon whom GOD gives to be a Mediator to die, and ſuffer for us, ſhould be infinitely dear unto him. For if it had been one that GOD had little or no regard for; there would not appear any great meaſure of Love, in giving him for us: but the nearer and dearer the perſon is to GOD, that he gives to redeem and ſave us, the more clearly would hiss love &amp; grace be manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it was neceſſary the Mediator ſhould be very near and dear to GOD, for the comfort and encouragement of ſuch: that they might be well aſſured of his intereſt with GOD, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of his Interceſſions, and of their perſons and performances being accepted <hi>in the Beloved.</hi> Surely when the Saints conſider that the Mediator is one in whom GOD is ever well pleaſed, it will encourage their hopes, and ſtrengthen their faith in him, and they muſt look upon themſelves as ſafe and ſecure with him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Qualification requiſite for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator <hi>is that he ſhould partake of both Natures, between which he Mediates: that is, that he ſhould be both GOD, and Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Mediator ſhould partake of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſeems very neceſſary; ſeeing he was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for both parties. He was as a days man
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002987_0037_0FE6AF3DF71B7F88"/>
to lay his hand upon us both: and by partaking of both natures; he muſt needs have an impartial regard for each.</p>
               <p>It was neceſſary the Mediator ſhould be GOD to give vertue, and value to his ſufferings. For nothing leſs than the ſufferings of him, who is truly GOD can give ſuch demonſtrations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite juſtice, and holineſs, as to ſecure the honour of theſe perfections in the Salvation of Sinful Man.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the buſineſs of the Mediator was ſuch as required nothing leſs than the Wiſdom and the Power of GOD to accompliſh it. The buſineſs of the Mediator is to convert, &amp; change the hearts of Sinners, to ſubdue, and conquer their enemies for them, even <hi>principalities, and powers, and the ruler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the darkneſs of this world</hi>: to overrule all things in providence for the good of the Redeemed: his buſineſs is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to diſcern and obſerve the motions of Mens Hearts, as well as their outward carriage, and to judge the ſecrets of Men. Now theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that Wiſdom and Power that dont belong to any Creature, but are Divine Prerogatives. Surely nothing leſs than the <hi>Wonderful Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and the mighty God</hi> could <hi>perform all theſe things for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then it was as neceſſary alſo that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator ſhould be <hi>Man,</hi> and that in order to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capacitated to ſuffer for Sin at all; or at leaſt in order to his Suffering in the ſame Nature that offended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which muſt be thought highly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if not abſolutely neceſſary: for if he had
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002987_0038_0FE6AF3F13F6DAE8"/>
taken any other than the humane nature, the fallen Angels might have laid claim to the merit of his Sufferings as ſoon as we, but ſeeing he took not on him the nature of Angels; but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>; it gives the moſt comfortable aſſurances, that his undertaking is on our account, and that he is our Mediator, and Saviour. And then as he was to teach men the way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Doctrine, and by his Example; ſo upon theſe accounts it was moſt reaſonable, yea very neceſſary, that he ſhould take upon him our nature, <hi>be made fleſh and dwell among us.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>in all things,</hi> upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>it behoved him</hi> that was to be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>that he ſhould be made like unto his brethren; that he might be a merciful, and faithful high Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſin of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe are ſome of the neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a Mediator.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider <hi>how peculiarly Chriſt the Son of God was thus Qualified</hi> for this Office; which will ſhow the Wiſdom and Prudence of GOD, in making choice of him for that ſervice.</p>
               <p>And here it muſt be ſaid, that there was no perſon in Heaven, or Earth that was ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and peculiarly Qualified for it, as he was. For as he was the perſon that GOD <hi>Choſe,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and accepted of; ſo had he all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualifications. Thus he was perfectly <hi>pure</hi> and holy: it is ſaid of him that <hi>he knew no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22. <hi>And he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002987_0039_0FE6AF3F2ACB94E8"/>
from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. He was free not only from all actual ſin, but from all natural corruption: for altho' he was born of a Woman; yet his Conception was in ſuch a way, as to eſcape the natural pollution; (the wiſdom of which may hereafter be conſidered) by which means he had nothing of his own to anſwer for, and therefore all his Sufferings muſt be purely on our account.</p>
               <p>Moreover, conſider him <hi>as GOD,</hi> and he was under no previous obligation to obey the Law of GOD given to Man. For altho' there was an exact conformity to theſe Laws in the Divine Mind, they being all holy, juſt and good, yet it had not the nature of obedience: for obedience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ctly ſpeaking, is a ſubjection to a law from the Authority of the Lawgiver. But now in this ſence, Chriſt as he was GOD was under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to obedience; for he was the Lawgiver himſelf, and was ſubject to no Superiour Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore for him to put himſelf into ſuch a ſtate, wherein he might yeild obedience to the Law, as it was an act of Infinite condeſcention in him; ſo there muſt needs be infinite merit in ſuch obedience.</p>
               <p>And further he had this peculiar Qualification that he partook of both natures; he was both GOD, and Man, as is moſt frequently, and fully declared of him, in the word of GOD, where he is called, <hi>the great God, and our Saviour,</hi> Tit 2.13. And <hi>the only wiſe God,</hi> Jude 25. Where alſo all Divine attributes are aſcribed to him: and all Divine homage and adoration directed to be paid
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002987_0040_0FE6AF4794A07CB0"/>
to him. And we are alſo aſſured from the ſame Infallible Oracles, that the Eternal Word was made fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. And that he who is the Mediator between GOD and us, is the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And then again, as another neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Mediator was that he ſhould be one very <hi>near and dear</hi> to GOD; ſo none on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was ever qualified to ſuch an high degree as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for he was infinitely near and dear unto GOD. Who can be ſo dear to him as his only begotten Son? He once &amp; again declared him to be <hi>his beloved Son, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>om he was well pleaſed.</hi> As at his Baptiſm; and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. — 17. And he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically called, THE BELOVED, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Intimating to us that he is beloved above all others: on which account there was no perſon in whom GOD could have manifeſted his impartial Juſtice, his infinite hatred of Sin, and yet at the ſame time his infinite love to Sinners, as in the perſon of his Son. Nay it may be ſaid in that the Son of GOD ſeems to be the moſt proper of the Sacred THREE in the glorious Godhead. It does not ſeem as if infinite holineſs, and juſtice, infinite love, and grace would have appeared ſo conſpicuous, if any other perſon in the Trinity had undertaken this work. And ſo the Wiſdom of GOD appears in pitching on this very perſon in particular, and not on the Father, or the Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Spirit: and this would appear with reſpect to the Father in particular, if we might venture to form any notion of the matter, from the Relation of a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002987_0041_0FE6AF47A86D6550"/>
Father and a Son among Men. Now affection more naturally deſcends from Parents to Children; than aſcends from Children to Parents. And therefore the higheſt, and ſtrongeſt affection, we can imagine among Men, is that of a Father to a Son, eſpecially to an only Son: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Man could not give a better manifeſtation of his impartiality, and juſtice; than in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Son according to the demerit of any Crimes he may be guilty of; and not ſpare him at all, thro' natural affection: nor could a Man ſhow greater love, and kindneſs to another than in giving up ſuch a Son for his ſake, or than for ſuch a Son to be willing to be given up. I ſay, conſidering the courſe of natural affections, this appears to be a greater thing, than for a Son to deal ſo by a Father. And now the Son of GOD is infinitely nearer, and dearer to him than a firſt born or an only Son. And conſequently it is impoſſible for us to conceive of ſo high an inſtance of impartial juſtice, and infinite holineſs; as GOD's puniſhing his Son ſo ſeverely, when our iniquities were laid upon him: nor of ſo high an inſtants of love as when he gave this his Son to die for us, or when this Son conſented to give himſelf for us; to leave the boſom of his, Father, to be made fleſh, and dwell among us. And hence our Saviour tells us, John 3.16. That <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his</hi> ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. And now ſince GOD's deſign was to magnifie, and illuſtrate his juſtice, his holineſs, and his grace, we cannot but ſee and admire the Wiſdom and Contrivance, in the very
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002987_0042_0FE6AF49D03D6CC8"/>
perſon that was pitched upon for the office of a Mediator, even the Eternal Son of GOD who was ſo wonderfully and peculiarly qualified for that Office.</p>
               <p>There are many more inſtances of Wiſdom, in managing this affair of our Redemption: but I muſt leave them to another opportunity.</p>
               <p>And now in a word: let us admire, and adore the Wiſdom of GOD; that does thus far diſcover it ſelf in this grand affair. Let us ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Divine prudence in refuſing to treat with Sinners any other way than by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; in demanding, and receiving full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Sin before he would pardon and ſave the Sinner, and eſpecially in making choice of his own Son, for our Mediator, and Saviour, ſo eminently, and peculiarly qualified for the office: who is able to maintain, yea and advance the honour of all the Divine perfections; even when he ſaves to the uttermoſt, all that come unto GOD by him. And now ſince the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator, that GOD in his infinite Wiſdom has appointed for us; let us believe him to be the moſt proper perſon for that Office; and let us teſtifie our conſent to it by accepting, &amp; imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with all our hearts, as our Mediator, and Saviour. Let us receive him in all his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Offices; as the Prophet, Prieſt, and King of our Salvation. Let us commit the whole affair of our Salvation to him, looking upon him as able, and alſufficient. Let us depend upon him for righteouſneſs, and ſtrength, and for eternal life; and for every thing that may ſit and qualifie us
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002987_0043_0FE6AF49E64D6798"/>
for it. Let the life we live here in the fleſh be by the faith of the Son of GOD. Let us live a life of dependance upon him, and then we ſhall find him to be an alſufficient Saviour unto us. We ſhall then Experience him to be the moſt proper perſon to have ſuch an affair committed to him, and he will appear more and more to us to be the Wiſdom of GOD as well as the Power of GOD.</p>

               <p>THE point before us is to prove the Wiſdom of GOD in the Redemption of fallen Man. And after a general proof of this truth, I propoſed for a more clear, and convincing demonſtration of it, to deſcend into ſome particular inſtances in the managing this grand affair; and obſerve the wonderful Wiſdom and Prudence of GOD that has appeared therein</p>
               <p>And here I have in my former Diſcourſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, 1. In his refuſing to treat with fallen Man, any other way; than by a <hi>Mediator.</hi> 2. In his inſiſting upon full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the wrong done to him by Sin, before he would come into any terms of peace and reconciliation with us. 3. In appointing <hi>his own Son</hi> to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and Redeemer of Mankind. And have ſhown what wonderful Wiſdom, and Contrivance there was exerciſed herein.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to another Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:002987_0044_0FE6AF53216B9678"/>IV. <hi>The manner of GOD's promiſing, and publiſhing the</hi> NEWS <hi>of a Saviour to fallen Man, diſcovers a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That GOD publiſhed his gracious purpoſes to ſave Man, appears from the many propheſies, and promiſes of a Saviour recorded in the Old Teſtament, many ages before he appeared unto us. Thus Man had no ſooner Sinned, and ruined himſelf, but GOD promiſed a Saviour to him, in Gen. 3 15. <hi>That the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head.</hi> Which altho' it may ſeem a dark and obſcure promiſe to us, at this day; yet doubtleſs they underſtood more by it, than we could poſſibly have gathered from the words; had we not received the fulfillment of the promiſe, to aſſiſt us in the interpretation. And now this was the promiſe, or the Goſpel, which the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs lived upon; and were juſtified by their faith in it. But then afterwards, when thro' diſtance of time, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe grew more dark perhaps, and unintelligible to them or at leaſt when they began to doubt, and be diſcouraged, becauſe of the delay of the fulfillment of it; then GOD renewed the promiſe with conſiderable additions, to <hi>Abraham</hi>; reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, that the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or Saviour ſhould be of his ſeed, and that in him ſhould <hi>all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12.3. And then he went on further; and declared to <hi>Jacob,</hi> of which of his Sons, he ſhould come, even of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and not only declared of what tribe he ſhould deſcend; but alſo gave a certain
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002987_0045_0FE6AF53353E2080"/>
                  <hi>period</hi> of time: before which he ſhould come, <hi>viz</hi> before the <hi>Scepter</hi> entirely <hi>departed from Judah, or the lawgiver from between his feet,</hi> Gen. 49 10. And then GOD went on gradually as he found there was occaſion for it to make further diſcoveries of the Meſſiah; as to inform of what particular Family, or Lineage he was to come; and alſo of the Miraculous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Birth, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 7.14. — 9.6, 7. And a multitude of particular circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his Life, and Death were propheſied of him; as that he ſhould be a <hi>Man of ſorrow, and acquainted with grief; that he ſhould be wounded for our tranſgreſſions, &amp; bruiſed for our iniquities, and at laſt pour out his Soul unto death.</hi> And much more to the ſame purpoſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53<hi>d.</hi> Chapter, which is ſo very expreſs, and particular that it ſeems to be rather an Hiſtory than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy of thoſe times. And then as the time drew nearer; GOD proceeded to reveal the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time when the Meſſiah ſhould appear to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 9.24. <hi>Seventy weeks,</hi> that is prophetical weeks, which make four hundred, and ninety years, <hi>are determined unto thy people, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, &amp; make an end of ſin, and to make reconciliation for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the viſion, and propheſy, and to anoint the most holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, beſides a multitude of promiſes, and prophecies concerning Chriſt, in almoſt every age of the Church; there were certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> inſtituted, and app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inted by GOD; to typify, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002987_0046_0FE6AF5451095018"/>
keep up a lively ſenſible repreſentation of Chriſt to their minds: and lead them to a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thought, and conſideration of him, and of the promiſes, and prophecies relating to him.</p>
               <p>Thus, altho' we have no expreſs mention of GOD's appointing <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> immediately after the fall; yet we have abundant reaſon to think he did; from their coming ſo early into the practice of it: and eſpecially if we conſider that GOD had reſpect unto their offerings; when they were made with ſuitable diſpoſitions of mind: as it is ſaid he had to the offerings of <hi>Abel,</hi> Gen. 4.4. which we can't ſuppoſe he would, unleſs he had inſtituted, and appointed ſuch Sacrifices to be offered to him. But then afterwards, we find them expreſsly commanded; and what a vaſt variety of them was inſtituted under the Law; for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were then the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible Church, that GOD had in the World. And now theſe Sacrifices could not be appointed, from any virtue, or merit in themſelves, to make atonement for Sin: for they were utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for this. The Apoſtle tells us, Heb. 10.4. <hi>It was not poſſible for the blood of bulls, and of goats, to take away ſin.</hi> And they themſelves were ſenſible of this: eſpecially the wiſer and more underſtanding part of them. As appears from what the Prophet ſays, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? ſhall I come before him with burnt offerings, with Calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or with ten thouſand of rivers of oyl? ſhall I
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002987_0047_0FE6AF5467403BA8"/>
give my firſt born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul</hi>? Which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations plainly intimate, that theſe Sacrifices altho' never ſo many, and coſtly, could not make atonement for Sin; and conſequently were only typical of the great Sacrifice Chriſt was to make of himſelf, once at the end of the World, to take away Sin. And the deſign of them was, no doubt, to keep up a thought of Chriſt in their minds, and to lead them to a dependance upon him alone for Pardon, and Salvation. And altho the thoughts of the common and more ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might terminate with the Sacrifices before them: yet it cant be thought but that the wiſer of them, had their thought, and their dependance, upon a more perfect Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>And now GOD in theſe promiſes, prophecies, and typical repreſentations; that he made of Chriſt before his coming, has manifeſted a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence; in as much as many great, and good ends, have been anſwered by them. Theſe things have been very much for the glory of GOD, and of great ſervice, and benefit to Mankind.</p>
               <p n="1">1 GOD's thus promiſing, and publiſhing the News of a Saviour was very much <hi>for the Glory of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the Divine perfections have been il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated, and made glorious hereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe things ſerve to ſet forth the glory of Divine <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How wonderful does the Grace of GOD to Sinful Man appear, in that firſt promiſe he made
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002987_0048_0FE6AF58F3AF3380"/>
to him, conſidering not only the matter of the promiſe it ſelf, but alſo the time and ſeaſon in which it was made! Our firſt Parents having acted ſo contrary to the poſitive prohibition, that GOD had given them, and therein abuſed his Goodneſs, as well as rebelled againſt his Sovereign Authority: They could expect nothing but that GOD's Anger ſhould wax hot againſt them, and that he ſhould Immediately proceed to pronounce, and then execute the Sentence of death upon them. But behold that which they thought would have been the day of vengeance, became <hi>a time of love.</hi> And the bleſſed GOD, inſtead of executing vengeance upon them, meditated mercy for them, and promiſed the ſame unto them. And now, how could GOD have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his grace to our firſt Parents more illuſtriouſly; than when he had called them forth, after they had thro' ſhame, and guilt endeavoured to flee from his preſence: and when they ſtood trembling before him, expecting every moment to have the dreadful Sentence paſſed and executed on them; to have at that very juncture the promiſe of a Saviour made unto them! Surely that muſt needs fill their hearts with the higheſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his infinite grace. And altho' GOD did proceed to denounce the Sentence of Death for their Sin, and did actually turn them out of Paradiſe: yet how gracious did he appear when he gave them the promiſe of a Saviour before hand, to be a cordial to ſupport and comfort them? How wonderful did his grace appear, that before he diſpoſſeſt them of their earthly Paradiſe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002987_0049_0FE6AF590C6B7D38"/>
he gave them the comfortable hopes &amp; proſpects of an Heavenly one! But then as that firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was a wonderful manifeſtation of grace, and mercy to <hi>Men</hi>: ſo was it a ſurpriſing diſcovery of divine grace to all the <hi>Angels in Heaven.</hi> They had ſome time before, ſeen their fellow Creatures that rebelled, actually turned out of Heaven; without any promiſe or proſpect of Mercy. But now to hear GOD making a promiſe of a Saviour to fallen Man; muſt needs fill them with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and Wonder at the Sovereign diſtinction of Divine Grace: and inſtead of the leaſt murmur againſt GOD for paſſing by their Brethren that fell, or envious thought at Men, whom GOD thus diſtinguiſhed by his grace, they were filled with raptures of joy at the unexpected manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of grace and mercy, and no doubt broke forth in Songs of praiſe, as they did when the Saviour, the mercy promiſed, actually appeared, Luke 2.14. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, good will towards men!</hi>

How kind and gracious and condeſcending did GOD diſcover himſelf to be in the frequent renewing the promiſe of a Saviour to his Church and People?

And thus GOD to manifeſt the glory of his truth, for many ages and generations before hand promiſed a Saviour, and foretold by the mouth of his Prophets, many particular inſtances relating to his coming. And now all thoſe being accompliſhed to a tittle when he came, it gives a clear demonſtration (to all, that have ever read the Prophecy, and the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory) of the infinite truth, and faithfulneſs of GOD, it plainly ſhows that he is not <hi>a man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> but that when he has ſaid, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do it, and <hi>that heaven, and earth ſhall ſooner paſs away, than one word that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, or foretold.</hi>

And then he that has this preſcience, or knowledge of things future in &amp; of himſelf, muſt needs have the abſolute government of all things in his hands. For it is impoſſible for a Being to have the certain knowledge of things future; eſpecially if they depend upon moral Agents for the performance of them; without having the government of all things in his hands, whereby he is able ſo to overrule, as to accompliſh what he has decre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, and predicted. Accordingly GOD's foretelling ſo many things concerning Chriſt, ſo many ages before his coming; plainly demonſtrates that he is a GOD that knows all things; &amp; that his providence, &amp; government is as extenſive as his knowledge: which ſerves yet further to ſhew forth the glory of GOD.

For without the promiſes, there would have been no foundation for any hopes: and then the repeating, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the promiſes in the ſeveral ages, ſerved mightily to ſtrengthen the faith, and hope of the Saints in every age. But then the daily, and conſtant repreſentations that were made of Chriſt in ſacrifices, types, and ceremonies, were of great benefit, and comfort to the Church and People of GOD. For altho' we ſhould ſuppoſe that the generality of them, had not their thoughts carried particularly to what theſe things were deſigned to prefigure, and ſhaddow forth; yet they conſidered them as genearl ſigns and pledges of the pardoning mercy of GOD, and ſo received unſpeakable comfort from them.</p>

And he that ſhould be found with all the marks and characters upon him, that were foretold of the Meſſiah, muſt needs be the very perſon. For there are ſo many particular, and remarkable circumſtances foretold of him, that it was impoſſible that any but the true Meſſiah ſhould have them all concurring in him. And now as theſe did all exactly concur in <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and only in him: it affords the moſt convincing demonſtration that he was indeed <hi>the Chriſt.</hi> And what more effectual way coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> GOD have taken to convince the World of his being the true Meſſiah? For altho' Chriſt when he came, gave other evident proofs of his being the Son of GOD, and the Saviour of the World; yet it muſt be ſaid that <hi>this</hi> was one of the moſt convincing arguments, and ſerved mightily to ſtrengthen all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are of great benefit to theſe ages of the World, <hi>as they ſerve to ſtrengthen our faith in the Promiſes, and Prophecies that are as yet unaccompliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:002987_0054_0FE6AF6A3467D908"/>GOD's having accompliſhed many promiſes, and prophecies already relating to Chriſt, is a very good argument, that he will accompliſh all the reſt of them. And this is the advantage which we enjoy, on <hi>whom the ends of the World are come</hi>; even a very convincing argument, that all that GOD has foretold, he will certainly accompliſh. For when we ſee ſo many prophecies fulfilled ſo exactly already, we may be ſure that others ſhall be accompliſh'd alſo in due time. Indeed if GOD had never as yet fulfilled a prophecy, or promiſe, but all of them had been yet delayed; our fears and doubts would have prevailed, and the Church and People of GOD without a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle would have ſunk into Infidelity. But ſeeing ſo many, and thoſe as ſtrange and wonderfull as any of the prophecies, have been accompliſhed already, we may be ſure the others will not fail. For there is nothing more difficult to do, than what he has done already. He promiſed a Saviour to be of the ſeed of the woman, and he has <hi>according to his promiſe, in the fulneſs of time ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the law</hi>; and ſo a multitude of particular circumſtances, that were foretold of him were all accompliſhed in him. And now this may confirm unto us that all that has been foretold concerning the Church of Chriſt in the World, the glorious things ſpoken concerning the <hi>City of God,</hi> and eſpecially what is foretold of Chriſt's <hi>Second coming</hi> to judge the World, ſhall as certainly come to paſs in due time. And altho' GOD delays, yet he is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his promiſes. Chriſt was promiſed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002987_0055_0FE6AF6A4ED54D60"/>
four thouſand years before he came: and it is not half that time ſince he was among us. And therefore the length of time gives not the leaſt reaſon to doubt of theſe things being accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee ſome of the wiſe and good ends that are anſwered by the manner of GOD's promiſing and publiſhing the news of a Saviour, ſo long before his perſonal appearance among us: which ſhows the wiſdom and contrivance of GOD herein.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to another Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>The</hi> MANNER <hi>of Chriſt's aſſuming the Humane Nature,</hi> was a further Inſtance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>I ſhewed in a former diſcourſe, that it was neceſſary for the Mediator to be <hi>Man,</hi> as well as GOD: to qualifie him for ſuffering in our ſtead, and that he might be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; that he might deliver his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and precepts to us in the moſt eaſy, and familiar manner, and that he might give a perfect pattern of them in his own Life. It was therefore agreed upon in the infinite Councils of GOD; that the Son of GOD or the Eternal <hi>Word ſhould be made fleſh and dwell among us,</hi> which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly accompliſhed; as we find, <hi>John</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>But now altho' he aſſumed the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet it was not in the common, and natural courſe, by ordinary generation. For he was conceived by the power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>: without having any natural Father after the fleſh. A particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002987_0056_0FE6AF6F6F9CE378"/>
of this miraculous conception we have in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31, 34, 35. The Angel being ſent to the Virgin, <hi>ſays to her, Behold thou ſhalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a ſon, and ſhalt call his name Jeſus</hi>: to which ſhe replies, <hi>How ſhall this be, ſeeing I know not a man</hi>? To which the Angel anſwers: <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee.</hi> And ſo inſtead of being with Child by any man, ſhe was as the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> declares <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. <hi>With Child by the holy Ghost.</hi> And now the Wiſdom and the Prudence of GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By this action he has manifested the glory of his Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certainly a miracle, and altogether beyond the power of nature, for a <hi>Virgin</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: and nothing leſs than the power of that GOD, that is above nature, could accompliſh it And now this almighty power has GOD made known in the conception, and birth of our bleſſed Saviour. By this GOD makes it plainly appear to all his Creatures, that he can <hi>do whatever he pleaſes, and that nothing is too hard for him.</hi> By this he lets us know, that by his almighty Spirit he can work in and upon us, according to his good pleaſure; that he can convert and change our hearts; which is beyond the power of nature, and cauſe us to be born again of the Spirit. And as he prepared the womb of the Virgin for the reception of the Son of GOD, ſo he can prepare a room in our hearts for him, and ſet <hi>open the everlaſting doors of our Souls for this king of glory
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002987_0057_0FE6AF6F87CAC810"/>
to come in,</hi> and make us <hi>the habitation of God thro' the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt's aſſumption of the Humane Nature in ſuch a miraculous manner, was an inſtance of Wiſdom, <hi>as it appears to us, the only way to eſcape the Taint of Original Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he had been begotten after the ordinary way, the guilt &amp; the corruption of our firſt Parents would have deſcended to him; as much as to the reſt of their Poſterity. Therefore GOD, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, took care that he ſhould be conceived in another manner, whereby he ſhould wholly eſcape the pollution that cleaves to all the natural deſcendants of <hi>Adam</hi>: and by the manner of his conception he did entirely eſcape. Hence the Angel calls him <hi>that holy thing which ſhould be born,</hi> Luke 1.35. And now the taking effectual care for his eſcaping the guilt and pollution, that was natural to man, was an inſtance of Wiſdom and Prudence, Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby the <hi>Divine Holineſs</hi> was made very conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>For by this GOD plainly ſhows, that rather than his Son, in taking our nature, ſhould be tainted with our corruption, he would prepare a body in a miraculous manner for him. By which it plainly appears that GOD will have nothing to do with Sin, but only to puniſh it: that he will keep it at the greateſt diſtance from himſelf: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat altho' he was willing to condeſcend ſo far, that his Son ſhould take our nature upon him with its natural infirmities; yet Sin muſt by all means be excepted; and that he could have to do
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002987_0058_0FE6AF74ED5A8CC8"/>
with any thing but Sin. Surely by this it plainly appears that he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and that it is the abominable thing that his Soul hates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby Jeſus Chriſt was (in this reſpect) <hi>qualified to be a Mediator</hi>; which he could not have been, had he been guilty of Original Sin.</p>
               <p>Perfect holineſs was abſolutely neceſſary for a Mediator: and therefore if Chriſt had been under the guilt of original Sin, he would have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unqualified for his office. He would then have had his own ſin to anſwer for; and ſo could not have made ſatisfaction for our Sins; nor could he ever have appeared in the preſence of an holy GOD for us; nor could he have wrought out a perfect Righteouſneſs to cloath &amp; cover us withall: and ſo indeed the whole affair of our Redemption by him would have been fruſtrated, and come to nothing. Now GOD wiſely conſidered this matter, and ſo ſent him into the World in ſuch a manner as to have no Sin of his own; but to be perfectly pure, and holy: which abundantly accompliſhed him for the office of a Mediator, and rendered his ſufferings infinitely meritorious for the pardon, and juſtification of every Sinner, that repents and believes in him. Thus much may ſuffice for the fifth Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">VI. <hi>GOD's ſending his Son into the World at that</hi> PARTICULAR TIME <hi>and</hi> SEASON, <hi>to purchaſe Redemption for us,</hi> was another Inſtance of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>Altho' GOD promiſed a Saviour to our firſt
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002987_0059_0FE6AF7507645198"/>
Parents, quickly after they had deſtroyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet he did not preſently appear to them. And altho' they, and all the Saints of old, were juſtified, and ſaved by vertue of what he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone and ſuffered in our ſtead, yet he did not make his perſonal appearance in the World to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice for Sin, till about four thouſand years after the fall of Man: and then as the Apoſtle ſays, Gal. 4.4. <hi>In the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now in this appeared the Wiſdom of GOD. For as there is a great deal of Wiſdom in timing a matter well, and doing it in the fitteſt, and moſt proper ſeaſon: ſo this Wiſdom appears in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming into the World at that particular time in which he came. For it was the fitteſt time, the beſt time that could be; no time ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuitable as that particular ſeaſon in which he appeared. No other time whether ſooner or later would have anſwered the end ſo well.</p>
               <p>Thus for Inſtance, Suppoſing he ſhould have come quickly after the fall of Man; and the firſt born of <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have been the promiſed ſeed, (as ſhe her ſelf imagined when ſhe ſaid upon the birth of <hi>Cain</hi> ſhe <hi>had gotten a man from the Lord,</hi> Gen 4.1. or <hi>a man the Lord,</hi> as the words properly ſignify, <hi>i. e.</hi> God-man, or the Meſſias, ſays Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>) I ſay ſuppoſing this, yet it would not have anſwered the end ſo well: becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There could not have been thoſe particular deſcriptions of him, in prophecies, and promiſes, types and ſhadows as now there are:</hi> and ſo one
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002987_0060_0FE6AF7D287744A8"/>
of the beſt arguments we now have for the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the Meſſiah, the choſen of GOD, would have been wanting. And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There would have been only our firſt Parents to hear his Doctrines, &amp; to atteſt unto his miracles</hi>: which would have been a very ſlender evidence for matters of ſuch importance, matters of fact, upon the truth of which our Religion is eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>One good Argument that the miracles Chriſt wrought (for the confirmation of his Doctrines) were real and no deluſion, is that they were not done <hi>in a Corner,</hi> but in the ſight of Multitudes, who as they were able to atteſt to the truth of them, ſo they were able to diſcover it, if there had been any cheat in them. But now this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been wanting in the beginning, quickly after the fall, when there was no other than our firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>And altho' we may ſuppoſe, theſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have been remedied in a few ages after, when men had multiplied, and repleniſhed the Earth, and that then GOD might have ſent forth his Son as well as when he did: —</p>
               <p>Yet in anſwer hereto it may be ſaid; that this would not have correſponded with ſome other wiſe purpoſes, and deſigns of GOD. Thus as GOD intended to honour ſome particular perſons, by Chriſt's deſcending from them, according to the fleſh; as that he ſhould be of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the Lineage of <hi>David</hi>; ſo theſe men muſt be themſelves, before Chriſt could deſcend from them. And many others he deſigned for eminent Types of Chriſt,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002987_0061_0FE6AF7D41F45DC0"/>
and others ſo far favoured as to propheſy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and to give ſome particular deſcription of him: Now th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe men muſt be born, and live in the World, and propheſy of Chriſt before he could come. Furthermore as GOD had wiſely determined to chooſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut a particular Nation, for his own peculiar People, and viſible Church in the World, and among them to have Chriſt typified, and ſhadowed forth by certain Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Ceremonies: So there muſt be this Nation and People offering up theſe Sacrifices, and attending theſe Ceremonies, before Chriſt the great Sacrifice, and Antitype ſhould come. So that he could not come ſooner than he did.</p>
               <p>Neither would it have done to have tarried longer before he came: for <hi>that</hi> would have been inconſiſtent with other wiſe ſchemes, &amp; purpoſes of his: and would alſo have been a great diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to Men, &amp; they would have been ready to ſay in deſpair; Where is, or what is become of the promiſe of his coming?</p>
               <p>So that all things conſidered, the time he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came in, was the fitteſt ſeaſon for it: and that becauſe it was the exact time that was propheſied he ſhould come in. And if he had come ſooner, or tarried longer, the propheſies would not have been fulfilled ſo to a tittle as now they are. And thus neither the truth of GOD, nor the knowledge of GOD would have appeared ſo conſpicuous, as now they do. And ſome doubts, and ſcruples would neceſſarily have ariſen about him, whether he was the Chriſt or no.</p>
               <p>But then again, according to the prophecies,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002987_0062_0FE6AF8059D8F950"/>
there was a general expectation of him among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and as Hiſtorians tell us, among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo; that is, of a mighty King, who ſhould be born in thoſe days: which ſerved very much to prepare the people to receive him, when he came among them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there was at that time a great decay of Piety, &amp; of true Religion: ſo that there wanted a more than ordinary Prophet to revive it, and none leſs then the Son of GOD, was able to give a revival to it. The profeſſing People of GOD had ſunk ſo deep in the meer Ceremonies of their Religion, to the groſs neglect of the weightier matters of the Law, that it was high time to have them aboliſhed: Which could be done no otherwiſe than by the coming of Chriſt, in whom they all had their accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>And then to mention no more, it being a time of univerſal Peace (as has been obſerved by Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians) throughout the World; this made it a very proper time for the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> to enter. For as a time of Peace gave them leaſure, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to think, and diſcourſe of theſe things; ſo it created a general Commerce, and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World, which very much facilitated the carrying the Goſpel, or the News of a Saviour into all parts of it. Now theſe conſiderations being laid together, make it very evident that our Lord came into the World in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſon for it; and conſequently the Wiſdom and Prudence of GOD appears in ſending him at that very time <hi>to be made fleſh and to dwell among us.</hi>

                  <p>Inf. 1. <hi>How thankful ſhould we be for the Promiſes, and Prophecies of the Old Teſtament</hi>!</p>
                  <p>For however uſeleſs ſome may imagine them to be now ſince Chriſt is come, and the Goſpel ſet up and eſtabliſhed; yet they are really of vaſt ſervice to the Chriſtian World: and are ſome of the chief ſupports of the Chriſtian Faith. It is certainly a matter of great importance to have it ſufficiently, &amp; ſatisfactorily proved unto us that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the Chriſt, the true Meſſiah, the anointed, and choſen of GOD: and we ſhould be thankful for any arguments to ſtrengthen, and confirm us in the Faith of this grand fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Doctrine of Chriſtianity. And now as the Promiſes, and Predictions of the Old Teſtament afford moſt convincing arguments in this matter, we ſhould be thankful for them. We ſhould ſearch the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament as well as of the New: and ſtudy thoſe things that are ſpoken of Chriſt; and compare them with the Hiſtory of him: and we ſhall find ſuch an exact harmony, and correſpondence, as will mightily ſtrengthen our faith in him.</p>
                  <p>Inf. 2. Was Chriſt conceived in a miraculous manner, to eſcape the natural pollution of Sin?
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002987_0064_0FE6AF86C0BEB068"/>
                     <hi>This ſhould lead us to lament and bewail the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Natures, and groan to be delivered from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For by GOD's being willing to take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into perſonal union with the Divine, but in ſuch a manner as wholly to eſcape the ſin that cleaves to us, he plainly ſhows the infinite evil of Sin, &amp; that Sin is the very thing that ſeparates between GOD and us. We ſhould therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bewail the Corruption of our Natures. Becauſe, altho' Chriſt was willing to be like us in every thing elſe; yet he would not be like us in this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. This then muſt be our grief and ſorrow, that we are <hi>ſhapen in iniquity, and that in ſin our Mothers conceived us.</hi> And we muſt earneſtly deſire to be delivered from this body of ſin, as being the very thing that now hinders our union to Chriſt, and communion with him. For as our Nature could not be united to his Divine Nature, but as it was perfectly pure, and holy; ſo we can't be united to him, nor have communion with him, before our corrupt nature is mortified, and ſubdued within us And as it was by the power of the Holy Ghoſt that Chriſt eſcaped the pollution of our Natures: ſo it is by the power of the ſame almighty Spirit that this pollution, and corruption is ever taken out of us. This muſt therefore be our heart's deſire, &amp; prayer to GOD, that as Chriſt was conceived by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and was perfectly free from Sin: ſo we may be born of the Spirit, and thereby ſanctified in the whole man through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in Spirit, Soul and Body, and made holy as he that has called us, is holy</p>

                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:002987_0065_0FE6AF86D48382B8"/>Inf. 3. From what we have heard, <hi>let us all be fully ſatisfied as to the time of Chriſt's appearing in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are ready to wiſh that Chriſt had tarried till this time, before he appeared in the World; that they might ſee him, and converſe with him, and behold his Miracles: and think they ſhould have been more fully confirmed in the Faith of him. But now ſuch men are vain in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations. They don't conſider that they have as great advantages for believing in Chriſt, as thoſe that lived in Chriſt's time, and converſed with him: and conſidering that he came at the very time that was predicted of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the other demonſtrative proofs we have of his having been in the World; the matter is plainer, and more evident, than if he ſhould have lapſed the time propheſied of, and waited till this time to make his perſonal appearance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not give way to any ſuch vain deſires, but be ſenſible that he came in the fitteſt ſeaſon and let us acquieſce and reſt ſatisfied in it. And altho' we have not ſeen him, yet let us love him; let us believe on him, and accept of him as our only Saviour, placing oar dependance upon him, and ſubmitting our ſelves entirely to him; and then we may be aſſured of this, that when he ſhall appear the ſecond time at the end of the World, <hi>in the glory of his Father and of the holy Angels, we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory</hi>: AMEN.</p>

               <p n="7">VII. ANother Inſtance of the Wiſdom of GOD in the affair of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, <hi>The poor Condition and low Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, in which</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>appeared in the World</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Chriſt appeared in a very poor and low condition, is ſufficiently evident from the Hiſtory of him in the Goſpel. As for his <hi>Parents,</hi> altho' they were of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and houſe of <hi>David</hi>; yet they appeared to be but in very mean circumſtances. His Father was but of an inferiour Occupation; a <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.25. And as for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Birth,</hi> it was attended with peculiar circumſtances of meanneſs, and poverty. There was no other room prepared for the Mother of our Lord to be delivered in, than that of a Stable: there <hi>ſhe brought forth her firſt born ſon, and laid him in a manger,</hi> Luke 2.7. And afterwards when he grew up, he did not grow rich, nor appear with any external or earthly grandeur, as the Jews expected the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this he took upon him the form of a Servant, and made himſelf of no reputation, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. So Poor was he that he had not ſo much as an houſe of his own, nor any certain dwelling place; he could ſay as in Matt. 8.20. <hi>Foxes have bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

hath not where to lay his head.</hi> And ſo ſtraitned was he ſometimes for Money, that he had not wherewith to pay his tribute-money, (which amounted to no more than fifteen pence) before he wrought a miracle for it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.27.</p>
               <p>And now Chriſt's appearing in ſuch low, and deſpicable circumſtances on worldly accounts, (altho' to the Jews a ſtumbling block, &amp; rock of offence) was an inſtance of wonderful Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was moſt ſuitable and becoming,</hi> that he who had our Sins imputed to him, and was about to ſuffer and make ſatisfaction for them, ſhould appear in low &amp; humbling circumſtances.</p>
               <p>We muſt conſider that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was coming on our account: he had taken our Sins upon him, and had undertaken to make ſatisfaction for them: and therefore a low and humble ſtate muſt needs be the moſt proper for him. Sin is a ſufficient cauſe for humiliation and abaſement, and humility always becomes a Sinner. And therefore as Chriſt was made Sin for us, humility and a low appearance in the World did beſt become him. There would have been no congruity, nor agreeableneſs in Chriſt's coming with external pomp, and glory, at the ſame time that he came loaded with our iniquities, and was to be wounded, and bruiſed, and die for them. How indecent is it for a Criminal at the Bar to appear in a fine dreſs, with great attendants, and other ornaments and marks of greatneſs, which he might properly enough appear with at another time. Now
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002987_0068_0FE6AF90114D7950"/>
altho' Chriſt was really no Criminal, becauſe <hi>he knew no Sin of his own</hi>; yet imputatively he was the greateſt Sinner: for GOD <hi>had laid upon him our iniquities.</hi> So that ſuch a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuited beſt with the circumſtances he was then under, and with the deſign of his coming.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His appearing in ſuch low circumſtances was an inſtance of Wiſdom, <hi>as it ſerved very much to illuſtrate and ſet forth the infinite Grace and Condeſcenſion of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more Chriſt humbled himſelf, the more he exalted his mercy, and grace. And what a wonderful diſplay of grace is it for him, who was the Eternal Son of GOD, to leave the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his Father, to leave the realms of light and glory: where he had <hi>thouſands of Angels bowing before him, and a thouſand times ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miniſtring unto him:</hi> to come into this World in the loweſt and meaneſt circumſtances of any man in it: for the Lord of Heaven and Earth, yea the GOD over all bleſſed forever, to appear in the form of a Servant, to become a Man of ſorrows and be acquainted with grief, to be cloathed with poverty and loaded with contempt! And we find the Apoſtle taking notice of this as a wonderful diſplay of Grace, 1 Cor. 8.9. Says he, <hi>Ye knew,</hi> (intimating the thing was ſo plain that every one might ſee, and <hi>know) the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who though he was rich; yet for our ſakes became poor; that ye thro' his poverty might be made rich.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle takes further notice of this wonderful grace and condeſcenſion, Phil. 2.6, 7.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002987_0069_0FE6AF9024FF2160"/>
                  <hi>That he was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It ſerved to teach his Diſciples, and the</hi> Jews <hi>of that day, that his Kingdom was not of this World</hi>; and that they muſt not expect any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral advantages in following him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> (as I hinted before) looked for a Meſſiah, that ſhould appear in earthly Pomp, and Grandeur; one that ſhould ſubdue all their Enemies for them, and reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael, and rear up the Throne of his Father <hi>David</hi> that was fallen, and reſtore that Nation to all, yea and to greater ſplendor, riches, and greatneſs than in <hi>David's</hi> or <hi>Solomon's</hi> days. And thoſe miſapprehenſions of their's, aroſe from the groſs and carnal ſenſe they put upon the Prophecies relating to the coming of Chriſt. But now this was far from being the deſign of his coming: it was to ſet up not a temporal, but a ſpiritual Kingdom, and that not to be confin'd to the Jews, but to extend to the Gentiles alſo. He was to be a <hi>Light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the glory of his people Iſrael.</hi> Whereas if Chriſt had appeared in external Pomp, and Greatneſs, in the form of an Earthly Prince, and Monarch; it would have confirmed the Jews in their miſtaken notion of his Kingdom: and no doubt they would then have all flocked to him, and owned him for their King and Ruler, and put themſelves under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and protection. But now from what
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002987_0070_0FE6AF94651BF060"/>
Principles would they then have accepted of Him &amp; ſubmitted to Him? Not from any true Chriſtian Principles; not from any love to GOD, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for his Glory, or in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: nor from a real hatred of ſin, or deſire to be freed from the ſpiritual bondage they were under to their corruptions, and ſpiritual enemies: But all would have been from carnal, and worldly views; to advance themſelves in this world; to have their external, and political Privileges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them. And now Chriſt was ſenſible of this before he came: and in his great Wiſdom determined to appear in a quite different manner from what they expected.</p>
               <p>And by his Appearing in ſuch a low condition, he took the moſt effectual method to convince them of their error, and to let them know that his Kingdom was not ſuch an one as they expected. He hereby plainly taught them, that it did not conſiſt in earthly Riches, in ſplendid Courts, and royal Palaces; but that it was all of a ſpiritual Nature: that it was a Kingdom that comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men, and is ſeated in their hearts; and that the acts of Royalty which he performs, are the pardoning Mens ſins, the ſubduing and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their luſts; the reſtraining &amp; conquering our ſpiritual enemies for us; the guarding us by his power; the guiding us by his counſel, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us to his Kingdom, and Glory, reſerved in Heaven for us. Now Chriſt's appearing in the manner that he did, had a natural tendency to lead Men into ſuch an apprehenſion of the nature of his Kingdom; or at leaſt to lead them into the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002987_0071_0FE6AF947B04DF18"/>
full belief of it, when he expreſsly told them as he did, That <hi>his Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> John 18.36. And by this he alſo taught them that if they looked for any great temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, it was not worth while to come to him. And ſo,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It proved a very good means to prevent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons flocking to him, and profeſſing ſubjection to him from meer</hi> Worldly <hi>views.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt had appeared in outward greatneſs, many that never did own him, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjection to him; and he would have been thronged with a number of Hypocrites and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjects, who knew or at leaſt ſavoured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the nature of his Kingdom. But now by his appearing in ſuch a manner as he did; none or but few in compariſon were diſpoſed to own him, but ſuch as had ſome other notion of his Kingdom than that of an earthly one. And ſo in ſhort, altho' if he had appeared in outward greatneſs, he would have had more profeſſed and pretended ſubjects; yet he would not have had more, if ſo many real and hearty ones.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His manifeſting himſelf as he did appears a wiſe contrivance, <hi>from the happy tendency of it to lead Men into a contempt of this World, and to the apprehenſion of ſomething ſuperiour to outward Pomp and Geatneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when the Son of GOD, who muſt needs know the exact worth and value of every thing, had ſo little regard to earthly grandeur, as not to cloth himſelf with it, nor take any particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe that were; he plainly ſhow'd his
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002987_0072_0FE6AFA07B4C9A60"/>
own contempt of this World and all things in it: and what better argument could we have to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it, to look and live above it; and to give the preference infinitely to a renewed nature, an holy heart and an harmleſs life; which Chriſt himſelf had ſo much greater regard for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>an for all the outward pomp and glory of this World.</p>
               <p>But to proceed,</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Another inſtance of divine Wiſdom, <hi>was the</hi> METHODS <hi>taken to</hi> PROVE <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the true</hi> MESSIAH, <hi>the Saviour that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here indeed, I might firſt of all ſay in general, that it was Wiſdom, and Prudence in GOD <hi>to prove</hi> him the Meſſiah. For unleſs he had given ſome evident proof, and demonſtration of it, there would have been no ſufficient grounds for any to believe in him; and ſo none would have received any benefit by him And therefore GOD in his Wiſdom and Grace did, upon his coming, give proofs, and demonſtration of his being the Chriſt. And now the Methods he took for this, manifeſt a great deal of Wiſdom, and Prudence; which will appear by a brief conſideration of the Ways and Methods taken to prove him to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and theſe may be reduced to Three heads; <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:002987_0073_0FE6AFA0936E0B78"/>1. One Method for proving JESUS to be the CHRIST, was his <hi>accompliſhing the Prophecies concerning the Meſſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may remember I told you in a former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that there were many Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt in the old Teſtament, which anſwered many wiſe and good Ends: one of which was that they ſerved to point out the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, when he ſhould come, and diſtinguiſh him from any Impoſtor; accordingly Chriſt when he came, took this Method to prove himſelf to be the Chriſt, by accompliſhing every Prophecy and Prediction concerning him. There were many things foretold concerning his birth; as the time when, and the place where; ſo were there many things ſpoken of his life, and death, and many circumſtances relating thereto. All which Chriſt took care exactly to fulfill: as will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any one that will compare the Hiſtory with the Prophecy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Method he took was, <hi>to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his doing any Miracles before he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enter upon his Publick Miniſtry we have no account: but after that we have almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable inſtances of Miraculous operations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him; and thoſe of every kind. He wrought Miracles upon the Wind, and the Seas, ſtilling them by a word's ſpeaking; upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, turning it into Wine; upon Bread &amp; Fiſhes, multiplying them miraculouſly for the feeding vaſt Multitudes with a ſmall quantity of them; upon Trees, cauſing them to wither immediately
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002987_0074_0FE6AFA1D36754B8"/>
at his Command; and what a Multitude of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did he work upon the Bodies of Men; healing all manner of diſeaſes in a Miraculous manner without the uſe of means. He cauſed the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the dumb to ſpeak, the blind to ſee, and the lepers to be cleanſed. Nay by Him Devils were diſpoſſeſſed, and the dead raiſed to life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Teſtimonies that were given of him,</hi> was another Method made uſe of for the proving him to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we might begin with the Teſtimonies that were given by the Inanimate Creation: Such as the extraordinary Star that appeared (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of his Birth) to the <hi>Magi,</hi> or wiſe Men of the Eaſt, and led them to the very place where the Child lay, and they fell down, and worſhipped him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.11. And then at his Death univerſal nature ſeem'd to give teſtimony concerning him. For when he was hanging on the Croſs, the <hi>Sun was darkned, and there was darkneſs over all the earth, and the vail of the Temple was rent front the top to the bottom, the earth quaked, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened</hi>; which, as it filled the Centurion and thoſe that were with him with exceeding fear and trembling, ſo it drew forth that confeſſion from them, <hi>that truly this was the Son of GOD,</hi> Mat. 27 54.</p>
               <p>But then not only ſuch Inanimate Creatures gave teſtimony of him, but GOD alſo at that time endowed Men, and Women with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit to teſtify concerning him. Thus good old <hi>Simeon,</hi> who had been <hi>waiting for the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:002987_0075_0FE6AFA1E9F01968"/>
Conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> was kept alive to the birth of Chriſt; and when he was brought into the Temple, to have the cuſtoms of the law performed upon him, this good old Man was brought thither by the Spirit, who took the Child in his arms, declaring him to be the Perſon whom GOD <hi>had prepared before the face of all People, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.31, 32. And <hi>Anna</hi> an ancient Propheteſs, did at the ſame time alſo <hi>teſtify of him to all them that looked for Redemption,</hi> Luke 2.37, 38.</p>
               <p>And after this when he was grown up, there was his fore-runner, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who being to prepare the way for him, teſtified concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, that he was the Chriſt. Thus beſides many other times, we find him upon Jeſus's coming towards him, pointing out to him and ſaying to thoſe that were with him, as in Joh. 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> But then Chriſt was teſtified of not only by Man, but by the Angels in Heaven. Thus an Angel was ſent to tell the Virgin, That <hi>She was to be with Child by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and to bring forth <hi>an holy thing, which ſhould be called the Son of God.</hi> And then he is ſent again to tell <hi>Joſeph</hi> that his eſpouſed Wife was <hi>with Child by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that the Child that ſhould be born of her, ſhould be called <hi>Jeſus: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord</hi>: And tell them where they ſhould find him. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it a multitude of them joyn in conſort, ſinging, <hi>Glory to GOD in the Higheſt,</hi> &amp;c. As in Luke 1<hi>ſt</hi> &amp; 2<hi>d.</hi> Chapters.</p>
               <p>But then not only the <hi>Angels</hi>; but the very <hi>Devils</hi> were forced to confeſs, and bear teſtimony of him, that <hi>he was the Son of GOD,</hi> Matt. 8.29. And then that there might be nothing wanting, but that there might be the fulleſt and ſtrongeſt evidence in this matter; GOD himſelf gave teſtimony concerning him once and again by an audible voice from Heaven. Thus at his Baptiſm, when he came up from the Water and the Spirit of GOD <hi>like a Dove</hi> lighted upon him; then a voice came from Heaven, <hi>ſaying, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Matt. 3.17. And after the ſame manner was it at his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration on the Mount.</p>
               <p>Now theſe were the ways that were taken to prove and demonſtrate Jeſus of Nazareth to be the Chriſt, and herein appears a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence. For</p>

               <p>What more effectual way can we imagine, could be taken, to convince Rational Creatures, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt, than the method that has been taken for it? What could be a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, than his being found with all thoſe marks and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon him, that were predicted of the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002987_0077_0FE6AFAE34910BE8"/>
Meſſiah, and accompliſhing every prophecy to a tittle that was made concerning him? This alone one would think ſufficient to convince a Man of unprejudiced reaſon. But if we add to this the many and mighty Miracles, which he wrought for the confirmation of what he declared, and profeſſed concerning his being the true Meſſiah: and at the ſame time conſider how abſurd it would be to ſuppoſe, GOD would enable him to work ſuch a Multitude of Miracles for the proof of a thing that was not true: I ſay, he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the nature of GOD, and the nature of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the declared deſign of thoſe wrought by our bleſſed Saviour, would have ſufficient matter of conviction by them, that he was what he profeſſed and declared himſelf to be. But then if to all this we add the expreſs teſtimony of men Divinely inſpired, of Angels, and of the very Devils, and laſt of all, of GOD himſelf who has once and again by an audible voice declared him to be <hi>his beloved Son</hi>: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And none but ſuch as are given up to judicial blindneſs of mind and hardneſs of heart, would pretend to evade the force of them. The method GOD has taken, is not to force Men to the profeſſion and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Jeſus for the Chriſt, contrary to our Judgment; but he has conſidered us as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Beings: and has laid matter of conviction before our minds to induce us by the force of rational argument, not only to confeſs with our mouths, but to believe in our hearts, that Jeſus
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002987_0078_0FE6AFAFABE04CC0"/>
is the Chriſt. And now GOD's taking a method ſo convincing, and demonſtrative, as it was an act of Wiſdom; ſo it was of Grace, and condeſcention in GOD to our natures and capacities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Method for proving <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Christ,</hi> was wiſely contrived, <hi>as it was very much for the honour of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' Chriſt did not appear with any marks of Earthly greatneſs; yet in the Method that was taken to prove him to be the Chriſt, he honoured himſelf, and had peculiar marks of honour put upon him. Thus he magnified his Truth, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the prophecies and promiſes, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as he did, and ſhow'd that as he <hi>was full of grace,</hi> ſo was he <hi>full of truth.</hi> And then he illuſtrated and made his great Power known in the many &amp; mighty Miracles which he wrought; by them he ſhewed that all power was given to him in Heaven and Earth; that univerſal nature was at his command, and that his Kingdom ruled over all. And altho' the Jews were ſtumbled at his appearing in the form of a Servant; yet by the Miracles that he wrought, he appeared to have an infinitely greater Empire and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than they ever expected for their Meſſiah. Moreover his Miracles were of ſuch a Nature, as to magnifie his Goodneſs and Compaſſions to Men. They were not meerly for the ſake of ſhowing a Miracle, as <hi>Moſes's</hi> was when his Rod was turned into a Serpent, and then returned again into a Rod: much leſs were they like ſome of the other Miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> even thoſe miraculous Plagues, and Judgments,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002987_0079_0FE6AFAFC5CB6218"/>
teaching them, <hi>by terrible things in righteouſneſs.</hi> But inſtead of this, moſt, if not all Chriſt's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were Miracles of goodneſs, kindneſs and benignity; for the benefit, relief and comfort of Mankind. We don't read of any Miracles of his that were injurious to men, but acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Perſons that were the ſubjects of them, which ſerved to ſet forth how abundant he was in goodneſs. I don't remember above two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances objected againſt this obſervation. One is the Devils entring into the herd of Swine, and their running into the deep and being drowned. The other is that of his curſing the <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> and cauſing it to dry, and wither away. Now as to the firſt of theſe, it may be ſaid in anſwer to it, that it was no Miracle at all: for the Miracle was in diſpoſſeſſing the Man, of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Devils that had entred into him. And as for the Devils entring into the Swine, it was only by permiſſion: that is, Chriſt did not ſee cauſe to reſtrain them. As for the ſecond, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from Matt. 21.19. <hi>to ſtand in the high way</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo had no particular proprietor that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the curſing of it. But then if it had been any Man's propriety, it's being a barren tree, the cauſing it to wither, could be no injury or damage.</p>
               <p>And then again, how great was the honour done to Chriſt by the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> that were given of him? Thus altho' he was born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger, yet the appearance of that bright and ſhining Star, and the Songs and Acclamations of joy by the Heavenly Hoſt,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002987_0080_0FE6AFB80DA70A78"/>
upon his Birth, were much greater honour, than to have been born in a Palace.</p>
               <p>And then again, GOD's proclaming him once and again <hi>his only begotten Son in whom he was well pleaſed,</hi> was an infinitely greater honour than for the whole Iſraelitiſh Nation to have proclamed him their King and ſubmitted to him. Nay, when he was hanging and dying on the Croſs, as the vileſt Malefactor, yet by the Sun's withdrawing it's light, the Earth's quaking, the Rocks rending, the Graves opening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there was more honour done him, than if he had been ſeated on the throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Princes and great Men bowing before him. Thus altho' he appeared in outward meanneſs, yet care was taken, that even in the deepeſt of his humiliations, there ſhould be a great deal of honour done unto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Method ſhows the Wiſdom of GOD, <hi>as hereby GOD has taken effectual care to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Juſtice in the deſtruction of thoſe, that will not believe in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>after they have heard of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As GOD will certainly puniſh with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction, the Infidel and Unbelieving, ſo it is very requiſite that he ſhould appear juſt when he ſpeaks, and clear when he judges and condemns them. And now by the Method he has taken to prove Jeſus to be the Chriſt, he has given ſuch convincing proof and demonſtration of it, as to leave all without excuſe, and juſtly puniſhable, that will not believe on him: by this means he left the Jewiſh Nation wholly without
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002987_0081_0FE6AFB8252DE608"/>
excuſe for not receiving him as their Lord Meſſiah, and made that utter deſtruction as a People, that GOD quickly brought upon them, to be very juſt, and righteous. And by this means GOD will alſo vindicate himſelf in the ſevereſt, and heavieſt puniſhment, that he brings on unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for having laid ſuch a foundation for faith in Chriſt, when he ſentences the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the everlaſting burnings prepared for the Devil, and his Angels, we muſt ſay as in Rev. 16.7. <hi>Even ſo, Lord God Almighty, true, and righteous are thy Judgments!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have not time to enter upon any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Wiſdom in this grand affair of our Redemption at preſent. And ſo ſhall conclude with applying and improving what has been now delivered.</p>

                  <p>Inf. 1. What we have heard of the poverty and meanneſs of Chriſt's appearance, <hi>ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our undervaluing, or deſpiſing any of the Saints, for their being poor and low in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That many of the Children of GOD are in poor and low circumſtances, is no leſs evident, than it is common for them to be deſpiſed, and undervalued by others upon the account here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A poor Man, altho' a Saint and a child of GOD, is oftentimes the object of contempt: his Grace wont ſecure him from the contempt of the men of this World. But now how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:002987_0082_0FE6AFBE4D4F41D0"/>
is <hi>this?</hi> For by what we have heard we find that a perſon may have true greatneſs, and real excellence, and yet have little or nothing of this World's good. For thus it was with our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, he was in a very low condition on worldly accounts; but yet he had that in him that recommended him to our higheſt eſteem: altho' he was poor yet he was <hi>the chief among ten thouſands; altogether lovely.</hi> And thus it is with many of the Saints: they have little of this World's goods; and yet they are worthy of our love and eſteem. They have that in them that is infinitely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than all earthly good, they have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Saving Grace which is better than ſilver and gold, more precious than rubies; and all the things we can deſire, are not to be compared with it. They have the ſame Mind and Spirit in them that was in Jeſus Chriſt: they have the Image of GOD upon them, and are in favour with him, which ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to us, let them be ever ſo poor on worldly accounts.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore let me ſay, that he that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes a Saint becauſe he is poor, deſpiſes the Grace of GOD, deſpiſe his image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and implicitly deſpiſes Chriſt himſelf for appearing in a low condition, &amp; Chriſt looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the contempt offered to his Saints as offered to himſelf, Luke 10.16. <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me: and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I don't mean that any ſhould make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poor, to be conformed to Chriſt in it, nor be ſo ſatisfied in a poor condition as to neglect all lawful means for the bettering their circumſtances. But that when GOD in his Providence orders out a ſtate of Poverty for them, they ſhould comfort, and ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that it was the very ſtate and condition that Chriſt their Lord and Maſter was in. We ſhould argue with our ſelves, that if Chriſt put himſelf into ſuch a low condition for our ſakes, ſurely we ſhould be content, when he orders out no worſe for us than for himſelf, and ſhould conſider the force of thoſe words of his, Matt. 10.24.25. <hi>The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord: it is enough for the Diſciple that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord.</hi>

                  <p>If GOD had not taken ſuch a way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this truth, how much doubt and uncertainty ſhould we labour under? And what danger would there be of our being carried away with an evil heart of unbelief? How thankful then ſhould we be that GOD has

left ſo little room for us to doubt in a matter of ſuch infinite importance to every one of us? But that he has in tender mercy to us, given ſuch full and convincing demonſtration in this matter, that it muſt be becauſe we will not, if we do not <hi>believe that Jeſus is the Son of GOD.</hi> So that every unbeliever under the Goſpel will be left without excuſe, and what our Saviour ſaid of the unbelieving Jews, may be as truly ſaid of all Unbelievers under the Goſpel, John 15.22. <hi>But now they have no cloak for their Sin.</hi>

               <p>We are told, John 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us.</hi> He did not only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Humane Nature; but he tabernacled or dwelt here upon Earth among Men, and converſed with them for a time. He lived upon Earth between thirty and forty Years, according to the beſt Chronologers. Indeed moſt of that time was ſpent in a private man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with his Parents, and (as is ſuppoſed) working with his reputed Father at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's Trade. Hence he is called not only the Carpenter's Son; but <hi>the Carpenter,</hi> Mark, 6.3.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002987_0085_0FE6AFC5C329CC98"/>
But when he was about thirty years old, the age (that the Prieſts, were allowed to miniſter in holy things) he ſet out upon his Publick Miniſtry. At which time alſo he called his Diſciples to accompany him in his Miniſtry; to hear his Doctrines, to ſee his Miracles, and to obſerve his Life and Converſation. And as for his Preaching, the ſum and ſubſtance of it was Repentance, Faith, Humility, and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Charity and Forgiving one another, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this World, Heavenly mindedneſs, Sincerity and uprightneſs, and the like. A great part of his publick Preaching was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in expoſing thoſe carnal interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corrupt gloſſes, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had put upon the Law; and in teaching them the Spirituality and Extenſiveneſs of the Divine. Precepts: that they extended not only to the groſſer, and more external acts, but that they reached to the very thoughts, deſires and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Heart. It was alſo imployed very much in reproving the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and for reſting ſo much in carnal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and vain traditions. He taught them alſo that he was the Chriſt that they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, who was propheſied of, and promiſed to them; and invited, exhorted and directed all to come to him and believe in him, aſſuring them there was no other way to the Father, or to eternal Life, but in and thro' him.</p>
               <p>And then as to his Life and Converſation, it was altogether worthy of, and agreable to the Perſon he profeſſed himſelf to be, and altogether
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002987_0086_0FE6AFCA1CE59158"/>
conformed to the doctrines he taught, and the precepts he laid down for others. He ſat before them an exact Pattern of what he taught them. The ſame rules of living that he preached up to them, he obſerved is his own life. He confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the law of GOD in every article that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him. He never was guilty of the leaſt fault, or failing, or miſconduct in the whole courſe of his life: and there could be <hi>no fault found in him.</hi> But as the Apoſtle ſays it became him, Heb. 7.26. <hi>He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> He went about doing good: <hi>glorifying GOD on earth, and finiſhing the work that GOD had given him to do. As he ſays of himſelf,</hi> Joh. 17.4. And now in all this there appears a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>And that upon this account in general, —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this was the moſt effectual way to eſtabliſh the Goſpel-diſpenſation; which Chriſt was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet up in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now high time to abrogate and lay aſide the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſation of Ceremonies, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances; for the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſunk all their religion into Ceremony and outward form. And the Ceremonies they laid ſo great ſtreſs upon, were not ſo much thoſe that had been taught them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as what they received by tradition. And hence we have our Saviour complaining of them, for <hi>making the Commandment of GOD of none effect by their tradition,</hi> Mat. 15.6. They thought that if they were careful <hi>to waſh their hands before meat; and tyth'd mint, anniſe and cummin,</hi> and the like, they might ſafely neglect
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002987_0087_0FE6AFCA322203D0"/>
the <hi>weightier matters of the law; righteouſneſs, mercy, and faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was therefore very neceſſary that theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ſhould be aboliſhed: and that a more refin'd and ſpiritual religion ſhould be ſet up; whereby Men might do their duty in a more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner, and from more ſublime and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly principles, than the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> led them into.</p>
               <p>But now, how ſhould this be done? who would undertake to bring it to paſs? For the <hi>Jews</hi> had received the law by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom they juſtly eſteemed as one of the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that had riſen among Men. This is the Teſtimony given of him after his Death, Deut. 34.10. <hi>That there aroſe not a Prophet ſince in Iſrael like unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>whom the Lord knew face to face</hi>: That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And then, beſides the great, and juſt veneration they had for <hi>Moſes,</hi> there is to be conſidered, that if had been a law of long ſtanding, which their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had been in the practice of, and in the ſame way (as they imagined) for two thouſand years. And they looked upon all the Judgments that had befallen their Nation, to be the fruit of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from, and neglect of the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> All which things, we may ſuppoſe made it very difficult to bring the <hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:002987_0088_0FE6AFD3D83547E8"/>And now, who ſo proper to undertake this affair, as the Son of GOD himſelf?

               <p>It was therefore neceſſary that the Meſſiah, the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at Anti-type, or ſubſtance of all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, ſhould appear, in order to the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. It was neceſſary that the very Perſon which <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold them ſhould come, and which when he came, he directed them to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto; ſhould appear for the abrogating any of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s laws. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them of this Prophet, Deut. 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet, from the midſt of thee, of thy Brethren like unto me; unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> This Prophet that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, ſeems to be the only Perſon that ſhould ſuperſede any thing that <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught them. Add now this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was Chriſt: as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. So that Chriſt's coming and dwelling with the <hi>Jews,</hi> his preaching, and prevailing as he did, was the moſt effectual means to lay aſide the Ceremonial law, and eſtabliſh the Goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His coming into the World, and dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as he did, was a plain demonſtration <hi>of his Humanity; that he was really and truly Man, and ſo one of their Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt had firſt appeared in the World at his full growth and Man's eſtate, and had when
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:002987_0089_0FE6AFD3EBF3D0D8"/>
he ſhewed himſelf for a while diſappeared, there would many doubts have ariſen about his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they would have looked upon him only as ſome Spectre; ſome Spirit only appearing in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape; and would not have believed him to be really and truly Man. And ſo not one of their Brethren raiſed up from among them, and conſequently not that Prophet that <hi>Moſes</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them of; whom they were to hearken unto. And ſo they would have had more pretence for their not hearkning unto him and rejecting him. But now by his being born among them in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ordinary way (how miraculouſly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was conceived) and by coming into the World an Infant, and growing up as other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do, both in Wiſdom, and in Stature, till he came to Man's eſtate, and living above thirty years among them: I ſay, by this he took the moſt effectual method to convince them that he was really and truly Man, in all things made like unto his Brethren, with all humane Infirmities, ſin only excepted: and conſequently that he was one of their Brethren: which, together with other circumſtances concurring, gave moſt convincing evidence, that he was <hi>that Prophet</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> had told them, GOD would raiſe up unto them, unto whom they were to hearken; even altho' it was to lay aſide ſome of theſe things that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf had taught them.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:002987_0090_0FE6AFD604726998"/>He being about to aboliſh the legal, and ſet up the Goſpel diſpenſation: It ſeem'd very proper that Chriſt ſhould come in his own Perſon to make this mighty alteration and change in their conſtitution: becauſe this was the moſt effectual way to give Credit &amp; Authority to his doctrines. For altho' he appeared to be really, &amp; truly Man; yet he appeared with marks of Divinity upon him, and proved himſelf to be the Son of GOD. And now what could give ſuch Authority to any doctrines, or diſpoſe perſons more readily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, than for the Son of GOD himſelf to teach them? That which gives Authority to any doctrine, is the apprehenſion of its coming from GOD. Now what better evidence could there be of a doctrin's coming from GOD than its being delivered by the Son of GOD, who came out from the Boſom of the Father, and whom the Father did once, and again by an audible voice from Heaven, declare to be <hi>His beloved Son, and commanded them to bear him?</hi> Mat. 17.5.</p>
               <p>So that altho' the <hi>Jews</hi> had a great veneration for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and look'd upon the Moſaical conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come from GOD, (as indeed it did) yet when Chriſt the Son of GOD perſonally appeared, there was ſufficient reaſon for them to hearken to his doctrine, altho' it was to lay aſide the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For altho' they might have deſpiſed any meer Man that had taught any thing contrary to their law, and treated him ſhamefully, as the Husbandmen in the Parable did the Servants of the Houſeholder; but as he ſaid, ſo GOD might juſtly expect, that ſurely,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002987_0091_0FE648A5860463D8"/>
                  <hi>they would reverence his Son,</hi> Mat. 21.37. So that it was wiſely contrived of GOD, that when he had <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpoken to the Fathers by the Prophets, he has in theſe laſt days,</hi> when he was ſetting up the Goſpel King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. CHRIST's coming, and dwelling among Men was very proper when he was about to lay aſide the Sacrifices and Ceremonies of the Jewiſh Church, and eſtabliſh the Goſpel; <hi>becauſe they had their accompliſhment in Him, and were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded by Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are told, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. That <hi>the law,</hi> that is the Prieſthood, the Sacrifices, and Ceremonies of it, were <hi>ſhadows of good things to come.</hi> That is, they were ſhadows or dark repreſentations of Chriſt, and of the great Sacrifice he ſhould once make of himſelf; and of the benefits he ſhould purchaſe for us by that Sacrifice. And now, as the ſhadow was to continue till Chriſt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance came, and no longer: ſo it was neceſſary, when the legal Conſtitution which was only a ſhadow of Chriſt and the Goſpel ſtate was to be aboliſhed, that Chriſt himſelf ſhould make his appearance in the World: who being the Antitype, or the Subſtance that was ſhadowed out, might ſuperſede, ſcatter, and remove thoſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. For by his coming, and accompliſhing what they prefigured of him, he made it appear, that they had anſwered the end for which they were Inſtituted at firſt, and that there was no further occaſion for them And thus the Apoſtles, after they had received the holy Ghoſt, underſtood it;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:002987_0092_0FE6AFD9DA8AAD80"/>
and were accordingly for laying the whole Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law aſide: excepting in a few particulars which they ſubmitted to for Peace-ſake, whilſt a Judaizing ſpirit continued among the Chriſtian Jews.</p>
               <p n="4">4. CHRIST's dwelling among us when he was made fleſh, was very ſerviceable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he was upon; <hi>becauſe his Life was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to his Doctrines, and Precepts, as to be a mighty recommendation of them, and ſerved very much to lead Perſons into the Belief and Practice of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any thing that recommends a vertue more, than to have it drawn out and deſcribed in a Man's life. Examples we all find are more powerful than Precepts. Accordingly our bleſſed Saviour ſaw cauſe, not only to deliver his Precepts to us; but alſo to tranſcribe them in his own life: and thereby has left on record the moſt perfect Pattern of holineſs, that ever was in Man; which was certainly the moſt effectual way to credit, eſtabliſh, and promote the holy and ſpiritual Religion of the Goſpel he was ſetting up.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Life and Converſation he led in the World, <hi>He demonſtrated his Truth, and Sincerity, with reſpect to the Doctrines, and Precepts that he taught them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Life, and Converſation being ſo agreable to what he taught them, gave ſufficient proof that he was ſincere and hearty in what he ſaid, that he told them nothing but what he believed, and knew to be true. He reproved them for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:002987_0093_0FE6AFD9F3E02AA8"/>
but what he refrained from himſelf. He commanded them nothing but what he conformed to himſelf, ſo far as it could belong to him: the rules he gave to others, he made the rules of his own conduct; which muſt needs convince Men that they were what he knew to be the beſt rules for Men to govern themſelves by. For it can't be thought he would practice according to his own rules, unleſs he knew in his heart that they were the beſt. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Life, and Converſation ſerved very much <hi>to ſet forth the Excellency of his Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to the ſincere, and hearty practice of Chriſtianity, it is neceſſary that we ſee, and have a convincing evidence of the beauty &amp; excellency of it. And now what external way is there that can ſo elegantly ſet forth the beauty of holineſs, and the excellency of all Chriſtian graces, as the perfect copy of them drawn in a Man's life? They are much more livelily expreſs'd, in actions than in words. It is the living theſe vertues and graces, and not ſo much the ſpeaking them, that recommends them. And thus did our bleſſed Saviour recommend them to us by his own life: for he ſtrictly obſerved his own Precepts, ſo far as they cou'd relate to him. Now what could recommend a life of piety, and devotion, a life of Juſtice, and Charity, an heavenly Walk, and Converſation, ſo much as Chriſt's ſetting a perfect Pattern of theſe things before us? For, as it rendred Chriſt himſelf amiable in the eyes of all, but ſuch as were perverſely ſet againſt him: ſo did it give a Reputation to the vertues
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:002987_0094_0FE6AFDC06AC2140"/>
themſelves. They never appeared ſo glorious, as in the life of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And there is nothing of outward means, that is now more help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to encourage and promote piety, and holineſs, goodneſs, and charity, a contempt of this world, and the like, than the ſurveying our Saviour's life, as it is recorded in his Goſpel. Which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhows the Wiſdom and Prudence of GOD, in ordering Chriſt's abode with us for a time, and living ſuch a life among Men. For ſince ſuch an holy and ſpiritual Religion was to be ſet up, it was certainly a point of Wiſdom to take the moſt effectual means for the recommending of it unto the World.</p>
               <p>But I paſs now to another Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>In the</hi> SUFFERINGS <hi>&amp;</hi> DEATH <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> there appeared a great deal of Divine Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>He that reads the Hiſtory of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, will find that he was a <hi>Man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief</hi>; that throughout the whole courſe of his life, eſpecially after he appeared in his publick Miniſtry, he was deſpiſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, reproached, and inſulted by Men. But towards the latter end of his life, we find him ſtill more oppreſſed with grief, and ſorrow, and groaning under the weight of our Sins that were laid upon him; eſpecially under his Father's holy wrath upon the account of them. Thus we find him <hi>in an agony</hi>; complaining that <hi>his ſoul was exceeding ſorrowful even unto death</hi>; and his Body <hi>ſweating as it were great drops of blood.</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:002987_0095_0FE6AFDC1CABC860"/>
And the ſame Night we find him wickedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into the hands of Sinners, by one of his own Diſciples. After which he was falſely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and unjuſtly condemned, and moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful abuſes offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to him. <hi>They ſpit upon him; they ſmote him with the palms of their hands</hi>; and in a taunting, jeering manner, called upon him to propheſy, <hi>who</hi> did it. Moreover, they ſat, him up as a mock-King; ſtripping him of his own Cloaths, and putting on him <hi>a Purple Robe with a crown of thorns on his head,</hi> and <hi>a Reed,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Scepter,</hi> in his hand; and then with, the utmoſt inſult, and mockery, <hi>bowed the knee before him; crying, Hail, King of the Jews</hi>! When they had done this, they <hi>ſpit upon him, and beat him with the reed,</hi> they had put in his hand. And after they had mocked and inſulted him, they led him away to the Place of Execution, where they had determin'd to inflict upon him the curſed, ſhameful, and painful death of the croſs. At which time he ſeem'd to be under a Divine deſertion, that made him cry out with ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible diſtreſs, <hi>My God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> And at length he <hi>bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> A particular account of which things we have in <hi>Math.</hi> 26. &amp; 27th Chapters, and <hi>John</hi> 18. &amp; 19th Chapters.</p>
               <p>And now in all the cruel ſufferings, and in the curſed, and ſhameful death, that Chriſt endured, there appears a great deal of Wiſdom, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in regard of many wiſe, great, and good Ends anſwered hereby.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:002987_0096_0FE6AFE4EC81C898"/>1. By the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>there was Satisfaction made to GOD for Sin</hi>; and a way opened for GOD, conſiſtent with the honour of all his perfections, to pardon, and be reconciled to repenting, and believing Sinners.</p>
               <p>The Infinite Mercy of GOD inclined him to take pity and compaſſion upon miſerable Man: but that could not be, unleſs there was ſome effectual care taken, to ſecure the honour of the other Divine perfections. And here lay the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to have Mercy on the Sinner, and at the ſame time to vindicate the honour of his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which conſiſts in an infinite hatred of all ſin; and of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which obliges him to ſee to it that every tranſgreſſion receive a juſt recompence of reward: and of his <hi>Truth,</hi> when he had poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively threatned death to ſin. But now the death of Chriſt is an expedient for all this; and wholly removes the difficulty; and makes way for <hi>Mercy, and truth to meet together, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and peace to kiſs each other.</hi> For ſince Chriſt has been delivered for our offences, and borne our ſins in his own body on the tree, all the perfections of GOD not only harmonize, but ſhine more gloriouſly, in the pardon, and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of penitent, believing ſinners; as has been already ſhown in a foregoing diſcourſe. So that now, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. GOD may <hi>declare his righteouſneſs, and be juſt</hi> to himſelf, and to all his perfections; <hi>and yet the Juſtifier</hi> of the Sinner <hi>that believes in Jeſus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For altho' the Sinner be ſaved, yet the ſin is puniſhed in the death of Chriſt. And ſo it is now become even
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002987_0097_0FE6AFE5059B2A58"/>
an act of Juſtice in GOD, to pardon, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the ſinner that repents, and believes in Jeſus. Hence the Apoſtle tells us, 1 Joh. 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful, and</hi> JUST, <hi>to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> It is with regard to our Surety, an act of Juſtice in GOD, to forgive the ſins of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and he will be faithful and juſt to do it. And now in ſuch a wonderful manner as this, does the death of Chriſt remove all the difficulties in the way to our being pardoned and juſtified; which ſeemed inſuperable, and would have puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not only the wiſeſt of Men, but the brighteſt Angel in heaven; which ſerves to ſet forth the Wiſdom of GOD in the contrivance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was the moſt effectual way that could be contrived, <hi>for the illuſtrating the infinite Love, and Grace of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems impoſſible for any thing to be contrived, that could ſo clearly diſplay the boundleſs riches of divine Grace, as the ſufferings, and death of the Son of GOD. How could GOD the Father have expreſſed greater love, and grace, than in parting with his only begotten &amp; dearly beloved Son out of his own Boſom; to receive all the Ignominy, and reproach that Men could put upon him, and to endure the cruel, ſhameful, and curſed death of the Croſs? And then how could Chriſt have manifeſted greater love, and grace to Man than in laying down his life for us? There is nothing ſo dear to Man, of a temporal nature, as LIFE. It is an undoubted truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſpoken by the father of lies, <hi>Skin for skin,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002987_0098_0FE6AFEB8163F118"/>
yea all that a man hath, will he give for his life,</hi> Job 2.4. Accordingly the higheſt inſtance of love that can be among Men, is for one Man to part with, or lay down, his life for another: and this is an inſtance of love that is exceeding rare among Men, and can never be ſuppoſed to be exerciſed towards any, but a very particular friend. For thus ſays our Saviour, (who beſt knew the degree of love that Men could exerciſe towards one another,) Joh. 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n than this; that a man lay down his life for his friend.</hi> And where is the Man that has ſo great a love as this? But as the Apoſtle ſays, Rom. 5.8. <hi>GOD has commended his love to us</hi> (given higher manifeſtations of it) <hi>in that while we were ſinners,</hi> and enemies, <hi>Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> And now herein appeared the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD: becauſe as he intended to make a glorious manifeſtation of his love and grace, he has moſt effectually anſwered his end, by Chriſt's enduring the Croſs, and deſpiſing the ſhame for <hi>our ſakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Death of Chriſt was a wiſe contrivance, as it was the moſt effectual Method that could be, <hi>to diſcover the infinite Evil of Sin, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from a ſinful courſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was very proper, and requiſite for the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the World, when he was about to pardon and ſave Sinners, to give ſome full manifeſtations of the horrid and odious nature of ſin: and take effectual care, not to give us the leaſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go on in ſin: but that we ſhould have as much reaſon to be afraid of it, and to ſtrive
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002987_0099_0FE6B1220377B5E8"/>
againſt it, as ever. And now what way could be taken to convince us more effectually, that ſin was the worſt of Evils; that it was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offenſive to the pure Eyes of GOD's Glory; and infinitely dangerous for us to go on in ſin; than to ſee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>readful effects of it upon our Saviour, when it was imputed to him? How could we have had a more lively Idea of the horrid nature, and the dangerous conſequences, of ſin; than by the dying groans and agonies of the Son of GOD; when he bore our ſins in his own body on the tree? Here we find, that when he had our ſins upon him, he was ready to ſink under the weight of them, and would have done ſo, had it not been for his Divinity which ſupported him. Into what an agony did ſin put him, when <hi>his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o that he <hi>ſweat as it were great drops of blood: and cryed to his Father, again, and again,</hi> that if it <hi>were poſſible, the bitter cup might paſs from him!</hi> And when he cryed out in ſuch anguiſh of Soul upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God! why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> Now if the Son of GOD himſelf was ready to ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of his Father's wrath, when he undertook to ſatisfie for our ſins; this will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and neceſſarily lead us to conclude, that there is an infinite Evil in ſin: and that it would be a moſt fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD, with the guilt of ſin upon us. We are naturally led to argue after this manner: If the Son of GOD could not help crying out, when under the wrath of GOD for
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:002987_0100_0FE648A7EA8C0B48"/>
our ſin, how inſupportable will our torments be, who are obliged to receive the puniſhment of our own Iniquities? Was Chriſt's Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful, when he was making ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſin, how then will our hearts endure, or how ſhall our hands be ſtrong, when GOD ſhall come to deal with us?</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the death and ſufferings of Chriſt give the moſt convincing evidence of the evil of ſin; and afford one of the beſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to diſſwade and deter us from it. And here I will venture to ſay; altho' ſome may think that if they did but hear the crys of the damned in hell, they ſhould be affrighted from their ſinful ways; yet that the dying crys and groans of the Son of GOD are as ſtrong an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to diſſwade and deter us from ſin: and he that will not be moved by this conſideration, neither would he be effectually perſwaded, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' one ſhould come from the bottomleſs Pit with the flames of hell about him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another wiſe and good End anſwered by the death of Chriſt, <hi>is that it affords mighty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Sinners, to come unto him: and a ſure foundation of Comfort, to all ſuch as are in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since Chriſt had undertaken our Salvation, and we were to be juſtifyed, and ſaved by <hi>faith</hi> in him; it was neceſſary there ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to convince us that he was able to ſave us: thereby to encourage us to repair to him, and depend upon him for Salvation. And now what could ſo convince us of his being able to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:002987_0101_0FE6AFEB966A6740"/>
ſave us, as the ſeeing him pay the price of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Redemption, and make full ſatisfaction to GOD for our ſins; by ſuffering the puniſhment due unto us for them? for if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt proclaiming himſelf a Saviour, able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that ſhould come unto GOD by him, and yet had never endured theſe cruel ſufferings, and this curſed death: I ſay, in ſuch a caſe, we ſhould not have been ſo much encouraged to go to him, nor have ſuch a foundation to depend upon him, as now we have. We ſhould have been more doubting, and unbelieving. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the inflexible Juſtice of God, his glorious Holineſs, his immutability &amp; Truth, would naturally raiſe great doubts in our minds, whether he would ever paſs by our ſins, without a ſatisfaction for the wrong done to all his perfections by them.</p>
               <p>But now Chriſt having made his Soul an offering for ſin, and been obedient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs; and thereby having made full ſatisfaction for the wrong done by ſin; he has given the moſt convincing evidence, that he is a compleat Saviour. Since he has paid a price for our ranſom, having been wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities; we may with courage, and confidence go to him, and depend upon him; aſſured, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. For as he ſtrongly argues in 34. <hi>v. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> So that
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:002987_0102_0FE6AFF7F44D53F8"/>
indeed the death of Chriſt is one of the greateſt encouragements ſinners have to come unto him for life: for as the Apoſtle tells us, Heb. 9.26. <hi>He has taken away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf. And by that one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Chap. 10.13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another good End anſwered by the Death of Chriſt, <hi>was the Confirmation of his Doctrines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt had taught that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> propheſied of, and promiſed; that he was the Son of GOD, and the Saviour of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe being the grand Doctrines of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, the very foundation of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it was neceſſary that he ſhould give the higheſt teſtimony that could be, of the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And what fuller confirmation could he have given, that he taught nothing but what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and knew to be true, than to lay down his life for the teſtimony that he had given, and to ſeal his Doctrines with his blood?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another good End anſwered by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Death of Chriſt is, <hi>That they ſerve not only as a Pattern, for direction to us in ſuffering and dying; but alſo as an Argument, to reconcile us unto ſufferings, and death it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt aſſured his Diſciples, and followers, that in the World they ſhould have tribulation: and they all find it ſo by experience. But now the ſufferings of Chriſt, and his behaviour under them, ſerve as a <hi>Pattern,</hi> to direct us how we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves under ſufferings, and under the apprehenſions &amp; approaches of death. If he had
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:002987_0103_0FE6AFF80DD945D8"/>
not been a Man of ſorrows, he could not have left us a Pattern of ſuffering-graces. How could he have left us an Example of Patience, of profound ſubmiſſion and reſignation to the will of GOD; or of a forgiving ſpirit towards his Enemies, and the like; if he had not had bitter cups to drink, and received injuries and abuſes from Men?</p>
               <p>But then he becomes not only a more full and perfect Pattern and Example to us hereby; but his ſufferings ſerve mightily to <hi>ſupport,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Saints under their afflictions. If they meet with the foreſt trials, &amp; the heavieſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have this to comfort them; That it is no more than what their Lord and Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf met withall. And indeed there are ſcarce any ſufferings to be met with in this life, but that we may comfort our ſelves with this thought; That Chriſt had a ſhare of the ſame. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our offers this as an argument of comfort to his Diſciples. Joh. 15.18. <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</hi> And now his having been under the ſame troubles and afflictions, affords great comfort, from this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; that he knows how to pity us, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and ſupport us under them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. laſt. <hi>In that he himſelf having ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, <hi>The captain of our ſalvation became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thro' ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 2.10. After he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a while, he entred into his glory. And this ſerves wonderfully to reconcile us to, and comfort us under ſufferings; becauſe after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we muſt be perfected. 1 Pet. 1.10. <hi>But the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:002987_0104_0FE6AFFB9CF03018"/>
God of all grace, which hath called us unto his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory, by Chriſt Jeſus, after that ye have ſuffered a while, make you perfect.</hi> And thus even Death it ſelf is made more eaſy to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the Grave ſweetned by Chriſt's having been there before them: eſpecially conſidering that as they are to be conformed to him in the likeneſs of his Death, they will alſo in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: An inſtance of Wiſdom hereafter to be conſidered.</p>

               <p>Men, &amp; Devils, the Enemies of Chriſt, thought nothing ſo effectual to deſtroy him and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as to put him to death. The Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no doubt thought that it Jeſus was but once dead, his Intereſt would be deſtroyed and his own Kingdom would ſtill remain undiſturbed. Accordingly the Devil entred into <hi>Judas,</hi> tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to betray his Maſter: and filled the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the Chief Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſees, with ſuch rage and malice againſt him, that they prevailed ſo far as to get him Crucified, and having thus actually procured his Death, the Devil and the unbelieving Jews concluded they had given a mortal ſtroke to his intereſt, and that his deſigns and attempts would have been wholly fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>But behold how the Wiſdom of GOD out-did all the Policy of Earth and Hell! For that which
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:002987_0105_0FE6AFFBB1965600"/>
it was thought would have utterly deſtroyed the Intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt, was the very means of advancing it, and deſtroying the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan. When he thought he had given a mortal blow to Chriſt, it proved a deadly wound to himſelf. The Serpent, by bruiſing the heel of the Seed of the Woman, had his own head bruiſed and broken. And here is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD in a Myſtery, that Chriſt by dying overcame death, and <hi>deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the Devil,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>Other inſtances of Divine Wiſdom in the affair of our Redemption, muſt be left to another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. And I muſt conclude at preſent with one word briefly, by way of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us all be thankful to Chriſt the Eternal Word,</hi> that when he was made fleſh he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to dwell among us for ſo long a time as to give ſufficient evidence that he was one of us; and did really partake of fleſh and blood with us.</p>
               <p>And let us be thankful for the excellent Doctrines and Precepts, that he has delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, for the rule of our faith and manners; and for the tranſcript he has given of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in his Life, whereby he has mightily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them unto us, giving us therein the cleareſt view of the amiableneſs of Religion and the beauty of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially let us be thankful <hi>for his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Death</hi>; which, altho' ſo bitter to him, yet were ſo much for the Glory of GOD, and of infinite advantage to Mankind. And ſince
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:002987_0106_0FE6B00400F70260"/>
Chriſt has died for us, let us not only admire and adore the riches of his love and grace herein, but be alſo encouraged herefrom to fly to him for refuge, and depend upon him for Salvation. Let us believe and be perſwaded that by his Death he has fully ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, and paid our debt to the utmoſt farthing; inſomuch that GOD can now be juſt, and yet the juſtifier of him that believes in Jeſus. GOD forbid, that we ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus! Becauſe by that only can we be delivered from the Curſe of the Law and ſaved from the wrath to come.</p>
               <p>And now inſtead of taking encouragement to go on in Sin, becauſe Chriſt has died and made ſatisfaction for it; let us be more than ever <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from a Sinful courſe.</hi> Let us but conſider how much it coſt the Son of GOD to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Sin; and then conſider how dreadful our condition muſt needs be, if we muſt anſwer for our own Sins (as we moſt certainly ſhall) if we die in them: and this will make us afraid of Sin. Let us conſider, if Sin fetched ſuch dreadful groans from the Son of GOD, what ſhrieks and crys it will fetch from us in the Flames of Hell forever, when we come to bear the puniſhment of our own Iniquities. Let us therefore be all awakened by the dreadful ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt to break off all our Sins by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to get into Chriſt, to get united to him that ſo we may be ſaved from all condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

If we endeavour thus to have the ſame mind and frame of Spirit under ſufferings &amp; death as was in Chriſt Jeſus, we ſhall at length come to be with him to behold and to partake of his Glory, in that place, where there is no more Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſuffering, <hi>nor any more Death; but all tears ſhall be forever wiped away from our eyes.</hi>

And now
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:002987_0108_0FE6B009111A3C20"/>
in this affair there appears a great deal of the Wiſdom and Prudence of GOD: and that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the manner and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it: or the wiſe and good Ends that have been and are anſwered by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Manner</hi> of Chriſt Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, <hi>and the circumstances that attended them,</hi> diſcover much of the divine Wiſdom &amp; Prudence.</p>
               <p>And here we muſt obſerve, that as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ariſe from the Dead: ſo it was neceſſary it ſhould be done in ſuch a way &amp; manner as to afford inconteſtible Evidence of the certainty of it, and that there ſhould be no room left for doubts and jealouſies to unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced minds. For a great deal depended upon his Reſurrection. The whole Chriſtian Religion hung upon it. For having foretold his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; if he had not riſen according to his word, he would have proved himſelf to be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor; and all that intereſt which he had gained in the world would ſoon have come to nothing. Whereas on the other hand, his riſing again from the dead being what he himſelf foretold, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it ſelf a moſt miraculous operation, muſt needs ſerve very much to eſtabliſh his doctrines, and confirm to every one, that he was the Perſon he had declared himſelf to be. Therefore it was abſolutely neceſſary that when he aroſe there ſhould be ſuch proof, and demonſtration of it, as would be ſatisfactory to a rational Unprejudiced perſon; for unleſs there be ſufficient proof of his Reſurrection from the dead, there would not be ſufficient reaſon to believe his doctrines, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

imbrace his Religion. And now this was well conſidered and thought of by GOD, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the affair of his Reſurrection as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and circumſtances of it, were ſo contrived as to leave no room for doubts, or uncertainties in the matter, to ſuch as will but be ſatisfied with the ſame degree of evidence in <hi>this,</hi> as they are in a thouſand other i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtances.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall not deſcend to all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances that might be mentioned rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this affair, but ſhall content my ſelf with ſome general hints, which will ſerve to ſhow that there has been a great deal of Wiſdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the management of it.</p>
               <p>And here I might ſay, firſt of all, that the <hi>Time</hi> in which Chriſt aroſe after his death, was wiſely contrived; which was on the third day. For it was very neceſſary he ſhould continue under the power of death ſo long a time, as to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he was really dead. If he had revived quickly after he gave up the Ghoſt; People would not have readily believed that he had been dead, but only that he had fainted, or fallen into ſome fit; as many perſons do, and to appearance are dead, but recover themſelves again There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent any doubts or cavils as to the reality of his death, he continued in the ſtate of the dead till the third day: which is beyond the time that any can be ſuppoſed to continue in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>oon, or fit.</p>
               <p>And it was alſo wiſely &amp; graciouſly contrived that he ſhould riſe within ſo ſhort a time after his death. For if he had continued much longer
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002987_0110_0FE6B01663B36398"/>
in the Grave, his body according to the common courſe of nature would have been putrifyed &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; which would have contradicted a Prophecy concerning him, in Pſal. 16.10. <hi>Thou wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce of his being the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it was very neceſſary to prevent all poſſibility of our being impoſed upon, that Chriſt ſhould riſe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſoon after his death as that his Countenance might not in the leaſt meaſure be forgotten: but that they who ſaw him, and knew him before, might retain ſuch a perfect Idea of his Countenance, as to know it was the very ſame perſon when they ſaw him again. Moreover, GOD wiſely and mercifully conſidered the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's Diſciples; and ordered ſo ſhort a time for his continuance in the Grave, to prevent their ſinking into utter deſpair concerning him. It was doubtleſs a very trying time to Chriſt's Diſciples, when he lay in the Grave. When they ſaw him actually dead, and buried, they were ready to give up the cauſe While he was among them, they looked that he ſhould have reſtored the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and brought Redemption: but now he was dead, they did not know what to think of it. And doubtleſs they waited very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently till the third day, to ſee if he roſe or no. And ſo GOD in gracious Condeſcention to the weakneſs of their faith, ſpeedily raiſed their ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
               <p>And thus as there was Wiſdom and Prudence, if we conſider the time that Chriſt continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:002987_0111_0FE6B01678A7C8C0"/>
the power of death, before he triumphed over it in his Reſurrection; ſo was there in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that attended his Reſurrection, which afforded full demonſtration that he did really and truly riſe from the dead, and that they were not in the leaſt impoſed upon. And here it is to be obſerved as an act of Wiſdom in Chriſt that before his death, he told them when he ſhould riſe, even on the third day. Whereby he gave not only his Diſciples, but even his Enemies, fair opportunity to watch his Sepulchre, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was as good as his word, or no. And then here the wiſe &amp; over ruling Providence of GOD is further to be obſerved in ſo ordering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the very worſt of his Enemies were led into the moſt effectual method to be convinced in their own Conſciences, that he did according to his promiſe actually riſe from the dead. For they remembring what he had ſaid concerning his riſing on the third day, ſuſpected that <hi>his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would come by night and ſteal him away, and then ſay he was riſen, and ſo the laſt error would be worſe than the firſt.</hi> The Chief Prieſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and the Phariſees deſire of Pilate, <hi>That the Sepulchre might be made ſure until the third day.

               <p>And now as this was a moſt effectual way to have detected the cheat, if there had been any;
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002987_0112_0FE6B017E4625C90"/>
ſo as there was none, it ſerved to confirm the truth, and certainty of the fact. For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe that were ſet to watch the Sepulchre, were hereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to witneſs to his Reſurrection; and did lay ſufficient matter for conviction before the Chief Prieſts and Elders to leave them inexcuſable for their perverſeneſs, and infidelity. For when the Soldiers were according to their orders watching on the Morning of the third day (as doubtleſs they did) with a great deal of care being the day he told them he ſhould riſe; I ſay, when they were lo king out ſharply, expecting his Diſciples would come to ſteal him away: behold at that very time the Angel came down from Heaven, and rolled away the ſtone from the Door of the Sepulchre, and ſat upon it in ſuch brightneſs, and luſtre, as that the Soldiers were all filled with Amazement; <hi>they did ſhake and became as dead men.</hi> And the Angel tells the Women that came juſt at that time to ſee his Sepulchre, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not there, but was riſen from the dead, as he had ſaid; and invites them to come near, and ſee the place where he had lain. And not only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Women, but ſome of his Apoſtles came alſo and ſaw that he was gone out of the Sepulchre.</p>
               <p>But now if he had gone immediately into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without making his perſonal bodily Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among Men, there would have been a great deal of room left for doubts and ſuſpicions among Men; and indeed if he had not appeared viſibly among Men, it would have been morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring Men into the belief of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This therefore was wiſely conſidered by
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:002987_0113_0FE6B017FA207670"/>
Chriſt. He accordingly abode ſome time upon Earth after his Reſurrection, and ſhewed himſelf frequently unto his Diſciples; he converſed with them, and eat with them; and cauſed <hi>Thomas</hi> that was the moſt doubting of his Diſciples, to feel of him, to ſee the print of the Nails in his hands, and to thruſt his hand into his ſide that had been pierced with the Spear, by which he gave the moſt ſenſible Evidence that he was indeed riſen, and had the very ſame body he laid down in the Grave.</p>
               <p>But then becauſe a few are more eaſily deluded, and impoſed upon, than a great number, and were not ſo ready to believe any wonderful thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a few perſons: This therefore did Chriſt conſider, and ſhewed himſelf not only very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his Eleven Diſciples, but he ſhewed himſelf to a great multitude at once, even to above five hundred Brethren, as appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. And now herein appeared the Wiſdom of GOD, as the Apoſtle ſays, Act. 1.3. <hi>That he ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion by many infallible proofs; being ſeen of them forty days, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as he took care to give infallible proofs of his Reſurrection, ſo did he alſo to prove his Aſcenſion into Heaven. That he did not juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and then dye again, but that as he ſaid to his Diſciples, he aſcended to <hi>his Father and their Father, to his God and their God</hi>; for he did not go up <hi>Incognito,</hi> but he took his Diſciples with him to the Mount of Olives: and when he had bleſſed them, and in a ſolemn manner taken his
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002987_0114_0FE6B026771F4848"/>
leave of them; and while their eyes were fixed upon him, he Aſcended up gradually towards Heaven; ſo that they actually ſaw him going up till a cloud interrupted. But then that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting to ſtrengthen their faith in this matter; two of the Angels that came to wait upon Chriſt in his triumphant progreſs to Heaven, are ſent back to tell them not to gaze any longer, becauſe he was aſcended to Heaven, and that they ſhould ſee him return in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they had ſeen him go up: that is at the day of Judgment, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11. And then for a further confirmation, we have the Teſtimony of the bleſſed Proto-Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi>; who becauſe he was the firſt that dyed for the cauſe of Chriſt, had a glorious revelation made to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares juſt before his death, That <hi>he ſaw the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God,</hi> Act. 7.56.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee a great deal of Wiſdom, and Prudence in the Manner of Chriſt's riſing from the dead, and aſcending to Heaven: for they have been carried on in ſuch a manner as to afford ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and ſatisfactory evidence to reaſonable and unprejudiced minds.</p>
               <p>Some may poſſibly think it would have been better if he had appeared more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly after his Reſurrection; and that if he had then ſhewed himſelf to his Crucifiers, and the Infidel Jews, they would have believed on him. But to this it may be ſaid that he gave ſufficient demonſtration of his Reſurrection. And that this even the Chief Prieſts and Elders themſelves
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:002987_0115_0FE6B0268F32F208"/>
had ſufficient matter for Conviction offered to them by the report they received from the Soldiers, whom they themſelves had appointed to watch the Sepulchre, and which were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch as they could put confidence in. Which together with the Miracles he had wrought in in their preſence before his death, and other concurring circumſtances for the proof hereof, made it altogether unneceſſary for him to do any thing further to convince them. For when ſuitable, and ſufficient means won't anſwer it is no ways conſiſtent with the honour of GOD to ſtoop to all the perverſe and obſtinate humours of Men. But I proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Reſurrection &amp; Aſcenſion of Chriſt there will appear a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence, if we conſider <hi>the wiſe, and good Ends that are anſwered hereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Reſurrection of Chriſt ſerved <hi>for the confirmation of all his Doctrines, &amp; of the Religion, that he came to ſet up among Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour had told them before hand of his riſing again from the dead within three days, which as it would be a ſign or token of his coming from GOD, ſo would be a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all he had taught them. But now if he had not riſen from the dead as he promiſed, he would have proved himſelf an Impoſtor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the People, and his Religion that he was ſetting up would have come to nothing. But now by his being ſo good as his word in this grand Article of his Reſurrection, he has confirmed the truth of all that he ſaid unto
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:002987_0116_0FE6B027C2B36030"/>
them. By this he has given demonſtration that GOD was with him; and that he was ſuch a Divine Perſon, even the Son of GOD, as he had declared: as the Apoſtle tells us, Rom. 1.4. <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit of holineſs by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> And now if his Reſurrection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him to be the Son of GOD, it does by conſequence declare the truth of all that he had taught &amp; commanded. For if he was the Son of GOD, it was impoſſible for him to deliver anything but what is agreable to truth. And now, as I ſay he was declared to be the Son of GOD with power by his Reſurrection from the dead, that is, his Reſurrection was a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his being the Son of GOD. (For if he had nor been the Son of GOD, he could not have raiſed himſelf from the dead by his own power. And moſt certainly GOD would never have raiſed him from the dead, if he had falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended to be the Son of GOD. For as it is impoſſible for GOD to lye, ſo is it impoſſible for him ſo far to confirm a lye, or countenance blaſphemy, as he would have done in raiſing Chriſt from the dead, if he had not been the Son of GOD, as he profeſſed.) So that the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt affords anirrefragable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the truth of Chriſtianity. Inſomuch that if we do but believe that Chriſt <hi>both died and roſe again and revived,</hi> we muſt believe, we muſt receive and embrace Chriſtianity, and be fully ſatisfyed in the truth of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt's Reſurrection, as it ſerves to aſſure
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:002987_0117_0FE6B027D93AE490"/>
us that he had by his death made full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſin, <hi>ſo it affords ſtrong Conſolation to all that believe in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt having undertaken for us, and our ſins being laid upon him; if his Death had not been a ſatisfactory ſacrifice, he could not have riſen from the dead, much leſs have aſcended into Heaven. Therefore his riſing from the dead plainly teaches, yea aſſures us, that by the <hi>one offering of himſelf he finiſhed tranſgreſſion, and made an end of ſin, and brought in an everlasting righteouſneſs.</hi> Chriſt's being diſcharged from the Priſon of the Grave, makes it evident that by his death he ſatisfyed the demands of Juſtice, and had paid the debt to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he had undertaken for: which muſt needs afford joy, &amp; conſolation to all that believe in him; becauſe they have aſſurance hereby that their ſins are ſatisfyed for, their debt paid, and they diſcharged, and no condemnation belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. For the Reſurrection of Chriſt in a peculiar manner juſtifies them or frees them from Condemnation; or rather gives aſſurance of their Juſtification, by aſſuring them that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made for them. As the Apoſtle ſays, Rom. 4.25. <hi>He was delivered for our offences, and raiſed for our Juſtification.</hi> That is, ſays an Expoſitour, <q>Chriſt did Meritoriouſly work our Juſtification by his Death. But the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and perfection of it with reſpect to us, depends on his Reſurrection. By his Death he paid our debts, by his Reſurrection he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our acquittance.</q> If he had continued
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:002987_0118_0FE6B034E18B1110"/>
under the power of death, his death would have been of no benefit to us. But every true Believer may now ſay in holy triumph and joy, as in Rom. 8 34. <hi>Who is he that Codemneth! It is Chriſt that died, yea</hi> rather <hi>that is riſen again</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſcenſion ſerved <hi>intirely to take away the ſcandal of the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt's Sufferings, and Death were ſuch as carried a great deal of Ignominy, and Reproach with them. To ſuffer and die at all was Infinite Humiliation: but the death he died was the moſt ſhameful as well as cruel death, which was inflicted only upon ſlaves, and only the vileſt of them. So that this would have been a perpetual reproach to him; and would have been a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon for every Man's not believing in him, as their Saviour, who himſelf had died as the vileſt Malefactor; unleſs this reproach and ſcandal were ſome way or other taken off. The Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>a crucified Chriſt was to the Jews a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23. And well it might, if they had preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe concerning him, or if nothing further could be ſaid of him. But now his glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and triumphant Aſcenſion ſerved en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to remove <hi>this ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence.</hi> For his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion did him more honour than he could ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by that curſed death of the Croſs. By this he has appeared with more Magnificence and Glory than all earthly pomp and greatneſs could poſſibly have afforded him By this <hi>he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Son of God with power.</hi> He has
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:002987_0119_0FE6B034F523E1C0"/>
herein triumphed over death, and the grave: and ſhewed that altho' he ſubmitted to the ſtroke of death; yet he could not be held by the Chains of death, but that as he had power to lay down his life, ſo he had power to take it again.</p>
               <p>And now what reaſon is there to be in the leaſt ſcandalized at Chriſt, altho' he was dead, ſince GOD has raiſed him from the dead, and he is now alive, and lives for ever more, and has the keys of hell and of death? Who need be offended at Chriſt's <hi>enduring the croſs and undergoing ſuch ſhame,</hi> ſince he is now <hi>ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God</hi>!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another good end anſwered by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt is, <hi>that it affords a powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for our own Reſurrection to an Immortal State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine of the Reſurrection, altho' it was never thought of by the heathen World, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incredible to them when they firſt heard of it; yet it is a doctrine of great importance, very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the believed; and becauſe it appears with ſome difficulty, to believe that our bodies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have for thouſands of years been moulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into duſt, will be gathered together, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the ſame bodys again; hence it is very neceſſary that this doctrine ſhould ſome way or other be well eſtabliſhed, and confirmed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring Men into the full belief of it.</p>
               <p>And now what way could GOD have taken more effectually to convince Men of the truth of this doctrine than by giving a Specimen or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it; as he did in Chriſt's Reſurrection
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:002987_0120_0FE6B03674907B60"/>
from the dead. Indeed, before the coming of Chriſt, ſome perſons had been miraculouſly raiſed from the dead: as the Son of the Woman of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephath</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. and the Son of the <hi>Shunamite</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. But theſe were only raiſed to a mortal ſtate, they died again; as did all thoſe without doubt that our Saviour himſelf raiſed from the dead whilſt he dwelt among us, and ſo they were no examples of our being raiſed to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. And altho' ſome have been tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an Immortal ſtate, ſuch as <hi>Enoch</hi> &amp; <hi>Elijah</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they never actually died as other Men. So that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was the firſt that ever truly died and then roſe with an immortal Body, after the manner that all Mankind ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> in reckoning up the ſtrange things that happened at Chriſt's death, mentions this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52. <hi>That the graves were opened, and many bodies of ſaints that ſlept aroſe.</hi> But then by the next verſe it looks moſt probable, and the generality of Expoſitors agree to it, that this was after his Reſurrection; and that the Evangeliſt is only ſumming up in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the wonderful Events that happened about that time. And this agrees beſt with what the Apoſtle ſays, 1 Cor. 15.20. <hi>Chriſt being riſen from the dead is become the first fruits of them that ſleep.</hi> And with his being called <hi>the firſt begotten of the dead,</hi> Rev. 1.5. Which could not truly be ſaid if any had riſen before him. So that Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was a pledge and token of our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:002987_0121_0FE6B03690360258"/>
and aſſures us that we ſhall all riſe again: they <hi>that have done good to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life</hi> and happineſs; <hi>they that have done evil to the Reſurrection of damnation.</hi> But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially does the Reſurrection of Chriſt afford full aſſurance to Believers that they ſhall riſe again, for he is their myſtical, and ſpiritual Head, and they are the Members: and if the Head be riſen all the Members muſt certainly follow. And now that the Reſurrection of Chriſt is a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for our Reſurrection, appears from the Apoſtle's arguing it from that conſideration, 1 Cor 6.14. <hi>And God hath both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe us up by his own power.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.14. <hi>Knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another good end anſwered by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, <hi>is that it ſerves to raiſe our Minds above this World, and ſet them upon things that are above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſince Chriſt has left the World, and gone to Heaven, if we have a ſincere and hearty love for him, we ſhall follow him with our hearts; we ſhall look upon him as our treaſure, <hi>and where our treaſure is, there will our hearts be alſo.</hi> The thought that Chriſt has left the World, &amp; gone to Heaven, will cauſe the believing Soul to deſpiſe &amp; caſt an holy contempt upon this World, and will carry out the Soul in longing deſires to get to that bleſſed place where he is, that we might behold, and partake of his Glory. The Apoſtle thought that to be with Chriſt was far better than to be here, in ſo much that he was willing to be
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:002987_0122_0FE6B0402A75CFE0"/>
abſent from the body, and leave this World, to be preſent with the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. And the thought that Chriſt is gone to Heaven will put every ſaint upon looking upward, will fix his affections there, and will put him upon making his Intereſt there, as ſure as he can. It leads them to conſider that this World is not their home, but where Chriſt their Saviour dwells, to whom they expect and hope at laſt to be received. And hence does the Apoſtle argue with us after this manner, Col. 3.1. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Another good End anſwered by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection &amp; Aſcenſion of Chriſt is, <hi>that by this means we have a powerful Advocate &amp; Interceſſor with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For being riſen from the dead and aſcended to Heaven, He there appears in the preſence of GOD for us, preſenting his crucifyed Body, and pleading the Merits of his ſufferings &amp; obedience on our behalf; which as it is of infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſo it muſt needs afford unſpeakable comfort to the Saints. This is the comfort they have, as the Apoſtle ſays, 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>That if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> For altho' by his ſufferings he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Salvation, yet it is by his going to Heaven, and there Interceeding for us, that he became able to ſave us: Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt told his Diſciples before his Death, <hi>That in his Father's houſe were many Manſions, and that he was going to prepare a place for them, and that he would come again and receive them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that where he was there they might be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.2, 3. And now their ſeeing him aſcend up to Heaven after his Reſurrection, ſerved to ſtrengthen the faith of his Diſciples, and ſo of all true Believers, that when he had prepared a Place for them he would come again and receive them to it: for as they ſaw the former part of what he ſaid fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> his aſcending up to Heaven, it aſſured them of the fulfilment of the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would come again and receive them. But then we muſt conſider further, that Chriſt when he paſſed into the Heavens, entred and took poſſeſſion for Believers, as the Apoſtle tells us, Heb. 6.20 <hi>Whither the fore-runner is</hi> FOR US <hi>entred, even Jeſus.</hi> He entred as our head, and repreſentative, and ſo has ſet open the gates for all that ſhall believe in him. So that all believers may from hence be aſſured, that an open entrance ſhall be miniſtred to them into his everlaſting kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are ſome of the wiſe, and good Ends that have been anſwered by the Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, which ſerves to ſet forth the wiſdom, and the prudence of GOD in that affair.</p>
               <p>I may not proceed to another Inſtance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, but muſt conclude by ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:002987_0124_0FE6B04351CE26B8"/>
                  <hi>Let us all be thankful</hi> that as Chriſt died for our offences, ſo he has riſen again for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and is gone to Heaven, there to appear in the preſence of GOD for us; and that he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it in ſuch a manner, as to afford plentiful evidence and full demonſtration of it. And now let us rejoyce in the full belief of this comfortable Truth: a Truth that is the cauſe and foundation of all our hopes 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> It is by Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, that we are begotten again to a lively hope. For if he had not riſen there would no advantage have been received by his death, and ſo no foundation for our hope &amp; truſt in him; as the Apoſtle argues, 1 Cor. 15 17, 18. <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your ſins. Then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> But we believe and are aſſured of better things. And now ſince Chriſt has both died, and roſe again and revived; let us be conformed to him in the likeneſs of his Death, and Reſurrection. As he died for ſin, ſo let us die to ſin: And as he roſe again for our Juſtification ſo let us be raiſed to Righteouſneſs and new Obedience.

For here was to be a <hi>crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> preached &amp; offered unto them, which was to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks (the moſt celebrated for learning in the World) fooliſhneſs. Here was to be the ſetting forth of a ſtrange doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reſurrection of the body, which the Heathen World never dreamt of, and which ſeemed an incredible thing unto them. Here was alſo the preaching up of a Religion, the doctrines of which were too myſterious, ſublime and ſpiritual, to be eaſily apprehended by them, and the duties of it directly contrary to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and corrupt diſpoſitions of Men, and which tended directly to the ſubverſion, and overthrow of the kingdom of Satan: and ſo whoever ſhould undertake it, would be ſure of meeting with all poſſible oppoſition from Earth and Hell.

But as I obſerved in my firſt diſcourſe on this ſubject, the more difficult and perplexed any affair is, the more clearly does wiſdom appear in taking proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the accompliſhment of it.</p>
               <p>And now in the preſent caſe, GOD has improv'd the opportunity for making clear manifeſtations of his wiſdom; as will appear by conſidering the methods he has taken, and the means he has made uſe of for propagating the Chriſtian Religion in the World at firſt, and for maintaining and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting

that intereſt thro' the ſeveral Ages of the World to this day. And here I ſhall not take notice of the Inward, and more effectual means, <hi>viz.</hi> the Operations of the holy Spirit working Convictions, and a thorow Converſion in the Souls of Men, becauſe I ſhall leave this as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance of divine Wiſdom, to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered afterwards, But ſhall only take notice of the Outward means, thoſe that are viſible, and apparent, and obſerve what Wiſdom and Prudence there appeared herein.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Let us conſider the <hi>Perſons,</hi> imployed in carrying on this great, and difficult affair, <hi>who were a few poor Illiterate Fiſher-men</hi>; and it will appear to be a ſurprizing inſtance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Indeed conſidering the difficulty, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the work, we ſhould have thought (if we had been conſulted in the matter) that no Beings inferiour to the glorious Angels could have carried on this affair to effect: Humane reaſon would have thought that the only, or the more likely way would have been for thoſe bright Intelligences, who excel in wiſdom and ſtrength, to have come down among Men, to prevail with them to receive, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>orace the ſublime Doctrines and Duties of Chriſtianity. But altho' this might appear moſt agreable to the wiſdom of Man, yet it did not to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD. And if we do but thorowly conſider the matter, we ſhall ſee the Perſons that GOD pitched upon, to be much more proper and ſuitable. For if thoſe Miniſtring
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:002987_0128_0FE6B05457D4A1B8"/>
Spirits had come down in viſible Shapes among Men, and the Goſpel had been delivered by the Miniſtry of Angels, as the law was from Mount Sinai, it would indeed have filled Men, as it did the Iſraelites, with terror and amazement, and frighted Men into a ſubmiſſion to it: but they would not have been perſwaded into an hearty entertainment of the Goſpel from ſuch clear, rational Convictions, as now they were; and as is proper for rational and free Agents to be. Moreover, if ſuch powerful Inſtruments had been immediately and apparently imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this work, the power of GOD in the ſucceſs of the Goſpel would not have been ſo viſible, and apparent, nor ſo readily owned, and acknowledged as now it is.</p>
               <p>But then ſuppoſing we ſhould have thought it proper to imploy Men, ſome of our ſelves, as Inſtruments to carry on this affair, yet ſurely we ſhould have concluded that the wiſeſt and moſt effectual courſe would have been to chuſe the higheſt ranks and orders of Men for that ſervice: thoſe that had the greateſt Eſtates, were higheſt in authority, and that had the moſt powerful and extenſive Influence upon others. But now even this upon a more thorow conſideration does not appear to be ſo wiſe, and prudent a courſe as that which the wiſdom of GOD made choice of. For altho' perhaps ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more People might have profeſſed Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than there did; yet they would not have done it from ſuch true, rational &amp; Chriſtian principles: they might perhaps have come into

the profeſſion of it, for fear of their ſuperiours, or for faſhion ſake, or to pleaſe thoſe they had their dependence upon; or from ſome ſuch like temporal views, and not from any real Convictions in their own minds of the truth and excellency of Chriſtianity it ſelf. Nay they would rather ſuſpect that it was the ſubtil contrivance of the great Men, to keep the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in greater awe, and in more perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them. So that altho' there might have been more profeſſed Chriſtians, yet there would not have been ſo many real and hearty ones. And ſo GOD has ſhown that <hi>his thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways,</hi> in pitching upon ſuch as were the moſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any to carnal reaſon at the firſt thought, for this ſervice, even Men of an inferiour Rank, who had no advantage of Education, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of Eſtates, or of Authority; and ſo in ſhort, nothing in themſelves by nature, or birth, or outward circumſtances that could recommend them unto the People. Now, I ſay, ſuch were the Men that GOD firſt ſent forth to preach the Goſpel to the World; and certainly there was a great deal of wiſdom &amp; prudence herein.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They were the least likely of any to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of being about to</hi> impoſe a cheat <hi>upon the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For none could think that ſuch Men who had no more advantages of Education, or Eſtate, or Authority, or Reputation in the World, than a company of Fiſher-men, ſhould undertake to
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:002987_0130_0FE6B05B975E8F28"/>
draw a new Scheme of Religion, full of ſtrange doctrines, out of their own Brains, and think to perſwade the World into the belief and practice of it. I ſay, no body would ever ſuſpect ſuch a company of Men to be upon ſuch a deſign as this. For however ſtrange, and incredible the things they taught might be to the generality of Mankind, yet they would not think but that theſe poor Men, who appeared with ſo much ſimplicity, did believe what they ſaid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe were the most likely Men to perſwade the World that what they taught</hi> came from GOD, <hi>and ought to be received by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, firſt, it would appear very certain to all that conſidered it, that theſe illiterate Men could not themſelves be the Authors of that Religion they preached. Who could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Men of no better Education than they, could have drawn up the fulleſt, &amp; moſt exact Compendium of all moral Duties; and have given the moſt extenſive, and the moſt refined and ſpiritual Notion of all divine moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that ever the World was favour'd with by the wiſeſt and moſt learned Jew or Heathen!</p>
               <p>And then as their circumſtances were ſuch that no body could believe them to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Religion they recommended to the World: So it plainly appeared they were not imployed as Tools or Inſtruments by the wiſe, and learned, or great Men of that day; becauſe the Rulers, and the great Men almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally oppoſed, &amp; appeared againſt their deſigns,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:002987_0131_0FE6B05BAE288F10"/>
and did all they could to cruſh, and overcome them. And then it appears as clearly that they were not ſet on work by the Devil, becauſe what they taught was ſo directly contrary to his intereſt, and tended to the overthrow and deſtruction of his kingdom. From all which it follows that they received it from GOD; for if they could not be the Authors themſelves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they it from Men or Devils, who elſe could they receive it from, but GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The</hi> power of GOD <hi>was more clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by the Goſpel's prevailing under their Miniſtry of it, than it would by the Ministry of other Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle tells us, 2 Cor. 4.7. <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi> The more weak the Inſtruments are that GOD makes uſe of for the ſpreading his Goſpel, and for the Converſion of Sinners, the more is the divine Power magnifyed and made known therein. And therefore GOD made uſe of ſuch Men at firſt in ſpreading the Goſpel, to make it evident, that it was not <hi>by the enticing words of Men's wiſdom,</hi> that it was not by the Authority or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Men, but by his own almighty Power, that the Goſpel ſpread and prevailed as it did, by which means the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are excluded from all manner of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or boaſting, becauſe of the ſucceſs of their Miniſtry. And thoſe that experienced, and felt the bleſſed effects of the Goſpel on their Souls,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:002987_0132_0FE6B05E919071D8"/>
are led to ſee, acknowledge, and adore the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power and infinite grace of GOD therein.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Wiſdom of GOD appeared <hi>in the manner of furniſhing, and accompliſhing</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles for the important buſineſs He was ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them about.</p>
               <p>It is the part of a wiſe Man, when he imploys any in his ſervice, to ſee that they be duely qualifyed, and ſufficiently accompliſhed for the ſervice they are to attend. And thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his infinite Wiſdom &amp; Prudence, when he ſent forth his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel, and propagate Chriſtianity in all parts of the World; took effectual care that they ſhould be ſufficiently qualifyed, and fitted out for ſuch weighty and difficult ſervice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did not furniſh them with Silver or Gold or any earthly authority: for theſe things would not contribute to the deſign he was ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out upon, which was to ſet up not an Earthly but a Spiritual Kingdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of thoſe, he endowed them with the holy Ghoſt, in his extraordinary and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts, which at once accompliſhed them for their buſineſs. And they were not permitted to depart from Jeruſalem before they received the promiſe of the Father, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Thus as it was left in charge to them that they ſhould go and teach all Nations, it was neceſſary they ſhould be able to diſcourſe with each in their own language, ſo as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them. Accordingly before ever they
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:002987_0133_0FE6B05EA78BEAA8"/>
departed from Jeruſalem, <hi>there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and ſat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt, &amp; began to ſpeak with other tongues,</hi> even in any language whatſoever. And as there <hi>was of every Nation under Heaven,</hi> at Jeruſalem, (which by the way gives us another inſtance of divine Wiſdom, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe wonderful tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with reſpect to our bleſſed Saviour, ſhould be at ſuch a time, and place, where there was a reſort of all Nations, who ſhould ſee and hear of theſe matters, the wonderful news of which they doubtleſs ſent abroad to their reſpective Nations, which might prepare them for the more ready receiving of the Goſpel when it was ſent unto them:) But as I ſaid, there being of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Jeruſalem, they heard the Apoſtles at once ſpeaking to every one in his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular language: at which they were all ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, knowing that they were <hi>Galileans,</hi> and ſo had never learned theſe language. A parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of which we may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ch. the beginning. So that there appeared to be a miraculous effuſion of the holy Ghoſt; which at once not only qualified them for going into the World and teaching every Nation, Tongue and Language; but it alſo gave great authority to their Miniſtry, and was a witneſs from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for them, that they were going on GOD's Errand, and in a buſineſs that he approved of, and was greatly concerned for.</p>
               <p>But yet the alwiſe GOD knowing it was not ſufficient for the Apoſtles in their grand under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:002987_0134_0FE6B06D15D7F310"/>
to have barely the gift of Tongues: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe altho' they ſhould be able to ſpeak in every man's tongue; yet if they had not the Spirit to guide them, and to dictate to them what they ſhould ſay, it would have been to little purpoſe: This therefore were they endowed with, even the Spirit of truth, or infallibility, to lead and guide them into all truth, as our Saviour had promiſed them <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. They had a Spirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, if not conſtantly and in every action, yet upon all neceſſary occaſions, to direct them what to do, and dictate to them what to ſpeak: and eſpecially when they were about to preach or to write any thing for the uſe, and benefit of the Church, they were under the guidance of that Infallible Spirit. For this is the account that one of them gives us in that matter, 1 Cor. 2.13. <hi>Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then further, GOD knew that the Apoſtles having the Spirit of infallibility would not induce People to believe them, unleſs they were able to give ſome external demonſtration of their being ſent of GOD. Therefore GOD in his great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodneſs, to all the other gifts of the Spirit, added that of working Miracles, inſomuch that the Apoſtles were able to diſpoſſeſs Devils, to heal all manner of diſeaſes, yea and upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to raiſe the Dead; all which Miracles they did in the name of Chriſt, by which they exalted his Name among the People, and gave ſufficient reaſon for them to believe in him. And thus
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:002987_0135_0FE6B06D29673288"/>
were the Apoſtles every way furniſhed for the ſervice they were imployed in: they were able to ſpeak to every man in his own language to deliver to them the infallible Oracles of GOD, without any error or miſtake, and to confirm the ſame by divine ſigns and miracles; which was ſufficient to leave any People without excuſe, that would not believe their report, nor receive the Goſpel which they delivered to them. For ſurely theſe Men ſpoke in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and with power, a power ſufficient to work Conviction in the Minds and Conſciences of men, and not force them contrary to their minds, as the ſecular power, and the power of the Sword too often do.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The</hi> Hardſhips and bitter Sufferings, <hi>that GOD ordered out for the Apoſtles, and firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity,</hi> was a wiſe contrivance for the advancing and eſtabliſhing the Intereſt of Chriſt in the World.</p>
               <p>That they went thro' many difficulties, ſore tryals, and the ſharpeſt perſecutions in the courſe of their Miniſtry, and at laſt ſuffered the moſt cruel deaths in the cauſe, the Acts of the Apoſtles and the Hiſtory of thoſe times do ſufficiently aſſure us of. And now altho' it may at firſt view ſeem ſtrange that GOD ſhould ſuffer his own faithful Servants (thoſe that loved him, and ſerved him with all their Hearts and Souls) to be impriſoned, to be whipp'd, to ſuffer hunger and thirſt, to be buffeted, to be perſecuted, to be reviled, and made the off scouring of all things whilſt they lived, and at laſt to have the moſt
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:002987_0136_0FE6B06E6BFFAC00"/>
cruel, and tormenting death inflicted on them: Yet if we conſider the matter, we ſhall ſee there was a great deal of wiſdom, and prudence in it, and that it was even neceſſary for the firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel to ſuffer, and die as Martyrs, or Witneſſes for the truth they had delivered to others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This was the moſt effectual way that could be, <hi>to convince the World that they really believed, and certainly knew the truth</hi> of thoſe things which they had preached to them.</p>
               <p>Here it muſt be ſaid that it was neceſſary for the Apoſtles to give the ſtrongeſt evidence poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they really believed, yea &amp; that not upon ſlender grounds, but that they certainly knew the truth of thoſe things they taught and urged others to the belief of. They taught the World that Jeſus of Nazareth was the true Meſſiah, that he wrought all thoſe, (&amp; innumerable more) Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that are recorded in the Goſpel, and that after he was put to death by the Jews, he aroſe again from the dead on the third day, and aſcended up into Heaven. Theſe things they declared to be true of their own certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. that they were eye-witneſſes of them. Now theſe appeared ſtrange things to the World, and they were with difficulty perſuaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. It was therefore neceſſary in order to perſuade Men into the belief of them, that thoſe who related them ſhould give all poſſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of their ſincerity, that they believed and knew theſe things to be ſo. And now what more effectual way could be taken for this than
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:002987_0137_0FE6B06E86469140"/>
by ſuffering perſecution even unto death, in their witneſſing to the truth of what they declared? Surely they could have no temptation to purſue in declaring thoſe things, if they knew them to be forgeries, and lyes, or if they were not fully aſſured of the truth of them, ſince they had no proſpect of any temporal advantage; but only poverty, whipping, impriſonment and death: and had as little reaſon to expect any better treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the other world, if they were guilty of lying and falſhood. For according to their own Doctrines and Principles LIARS were to have their portion in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone forever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the perſecutions they underwent for the cauſe of Chriſt, gave the ſtrongeſt demonſtrations of their ſincerity and that they really believed and certainly knew the truth of what they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for. So that altho' it might look like hard and ſevere treatment from GOD to his Children and Servants, yet GOD was very wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ſuffering the Church to be ſo ſeverely perſecuted in the former ages of it; for he knew how to uphold and carry his Servants through ſuch ſufferings, with patience and chearfulneſs, and he knew how to reward them for it by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing a far more exceeding, &amp; eternal weight of glory on them in the other World. And ſurely it was in infinite mercy to the Church to this very day as it affords a moſt powerful argument for the truth of Chriſtianity, by putting that matter beyond all doubt with reſpect to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:002987_0138_0FE6B079097806C8"/>2. Theſe Perſecutions were the means of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mighty Recommendation of <hi>Goſpel-Doctrines and Principles, to the Eſteem and Admiration of Mankind,</hi> who ſaw the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of them in Chriſtian Profeſſors.</p>
               <p>It ſhewed their principles to be Heroick, and Sublime, that could carry Men above the fears of Death, and all the tortures and torments that the wrath and cruelty of Men could invent or inflict. It ſhewed that ſuch Men were endowed with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples uncommon, and extraordinary, that they could ſo couragiouſly embrace the Stake, and with ſuch conſtancy, and ſteadineſs, yea and chearfulneſs of mind, endure the ſcorching flames, and inſtead of being inflamed with wrath and indignation againſt their cruel Perſecutors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were fired with a generous compaſſion towards them, and prayed earneſtly for them: I ſay, ſuch a behaviour of themſelves at ſuch trying times, ſhewed that they were under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of higher, and more noble principles than all the Philoſophy of this World could raiſe men to. And ſurely it muſt needs be a mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their Religion to all the by-ſtanders, to ſee how it would ſupport them under the fears of Death; to ſee what patience &amp; ſubmiſſion, what courage and ſteadineſs of mind, what hope, and confidence, what love and charity even to their Enemies, they would endure the moſt cruel Sufferings withal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then again, theſe Perſecutions ſerved mightily to <hi>keep up the Life and Power of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:002987_0139_0FE6B0791D0CD808"/>The Perſecutions, inſtead of ſuppreſſing the intereſt of Chriſt, made it to thrive and flouriſh more abundantly. The notter the Perſecuti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns were, and the greater the number that became Martyrs, and ſealed the truth with their blood; the more inclined were People to believe the truth of the Religion, and to embrace it. And then the fire of Perſecution ſerved to cleanſe, and purifie the Church, of Hypocrites and falſe Profeſſors: for at ſuch times they would fall away, and ſcarce any but true and real Chriſtians would endure the fiery tryal. Moreover theſe Perſecutions ſerved to brighten all their Graces, and made them more lively, and more eminent, and exemplary Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than otherwiſe they would be; as might be argu'd from the natural tendency of a time of Perſecution, as well as from the more plentiful ſupplies of the holy Spirit, which doubtleſs they had at ſuch a ſeaſon, more than at other times.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Another wiſe and good Method that GOD has taken for the propagating, and perpetuating Chriſtianity, was <hi>the preſerving the Writings of the Apoſtles for the benefit of the Church in all Ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Apoſtles were not ſuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue by reaſon of Death. And now if they had left nothing in Writing for the uſe of the Church, and if there had been nothing but uncertain tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the true Chriſtian Religion might have been loſt out of the World long before this day, and there would have been only ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſparks of it left, and thoſe buried up in the groſſeſt Superſtitions. And therefore GOD in
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:002987_0140_0FE6B07A74B5E580"/>
his great Wiſdom put it into the Hearts of the Apoſtles to commit to Writing theſe Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the New-Teſtament, guiding them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by his Infallible Spirit. Theſe Scriptures, as well as thoſe of the old Teſtament, were <hi>given by inſpirations of God, &amp; are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction or inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. And GOD in his wonderful Providence has preſerved theſe Sacred Writings pure, and entire, without any material addition, or diminution even unto this day; inſomuch that we by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into this perfect Law of liberty, may have as right notions of Chriſtianity as the Apoſtles themſelves: which ſhows what wiſe and prudent care GOD has taken in making proviſion for his Church throughout all the Ages of it. For it is moſt certain that thoſe Writings of the Apoſtles, the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, are under GOD the very ſupport of the Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them it would long before this time have come to nothing.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) <hi>The Ordinances of the Goſpel</hi> are a wiſe contrivance for the preſerving, and upholding the Intereſt of Chriſt in the World.</p>
               <p>GOD deſigned that the Chriſtian diſpenſation ſhould continue to the end of the World. But here lay a difficulty and danger, with reſpect to thoſe Ages that ſhould be at a great diſtance from the time of Chriſts appearing in the fleſh, leſt they ſhould be ready to doubt and disbelieve the facts, and call the whole Religion into queſtion:
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:002987_0141_0FE6B07A8F8E9310"/>
As there are too many ſuch in the World at this day, who call in queſtion all revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But now Chriſt, to prevent our ſinking into Deiſm, and to leave thoſe without excuſe that do ſo, did at the firſt eſtabliſh certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to be continued in his Church, until his ſecond coming. Thus the Night before he ſuffered, inſtituted the <hi>Sacramental Supper,</hi> to be attended in all Ages of his Church, as a ſtanding memorial of his Death, until he comes. And alſo the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which he inſtituted before his Aſcenſion to be as an Initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Ordinance, and to be performed in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. And alſo the Ordinance with reſpect to a <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtry,</hi> to ſucceed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in all Ages of the Church, and with whom Chriſt promiſed his preſence always even unto the end of the World.</p>
               <p>And now, if I had time, I could ſhow that theſe Ordinances having been kept up in the Church to this day, are moſt convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Truth of Chriſtianity, and leave all without Excuſe that wont believe thoſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which theſe Ordinances are, &amp; have been declared all along to be the Monuments and Memorials of; altho' it be for near Seventeen hundred years. And in ſhewing how theſe Ordinances help to confirm the Chriſtian Religion, I ſhould ſet forth the Wiſdom and Prudence there was in appointing them.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:002987_0142_0FE6B07FAFA1F458"/>(6.) <hi>The Prophecies of the Goſpel</hi> were a wiſe contrivance to maintain Chriſtianity in the World.</p>
               <p>As I have obſerved in a foregoing diſcourſe, the Prophecies of the old Teſtament were wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, as they ſerved to point out the Meſſiah, when he ſhould appear, ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the new Teſtament are wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to be of great uſe, &amp; benefit for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of Chriſtianity. Indeed there are ſome of the Prophecies of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hard to be underſtood; they are wiſely hid from us, and I believe will till they are accompliſhed but when they are accompliſhed and underſtood, they will be of vaſt ſervice to the Intereſt of Chriſtianity: for they afford one of the moſt powerful arguments of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scriptures, and ſo for the Truth of Chriſtianity: for when theſe things are accompliſhed exactly as they were foretold ſo many hundred years ago, it will appear that the Perſons who wrote theſe things had the Spirit of GOD with them, as our Saviour had promiſed to his Diſciples, who ſhould as he ſaid, <hi>tell them things to come,</hi> Joh. 16 13. And conſequently that what other things they wrote of at the ſame time, were by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſame Spirit of Truth: for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed that GOD would give his Spirit to foretel future Events, to Perſons that would make no other uſe of it than to make it a means of impoſing lyes and falſe-hoods upon the World</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:002987_0143_0FE6B07FC9516BF8"/>And altho' the Church has not as yet received ſo much benefit by theſe Prophecies, becauſe of the uncertainty with reſpect to the meaning of them; yet they ſeem to be reſerved for pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar uſefulneſs for the Church in the latter Days: when Deiſm &amp; Infidelity ſhall prevail, and the preſent arguments made uſe of for proving the Truth of Chriſtianity be born down by the Corruptions of Men. Then I ſay we may conclude that theſe Prophecies which have been kept as a reſerve, will by their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their being more fully underſtood, be a powerful means of reviving, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the evidences for Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Thus for inſtance, the Converſion of the Jews, ſuppoſed by many Divines to be foretold, both in the old, and new Teſtament, the deſtruction of Antichriſt, the downfal of Babylon; I ſay, the accompliſhment of theſe Prophecies will be of great ſervice to the Church, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count among others, that it will ſtrengthen the faith of Chriſtians, and induce others to the ſame belief &amp; practice, by convincing them that the Scriptures which contain'd this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are the word of GOD, and that <hi>the holy Men</hi> from whom we have them <hi>ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7.) <hi>The Controverſies and Diſputes,</hi> that GOD has permitted in the Chriſtian World, have been wiſely ordered for the eſtabliſhing Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>That there have been grievous Controverſies, and diſputes in the Church of Chriſt even from

the beginning, is abundantly evident from the Hiſtories of it in all Ages. And now altho' thoſe Controverſies ariſing from different apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things, have been unhappy occaſions of a great deal of ſinful Contention, unreaſonable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and dreadful Schiſms and breaches in the Church, yet GOD in his infinite Wiſdom does ſo order it as to bring good out of theſe evils, and makes theſe Controverſies and diſputes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very ſubſervient for the confirming the Truth of it, and keeping up the knowledge of and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it. By the diſputes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies things were more thoroughly ſearched, and examined into; which always proves of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to that ſide which is the Truth. For the more narrowly Truth is ſearched into, the more clearly it appears But then the Ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and the Books that were produced by them, as they demonſtrate to us that Chriſtianity was in being in thoſe days; ſo by their appealing to the Scriptures as the Standard, or Rule of trial, they plainly acknowledged the divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy Scriptures. And now by reading and ſtudying the Ancient Controverſies of the Church, and their frequent references to the Scriptures of the old, and new Teſtament, as now we have them in our Bibles; it appears that the Scriptures that we now have in our hands, were agreed upon by all Parties to be the Word of GOD: which muſt needs afford very great ſatisfaction to us, and help very much to remove the doubts and ſcruples that may ariſe in our minds about the Scriptures, and convince us,

that they are a moſt ſure Word of Prophecy, to which we may do well, and be ſafe, to take heed, as to a light ſhining in a dark place. And this may ſuffice to ſet forth the Wiſdom of GOD, in the Method he has taken for the propogating, and perpetuating the Goſpel diſpenſation. There are ſome other Inſtances of divine Wiſdom in the affair of our Redemption, to be conſidered afterwards. I ſhall conclude at preſent with a brief</p>
               <div type="improvement">
                  <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
                  <p>And here I might from the ſeveral Inſtances of divine Wiſdom in the Method of propogating and eſtabliſhing Chriſtianity, draw ſome uſeful and practical Inferences; but I ſhall mention only two or three, and ſo conclude at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Inf. 1. <hi>We ought not to be prejudiced againſt any perſons meerly for their external poverty and meanneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Apoſtles themſelves were poor, and yet Chriſt ſo far honoured them as to make them the Pillars of his Church, &amp; the grand Inſtruments in ſetting up his Goſpel-Kingdom, and their Names ſhall be handed down with the greateſt honour to the lateſt Poſterity. Miniſters muſt not be deſpiſed, or rejected becauſe of their outward Poverty. Let them be ever ſo mean on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accounts, they muſt be honoured, and reſpected as the Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts, and he that deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth him that ſent them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="unknown:002987_0146_0FE6B09074A48830"/>Inf. 2. <hi>Here is ground of Encouragement, that whatever Service GOD calls us unto, he will furniſh and qualify us for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did ſo when he ſent forth his Apoſtles, he ſufficiently qualifyed them for their Office; and therefore whatever Service GOD ſhall call us unto we have abundant Encouragement to ſeek to him, to depend upon him for all ſupplies of Wiſdom and Grace, that ſhall be neceſſary for us. It is not conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of GOD to call to any Service, and not qualify for it: And therefore if we are but ſure that he calls us to the Service, we may ſafely accept of it in a humble confident dependance upon GOD for his Grace and Spirit that ſhall be ſufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Inf. 3. <hi>Outward Afflictions, altho' ever ſo great, are no certain mark of GOD's diſpleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never any Men endured ſorer Afflictions than the Apoſtles, yet GOD was far from being angry or diſpleaſed at them: for they were in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay of their duty, in the way that pleaſed him; and they were in a peculiar manner hear and dear to Chriſt. We muſt not therefore judge of GOD's love or hatred by the diſpenſations of his Providence. For this we are taught by the Preacher, Eccl. 9.1. <hi>No man knoweth either love, or hatred by all that is before him.</hi> Nay, if any way, we ſhould argue GOD's love from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive diſpenſations of Providence; for ſays the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.</hi>

                     <hi>To Conclude,</hi> Let us adore the Riches of divine Wiſdom in contriving and proſecuting ſuch Methods, for the propogating and preſerving the Intereſt of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the World, even unto this day; and the good foundation there is laid for the continuance of it to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>And let us adore the Riches of Sovereign Grace, that we have the holy Scriptures, the Writings of the Apoſtles among us, and that they are attended with ſo many powerful Arguments to induce our belief of all that is contained in them. And now let ſuch conſider how inexcuſable they will be who continue in Unbelief, and wont be ſatisfyed with the Evidence that GOD in his Wiſdom has ſeen cauſe to afford, and judges ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us. And let ſuch conſider how dreadful their condition will be, when they find things to be as they have been told ſo often from the Word of GOD, when it is too late for them to help themſelves, but muſt be caſt into the place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Hypocrites and Unbelievers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let ſuch be perſwaded now to lay aſide their carnal and unreaſonable prejudices againſt the Doctrines, and Precepts of Chriſtianity, and be no more faithleſs but believing.</p>
                  <p>And now let us who pretend and profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe things, ſee that we live as becomes the belief of them Let us look upon the holy Scriptures as a perfect rule of Faith &amp; Manners; and let us order our Converſation aright, even according to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and then we ſhall thro' Him moſt certainly ſee the Salvation of GOD.</p>

               <p>Under this head I ſhall briefly conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>Nature</hi> of that Redemption, which is wrought out for us, and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD in procuring ſuch a <hi>Redemption</hi> for us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I am to conſider ſomething of the</hi> Nature <hi>of that Redemption, which is wrought out for us, and ſhow wherein it conſists.</hi> And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Redemption wrought out for us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in <hi>the Pardon of our Sins, and Juſtification before GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have it explained in the verſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceeding our Text, <hi>In whom we have Redemption thro' his blood, <hi>the forgiveneſs of Sins:</hi>
                  </hi> intimating to us that Redemption thro' the blood of Chriſt, and forgiveneſs of Sins, are the ſame thing, or that forgiveneſs of Sins is part of that Redemption. So that all ſuch as are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the blood of Chriſt, have their Sins pardoned &amp; blotted out; they are delivered from the curſe of the law, and from thoſe torments and miſeries that are the juſt wages of Sin. Hence ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. And accordingly ſays the ſame Apoſtle,

Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Act. 13.38, 39. <hi>Through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins: and by him all that believe are juſtified</hi> They are accepted as righteous in GOD's ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. This Redemption conſiſts <hi>in ſaving us from the Power of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the primitive Apoſtacy we were brought not only under the guilt of Sin, and ſo made liable to puniſhment, but under the Power &amp; Dominion of it: <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> luſts thereof.</hi> By Nature we are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to Sin and Luſt, and to ſpiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and are carried away Captive at their pleaſure. But now the Redemption that is wrought out for us conſiſts in our being delivered from the power of Sin, and out of the hands of all our ſpiritual Enemies. Hence Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>To
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:002987_0150_0FE6B09D4899B0D0"/>
redeem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That is, from the power as well as guilt of all Iniquity, as appears from the following words, viz. <hi>That he might purify to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Now how could his redeeming them from all Iniquity be an effectual means of purifying them unto himſelf a peculiar People, unleſs he redeemed them from the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin? So in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. They are ſaid, <hi>to be redeemed by the blood of Chriſt from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Converſation:</hi> That is from a ſinful life, which ſuppoſes the power of ſin to be ſubdued in their hearts. And this is the expreſs promiſe to ſuch as have an Intereſt in the redemption of Chriſt <hi>That ſin ſhall not have dominion over them, becauſe they are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. The Redeemed are freed in a great meaſure from thoſe propenſions or inclinations to ſin that are natural to us. They have the evil nature of ſin diſcovered to them, and are filled with ſhame and ſorrow for their paſt ſins, with an hatred and abhorrence of all ſin, and reſolutions againſt it, Yea, and they actually get the maſtery of ſin ſo far as to depart <hi>from their own Iniquity, and to lay aſide the ſin that does the moſt eaſily beſet them.</hi> And then, as for the Devil, that grand adverſary of Souls, and all their ſpiritual enemies, they are reſcued out of their hands; and altho' they are ſometimes ſeduced, and drawn aſide by their ſubtle devices, yet they are not in ſlavery, and ſubjection to them. For Chriſt who is <hi>ſtronger than the</hi> Devil, <hi>the ſtrong man armed, binds him,</hi> and diſpoſſeſſes their Souls of him, and in their
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:002987_0151_0FE6B09D5C146A60"/>
conflicts with their ſpiritual enemies, they <hi>come off conquerors, yea more than conquerors</hi> thro' Chriſt <hi>that has loved them,</hi> Rom. 8.37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Redemption includes the <hi>implanting Principles of Grace and Holineſs in our Souls</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Redemption is not only a negative kind of happineſs, but it conſiſts in ſomething that is poſitive. It contains in it not only the abſence of ſin &amp; corruption, but the preſence of divine Grace. Indeed the abſence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or a freedom from ſin, is the preſence of grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Soul: but yet it affords a diſtinct Idea in our minds: as the abſence of darkneſs is the preſence of light; yet we may form ſome diſtinct Ideas of them. So here, as the Souls of the Redeemed are freed from the guilt, and power of ſin, ſo at the ſame time they are endued with principles of grace and holineſs: As they are brought out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo they are brought into marvellous light; <hi>They who were ſometimes darkneſs, are now made light in the Lord.</hi> Their Underſtandings are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned in the knowledge of the Truth: the eyes of their minds opened to behold <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things out of Gods law.</hi> They are enabled to diſcern ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual manner. Moreover, the will is renewed: there is a holy gracious temper, and diſpoſition of Soul formed within them, whereby they are brought to be in love with GOD and Holineſs, and to take the greateſt delight in his Commandments. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Affections and Paſſions are ſanctifyed and ſet in order, being put under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an inlightned and a ſanctifyed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:002987_0152_0FE6B0A00B650DA0"/>
And ſo indeed this redemption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Sanctification of the whole Man, Spirit, Soul and Body: And that every grace of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit be implanted in the Soul. It intends their being endowed with faith, with love and charity, with humility, patience, ſelf-denyal and every other grace. In ſhort, the Image of GOD is reſtored and reimpreſſed upon their Souls; and they are made <hi>Pure as Chriſt is pure, and holy as he that has called them is holy:</hi> not in degree, <hi>but in kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Our eternal Salvation and Happineſs</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this redemption that is wrought out for us.</p>
               <p>This is not only a temporal but an eternal Redemption. Hence, Chriſt is ſaid to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Eternal Redemption</hi> for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. And he is ſaid to be <hi>the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. Now this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not only an eternal freedom from all ſin and ſorrow, the wages of ſin; but the everlaſting fruition of all good and happineſs. So that all ſuch as are redeemed by Chriſt, are delivered from the power of Death and the Grave, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in the Day of Judgment, and ſhall aſcend with Chriſt to Heaven, and there dwell in his preſence, where is fulneſs of joys, and ſet down at his right hand, were are rivers of pleaſures for evermore; where they partake of ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory, that neither Eye hath ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither has it ſo much as entered into the heart of Man at preſent to conceive of. Which glory &amp; happineſs will very much conſiſt
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:002987_0153_0FE6B0A021DF43C0"/>
in the exalted Services of their Redeemer in giving bleſſing, and honour, glory and power to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I proceed in the next place to ſhow that the working out, and procuring ſuch a Salvation for us, <hi>was an Inſtance of wiſdom and prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As it is a perfect and compleat</hi> Redemption, and ſuch an one as <hi>ſuited the caſe of fallen Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since Chriſt had undertaken the great work of our Redemption, it was requiſite for his own vindication, and honour, to procure ſuch a Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as would be ſuitable for us, and that would be every way ſufficient to anſwer the end; for otherwiſe he would have betray'd his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as not having thorowly conſidered our caſe in our fallen State, and what was needful to reſtore us to a State of happineſs.</p>
               <p>But now Chriſt having wrought out a Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us, which is perfect both as to the nature, and degree of it; having ſaved and delivered us from thoſe very things that we needed to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from, and to ſuch a degree as we ſtood in need of Salvation, ſhowed a great deal of Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Men are ſometimes ready to do another a kindneſs, and to help him out of his preſent diſtreſs; but for want of prudence and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they oftentimes miſs their aim, and what they do to help him, oftentimes proves not only ineffectual, but hurtful and prejudicial to him. But now GOD diſcovers his wiſdom and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in a due conſideration of our fallen cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:002987_0154_0FE6B0ADEA999808"/>
and of all our wants and neceſſities, and in procuring ſuch a Salvation as would relieve us under them all. He wiſely conſidered how we had expoſed our ſelves to miſery, and deſtruction by our Sins; He accordingly took care to find out a ranſom for our Sin, whereby we might be delivered from the curſe of the law, and ſaved from the wrath to come, to which our Sins had expoſed us. Furthermore, He conſidered how we had inſlaved our natures by Sin, and brought our ſelves under bondage to our luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and contracted ſuch a temper, as would incline us to a perpetual blackſliding; and that therefore it would be to no purpoſe to pardon our Sins, unleſs he found out a way at the ſame time to cure us of our ſtrong propenſions and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it, and ſo prevent <hi>our returning again to folly after God had ſpoken peace unto us.</hi> He has therefore in his great wiſdom and goodneſs, at the ſame time that he made way for our being pardoned and juſtified; taken effectual care that we ſhould be renewed and ſanctified, the ſinful diſpoſitions within us ſubdued and mortified, ſo as that we may be not only kept back from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sins, but from the indulgence of any Sin, and then ſerve GOD in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for the time to come.</p>
               <p>So again, as in our original make and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we were capable of enjoying the bleſſed GOD himſelf in the ſweeteſt fellowſhip &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in this World, and in the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt immediate communion with him in the World to come: and conſequently we muſt
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:002987_0155_0FE6B0AE0409C488"/>
be unhappy, unleſs we are reſtored to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable priviledge. This therefore has GOD in his great wiſdom and goodneſs taken care of, that we ſhould be freed not only from hell and deſtruction, and from the reigning power of Sin, but that we ſhould have ſuch impreſſions of grace and holineſs upon our hearts, ſuch a love of GOD and Chriſt, delight in him, and likeneſs to him; as ſhould fit us for communion with him here, and the enjoyment of him hereafter.</p>
               <p>So that in ſhort, Chriſt has ſo fully conſidered our caſe, that the Redemption he has purchaſed is what exactly ſuits our circumſtances: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves all the evils we had involved our ſelves in by Sin; and brings us into as happy, if not a more happy ſtate than if mankind had never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And ſurely ſo bring as much good out of ſo much evil is certainly an inſtance of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wiſdom. But then</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is an Inſtance of Wiſdom, as it is ſuch a Redemption that ſerves very much <hi>to ſet forth the Glory of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As was obſerved in the firſt diſcourſe upon thoſe words, <hi>Wiſdom conſiſts in propoſing the moſt noble Ends, and in purſuing the moſt proper means to accompliſh the ſame.</hi> Now the Glory of GOD is a deſign worthy of GOD himſelf, and the higheſt end he can propoſe, and conſequently every Method GOD takes that is effectual to promote this, is an inſtance of wiſdom in him. Now the Redemption that Chriſt has purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and wrought out for us is of ſuch a nature that it directly tends to advance the Glory of GOD, and that in two ways.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The nature and degree of this Redemption is ſuch that ſeparate from our Unworthineſs of it, and ſeparate from the infinite coſt and pains GOD was at to accompliſh it; I ſay, the nature of it is ſuch, that excluſive of theſe, it diſcovers wonderful goodneſs and kindneſs in GOD. For it is certain that an infinite favour and benefit is beſtowed upon all that are the ſubjects of it. For this Redemption is ſo great, and ſo ſuited to our natures and neceſſities, that it affords a compleat, and perfect happineſs unto us; a happineſs as great as we can deſire, or are capable of enjoying. We had undone our ſelves, we had corrupted, defiled and degraded our natures, and made our ſelves more vile than the Beaſts that periſh, and more miſerable too: for we had loſt the divine Image; had forfeited the divine Favour, and had expoſed ourſelves to the revenging Juſtice of GOD, &amp; ſo to all the torment &amp; miſery that our natures were capable of enduring. Now the Redemption wrought out for us implies a delivering us
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:002987_0157_0FE6B0B08DB304E0"/>
from all theſe evils; and not only ſo, but the putting us into a far more glorious and happy ſtate than we were in, before the fall. Which ſerves to illuſtrate the immenſe goodneſs, and infinite mercy of GOD unto us. What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſplay of divine goodneſs is it to acquit Men from the guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſave them from the puniſhment of Sin? How bright and glorious does the divine pity and compaſſion appear, in freeing Men from the ſlavery and bondage they are in by nature to their luſts &amp; corruptions; in reſcuing them out of the hands of Satan, and tranſlating them out of the kingdom of darkneſs, into the kingdom of GOD? How abundant in goodneſs, and how rich in Mercy does GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be, in delivering us from the pit of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery &amp; deſtruction, from the place that burns with fire &amp; brimſtone, and where is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth for ever; and in opening the gates of Heaven to us and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us an abundant entrance into his everlaſting Kingdom, where is fulneſs of joy and rivers of pleaſure for evermore? Surely to be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the greateſt evils and miſeries, and brought into the poſſeſſion of the greateſt bliſs and happineſs, and that not only for a few years, but throughout the infinite Ages of Eternity, are ſuch inſtances of goodneſs and mercy, as ſerve very much to ſet forth the glory of them: by this means theſe Perfections ſhine gloriouſly, not only in the eyes of the Redeemed, but in the eyes of all the intelligent Creation, who are capable of beholding them.</p>

                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:002987_0158_0FE6B0BE8B75B740"/>2. This Redemption is of ſuch a nature as ſerves very much to magnify <hi>the Power of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Redemption of Sinners, there is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting &amp; turning them <hi>from darkneſs to light; and tranſlating them out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of the Son of GOD.</hi> Which change requires no leſs than Almighty power to accompliſh it. A dark Underſtanding being <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the life of GOD,</hi> is inlightned and made to ſee ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual manner A carnal mind <hi>which is enmity againſt God, and not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> is taken out of them. Their natural ſtubborneſs removed, and of Unwilling they are <hi>made willing in the day of God's power.</hi> Moreover, the Sinner is ſo changed with reſpect to his Affections, that what he loved and took the greateſt delight in, he is made to hate with a perfect hatred: and that which he was altogether averſe to, he is made to take the greateſt pleaſure and delight in. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this is the diſpoſſeſſing and driving out the Devil, the ſtrong man armed who had taken poſſeſſion of our Souls; there is a conquering and over-coming Principalities and Powers, and the rulers of the darkneſs of the world; who do their utmoſt to obſtruct and hinder our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In ſhort, in our Redemption there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or new Birth. Hence we are ſaid, <hi>to be born again,</hi> Joh. 3.3. There is alſo a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to life. Hence, ſuch before their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are ſaid, <hi>To be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins</hi>; and when any are Converted they are ſaid <hi>to be quickned,</hi> or made alive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. Laſtly, there

is a new Creation: hence ſuch are ſaid to be Created in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. All which ſimilitudes ſerve to ſet forth the greatneſs of the work, and what power it requires to accompliſh it: ſo that when this work is done, when a Soul is Converted, there is a glorious diſplay of divine Power. By this it appears that Almighty Power belongeth unto GOD: by his changing the hearts of Sinners He makes it appear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whatſoever he pleaſeth; for we cant eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what work would require a greater power to accompliſh it. And thus GOD makes his great power known on the veſſels of Mercy in their Salvation; as well as on the veſſels of Wrath fitted for deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Redemption is of ſuch a nature as ſerves to ſet forth the glory of <hi>divine Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Redemption wrought out for us had conſiſted only in the pardon of Sin, a Reſtoration to the divine Favour, and a delivery from Hell and Miſery, while the natural propenſions and inclinations to Sin remain'd within; we and all the rational Creation ſhould have been ready to doubt of the infinite Purity and Holineſs of the divine Nature. For how could any have thought that GOD bore ſuch an infinite hatred againſt Sin, if he ſhould have forgiven Sinners, and been reconciled to them, at peace with them, while their love to Sin, and averſion to all that is good and holy remained in them. But now GOD's taking care to free us from the power of Sin, from our love to it, and delight in it, as well as from the guilt and puniſhment of it, is a ſufficient vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:002987_0160_0FE6B0BFF4C85058"/>
of the divine Holineſs. GOD takes care that all ſuch as are <hi>Juſtified freely by his Grace,</hi> are alſo <hi>renewed and ſanctified by his Spirit.</hi> When he cleanſes us from the guilt of Sin, he cleanſes us <hi>from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit</hi>; and is by degrees perfecting us in holineſs: which ſhows how high a regard GOD has for holineſs, and what a hatred and abhorrence he bears to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity.

               <p n="2">2. The nature of our Redemption is ſuch, as tends much to the glory of GOD; <hi>Inaſmuch as it diſpoſes and enables the Redeemed to give Glory to Him in an Active way and manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had GOD only pardoned our Sins, and releaſed us from puniſhment, and if we had after that remained under the power of Sin and Luſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving Glory to GOD for ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Mercy, as the delivering us from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and miſery: we ſhould take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go on yet further in our rebellions againſt him, we ſhould be more daring and preſumptuous, and do more than ever to diſhonour and diſpleaſe that GOD that had forgiven us our former treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes againſt him; and ſo inſtead of adoring and praiſing him for his infinite Mercy and Grace, we ſhould rather inſult him as being <hi>altogether
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:002987_0161_0FE6B0C00EA3D550"/>
ſuch an one as our ſelves.</hi> But now as they that are redeemed from the puniſhment of Sin, are renewed alſo in the ſpirit of their minds, and are transformed into the divine Image, ſo they have ſuch a temper and frame of ſpirit, which diſpoſes them to give unto GOD the Glory due unto his Name, and to ſhew forth his praiſes.</p>
               <p>Moreover,</p>
               <p>The Redemption wrought out for Sinners is of ſuch a nature, That it gives us the brighteſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the excellencies and perfections of the divine Being, and ſo ſerves to fill us with the moſt exalted thoughts, and adoring apprehenſions of him. By this Redemption we have a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing ſenſe of our dependance upon him, and that all we receive comes from him. He that is Redeemed is made ſenſible of his infinite Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to GOD, not only for the outward Mercies that he daily receives; but for his redeeming love and grace that has been manifeſted towards him. And that very temper and diſpoſition of mind which is wrought in him by Redemption, and which is part of his Redemption; fills him with the higheſt love &amp; gratitude to GOD &amp; awakens his Soul, and all within him to bleſs and praiſe his holy Name, and excites gracious purpoſes, and endeavours to bleſs the LORD whilſt he lives, and to give thanks unto him whilſt he has any Being, nay, and not only to ſpeak, but to live GOD's praiſes by being devoted to the Fear and Service of GOD, and imployed for his honour. But then further, this Redemption diſpoſes and enables not only to live a life of praiſe in this
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:002987_0162_0FE6B0C7F471FAC8"/>
world, but to celebrate his praiſes in the world to come. Hence, we find them repreſented, as <hi>falling down before the Lamb, ſinging a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the ſeals of it: for thou waſt ſlain and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue, and people, and nation. Bleſſing and honour, and glory, and power to him that ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever. Salvation to our God which ſitteth on the throne and unto the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 5.9, 13.—7.10. So that if it be for the Glory of GOD to have ſuch Creatures as we, in our moſt perfect ſtate, to be giving praiſe and honour, and glory to him in the moſt exalted manner that our natures are capable of, then the Redemption wrought out for us will be for his Glory; and that ſuch praiſes will be for his Glory, we are aſſured of from the Mouth of GOD himſelf, Pſal. 50. laſt. <hi>Whoſo offereth praiſe, glorified me.</hi> And this may ſuffice to ſhow the Wiſdom of GOD, from the nature and kind of Redemption that is wrought out for us.

                  <p>It would have been Unſpeakable Mercy in GOD, &amp; afforded matter for Thankfulneſs in us, if GOD had offered any degree of Salvation to us; if he had in any meaſure abated the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mitigated the miſery that we had by

Sin brought our ſelves into. But now for GOD to procure a perfect Salvation for us, an entire and an eternal Redemption from all Sin, and from all the evil of it; is a further manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine Grace, which calls for the higheſt Thankfulneſs.

For it is impoſſible from the nature of GOD, and from the tenor of the Covenant of Grace that we are under, for a Man in an Unregenerate, Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted eſtate, to be pardoned and reconciled to GOD. So that all ſuch as look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſtate of Peace &amp; Reconciliation with GOD, and have never experienced a gracious Change in their hearts, do miſerably deceive themſelves, they cry Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace. <hi>For there is,</hi> there can be <hi>no Peace, ſays my God, to the wicked,</hi> Iſai. 57.1.</p>
                  <p>Inf. 3. <hi>How much does it concern us all to have this very Redemption in all its parts applied unto us!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More Men are willing to have this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in part applyed to them; but not in the full extent &amp; latitude of it.

               <p>I have in ſome former diſcourſes, ſhewn how the Wiſdom of GOD was manifeſted in the way and method that was taken for purchaſing and procuring Redemption for us; and ſo bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into a ſtate of Salvation by a Redeemer, I am now to conſider the manner of Applying this Redemption to us which opens another Scene of amazing Wiſdom &amp; Prudence in GOD. It is not only neceſſary that Redemption ſhould
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:002987_0167_0FE6B0DB108998C8"/>
be purchaſed for us: but that it ſhould be alſo Applyed unto us. And now as there was in the purchaſing and procuring; ſo is there in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this Redemption, a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence. Which will appear by a diſtinct conſideration of the ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> of Redemption; ſuch as Juſtification, Regeneration and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eternal Salvation and Happineſs at laſt; and the <hi>Manner</hi> how they are applyed to us, and we made the Partakers of them.</p>
               <p>But before I do this, I would briefly obſerve in general, <hi>by or from whom</hi> we receive this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is the Author of it, and by whom we come to receive it.</p>
               <p>Now all the ſaving benefits of Redemption come <hi>originally from the Father, thro' the Merits &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Son, by the Agency &amp; Operation of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>The Father</hi> is to be conſidered as the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all ſaving Grace and Mercy that is ever conveyed to the Sinner. Free and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace and Mercy is to be conſidered as flowing originally from him. Hence, he is called the Father of Mercies, and the GOD of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſo of all Grace, 2 Cor. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be God even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Mercies, and God of all Comfort.</hi> And he even the Father is ſaid to have <hi>bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places:</hi> As in the 3 d. verſe of the context.</p>
               <p>But then Secondly, Theſe bleſſings are <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and procured by Chriſt the Son of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has purchaſed them for us by his Obedience
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:002987_0168_0FE6B0DE8615A1E8"/>
and Death. Hence we are ſaid to <hi>have Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' his blood, the forgiveneſs of our Sins, according to the riches of his Grace.</hi> In the verſe immediately preceeding the Text. And we are ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified freely by his Grace,</hi> (the Grace of GOD) <hi>thro' the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3.24. And the <hi>Church is ſaid to be purchaſed,</hi> or redeemed <hi>with his blood,</hi> Act. 20.28. But then he actually procures and draws forth theſe bleſſings by his Interceſſion. For ſince his Aſcenſion into Heaven, he appears in the preſence of GOD for us pleading the Merits of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Sufferings, in our behalf. So that whatever Mercy or Grace is beſtowed on us, it is by vertue of his prevailing Interceſſion. Hence he is ſaid to <hi>be able to ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come unto God thro' him, ſeeing he ever lives to make incerceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25.</p>
               <p>But then Thirdly, <hi>Whatever benefits Chriſt has purchaſed or does procure for us, they are applyed or conveyed to us by the hand of the holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt when he was about to leave the World, tells his Diſciples that he would pray the Father, and he would ſend them another comforter, that ſhould abide with them for ever; even the ſpirit of truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. And aſſures them that when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment, 16.8. Now the holy Ghoſt being ſent into the world, is the prime Miniſter, or Agent in Chriſt's Kingdom to carry on his work among Men; and to apply to them the benefits that Chriſt has purchaſed for them. HE it is that works all true and ſaving
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:002987_0169_0FE6B0DE9CE771D0"/>
Grace in the Soul. Hence he is called <hi>the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29. He it is alſo that applies all true comfort, and the joy of GOD's Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence, he is called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> Joh. 16.7. He it is that <hi>Helps our Infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. And the <hi>Love of God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5.5. And every Vertue and Grace is ſaid to be the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. That is, the effect of the Spirit, <hi>what is</hi> wrought in us by the Spirit of GOD.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee that all the Perſons in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity had a hand in carrying on the grand affair of our Redemption; which is ſuch an inſtance of Wiſdom as helps very much to confirm the doctrine before us: for as the Three that bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven are equal in power and glory; ſo it is a wiſe contrivance to have each of them ſo concerned in every affair that brings any glory to GOD, as that they ſhould be equal Partners in the glory; and now as there is great glory accruing to GOD by the wonderful work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo each Perſon in the God-head by having a hand in the work will have a ſhare in the glory. By this means there is glory to the Father, to the Son, and to the holy Ghoſt. The glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of each Perſon are magnified &amp; honoured hereby; and Angels and Saints give glory to them. Hereby they are moved to give glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> GOD the Father as the Father of Lights, and the Fountain of all Grace &amp; Mercy; from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift deſcends. And to ſay as in the afore-mentioned, Eph. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed

Bleſſing and honour and glory, and power be to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.</hi> Hereby they will be moved alſo to give glory to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit for working divine &amp; heavenly Grace within them, acknowledging it to be by the grace of GOD, and the almighty influences of the holy Spirit, that <hi>they are what they are.</hi> Acknowledging that their New-Birth, by which they are fitted to enter into the Kingdom of GOD, has been by the holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly conſidered by whom this Redemption is beſtowed on us. I proceed now to that which I more eſpecially intended to inſiſt upon, <hi>viz.</hi> The conſideration of the ſeveral parts of Redemption, and the manner of their being applyed to us, and ſo as I go along, take notice of the divine Wiſdom and Prudence that diſcovers it ſelf therein.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall divide or diſtinguiſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of a Sinner into theſe general parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Redemption, Regeneration and Sanctification, and his future Glorification or Happineſs in Heaven; and ſhall conſider the manner how each of theſe are applyed to the Sinner, and how the Wiſdom of GOD abounds herein. Here then,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="166" facs="unknown:002987_0171_0FE6B0E75DA003D0"/>1. <hi>In the</hi> JUSTIFICATION <hi>of a Sinner,</hi> there appears a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>The Juſtification of a Sinner is his being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and forgiven; his being acquitted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, his being accepted as Righteous in the Sight of GOD; his being reſtored to the divine favour, and intitled to eternal Life and Happineſs: all which is upon the account of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imputed to us, and received by Faith.</p>
               <p>Now the Wiſdom of GOD in applying this part of Redemption to a Sinner, appears in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the cauſe, matter and foundation of the Sinners Juſtification, <hi>which is the Righteouſneſs of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the qualifications required, and made neceſſary in order to our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>cauſe and foundation</hi> upon which GOD ever Juſtifies a Sinner; which is the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed to them,</hi> diſcovers a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>For the Illuſtration of this head, I ſhall ſay heſe things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. With the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Juſtification of a Sinner is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>this</hi> Righteouſneſs being <hi>Imputed</hi> to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Imputation</hi> of this Righteouſneſs for the Juſtification of a Sinner, there appears a great deal of <hi>Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With the Lord Jeſus Chriſt there is a</hi> perfect <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:002987_0172_0FE6B0EBD6BD5D88"/>Indeed there is a twofold Righteouſneſs with Chriſt. If we conſider him as GOD, He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Righteous and Holy: for <hi>there can be no Unrighteouſneſs with GOD. He is a Righteous LORD</hi>: and <hi>an Holy GOD, a GOD of Truth and without Iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi> But then if we conſider him as GOD-Man Mediator, and there is a perfect Righteouſneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith him. And this is the Righteouſneſs that is here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for it is by vertue of this Mediatorial Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that a Sinner is ever Juſtified. And that there was a perfect Righteouſneſs with Chriſt as Mediator, appears, in that he was perfectly freed from the taint of Original Sin, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a miraculous manner, by the over-ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the holy Ghoſt. Hence he is called, <hi>that holy thing,</hi> Luk 1.35. And in that, He did, as he ſaid, <hi>it became him to fulfill all Righteouſneſs</hi> in the courſe of his Life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. As he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from Sin, ſo there was a conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of heart and life to the mind and will of GOD: And not only ſo, but he alſo ſuffered the penalty due to us for ſin; and thereby made full ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice; and ſo he is ſaid, <hi>To bring in an everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan 9.24. Which perfect everlaſting Righteouſneſs is brought in by his active &amp; paſſive Obedience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience.</p>
               <p>Chriſt having undertaken the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, He undertook to ſatisfie for our ſins, to ſuffer the penalty due to us for ſin: and death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the penalty threatned, in caſe of Sin &amp; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, <hi>He became obedient unto death even

the death of the croſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle tell us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. And He as it was Propheſied of Him, Iſai. 53 8, 12. <hi>Was cut off out of the land of the living, and poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi> After he had been wounded and bruiſed, and endured the moſt cruel ſufferings in his body, &amp; inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Agonies in his Soul. Inſomuch that altho' theſe ſufferings were but temporary, and of but ſhort continuance, yet conſidering the dignity of the Perſon, and how infinitely near and dear he was to GOD, and conſidering alſo the nature of his Sufferings; and they are equivalent to our Suffering an eternal death (as has been ſhown at large in one of the foregoing diſcourſes) and ſo wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a full Satisfaction for ſin. The debt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted was hereby paid to the utmoſt farthing: and ſo GOD conſiſtent with his Juſtice, could be reconciled to the repenting and believing Sinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is by the <hi>active Obedience</hi> of Chriſt, that there is ſuch a perfect Righteouſneſs wrought out for us.</p>
               <p>In order to Chriſts having a perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was neceſſary that there ſhould be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conformity to the Precepts of the law, as well as an enduring the penalties of it: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this his ſufferings muſt have been upon his own account; for his own Sin as the high Prieſts of old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. Could not be Meritorious for us. Or if we ſhould ſuppoſe any Merit in his Sufferings, whereby the Sinner might have been ſaved from eternal death and deſtruction, yet there would not have been wherewith to have purchaſed eternal life &amp; happineſs: and ſo all the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:002987_0174_0FE6B0F6F248B610"/>
Salvation procured by the meer ſuffering the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the law, would have been only negative. And therefore choſe to make himſelf a compleat Saviour, and to purchaſe a poſitive as well as a negative happineſs, to bring us to Heaven, as well as deliver us from Hell, has performed a perfect Obedience to the whole law of GOD. Hence it is ſaid of him, 1 Pet. 2.22. <hi>That he did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> And that he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled ſeparate from Sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. And hence he himſelf could ſay to his Father, as in Joh. 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, and finiſhed the work which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me to do.</hi> And hence the Father could give this Teſtimony of him once and again from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as in Math. 3.17.17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Which could not be ſaid in an abſolute ſenſe, if he had not <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſs,</hi> and always done <hi>thoſe things that pleaſe the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The Juſtification of a Sinner is by the</hi> Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>of this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, when a Sinner is pardoned &amp; acquitted from the condemning Sentence of the divine Law, reſtored to the divine Favour, and intitled to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life; it is upon the account of the Merits of Chriſts Obedience and death accepted for him. Chriſt undertook the Office of a Mediator between GOD &amp; us, and became a ſurety for us. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, all that he did and ſuffered was upon our account, in our room and ſtead, and GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it upon the account of all thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and obey his Goſpel. GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:002987_0175_0FE6B0F70A208780"/>
of it on their account ſo far, as to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them, and to treat them with as much kindneſs and reſpect, and to beſtow as great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and bleſſings upon them, as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had perſonally ſuffered the penalties of the law, and ſatisfied the demands of Juſtice, and had alſo yielded a perfect Obedience to the law. And now when GOD treats a perſon after this manner, he may be ſaid to juſtify him: and his doing it upon the account of what Chriſt has done and ſuffered in our ſtead, is the Imputation of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto us. For GOD, by juſtifying a Sinner upon the account of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, does ſo far impute the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to the Sinner, that to all intents and purpoſes it is his Righteouſneſs. That is, he receives as much benefit by it, as if it had been his own perſonal Righteouſneſs. GOD is as much at Peace with him and as propitious to him, as if he had wrought out a Righteouſneſs himſelf, becauſe of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous of Chriſt: and this is what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the Imputation of it.</p>
               <p>And now that this is the way of a Sinners Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is evident from the word of GOD, where the Doctrine of a Sinners Juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt is taught, and no where elſe. And there we are taught, That what Chriſt did and ſuffered was upon our account. Thus it was Propheſied of him, That <hi>he ſhould be wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and bruiſed for our Iniquities. That he ſhould make his ſoul an offering for ſin, and bear the ſins of many,</hi> Iſai. 53 5, 10.12. Accordingly, ſince his coming into the World, he is ſaid to <hi>have
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:002987_0176_0FE6B0FA78421598"/>
born our ſins, in his own body on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. Hence alſo he is ſaid <hi>to be a Propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2. That is, he has made Attonement for our ſins, and the Attonement is accepted by GOD on the account of Believers; and becauſe the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſo made over to them, as that they receive the benefit of it. He has this ſtile and title given him, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. Furthermore, There is a Parallel run, between the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>: and that as the ſin of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> is imputed to all his Poſterity for their Condemnation; ſo the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is imputed to all that believe in him for their Juſtification. Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one,</hi> that is of Chriſt, <hi>ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there is a Parallel run between this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our ſin to him, and of his righteouſneſs to us. 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> So that as GOD, when Chriſt had undertaken to be our Surety, laid upon him our iniquities, and imputed our ſins ſo to him, as that he look'd to him for ſatisfaction; ſo Chriſt having made full ſatisfaction and brought in an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, <hi>that</hi> is made over to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinner for his Righteouſneſs. And hence this is the language of ſuch an one, Iſai. 45.24. <hi>In the Lord, i. e.</hi> in the Lord Meſſiah, <hi>I have both righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> And hence alſo we are counſelled by Chriſt to come to him for this
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:002987_0177_0FE6B0FA923BF030"/>
Righteouſneſs as a cloathing and covering, to cover our nakedneſs, and to skreen us from the wrath of GOD, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. I counſel thee to buy of me gold tryed in the fire that thou mayſt be rich, that is Grace, <hi>and white raiment,</hi> (which is underſtood of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt) <hi>that thou mayſt be cloathed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs may not appear.</hi> And hence alſo the Apoſtle prays, Phil. 3.9. <hi>That he may be found in Chriſt not having his own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is thro' the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Imputation of this Righteouſneſs for the Juſtification of a Sinner, there is a great deal of <hi>Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Inaſmuch as GOD has pitched upon the <hi>only ſuitable and ſufficient</hi> Righteouſneſs, that could be Imputed to us for our Juſtification.</p>
               <p>It is certainly a point of Wiſdom, to make choice of, and pitch upon what may be ſuitable and ſufficient to anſwer the End propoſed. Now the End propoſed was the Juſtification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of another unto him. And now what Righteouſneſs ſo proper, ſo ſuitable, and that could anſwer the End ſo effectually as the Mediatorial Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt? As for the Infinite Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of GOD, and which is Eſſential to the divine Nature, it is Incommunicable, and ſo can't be Imputed to any Creature for its Juſtification. So that notwithſtanding any thing that could be done as to the transferring of that Infinite Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to us, we muſt have periſhed for ever.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:002987_0178_0FE6B10769030DD0"/>
Nay, this Eſſential Juſtice of the divine Nature would have inclined and obliged GOD to puniſh us for ever.</p>
               <p>And then as for any Righteouſneſs of our own, <hi>That</hi> would by no means have anſwered for our Juſtification before GOD: for as the Prophet ſays, Iſai. 64.6. <hi>All our Righteouſneſs are as filthy Rags.</hi> Our Righteouſneſs is altogether imperfect, attended with innumerable Infirmities and Sins: and if we ſhould ſuppoſe that we were able now to perform a perfect Obedience; yet that would by no means be ſufficient to juſtify us, becauſe it could not ſatisfie for our former Violations of GOD's Law. And then again, if we conſider the Righteouſneſs of the holy Angels, and we ſhall find the incapacity and inſufficiency of it to ſatisfie for our offences, if it was imputed to us. For altho' the Righteouſneſs of the Angels is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in its kind, and is ſufficient for themſelves; yet there can't be the leaſt Merit in it: all their Righteouſneſs is no more than they owe to GOD their Maker and Preſerver, and therefore it could not in the leaſt meaſure ſatisfy for our guilt. But now as for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt wrought out by his active and paſſive Obedience, it was infinitely Meritorious, becauſe his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſufferings were what he did not owe to GOD for himſelf: And now this was the only Righteouſneſs that could be Imputed to us, that could be of any ſervice, or that could anſwer the End for our Juſtification. And therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom &amp; Prudence appears in fixing upon this Righteouſneſs, to be imputed to the Sinner for his Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="174" facs="unknown:002987_0179_0FE6B10781799BF8"/>2. There is Wiſdom, inaſmuch as GOD by <hi>the ſame act, magnifies his Justice, and his Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD has contrived the Juſification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in ſuch a manner, that he makes both his Juſtice, and his Mercy to appear very glorious in it. It is certain that the Juſtification of a Sinner is an act of free and ſovereign Grace; and GOD does in ſuch in act ſhow himſelf to be abundant in Mercy and rich in Grace. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how could GOD ſhow himſelf more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Gracious than in pardoning the ſins and rebellions of his Creatures, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der infinite obligations to obey and ſerve him, and in receiving them into ſpecial favour, and intitling them to eternal Life and Happineſs, who contrary to all their obligations in point of duty, gratitude, or intereſt, have riſen up againſt him, and done all they could to diſhonour and provoke him? But then at the ſame time, and by the ſame act that he diſplays his ſovereign Grace, he alſo makes very glorious manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his infinite and inflexible Juſtice: and that becauſe he receives full ſatisfaction for every ſin he pardons. When GOD forgives our debts, yet he ſhows that he is very juſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in that he won't do it till the debt be paid by our Surety to the utmoſt farthing. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' eternal Life to which Believers are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, is the free <hi>gift of God</hi>; yet it is an act of Juſtice, becauſe it is fairly purchaſed for them by Chriſt; even by his moſt perfect, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Obedience. So that when GOD is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering boundleſs riches of Grace to us in our
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:002987_0180_0FE6B108F60FC090"/>
Pardon and Juſtification: he ſhows that he is infinitely Juſt to himſelf, and won't in the leaſt abate of his right, nor give up any thing that is his due: That altho' he is willing to ſave us, yet that he is as careful not to wrong or injure himſelf.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not inſiſt upon ſetting forth the Wiſdom of GOD in this matter; becauſe I have prevented my ſelf by what has been ſaid under ſome of the foregoing Inſtances of divine Wiſdom: as particularly, that of GOD's inſiſting <hi>upon a ſatisfaction for ſin, before he would pardon the ſinner</hi>: And that, <hi>of Appointing his own Son to be the Mediator,</hi> who was able, and who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly has made full Satisfaction for ſin. Neither ſhall I at preſent, proceed to conſider the Qualifications GOD requires &amp; beſtows in order to our Juſtification, and the Wiſdom of GOD therein: but leaving the Conſideration hereof to the afternoon; I ſhall conclude, at preſent with ſome <hi>Improvement</hi> of what has been ſaid. And here,</p>
               <p>Inf. 1. From what we have heard in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this diſcourſe, we learn, <hi>How careful we ſhould be to acknowledge and adore each Perſon of the ever-bleſſed Trinity, in the Affair of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For each Perſon is concerned in carrying on this grand Affair, and therefore they ought all to be ſuitably acknowledged and adored by us. This is part of the glory that was propoſed by them, in having a hand in this ſtupendous work;
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:002987_0181_0FE6B1090F54BA78"/>
even to receive the acknowledgments and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Redeemed: (as we have already hinted) Surely then we ought to give to each Perſon the glory due unto his Name upon the account hereof. GOD has taken care that they ſhould be acknowledged and adored by us, in commanding every one to be Baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Matth. 28.19. And by the form of ſolemn Benediction left us by the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 13.14. <hi>The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all.</hi> We ſhould therefore conſider them in their ſeveral ways of working, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them in ſuch acts of worſhip and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is ſuitable to them. Thus we muſt direct our Prayers, our Praiſes, and all acts of religious Worſhip, to the Father, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, by the help of the Holy Spirit: believing that no duty can find acceptance with GOD, but thro' the Merits &amp; Mediation of the Son; and that no Duty can be performed, ſo as any way to be accepted, but what is done by the help of the Holy Spirit. For this we are taught, not only that our <hi>Spiritual Sacrifices are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. But <hi>that the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26.</p>
               <p>Inf. 2. Has Chriſt wrought out a perfect Righteouſneſs for us? <hi>Hence the ſafety of all thoſe that depend upon it, and are found cloathed with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay thoſe that depend upon it for their Juſtification, and are cloathed with it; becauſe
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:002987_0182_0FE6B112728BDD78"/>
they always go together. He that ſincerely and heartily depends upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for Juſtification, will be clothed with it: for this Righteouſneſs is received by faith. And ſeeing it is ſuch a perfect Righteouſneſs, ſuch muſt needs be in a very ſafe condition that are intereſted in it: What need ſuch be afraid, that have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to cloth and cover them?

Surely the Merits of his blood are ſufficient to make Atonement for the greateſt Sins, and ſecure the chiefeſt Sinner from all Condemnation. And it is certain, that his Obedience was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and his Mediatorial Holineſs ſo ſpotleſs; that if it be but imputed to the vileſt Sinner, he can't but be accepted of GOD, and intitled to eternal Life. So that there is abſolute perfect ſafety to all them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, that are found clothed with his Righteouſneſs. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect?

               </p>
               <p>For if the Juſtification of a Sinner be only by the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; then ſuch as have not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt made over to them, are not Juſtified, but are yet in their Sins; the guilt of Sin, and ſo the wrath of GOD abideth on them, and they are every Moment in danger of dropping into the burning Lake: for they have nothing to ſecure, or ſave them from it. As for any Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of their own, it is all but as filthy Rags; it can't hide their ſhame nor cover their Nakedneſs: it can't recommend them to the favour of GOD, nor intitle them to any bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So that notwithſtanding all their own Righteouſneſs, they are wretched, and miſerable, and poor and blind, and naked: they muſt anſwer for themſelves, and ſo muſt bear the puniſhment of their own Iniquity, in the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, where is weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth for ever.</p>

               <p>IN the foregoing Diſcourſe, I undertook to ſhow the Wiſdom of GOD, <hi>in the Juſtification of a Sinner.</hi> And this I propoſed to do by conſidering firſt, <hi>The matter, cauſe &amp; foundation of a Sinners
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:002987_0187_0FE6B12218825290"/>
Juſtification, namely, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt Imputed to him, and the Wiſdom of GOD herein</hi>: which was the ſubject of the forenoon-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And now for a further proof of the point before us, I propoſe in the next place to conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What GOD requires of us, and beſtows on us to qualify us for Pardon and Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and the divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence, that appears therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is Imputed to us for our Juſtification; and is the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of it: yet there are ſome things requiſite to qualify, prepare and enable us to receive this Righteouſneſs. It is not Imputed to every Man, nor is any one pardoned &amp; ſaved, before he is by divine Grace prepared, and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly qualifyed for the pardoning Mercy of GOD. And now thoſe things that are required to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie us for pardon and forgiveneſs, are ſuch as diſcover a great deal of Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Here therefore I ſhall briefly mention the requiſite qualifications for Juſtification, and take notice of the propriety &amp; ſuitableneſs of them, and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD in inſiſting upon theſe things, in order to our Juſtification; and they are in general, Repentance towards GOD, and Faith in our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Unfeigned Repentance is required of us, in order to our Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for true Repentance, I don't know a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcription of it, than what our Catechiſm affords us; which is, <q>That it is a ſaving Grace
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:002987_0188_0FE6B1238421E068"/>
whereby a Sinner out of a true ſenſe of his Sin, and apprehension of the Mercy of GOD in Chriſt, doth with grief and hatred of his Sin, turn from it unto GOD, with full purpoſe of, and endeavours after New Obedience.</q> True Repentance intends that we have a ſight, and ſenſe of the evil of Sin in general, and of our own ſinfulneſs and vileneſs in particular. It contains in it a lively, and an awakening ſenſe of the infinite diſhonour that we have done to GOD by our Sin, and of the Deſtruction and Miſery which we have brought upon our ſelves thereby. But yet this does not ſuppoſe that we apprehend our caſe to be deſperate &amp; remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but on the contrary, it ſuppoſes that we have a ſenſe of the infinite Mercy of GOD in CHRIST, and that <hi>there is forgiveneſs with him that he may be feared, and plenteous redemption.</hi> And the apprehenſion of this, inſtead of embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sinner in his ſinful courſes, helps to fill the penitent with grief and ſhame, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his Sins, with an utter hatred and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of all Sins, with an holy indignation againſt himſelf for having ſo often committed that abominable thing, which is ſo hateful and offenſive to GOD: and which has ſo defiled and degraded himſelf, and made him more vile than the Beaſts that periſh. Yet this is not all that is contained in a true Repentance: it carries a Sinner further than <hi>this</hi>; even to full purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and reſolutions, by divine Grace, againſt all Sin whatſoever. This is the language of a true Penitent, <hi>Wherein I have done Iniquity, I will do
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:002987_0189_0FE6B1239880A8C8"/>
no more.</hi> And then finally, <hi>It</hi> intends our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and earneſt endeavours againſt Sin, even againſt thoſe Sins that do the more eaſily beſet us, and that have the moſt frequently overcome us. And then altho' this may not come into the Idea of Repentance according to the ſtrict Notion of it; yet it is the natural, neceſſary &amp; conſtant effect of it; namely, an actual forſak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng of our Sins, a Reformation of our Lives, and a turning our feet into the paths of GOD's Commandments.</p>
               <p>And now that ſuch a Repentance as this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and inſiſted upon in order to our bring pardoned, and accepted as righteous in the ſight of GOD, is very evident from the whole current of Scripture; wherein pardon, and forgiveneſs of our Sins, is never propoſed to us, but upon the ſuppoſition that we are truly humble, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for them. This we find to be the tenor of the old Teſtament diſpenſation. <hi>Whoſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13 <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way &amp; the Unrighteous men his thoughts, &amp; let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſai 55.7. By which we ſee that altho' GOD is ready to pardon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims his Name the Lord, the Lord GOD, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſin: yet the Sinner in order to be forgiven, muſt confeſs and forſake his ſins, muſt be truly humble &amp; penitent for them. And then further, as this was inſiſted upon under the legal, ſo is it as much under the evangelical diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:002987_0190_0FE6B12E1A2F79D8"/>
for there it appears as plainly that without Repentance there is no Remiſſion of ſins. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was the Doctrine which <hi>John</hi> the fore-runner of CHRIST, and who was to prepare the way for him, taught by his Preaching, and by his manner of Living: which may be conſidered as an allegory, and ſerves to teach us, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the fore-runner of Remiſſion of ſin; and that it prepares the way for CHRIST to beſtow a pardon upon us. But then this was the Doctrine that CHRIST himſelf began his publick Preaching with. <hi>Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 4.17. And he ſays. <hi>It behoved him</hi>; or it was neceſſary, <hi>That Repentance &amp; Remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name,</hi> Luk. 24.47. Obſerve the order, <hi>Repentance &amp; Remeſſion of ſins.</hi> Firſt <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and then Remiſſion of Sins; Repentance in order to Remiſſion. And this we find to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles method, for when <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon had prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many to the heart, &amp; they cryed out, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do</hi>? he tells them <hi>to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and be Baptized in the Name of Jeſus Christ, for the Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Act. 2.38. Plainly teaching that Repentance was neceſſary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. So in chap. 3. v. 19. <hi>Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> By all which it appears that GOD requires and inſiſts upon Repentance in order to our ſins being blotted out And now the Wiſdom and the Prudence of GOD diſcovers it ſelf herein.</p>
               <p>Inaſmuch as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Altho' GOD forgives the Tranſgreſſor of his Law, yet he maintains the honour of his Law by this means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:002987_0191_0FE6B12E2E048868"/>If GOD ſhould pardon a Sinner that remains Impenitent, it would be a diſhonour to Himſelf, and a diſparagement to his Law: for what could be thought in ſuch a caſe but that GOD had given too rigid, and ſevere a law to us, and had impoſed an unreaſonable Service on us in the Injunctions of his Word, and conſequently that the law was not ſo holy, nor the Commandment ſo holy, juſt and good as it is declared to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. which GOD being ſenſible of, forgave them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked their tranſgreſſion of his law, without any penitent acknowledgement of a fault in them, and as if he himſelf was rather in an error than they.</p>
               <p>But now by GOD's inſiſting upon deep humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and thorow Repentance for all our Sins, in order to their being pardoned and forgiven; there is a demonſtrative teſtimony given to the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtice and goodneſs of his Commandments: for every true Penitent acknowledges all this. When a Man unfeignedly repents of his Sins, he implicitly, if not expreſsly, acknowledges the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the goodneſs of theſe Commands, that he has lived in the tranſgreſſion of. For unleſs a Man has a ſuitable ſenſe of this he can't have a ſenſe of the evil of Sin, and ſo can't be thorowly humbled for his own Sin. And now as every true Penitent does acknowledge the goodneſs of the divine Law, and his own indiſpenſable Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it; ſo hereby the honour of the law is maintained, even altho' the Sinner be forgiven, infinitely beyond what it would be, if an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinner ſhould obtain a pardon. Now there can't be the leaſt reflection upon the divine
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:002987_0192_0FE6B12F5C4BCA28"/>
Law in GOD's pardoning the tranſgreſſions of it, for beſides the full ſatisfaction that is made for Sin; the Sinner himſelf magnifies the law of GOD, and makes it honourable, by honouring it in his heart, and retracting every thing that he has ſaid or done, that ſhowed any contempt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In this Method the glory of divine Holineſs will not be at all Eclipſed, altho' he receives the Sinner into favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If GOD ſhould receive impenitent Sinners into favour; if he ſhould embrace them in his boſom, and make them the ſpecial objects of delight, and complacence, what would all the World of rational Beings have ſaid upon it, but that GOD was become altogether ſuch an one as our ſelves? Surely it would have raiſed a univerſal doubting in the breaſts of Angels &amp; Men, whether he was <hi>ſo glorious in Holineſs,</hi> and whether he <hi>was of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity.</hi> But now, by refuſing to pardon a Sinner, or to receive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour, before he be truly humbled for his ſin, or before his heart is broken for his ſin, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from all ſin, he ſhows that he bears the ſame hatred to ſin as ever, and is not in the leaſt reconciled to it. Surely every one will look upon GOD as glorious in holineſs, that obſerves the hatred and diſpleaſure he diſcovers againſt all obſtinate and impenitent Sinners, and his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to abandon them for ever; and how he ſhews favour to none but ſuch as have by a deep and thorow Repentance returned unto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In this Method Men are better prepared and diſpoſed to give GOD the glory of his Mercy, Pinardoning and Saving them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:002987_0193_0FE6B12F71C04460"/>If impenitent Sinners (while they continue ſuch) were pardoned, inſtead of being thankful to GOD for manifeſting ſuch infinite Grace to them: they would only take the opportunity to abuſe his Goodneſs, and turn his Grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſs, by going on preſumptuouſly in their ſins, and rebellions againſt him. But now a Man that is firſt brought to Repentance, and then to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he will be filled with adoring thankfulneſs to GOD for ſuch an infinite Mercy: for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul will be ſenſible what a dreadful condition he was in without a Pardon, and how utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy he was of one, and what an act of free, ſovereign Grace it is in GOD to forgive him, and ſave him from the wrath that is to come, and to receive him into favour. I ſay, the true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will have ſuch a ſenſe of theſe things as will inlarge his Soul in the utmoſt thankfulneſs to GOD, when he ſhall thus have Mercy on him. This will put ſuch a Man upon Calling on his Soul, and upon rouzing up all the powers within him, as the Pſalmiſt did, Pſal. 103. <hi>begin. Bleſs the Lord O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy Name; who forgiveth all thine iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. Thus perſons being brought to true Repentance, are prepared and diſpoſed upon their receiving a pardon, to extol and bleſs the Name of the Lord, and to give him the glory of his Grace: which ſhows the Wiſdom of GOD in taking ſuch an effectual way to bring Glory to Himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By this means there is not that danger of a Pardoned Sinners returning to his Sinful Courſes, and ſo walking unworthy of his Pardoned Staff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:002987_0194_0FE6B1353586CDF8"/>If a Sinner ſhould have his Sin pardoned, whilſt his love to ſin remained, and before he has a change wrought in his heart; his pardon would ſerve only to encourage him the more freely purſue his ſinful Inclinations: for the thoughts that he could ſo eaſily obtain a pardon, would remove thoſe fears of puniſhment which in times paſt has been a reſtraint upon him, and he would purſue his ſinful Courſes with more greedineſs than ever. But now GOD, by taking care that Men ſhould be brought to Repentance before they are pardoned, and releaſed from puniſhment, has effectually prevented this. For a Sinner being brought to ſuch a fight &amp; ſenſe of Sin as really to hate and abhor it; there will not be that danger of his returning again to it; altho' his paſt offences ſhould be pardoned and paſſed by. Indeed every Man even the very beſt would relapſe, and return to their ſinful courſes; if GOD did not reſtrain and uphold them by his Grace. But there being an habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hatred of Sin wrought in the true penitent; it will always abide with him: and his being acquitted and ſaved from the puniſhment of his Sin, wont at all abate his hatred of it, nor his care leaſt he again fall into it. Nay the thoughts that he has received ſuch an infinite Mercy from GOD as the pardon of his Sins, will make him more careful, &amp; more fearful than ever of abuſing the riches of divine Grace that have been magnifyed towards him, by returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto ſin and folly. And now by theſe, and many other things that might be mentioned,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:002987_0195_0FE6B1354E116120"/>
we ſee the Wiſdom of GOD in bringing Sinners into a Penitent, before he brings them into a Pardoned State. And now I proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Another thing that GOD requires in order to our being Justifyed, is Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and herein alſo there appears a great deal of Wiſdom.</hi>

               <p>That Faith is abſolutely neceſſary in order to our Juſtification and Salvation, is plainly taught us in that Goſpel, wherein alone the Doctrine of a Sinners Juſtification, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it is revealed unto us; therein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us. That <hi>whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life: and that he that believeth on the ſon hath everlaſting life; and he that believeth not the ſon ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3.16, 36. Agreable to this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Jaylor, when he put the Queſtion ſo earneſtly to him, What he ſhould do to be ſaved, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 16.23. Accordingly, we are expreſsly ſaid to be juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ied by Faith: Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by faith, we have peace with God, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> And we are ſaid to be ſaved by Grace <hi>thro' Faith,</hi> Eph. 2.8. And then the Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is imputed to us for our Juſtification, is ſaid to be by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 9. That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is of the law; but that <hi>which is thro' the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:002987_0196_0FE6B1390B149410"/>
of God by faith</hi>: (<hi>i e.</hi>) the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt received by faith in him. Now the faith ſpoken of in theſe places, and which GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us in order to our Juſtification is in general this; Namely, <hi>A receiving of Chriſt as our only Saviour, and a depending entirely upon him for Salvation in the way of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this contains and implies many things in it: for, as many things are requiſite to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Chriſt a compleat, and an alſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; ſo he that receives him as his Saviour, and reſts upon him alone for Salvation, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to believe all thoſe qualifications to be in him, and to accept of him in every Office which is neceſſary for him to ſuſtain and execute, in order to his accompliſhing Salvation for us.</p>
               <p>Here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As it was neceſſary that Chriſt in order to his being a Compleat Saviour, ſhould ſuſtain &amp; execute the Prophetical Office: ſo Faith in Chriſt intends our receiving him as the great Prophet ſent from GOD unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was neceſſary that he who undertook our Salvation ſhould be fully acquainted with the Mind &amp; Will of GOD, and the way to life and happineſs. He muſt know what is good, and what the Lord our God requires of us; that ſo he might be able to teach and inſtruct us, in thoſe things neceſſary to be known and believed by us, in order to our Salvation: And this is the proper office and buſineſs of a Prophet; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Chriſt being eminently qualifyed for, did actually ſuſtain the Character, and Execute
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:002987_0197_0FE6B13920D21D68"/>
the Office of a Prophet. For this was foretold of him that he ſhould be a Prophet: Deut. 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet, from the midſt of thee, of thy Brethren like unto me, unto him ſhall ye hearken.</hi> Now this Prophet was CHRIST, as appears by the Apoſtles (who were under the direction of the infallible Spirit) applying the Prophecy of <hi>Moſes</hi> to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. Accordingly he executes this Office. He did ſo in his publick Miniſtry, and in the whole reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that he made of GOD, of Himſelf, and of the way to life by him, and in thoſe gifts of the holy Ghoſt wherewith he endowed the Apoſtles, to accompliſh them for teaching all Nations, as he had commanded them. Moreover, this Office is now Executed in the ſtanding revelation which he affords us in the Goſpel, in the gifts of teaching which he affords unto his Miniſters; and more eſpecially in the ſecret, but moſt effectual teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and illuminations, which he affords to the Souls of Men, in their Regeneration and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby they come to underſtand, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual manner. Now then that faith in Chriſt which is neceſſary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur Juſtification, intends our receiving him as ſuch a Prophet: It intends, that we believe as we are told. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. That Chriſt <hi>was in the boſome of the Father</hi>; was fully acquainted with him, and his Mind and Will, and made the fulleſt, and the trueſt declaration of him. It intends, that we look upon all that he has taught as true &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſayings, as the infallible Oracles of GOD. We muſt believe all the Doctrines of the Goſpel,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:002987_0198_0FE6B148AB44D7E0"/>
even the moſt ſublime and myſterious of them, becauſe Chriſt who is full of Truth, as well as Grace, has revealed them unto us. We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Precepts, that the Rules of living which he has taught us, are exactly agreable to the will of GOD, and the direct way to pleaſe him, and to be happy in him. Moreover, we muſt believe the Promiſes, and the Threatnings and that they will be intirely accompliſhed and executed, as the Scriptures declare. But then, if we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt in his Prophetical Office, we muſt depend upon him, for thoſe inward teachings, and thoſe ſpiritual Illuminations that we ſtand in need of. We muſt depend upon him not only to give us an External Knowledge of divine Truths, but for a Spiritual diſcerning of them: Now faith in Chriſt intends that we thus receive him as a Prophet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As it was neceſſary that Christ ſhould Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and Manage the Priestly Office in order to his being a Compleat Saviour to us; ſo that Faith in Chriſt by which we are Juſtifyed, is a receiving Him as our great High-Priest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to Chriſt's becoming a Saviour to us; it was neceſſary that he ſhould offer up a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to GOD, to make Atonement for our Sins; and then to plead the Merits of that Sacrifice on our behalf, that ſo we might be intitled to the benefits and bleſſings purchaſed thereby, and this is properly the Prieſtly Office. And this we find the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to have been in the faithful Execution of; for he has offered a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to GOD, which muſt needs be ſufficient to
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:002987_0199_0FE6B26CD0B74818"/>
make Atonement for Sin, for it is nothing leſs than Himſelf; hence he is ſpoken of, as <hi>making his Soul an offering for ſin,</hi> Iſai. 53.10. And is expreſsly ſaid to have <hi>Appeared once in the end of the world to put away ſin, by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26. Furthermore, he is ſaid, <hi>To have entred into Heaven, and there to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. <hi>And that he ever ſhould to make Interceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. And he is called <hi>a Prieſt, a great high Prieſt, a Merciful, a Faithful high Prieſt, a Prieſt for ever after the order Melchiſedeck,</hi> Heb. 4.14.2.17.—7.21. And now he that receives the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by faith, receives him in this Office; he believes that he has made ſuch a Sacrifice of himſelf, as fully to ſatisfie divine Juſtice, and make way for GOD to be reconciled to us, and at Peace with us; and accordingly that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions at the right hand of his Father are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly, the true believer has his whole dependence upon the Merits of his Sacrifice; and upon the prevalency of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, he depends upon being pardoned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of GOD, but it is all by vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Interceſſion of Chriſt. When he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders of his Sin, and the Curſes of the Law that are denounced againſt the Sinner: he fetches all his comfort from this, that he has an <hi>Advocate with the Fathers, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, who is a Propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only; but for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There were ſo many difficulties &amp; oppoſitions in the way of our Salvation, that nothing leſs than Almighty Power could be able to obtain a Compleat Redemption for us; and therefore it was abſolutely neceſſary that the Saviour of the World ſhould be endowed with ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and unlimited Power &amp; Authority. It was neceſſary that he ſhould be the Sovereign of the World, and that univerſal nature ſhould be under his Empire and Government; that ſo he might be a ſtrong Redeemer, and one able and mighty to Save. And now thus it was with Chriſt; for as he himſelf declares; <hi>All power was given to him in heaven, and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. agreable to which the Apoſtle declares, that GOD had <hi>ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and given him to be head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.21, 22. And as it was neceſſary that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Providence ſhould be committed to him; ſo it was neceſſary that he ſhould exerciſe a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar dominion and authority over his Church which he had purchased with his blood; to give Laws, Statutes and Ordinances to them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and defend them from all their Enemies, and to preſerve them by his mighty power thro'

               <p>And now to believe in Chriſt, to receive him by faith, is to receive him as our Prince, our Sovereign as well as Saviour. It is to believe, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that all power belongs unto him, and he can do what ſoever he pleaſes, it is to believe that he has a Sovereign right, and authority over us: and that we owe all poſſible Obedience &amp; Subjection to him. Accordingly it intends, that we put our ſelves over into his hands, to be ruled &amp; governed, as well as to be protected and upheld by him. It intends, that we depend upon him to exert his almighty Power, and ſovereign Authority in our behalf, in ſubduing our Luſts and Corruptions for us; in reſtraining, and over-coming all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies, and in making us a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the day of his power. It is a depending upon him for Grace, and ſpiritual Strength, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that without him we can do nothing: and on the other hand, that we can do all things thro' Chriſt ſtrengthning us. Furthermore, it is an actual giving up our ſelves to Chriſt as our LORD, and our GOD, to be ruled, governed, and diſpoſed of by him, with ſincere and fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to receive, and obſerve whatever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us; according to the meaſure of Grace he he ſhall diſpence unto us, and we muſt according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be waiting upon him in all the ways that he has directed and appointed, for all the ſupplies of Grace, that we may ſtand in need of.</p>

                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:002987_0202_0FE6B14A0F1845E8"/>And now thus to receive Chriſt as a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King, as has been deſcribed, is to believe in Chriſt; and is that faith which is Antecedent in Nature, if not in Time, to our Juſtification. And it is in ſhort, a looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt as every way fitted &amp; qualified for a Saviour, and as the only one that is ſo: and a committing the whole affair of our Salvation to him; renouncing all truſt, or dependence on our ſelves, or any but Chriſt; believing that he, and he only is able to ſave to the uttermoſt. This is a believing all that he has taught us; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the merits of what he has done and ſuffered for us, and upon his Grace that ſhall be ſufficient for us: in a word, it is a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves upon him as the only hope of Iſrael, and ſaviour thereof, depending on him for righteouſneſs and ſtrength, for pardon, and grace here, and glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>And now, GOD in requiring ſuch a faith as this in order to our Juſtification, manifeſts a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is the moſt Effectual way to prevent all glorying and boaſting in our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more unreaſonable in its ſelf, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing does ſo diſhonour GOD, or deny him the glory due unto his Name, as a ſelf glorying and a ſelf boaſting ſpirit: and there is nothing that would maintain and keep ſuch a temper within us ſo much, as for us to be juſtifyed and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the divine Favour, while we remained in Unbelief. An Unbeliever, one that dont place all his dependance upon Chriſt; if he ſhould be

pardoned and ſaved, would aſcribe it all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if by his own ſtrength and skill he had procured Salvation for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would have an higher opinion and eſteem of himſelf, but not of Chriſt. But now faith for ever excludes all gloryi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> from thinking any better of himſelf; but of GOD and Chriſt, for his being brought into a pardoned and juſtifyed State. Faith helps a Man to ſee himſelf to be nothing, it gives him to ſee that he has not, and could not do any thing towards his reconciliation with GOD, or reſtoration to the divine Favour. Yea, it gives him to ſee that the very faith by which he is juſtifyed, is not of himſelf, but is the gift of GOD, and ſo it takes away all foundation for boaſting; becauſe it tells us that all we have, we've received; and ſo enables us to argue with Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another, and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doeſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> Thus does faith ſerve to keep the heart of Man hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even at the receiving the greateſt favours and bleſſings, by poſſeſſing our minds that they are freely given to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This faith required in order to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prepares and diſpoſes us to give the glory thereof to Chriſt which is the glory due to his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by our depending upon Chriſt for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we acknowledge that all our Salvation muſt come from him; and ſo when we receive it we ſhall give the glory of all to him. Faith
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:002987_0204_0FE6B156A5DB5478"/>
tells, and poſſeſſes the mind of the pardoned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctifyed Man, that it is all freely given him of GOD, and that it is all the fruit of free, rich and ſovereign Grace. This is the language of Faith, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am. By grace ye are ſaved thro' faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he ſaved us. And ſo not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be the glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now this is Wiſdom in GOD, becauſe as he deſigns his own glory in the Juſtification and Salvation of a Sinner; ſo what more effectual way to diſpoſe them to it than by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing their hearts with faith, whereby they ſee, and ſo muſt needs acknowledge to his glory, all Mercy and Grace coming from him, without the leaſt merit, or worthineſs of their own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Faith fits and diſpoſes a Man to walk worthy of ſuch an Infinite Mercy, as that of a pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man endowed with ſuch a principle of Grace, as is ſuppoſed in Juſtifying faith; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of abuſing the infinite Grace &amp; Mercy of GOD in the free remiſſion of his Sins; he will be filled with the moſt admiring &amp; adoring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it. He will have his heart influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced with love to GOD, and filled with the moſt earneſt deſires, and diligent endeavors to be living to GOD, and to the praiſe &amp; glory of his Name. This principle will make him ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious what he ſhall render to the LORD for all his benefits; This will perſwade him from a
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:002987_0205_0FE6B156B940F798"/>
ſenſe of the Infinite Mercies of GOD, to preſent himſelf a living Sacrifice to him. This will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence him, from the conſideration that he is not his own, being bought with a price, to glorify GOD in his Body, and in his Spirit, which are his; by which he will not only ſpeak, but live GOD's Praiſes, and in a practical manner give him the glory of his Mercy: which he would not, if there was not a principle of faith Implanted in the Soul in order to his Juſtification: which ſerves to ſhew the Wiſdom of GOD in requiring this of us. And ſo this may ſuffice to ſhew the Wiſdom of GOD in the terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or pre-requiſite qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inſiſted upon, in order to our Juſtification.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Improvement</hi> I ſhall make of what has been ſaid upon this head, ſhall be only in a word, to Exhort all <hi>to the exerciſe of Repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD who has the ſole power of diſpenſing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, will never beſtow one, but upon the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and believing Sinner. Without Repentance there is no remiſſion of Sins, and he that believes not ſhall be damned. Therefore, as ever we would be in a pardoned State, (and Oh how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the Man that is in ſuch a caſe!) We muſt ſtrive after a penitent, and believing heart. Let us by ſerious thought &amp; meditation be poſſeſſing our ſelves with ſuitable apprehenſions of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Evil there is in Sin; that we might mourn over out own Sins, and repent of them. But eſpecially let us pray to GOD that he would ſend his Spirit to convince us of our Sins, and to ſet them ſo in order before us as that we might abhor
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:002987_0206_0FE6B1582D255B98"/>
our ſelves, and repent in duſt and aſhes. And ſince Faith is not of our ſelves, but the gift of GOD, let us apply our ſelves to him in all the ways that he has directed, for the precious faith of his Elect, whereby we may receive the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as he is offered to us in the Goſpel, and reſt upon him alone for Salvation. And when we have attained to this, we ſhall be prepared for the pardoning Mercy of GOD. Then GOD <hi>will have mercy on us, and according to the multitude of his tender mercies, will blot out our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Then we ſhall be <hi>Justifyed freely by his grace, thro' the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now among ſerious &amp; thoughtful Perſons, that are greatly concerned about their future ſtate: Such a Queſtion as this will naturally ariſe within them: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How ſhall we know when we are in ſuch a penitent, believing State, as will intitle us to the pardoning Mercy of GOD?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Now the beſt, and the only certain way of knowing this, is, by the fruits and effects of ſuch a principle of faith, and penitence in the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The tree is known by its fruit.</hi> If there be ſuch a Repentance as is real, and ſuch a Faith as is of the operation of GOD, they will have ſuch effects upon us, as will diſcover themſelves to be true and genuine. Here I may ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the Repentance be ſincere, and ſuch as fits for the pardoning Mercy of GOD; it will produce a univerſal Reformation of our Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is heartily ſorry for, and really hates his ſins, will moſt certainly forſake them. And
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:002987_0207_0FE6B1584640A1B8"/>
therefore he that lives in the willful allowance of any known ſins, has never truly repented of them. And let not that Man think that he has received the pardoning Mercy of GOD: for verily he is ſtill in the Gall of bitterneſs, and bonds of iniquity.</p>
               <p>And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That faith which will Juſtify us before GOD, will always have theſe effects</hi>: viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It will always purifie the Heart.</hi> Act. 15.9.</p>
               <p>Juſtifying Faith refines and ſpiritualizes the Mind, and delivers it from thoſe dark and groſs Ideas, that a carnal mind labours under. There will be more juſt and true Notions of GOD, and Chriſt, and ſpiritual things, there will be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſcerning of them beyond what is ever experienced by an Unbeliever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It always works by love.</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
               <p>It gives us ſuch realizing apprehenſions of the Infinite love of GOD in Chriſt, as will influence our hearts in love unto him who has expreſſed ſuch infinite love to us. It will fill us with holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him, and the greateſt delight in him, and in all thoſe ways wherein we may have Communion with him. Moreover it will excite a ſincere &amp; fervent Charity towards our fellow-Creatures, enabling us to love our Neighbour as our ſelves, and to expreſs it in all acts of Juſtice, and Charity that we are capable of, and have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for.</p>

               <p>THE Inſtance of Divine Wiſdom under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is, <hi>the Application of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by Chriſt, and the manner of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And under this head,</p>
               <p>I propoſed a diſtinct handling the ſeveral parts of our Redemption; ſuch as our Juſtification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the progreſs of it in Sanctification, and our future Glorification: and at the ſame time to conſider the manner of the Application of theſe things unto us, and the Wiſdom of GOD that appear therein. I have conſidered the firſt of theſe already, <hi>viz.</hi> the manner of a Sinners
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:002987_0209_0FE6B1630D233090"/>
Juſtification; and how GOD has in that affair abounded towards us in Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to conſider another part of that Redemption that Chriſt has wrought out for us, and the Wiſdom of GOD that appears in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it. So then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Regeneration, or Converſion of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the progreſs of it in Sanctification, there appears Infinite Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Regeneration, or Converſion of a Sinner is his having a thorow Change wrought in his heart. It is his being brought out of a State of Nature, into a State of Grace. It conſiſts in the ſubduing our Luſts and Corruptions; and in Implanting gracious and holy principles in the Soul: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the habits of ſin, and the natural averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from that which is good, and in inclining our hearts to GOD, and to every thing that is holy, juſt and good. In ſhort, it is <hi>the Creating a clean heart, and renewing a right ſpirit within us. It is a quickning us who are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins</hi>: breathing a Spiritual Life into the Soul. It is an <hi>Opening mens eyes, turning them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Sanctification, it is the progreſs of this gracious Change wrought in us at our Converſion; it is our growth in Grace, a going from one degree of it to another, and our abounding more &amp; more in the fruits of Righteouſneſs. And now that there is a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing it ſelf in this affair, will abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The work it ſelf, even that of Converting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, working divine Grace in the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="205" facs="unknown:002987_0210_0FE6B167DD536688"/>2. <hi>The Manner &amp; Method GOD takes in the Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The outward Means made uſe of in this Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If we conſider the Work of Regeneration or Converſion it ſelf, we ſhall ſee a great deal of the Wiſdom of GOD therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For (as I have already obſerved) the higheſt, and laſt End GOD can propoſe, is his own glory; and conſequently the purſuing thoſe things that will effectually promote this, is to act wiſely, and with the Prudence that becomes him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the work of Converſion be ſuch a work as tends to the glory of GOD, it muſt be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an inſtance of Wiſdom in GOD to perform it, and ſurely if any of the works of GOD ſerve to declare his glory, this, of the Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will: for it ſerves to the glory of GOD on two accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it prepares, diſpoſes, and enables a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Creatures in an active manner to give glory to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it ſerves to diſplay and magnifie ſeveral of the divine Perfections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Converſion of Sinners is for the glory of GOD, as it prepares, diſpoſes and enables a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Creatures in an active way and manner to give glory to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is with every one that is Converted, and brought into a ſtate of Grace. Before their Converſion they (in the greatneſs of their folly) go a ſtray from GOD; and by their ſin and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience do greatly diſhonour him, and offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite affronts to him; but when once there is a
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:002987_0211_0FE6B167F22B1420"/>
gracious Change wrought in their hearts (as there is in Regeneration) they are at once diſpoſed, and enabled to give unto the LORD the glory due unto his Name. When once the heart of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is changed, he ſees ſo much of the greatneſs, and the glory of GOD, eſpecially in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, that fills him with the higheſt love, eſteem and admiration of him. The Soul Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted is inlarged in thankfulneſs to GOD, and is for ſhewing forth the praiſes of him who has called him out of darkneſs into this marvellous light. He is for glorifying GOD in his body, and in his ſpirit which are his: he is diſpoſed to bleſs the LORD whilſt he lives, and to give thanks unto him whilſt he has any Being. True Grace in the heart diſpoſes a Man not only to praiſe GOD on Earth; but qualifies to joyn the heavenly Hoſt in ſinging Praiſes and Hallelujahs to GOD, and the Lamb for ever in Heaven. As we have them repreſented in the viſions of <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 5.9. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The work of Converſion ſerves to illustrate ſeveral of the divine Perfections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is a work that ſerves very much to ſet forth the Power of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The glory of divine Power appears in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the difficulty of the work that he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes. The further any work is beyond our Power, or beyond the reach of any Creature, the more gloriouſly does the mighty Power of GOD ſhine forth in the accompliſhment of it. And now what work is greater, or more beyond the Power of any Creature among all the great, and
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:002987_0212_0FE6B174A2AE8E28"/>
marvellous works of GOD, than this of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Changing the hearts of Sinners? The Creating us at firſt was a great and wonderful work of GOD, and ſerved very much to diſplay his <hi>Eternal Power and God-head</hi>: But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting us, and Creating us a-New in Chriſt Jeſus unto holineſs, &amp; good works, ſeems to be as great (if not a greater) Manifeſtation of divine Power. For in the firſt Creation there was nothing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or reſiſt GOD in it; but in our Converſion, or the New Creation, there is a great deal of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or Reſiſtance from the World, the Devil, and our own Corrupt hearts.</p>
               <p>The Devil ever ſince he ſeduced our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, has taken poſſeſſion of our Souls for himſelf. He is that <hi>Spirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. He does all he can to oppoſe and hinder the work of Grace upon our Souls; he exerts all his power, and the utmoſt skill and policy, to keep us in ſlavery &amp; ſubjection to him, and our own luſt; he endeavours to raiſe within us all poſſible prejudices againſt GOD, and all that is good: and there are Legions of theſe curſed Fiends that combine together to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Converſion, that unite their Power and Subtility to keep us in Slavery to our luſts, and to hinder the Strivings of GOD's Spirit accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the outward Means of Grace from taking effect upon us. Therefore GOD in Converting a Sinner, makes his great Power known: for in that work he triumphs, yea, and enables the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who was in Slavery and Subjection to them now, to triumph <hi>over Principalities and Powers,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:002987_0213_0FE6B174B70AA708"/>
and the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world.</hi> In Converſion GOD ſhows Himſelf to be Stronger than the Devil, <hi>That ſtrong man armed,</hi> becauſe he overcomes him, diſpoſſeſs our Souls of him, <hi>takes from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and divideth his ſpoils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, There is a glorious Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine Power in inlightning the dark Minds, and in removing the natural Oppoſition that prevails in the hearts of Men ſince the fall againſt GOD and holineſs. Was it an illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine Power, to open the eyes of the blind, eſpecially ſuch as were born blind? How much greater Power muſt needs he exerciſed in inlightning a dark Soul? In opening the eyes of our Underſtandings; <hi>which were darkned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being alienated from the life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of our hearts?</hi> What Power is there put forth in breaking &amp; diſſolving our hard &amp; ſtony hearts? in ſubduing our ſtubborn &amp; rebellious wills? Verily when GOD does thus of unwilling make us willing, it muſt needs be in the day of his mighty Power: for it is beyond the Power of any meer Creature to accompliſh. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when ever ſuch a Change is wrought, GOD makes his great Power known, and ſhows what the Pſalmiſt <hi>heard once, yea twice, that Power belongeth unto him,</hi> Pſal. 62.11.</p>
               <p>And here, I cannot but obſerve how proper and ſuitable, and ſo how very Wiſe &amp; Prudent it is in GOD to manifeſt his Power in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in particular: for if GOD had never put
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:002987_0214_0FE6B176136FEFD8"/>
forth a power ſufficient for the Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, there would have been danger of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections being caſt upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was not able to reduce his rebellious Creatures that had revolted from him, to their duty &amp; allegiance. GOD never did Convert any of the fallen Angels, but ſuffers them to go on in their rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And if he had never Converted any of the Children of Men, but had only puniſhed them for their Sin, he would not have ſhown that power and dominion over the hearts of Men, which now he has: for how would it have appeared that GOD has the hearts of all in his own hands, and can turn them as the rivers of Water are turned, unleſs he had paſſed ſuch a change upon ſome of them, as there is wrought, in their Converſion, even an entire change of the temper &amp; diſpoſition of the heart? If all the World had remained in their Sin, would it not have been ſaid, that when once we had revolted from GOD, and gone over to the Devils ſide, GOD could not reduce us, and bring us back into his Service? Whereas now by making ſome of theſe rebellious ones even ſome of the vileſt and moſt obſtinate of them, a willing and obedient People in the day of his power, he Convinces all the World, that he could have reduced all his rebellious Creatures (even the Devils themſelves) to their Loyalty and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection if he pleaſed; for in the Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners he exerts a power over them, as well as over the hearts of Men, and therefore altho' GOD ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Devils with the greateſt part of Mankind to go on in their rebellions againſt him, it appears
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:002987_0215_0FE6B17628FAE3F8"/>
that it is not becauſe he could not, but becauſe he would not recover them to his Service, but chuſes rather to get glory to himſelf by them in another way, even by making them the everlaſting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his vindictive Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This work of Converſion ſerves greatly to ſet forth the riches of divine Goodneſs and Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is an act of power, ſo it is an act of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Grace, to Convert a Sinner. It is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy to the Sinner to have ſuch a change wrought in him, &amp; ſo infinite Goodneſs &amp; Kindneſs in GOD to do it. We brought our ſelves into this wretched ſtate of ignorance, blindneſs &amp; darkneſs, we caſt our ſelves out of the kingdom &amp; ſervice of GOD, and made our ſelves ſlaves and vaſſals to the Devil, and to our own Luſts. And now what a wonderful manifeſtation is it of glorious Grace in GOD, to call us out of darkneſs into marvellous light, out of the kingdom of Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of the Son of GOD: to bring us out of an infinitely worſe than Aegyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and ſlavery into the glorious liberties of the Sons of GOD. And now conſidering that we brought our ſelves into ſuch unhappy circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and how unworthy we were of GOD's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in our behalf; and further, if we conſider that it is no real <hi>profit to the Almighty if we are righteous, nor gain to him if we make our ways perfect</hi>; I ſay, conſidering theſe things, we cannot but ſee the riches of divine Grace ſhining forth very gloriouſly in our Converſion. And now as the Almighty Power, Infinite Goodneſs &amp; Grace of GOD are glorifyed, in a Sinners being Converted and brought home to Him; ſo it muſt needs be
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:002987_0216_0FE6B17F1E8DCAE8"/>
ooked upon as an inſtance of Wiſdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in GOD, to beſtow this Grace on ſome of the Children of Men. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Order, Method and Manner of GOD's proceeding in the Converſion of Sinners, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of the Wiſdom of GOD in the work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under this head I ſhall conſider, (1) The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der GOD obſerves in working this Change. (2) The Secret, Myſterious and Unſearchable way of the Spirit's working this Regenerating Change in the Soul. (3) The variety of Perſons on whom GOD beſtows converting Grace. And under theſe heads I ſhall obſerve the Wiſdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of GOD therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If we conſider the Order and Method GOD obſerves in working this Change in the heart, we ſhall ſee the Wiſdom of GOD therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, GOD when he works a gracious Change in the Soul, begins with the higher and nobler Faculties, and ſo proceeds to the inferiour powers of it. To go upon the common diſtinction of the faculties of the Soul, into the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will and Affections; it has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by Divines, Whether this Regenerating work begins upon the Will, or the Underſtanding? but the difference between them is not very great in the concluſion; for all will allow this in the acts of a Regenerate Soul, after the charge wrought, the Underſtanding is the leading and governing faculty, and the Will follows the dictates of it. And ſo without entring into the diſpute (which I have not time for at preſent) I will ſuppoſe that GOD begins the work in the Underſtanding inlightning that in the firſt place; removing the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:002987_0217_0FE6B17F32A8D770"/>
darkneſs &amp; blindneſs which our Souls thro' Sin and Luſt are covered with. Since the Fall the Underſtanding is darkned, <hi>being alienated from the Life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in them:</hi> and hence the natural Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Man in the State of Nature, <hi>knows not the things of the Spirit of God; but they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> The natural Man ſees nothing in GOD, or Chriſt, or in Religion that is excellent and deſireable; by which means he deſpiſes, and neglects them, and follows after lying Vanities. Now GOD in the Work of Converſion begins with enlightning the Underſtanding, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conviction to it. The firſt ſtep GOD takes ſeems to be to open Mens eyes, and give them to ſee the evil of Sin, and the wondrous things out of GOD's Law. To ſee our need of Chriſt, his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſufficiency for us, and his infinite readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive us upon our coming unto him. I ſay, this is the firſt ſtep GOD takes in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Sinner, to give him a clear, and convincing Sight of theſe things, a lively Apprehenſion and full Perſwaſion of them in his own Mind, beyond what he ever had before, and beyond what any Man in his natural Eſtate attains unto: and now the Underſtanding being enlightned, the Will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is renewed; and ſo is perſwaded and inclined to follow the Dictates of the inlightned Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But now when I ſpeak of this as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtep that GOD takes in our Converſion, I dont ſuppoſe any diſtance of time in this work of GOD upon the Soul from the other, but that the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:002987_0218_0FE6B18317401278"/>
Will and the Underſtanding are both wrought upon together, the one is before the other in order of Nature only, not in time. For it is by the clear light, and ſtrong Conviction brought to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that the Will is moved &amp; perſwaded to comply with its Dictates.</p>
               <p>And now GOD's proceeding with us in ſuch a way, is Wiſdom in GOD: And that for this eaſy reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe this is a dealing with us agreably to our Natures, as Rational Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very Wiſe and Prudent for GOD, in all his workings with, and upon his Creatures, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the particular Natures he has given to them, and to deal with them accordingly. And thus he deals with us in the work of our Converſion; for having given rational and intellective powers to us, powers of Underſtanding, &amp; Apprehending, and then of Willing &amp; Chooſing according to the dictates of the Underſtanding; he accordingly when he Converts a Man, begins with the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>that</hi> being the leading and governing faculty, and makes uſe of <hi>this</hi> to incline &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Will; and ſo the Man makes a rational Choice, and is perſwaded from rational conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If GOD ſhould ſo work upon the Will in the firſt place, as to incline and diſpoſe a Man, to hate Sin, to make choice of GOD, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ways of Religion, before he had rectifyed and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Underſtanding, and ſo given him to ſee the evil of Sin, and the excellency of Religion, he would not have dealt with us according to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Nature that he has given us; and ſo our
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:002987_0219_0FE6B1832BB70A40"/>
Converſion to GOD would not have been a proper rational act. The proper rule and method for a rational Being is to follow the dictates of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and to chuſe and refuſe as his reaſon ſhall inform and direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im. And therefore GOD i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his great Wiſdom takes care not to break in upon this order of Nature, even in that great and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural work of our Converſion. He will have us Convinced of the evil of Sin in order to our repenting of and forſaking it. He will have us ſee the beauty of Holineſs, the excellency of Religion, in order to our making choice of it, and complying with its Precepts. He will have us ſee the fulneſs and ſufficiency there is in Chriſt, and the need we ſtand in of him in order to our receiving him. And now in this method, our Converſion, inſtead of breaking in upon, or offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any force to our faculties, is an improving, a rectifying and ſtrengthning them. For our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or turning to GOD is only the regular act and exerciſe of our rational Powers put into ſuch a motion by the ſupernatural Grace of GOD; and ſo every regenerate act in us is only acting according to our reaſon under the higheſt and beſt Improvement, and not the leaſt inverſion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>If we conſider the ſecret, myſterious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible was of the Spirit's working this Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Change within the Soul, we ſhall ſee ſomething of the Wiſdom of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That our Regeneration, or Converſion is wrought by the Spirit of GOD is ſufficiently taught us in
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:002987_0220_0FE6B191940945C0"/>
the Scriptures, which declare this to be the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al work of the Spirit of GOD; for therein we find not only the ſeveral parts of Converſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly aſcribed to the Spirit; but the whole work in general. Thus our Saviour ſpeaks of our being Regenerated or <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> as neceſſary in order to our entring into the kingdom of GOD, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. And it is called, <hi>the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. But now the Spirit of GOD works this Saving Change in a moſt ſecret, myſterious and unperceptible manner; as our Saviour tells us, Joh. 3.8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou bearest the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> The way of the Spirit is unſearchable, we cannot find out the manner of it's operations upon us in the work of Converſion. Indeed the effects of it are plain, and very diſcernible, but not the manner of its operation. The Spirit of GOD works with and upon our Spirits in ſuch a manner that we can't perceive any thing but the working of our own Minds, in the change that is wrought in them. The Spirit works ſo ſecretly that we can perceive nothing in us but the free Exerciſe of our own rational powers. It is <hi>we our ſelves</hi> that apprehend the evil of Sin, and the beauty of Chriſt, and the excellency of Religion: it is <hi>we our ſelves</hi> that are ſorry for Sins, and reſolute againſt them; <hi>we our ſelves</hi> reſolve upon a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious courſe of life; and <hi>we our ſelves</hi> take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ways of GOD: but now theſe good thoughts, and motions in our hearts how much ſo

ever they ſeem to be our own, are the workings of the Spirit of GOD. And now here alſo is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for as the Preacher tells us, Prov. 25.2. <hi>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.</hi> It is ſurely for the honour of GOD ſo to conceal the manner of his operations, as not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by his Creatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. It is for the glory of GOD to have his works ſo great and marvellous as to be beyond the reach of any Created Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to comprehend them; becauſe this will lead us the more to admire, and adore him. For the more wonderful and unſearchable the works of GOD are, the more readily will He attract the eſteem admiration &amp; adoration of his Creatures. And now for GOD by the ſecret motions of his Spirit to work every good diſpoſition within us in ſuch a manner that it can't be diſtinguiſhed from our ſelves; it ſhows how unſearchable the ways of GOD are, and what an intimate Knowledge He has of, and what free acceſs He has to, and what power He has over our Spirits: which ſhould lead us to fear and reverence Him, whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is unſearchable, and his ways paſt finding out: yea, and to acknowledge Him in every good diſpoſition found in us, and in every good work performed by us; how much ſo ever it appears to be of our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If we conſider the variety of Perſons on whom GOD beſtows Converting Grace, we ſhall ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the divine Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certain that GOD don't confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any particular ſort of people, in beſtowing Converting Grace: but exerciſes a great Latitude
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:002987_0222_0FE6B192DFF78090"/>
and Liberty in this matter. He beſtows Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace upon ſome of all Nations: Jews and Gentiles, Barbarians, Scythians, Bond and Fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> have been called by GOD into a State of Grace Moreover, GOD Converts ſome of all Ages: Some He Converts in Youth, others at middle Age, and ſome are called at the Eleventh Hour, and in their Old Age, are made to experience the New-Birth. Sometimes GOD makes choice of the Rich, and oftentimes of the Poor of this World. Sometimes GOD Converts the leſs ſinful &amp; ſcandalous, and ſometimes he paſſeth by ſuch, and ſaves ſome of the Chief of Sinners. Sometimes he beſtows Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace upon ſuch as have deſcended from Godly Parents, &amp; ſo far ſmiles upon their religious Education, as that the pains and prayers of their pious Anceſtors are not loſt upon them. And ſometimes he paſſes by thoſe, and makes choice of the Children of the more wicked and ungodly. Thus various is GOD in his beſtowing Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace upon perſons, not taking all, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all of any ſort of People whatever. And now the divine Wiſdom and Prudence appears in ſuch a Conduct of himſelf. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By this GOD ſhews his Sovereignty, and that Divine Grace is in his hands to diſpenſe it to whomſoever he pleaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certain that GOD has ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereignty over the Children of Men as well as over the reſt of his Creatures as to deny, or diſpenſe his Grace to whom, and when, and where, and how he pleaſes; he has right to have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:002987_0223_0FE6B192F5503568"/>
he will to harden. Now it is highly proper that GOD ſhould manifeſt this Sovereignty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto him, and let us know that he is not obliged to one more than to another; but that he may, and does do what he pleaſes with his own, with the works of his own hands. And now GOD does moſt fully diſcover <hi>this,</hi> in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manners of his beſtowing converting Grace. For by GOD's chuſing ſome, and rejecting others of every ſort, we are utterly at a loſs for any certain Rule that GOD goes by in beſtowing his Grace, but that of his own Will. We find that outward Riches and Greatneſs don't move GOD to afford his ſpecial Grace, becauſe we may ſee multitudes of ſuch going on in their Sins. We alſo find that outward Poverty don't move GOD to Inrich them with his Grace; becauſe we ſee multitudes of ſuch as poor on ſpiritual, as they are on temporal accounts. We alſo find that deſcending from godly Parents, and being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a religious Education altho' the moſt likely way of any, yet does not always ſucceed, becauſe many that have been as highly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged on theſe accounts as any, have proved ſome of the vileſt and moſt abominable Wretches in the World: So that we can't find any certain Rule that GOD goes by, but he takes one here, and another there, without any conſtant regard to Circumſtances, which naturally ſuggeſts to us that GOD herein Acts according to his ſovereign Will &amp; Pleaſure. And now whatever will lead us to ſee and acknowledge the Divine Sovereignty in this matter, may be conſidered as an Inſtance
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:002987_0224_0FE6B19EC4C534E8"/>
of Wiſdom, becauſe the Glory of GOD is very much concerned in our believing and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this Perfection of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>This way of management ſerves to convince us that our Converſion is not of our ſelves, but of GOD; and that the glory of it belongs unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If only ſuch Perſons as deſcended from godly Parents, or lived in godly Families, and ſo were favoured with a religious Education were Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we ſhould be ready to impute all to their Education and Inſtruction, and to the good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that have been ſet before them; and not think of it's being the immediate Operation of the Spirit of GOD. We ſhould be ready to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Privileges not only as Means, but as the Cauſe of our Converſion, and ſo GOD would not have the glory of this wonderful work aſcribed to him, to whom alone <hi>it doth appertain.</hi> But now GOD by Converting ſome that have deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of wicked Parents, and have been deſtitute of the advantages of a religious Education, or of having good Examples before them: And by his Converting ſome alſo in their Old Age, when they have by their long cuſtom in Sinning ſtrengthned the habits of it, ſo as that it would be as eaſy for an Ethiopian to change his skin, and the Leopard his ſpot, as for them to forſake their evil ways, and turn to GOD of themſelves; I ſay, GOD by beſtowing regenerating Grace upon ſome ſuch, diſcovers to us that it is not in the power of counſels, cautions, admonitions, and good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to convert Men, but that when ever any are brought into ſuch a State, the Spirit of GOD has
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:002987_0225_0FE6B19ED8107A08"/>
been at work upon them. And ſo every one will be led to aſcribe this not to the power of means; but to the power of GOD, acknowledging to his glory, that it is not in the power of counſels or examples, nor in the power of pious Parents to convey Grace to their Children: but that it is by the Grace of GOD that Converted ones <hi>are what they are</hi>; that they <hi>are ſaved by grace, thro' faith, and that not of themſelves,</hi> nor of any Inſtruments, <hi>but it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>GOD's beſtowing regenerating Grace in ſuch a, Promiſcuous manner, is very uſeful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any from ſinking into deſpair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if ſome of all ſorts be Converted. Rich as well as Poor, the Children of the wicked as well as of the godly; ſome of the greateſt Sinners as well as of the leaſt; then none have any reaſon to be entirely diſcouraged. Indeed ſome that have often ſtifled the checks and convictions of their own Conſciences, grieved, and done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace; they may perhaps have ſo provoked GOD, as to be given up to their own hearts luſts, and ſo the day of Grace may expire with them before the day of life. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12.) But none can certainly know this; and it is certain there have been Inſtances of the Converſion of exceeding vile Sinners, and therefore one that is never ſo great a Sinner knows not but he may be another Inſtance wherein the mighty Power, and Grace of GOD ſhall be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed. So that conſidering what Inſtances of Converſion there have been it may keep all even the vileſt Sinners from utter deſpair, which is of
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:002987_0226_0FE6B1A11C4D6068"/>
great Service, as it will prevent them from growing more deſperate in their ſinful Courſes, and prevent their giving over all Means that GOD has appointed for their Converſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I may add alſo, <hi>That this is a way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Perſons from having too great a dependance upon their particular Circumſtances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men are exceeding apt to depend upon their particular Circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conclude from thence that they are or ſhall be Converted. Thus the rich Man that is made to proſper in the World, is ready to conclude with himſelf that GOD has ſpecial Favour for him, and concludes that as GOD has bleſſed him with temporal, ſo he will alſo with ſpiritual Bleſſings. The poor Man he alſo depends very much upon his Circumſtances, preſuming upon what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays, of GOD's <hi>Chooſing the poor of this world: make them rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom,</hi> Jam. 2.5. Others again have great dependance upon their Parentage, their being deſcended of godly Anceſtors, as if regenerating Grace run in the Blood, boaſting as the proud Phariſees &amp; Sadduces that they <hi>had Abraham to their Father.</hi> But now the manner of GOD's diſpenſing regenerating Grace, will lead us to reject ſuch Confidences as theſe; and teach us that theſe things are by no means to be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon; and ſo many a one is driven off from that preſumptuous Hope, they would otherwiſe have periſhed in.</p>
               <p>And thus if we conſider the order GOD ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in beginning this work of Grace in the
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:002987_0227_0FE6B1A132BBBF48"/>
Soul, the way of the Spirit's working this Grace within us, and the variety of Perſons whom GOD makes choice of to be the Subjects of this Grace, we may ſee that it is all by Counſel and the reſult of conſummate Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, the Means made uſe of by GOD, in the Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Wiſdom of GOD that appears therein. But this I muſt leave to another Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. And I ſhall Conclude at preſent with a word or two by way of <hi>Application.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Since the Converſion of a Sinner is ſuch a mighty Work as to require the Almighty Power of GOD to accompliſh it; let none of us be ſo vain as to think this to be a work within our own Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For (as we have heard) the turning a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from darkneſs to light, and bringing him out of the Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of the Son of GOD, requires an Almighty Arm to accompliſh it. The ſame Power that gave Being to the World at firſt, that raiſed us up to a natural Life, muſt raiſe us to a new &amp; ſpiritual Life. It is the Almighty Power of GOD which raiſed up JESUS from the dead, muſt make us to know him and the power of his Reſurrection and enable us to dye unto Sin, and live unto Righteouſneſs. Therefore that Man is a great ſtranger to himſelf, and to the greatneſs of this work, that imagines it may be performed by the ſtrength of Nature without the ſpecial and ſupernatural Grace of GOD, and he will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a ſtranger to this work in his own Soul, ſo long as he engages in it in his own Strength.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="223" facs="unknown:002987_0228_0FE6B1AD5B02C798"/>2. <hi>What we have heard of the Order in which GOD proceeds in the Converting a Sinner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords one Mark to know whether we are in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted State or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Namely, <hi>Our being wrought on by Grace after the manner mention'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing that GOD does is to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Mind, by which he perſwades the Will, and excites the Affections. Now therefore if we would know whether we are Converted, we muſt conſider whether ever GOD has opened the Eyes of our Minds: Have we another ſenſe and apprehenſion of ſpiritual things than in times paſt? Do we ſee Sin after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Do we ſee it in ſuch a view as to ſee it to be an Infinite Evil, and to have ſuch a ſtrong and lively ſenſe hereof as to hate and abhor it, to repent of it, and reſolve againſt it? Do we ſee Chriſt in his beauty &amp; glory? Do we ſee our need of him, and his fulneſs &amp; ſufficiency for us in ſuch a manner as to embrace him with all our hearts as our Prince &amp; Saviour? Laſtly, Have we ever ſeen ſo much of the beauty of Holineſs, and of the holineſs, juſtice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the divine Commandments, as to make Choice of them for the Rule of our Lives? Now when we find our Minds thus enlightned as to have ſuch a ſpiritual diſcerning of ſpiritual things, we may conclude there is a work of Grace begun. But until we find ſuch an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion &amp; diſcerning of ſpiritual things we may conclude we are in a State of Nature, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pangs of Affections and Devotion we may
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:002987_0229_0FE6B1AD6F192CB8"/>
ſeem to have at ſome particular Seaſons; for if our Affections are not ſtirred up from ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual views &amp; apprehenſions of ſpiritual things, they are ſtirred up by Nature and not by Grace: for Grace begins with the Underſtanding, the leading Faculty of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Since GOD deals ſo promiſcuouſly in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing converting Grace, let none be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but let us all truſt in him, and hope in his Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' we can find nothing in our ſelves to recommend us to him, yet we may hope for his Grace; for it is nothing that he ſees in any that moves him to beſtow his Grace upon them, but it is all owing to his ſovereign Will &amp; Pleaſure: and therefore altho' we are never ſo Unworthy, GOD may have Mercy on us, and turn us unto himſelf; nay ſometimes he chuſes ſuch to make his Power and his Grace the more manifeſt and conſpicuous. And altho' it would be moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible perverſeneſs in any to go on in Sin that Grace might abound, yet when we have gone very far in Sin, it may give us ſome Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hope in GOD whoſe Mercies are Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and who can as eaſily Convert one Sinner as another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let ſuch as are Converted ſee to it that they give the glory of all to GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely the glory of it all belongs unto him; let us then give him the glory due unto his Name. Don't be ſo fooliſh as to imagine that becauſe you did not perceive the motions of the Holy Ghoſt, diſtinct from the natural motions
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:002987_0230_0FE6B1AED5451568"/>
of your Souls, as if it were nothing but your own work. But conſider how ſecretly the holy Spirit works in and upon our Spirits: therefore where ever we find the work wrought within us, in how natural and unperceptible a way ſo ever it has been performed; yet be ſure to acknowledge it as the work of GOD, and that it is he that has wrought in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>And let us aſcribe it to him as an act of free, and ſovereign Grace. Let us not think that GOD ſaw any thing better in us than he did in others; for we were all equally under guilt, and children of wrath by nature even as others, and therefore if any of us are Converted, while others remain in a ſtate of Nature, we muſt acknowledge and adore ſovereign Grace, that makes the difference, and muſt ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> AMEN.</p>

               <p>THE point I am upon is the Regeneration and Converſion of a Sinner, and to obſerve the Wiſdom of GOD that appears therein. And here I have already conſidered the work it ſelf, and ſhewn how much it manifeſts the glory of GOD, eſpecially the glory of his Power, and of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:002987_0231_0FE6B1AEEA0A11D8"/>
his Grace: and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD that he is pleaſed to perform ſuch a mighty work as the Converting and Changing the hearts of Sinners. I have alſo in the next place conſidered the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Method and Manner of GOD in performing this work; that is, I have ſhewn how, and where he begins this work in the Soul; namely, in the Underſtanding, enlightning that, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Will: and that this work is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſecret, unperceptible operations of the holy Spirit, and that GOD makes choice of a great variety of perſons on whom to beſtow this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and Saving Grace, even ſome of all ſorts, in all which I ſhewed there is a great deal of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Contrivance.</p>
               <p>Now what remains is to conſider the Outward Means made uſe of by GOD in the Converſion and Sanctification of Sinners. So then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If we conſider the Means made uſe of by GOD in the Converſion of Sinners, we ſhall ſee much of the Wiſdom of GOD therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under this head, I ſhall endeavour to ſhow the Wiſdom of GOD,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In making uſe of any Means at all in our <hi>Converſion.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:002987_0232_0FE6B1B91A2928A8"/>That GOD is able to Convert a Sinner by an act of his immediate Power, without the help of Means, and Second Cauſes, none can doubt of who believe that Almighty Power belongs unto him, nor is it much to be doubted, that GOD has done ſo. The Converſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have been an inſtance; for he was not brought to believe in Chriſt from any arguments, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Means that were uſed, which by the ſecret workings of the Spirit proved effectual on him: but notwithſtanding all the common Means that had been uſed with him; he was as bitter againſt the Chriſtians as ever, and was in his rage hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to perſecute them; but GOD Converted him at once as he was on his way, by a miraculous Light from Heaven that ſhown round about him, and by a more glorious Light that ſhone into him, giving <hi>him the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of GOD in the face of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: without any uſe of the ordinary Means: but this is not the common way in which GOD Converts Sinners unto himſelf; but it is by the uſe of certain Means that he has inſtituted and appointed for that End. Thus Prayer is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Means of Grace by which we may obtain the holy Spirit in the Regenerating and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Influences of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. The word of GOD is alſo ſpoken of as a Means made uſe of for our Regeneration. Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of Truth.</hi> And this muſt be by our Hearing of it, and attending to it. For as the Apoſtle ſays, Rom 10.17. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:002987_0233_0FE6B1B92D74B418"/>
Other means of Grace alſo are appointed for us, which I ſhall take particular Notice of before I finiſh the point under conſideration; by all which it appears that GOD has appointed certain Means to be made uſe of for begetting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing a principle of Grace in the Soul: and now here is Wiſdom and Prudence. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the firſt place, the Power of GOD is as much manifeſted in the Converſion of a Sinner, in the uſe of Outward Means, as if he ſhould do it by an Immediate act of his Power, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Second Cauſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Converting or Changing the heart of a Sinner, is ſuch a work as will always require Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power to accompliſh it: and therefore let it be done by an Immediate act, or in the uſe of Means, yet ſuch a Power muſt and will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted therein. GOD's making uſe of Means, and obliging us to attend upon them don't prevent his exerting the ſame Almighty Power, as if he ſhould do it at once by an immediate Voice, or Light from Heaven: For unleſs the Almighty Spirit of GOD accompany the Outward Means to give life, and efficacy to them, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to Convert a Sinner; but thoſe who have the richeſt and moſt plentiful enjoyment of Outward Means would remain in their Sins, of which we have innumerable Inſtances. So that every one that ſeriouſly conſiders of it, eſpecially ſuch as have experienced this mighty work of Grace in their own Souls, will be ſenſible of, and obliged to acknowledge, that how uſeful ſoever Outward Means have been, the change has
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:002987_0234_0FE6B1BBE02D6188"/>
been wrought in them by the power of the <hi>divine Spirit,</hi> that the ſame Almighty power which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs at firſt, has cauſed it to ſhine into their Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is wiſely contrived by GOD to make uſe of certain means in the Converſion of Sinners, <hi>as herein the work of the Spirit is carryed on in a Secret, Unperceptible way, altogether agreable to, and in Concurrence with our Natural Powers and Faculties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Converſion of Sinners ſhou'd be brought about in ſuch a ſudden, immediate &amp; viſible manner from Heaven, as that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> it would be like the other miraculous operations of the holy Spirit, and not in that ſtill and ſecret way which the holy Ghoſt deſigned to work in, and upon us. Our Saviour tells us that, that the <hi>Kingdom of God that is within men,</hi> that is ſet up in Mens hearts, <hi>cometh not with obſervation,</hi> Luk. 17.20. It was not to come with outward ſhew, in ſuch a viſible, and glorious manner as to be obſerved in its coming; but it was to come within Men, to be wrought in Mens hearts in ſuch a ſecret manner as not to be obſerved by others till it manifeſted it ſelf by the bleſſed Effects of it in Mens lives.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the work was wrought in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Manner, there would not be the uſe of our natural and rational Powers &amp; Faculties, nor any concurrence of our own Endeavours, but we ſhould ſeem to be wholly Unconcerned about the matter: but now by the uſe of Means, altho' the Spirit works the change in our hearts as really and truly as if he did it without Means, yet now we

ſome way or other concur, and are concerned in the work. By there being Means appointed we have the opportunity of Exerciſing our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers of Judgment and Choice: By there being Means made uſe of we have the opportunity of being inlightned &amp; inſtructed in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo indeed, altho' GOD in the work of Converſion does really work in us both to Will and to Do of his own good pleaſure; yet we may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to work out our own Salvation. And it is highly proper, and ſo wiſely ordered by GOD, that it ſhould be ſo, conſidering that Heaven is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a reward, and Hell conſidered as a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and that we ſhall be ſentenced to one of theſe, according as we do, or do not comply with the terms of Salvation propoſed to us.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third place, That it is wiſely ordered by GOD to make uſe of Means in the work of Converſion, <hi>as it puts the affair of our Converſion ſo much in our own hands as to render us utterly inexcuſable if we are not Converted, and ſo will vindicate the Juſtice of GOD in the ſentence of Condemnation he ſhall pronounce upon all ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were no ſort of Outward or ordinary Means appointed to be made uſe of by us in order to our Converſion; but if GOD ſhould ſtrike down one at one time, and another at another time by a

viſible appearance, and audible voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even perhaps when they were in their full Career of wickedneſs, inſtead of being attendent upon him in any duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, if this were the conſtant method of Converting Sinners, Men would have nothing to do towards their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, they would not have any tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: and then one Courſe of life would bid as fair for Converſion as another for ought we know. And now in this caſe, if a perſon remained Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, it could not be looked upon as a crime, but an unhappineſs that he was paſſed by, and ſo the Juſtice of GOD could not appear ſo clear in pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing him for remaining in an Unconverted Eſtate, becauſe it would be impoſſible for him to know, much leſs to do any thing that has ſo much as a tendency towards it. But now by GOD's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing certain Means to be made uſe of, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by us in order to our Converſion, he does in ſome ſenſe put it into our own power, and leaves it to our choice, whether we will be Converted or no. For altho' Converſion be altogether the work of GOD; yet the making uſe of theſe Means wherein he is wont to convey ſaving Grace to the Soul, is in our power who live under the free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them. Thus for inſtance, GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the <hi>Reading &amp; Hearing the Word</hi> as Means of our Converſion, now this we can attend upon; it is as much in our power as any natural Action that we perform, to Read the word of GOD, to go to his Houſe, and ſet under the Preaching of it. And as <hi>Prayer</hi> is another Means of Grace, ſo this we are able alſo to attend upon. And therefore
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:002987_0237_0FE6B1C7EE5D3B70"/>
if we dont diligently and carefully attend upon theſe, and ſuch like Means of Grace, it is our own fault: And ſo it becomes our own fault that we are not Converted, becauſe we dont make uſe of the Means that GOD appoints for that End as we ought. And this will render every Man that lives, and dies in an Unconverted Eſtate under the Means of Grace, utterly inexcuſable before GOD. For if the Sinner ſhould plead he could not Convert himſelf; yet his Mouth will be ſtop'd wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h ſuch a reply as this from GOD, that he might have made a better uſe of the Means of Grace that were appointed, that he either neglected them, or was careleſs in his attending upon them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he might have been Converted as well as others: and their deſtruction will appear to be of themſelves, and their Condemnation very juſt and equitable. And ſurely it is the Wiſdom of GOD ſo to order things, as that even in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction of the Ungodly, it will appear that Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Throne, and ſo to have this ſung to his everlaſting honour, Juſt &amp; True are all thy ways, thou King of Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>I proceed to Conſider the Manner of GOD's making uſe of Means in our Converſion,</hi> and the Wiſdom of GOD that appears therein.</p>
               <p>As it is an Inſtance of Wiſdom in GOD to make uſe of any Outward Means; ſo this Wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more Conſpicuous in the Manner of his making uſe of them: for he makes uſe of ſuch Means, and no other, ſo far, and no farther than will anſwer ſome very wiſe and good purpoſes.
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:002987_0238_0FE6B1C9444BB370"/>
Here I ſhall mention a few particulars under this Head.</p>
               <p n="1">1. GOD's <hi>giving Succeſs ſo frequently to the Means that he has appointed, and making them for the moſt part the Inſtrument of our Converſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers divine Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When GOD Converts Sinners he does it for the moſt part in and by the Means that he has appointed, they are generally the Inſtruments of our Converſion, and it is Wiſdom in GOD that it ſhould be ſo. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby GOD puts Honour upon his own Inſtitutions, and gives further Teſtimony that they are means of his own Appointment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is highly proper that GOD ſhould put Honour upon his own Inſtitutions, and give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Evidence to us that they are from him, that ſo we might Honour them by an high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of them, and a reverent and devout At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on them. And now there is no way appears ſo effectual for this, as the giving Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Means, and making them anſwer the propoſed End of their Inſtitution. Thus for Inſtance, how could GOD magnify his word and make it honourable any ways ſo effectually, as by making it the Inſtrument of our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration &amp; Converſion? By cauſing it to come with ſuch demonſtration of the Spirit, and with ſuch Power as to enlighten our dark Minds, to enliven our dead Souls, and to make us <hi>wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> So again what greater honour can be done to the miniſterial Inſtitution, or what greater confirmation can be given of Chriſt's
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:002987_0239_0FE6B1C959B0CC28"/>
appointing an order of Men to diſpenſe his Word &amp; Ordinances, and of his being preſent with them, than is giving Succeſs to their Miniſtry; and making them the Inſtruments of turning Men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD? Theſe are ſeals of their Miniſtry, proofs &amp; confirmations of their Commiſſion's being received from CHRIST the King and Head of the Church: and ſo any of the divine Ordinances when they are accompanied with the mighty Power of GOD ſo as to convert Sinners &amp; edify Saints, it honours the Ordinances and ſhews that GOD is with us of a truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. GOD's giving Succeſs to Means <hi>leads us highly to Prize and Value them, and to be more Thankful for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſee the Means of Grace prove ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the Converſion of Sinners, when we find the Ordinances to be quick &amp; powerful, and by the Diſpenſations of them great additions made unto the Church of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, it will naturally lead us to an high Eſteem of them, to look upon them as very uſeful and neceſſary and ſo an unſpeakable Favour to enjoy them. For what can be a greater Bleſſing than to enjoy thoſe Means which (with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the divine Power which is wont to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them) are able to ſave our Souls? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have any regard for our precious and immortal Souls, we ſhall have an high eſteem for thoſe Means &amp; Inſtruments that GOD will own and bleſs for their Salvation. We ſhall
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:002987_0240_0FE6B1D4E601E778"/>
be enlarged in greater Thankfulneſs for them than for any outward good things whatſoever. This will put Men upon praiſing the Lord for giving them his Statutes and his Judgments; this will put them upon bleſſing the GOD and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for bleſſing them with ſuch ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo GOD will have the glory due unto his Name for theſe Means, as well as we the benefit &amp; advantage of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. GOD's giving Succeſs to his own inſtituted Means well ſerve this good End, <hi>That it will Encourage us to the more diligent Attendance upon them, as being the moſt, yea the only likely way of obtaining converting Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Word, Ordinances, and all the Means of Grace have little or no good Effect upon Perſons, when thoſe that attend upon them are no better than thoſe that neglect them, it becomes a ſtumbling block to many; they are apt to entertain ſlighty thoughts of the Means themſelves as if they were inſignificant, and are ready to ſay, It is in vain to wait upon GOD in them. But now when we ſee the divine Bleſſing accompanying the outward Means of Grace, ſo as that many Sinners are Converted, and Converts are filled with Righteouſneſs by them; when we ſee them <hi>flouriſh in the Courts of our God, that are planted in the houſe of the Lord</hi>: It will convince us of the Advantage of attending divine Ordinances, the Sin and Folly of neglecting them, and it will Encourage us to be waiting upon GOD in the ways of his
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:002987_0241_0FE6B1D4FA5BA2E0"/>
appointment, if we have any regard for our Souls, or any concern for being brought into a State of Grace. Surely when we ſee that they are bleſſed who watch daily at Wiſdom's Gates, waiting at the Poſts of her Doors, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to do likewiſe; we ſhall be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to go with them that keep holy Days, to the mountains of Zion, to the Houſe of the GOD of Jacob, where the Lord commands the Bleſſing. But I proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That as it is Wiſdom in GOD to give Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for the moſt part to the Means appointed, ſo on the other hand it is alſo Wiſdom in him ſometimes <hi>to Deny his Bleſſing with Means, or at leaſt not to give ſucceſs always in proportion to the outward Means enjoyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' GOD does for the moſt part, yet he does not always tye himſelf up to his inſtituted Means in beſtowing converting Grace. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he works without the common Means, as in the forementioned Inſtance of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> But whether there be any ſuch Inſtances as <hi>that,</hi> now a days, yet this is moſt certain, that GOD does not always ſucceed the Means of Grace in the ſame degree &amp; meaſure, nor in any exact proportion to what Means are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This we often find that the ſame Means are to ſome a ſavour of Life unto Life, and a ſavour of Death unto Death to others. We find that the Word &amp; Ordinances, altho' diſpenſed and adminiſtred as faithfully in one Place as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet not with the like Succeſs, no nor with the like Succeſs in the ſame Place. Sometimes
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:002987_0242_0FE6B1D64B7D4CA8"/>
the number of Converts increaſes daily under the Means of Grace; and at another time altho' the ſame Means are uſed, the ſame Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the ſame Care &amp; Watchfulneſs exerciſed over the Flock, yet the Miniſter will have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to complain, that he labours in vain and ſpends his ſtrength for nought. Nay it may be obſerved further, That among thoſe who enjoy the richeſt Means, and are moſt plentifully fed with Knowledge &amp; Underſtanding, by the moſt burning &amp; ſhining Lights, the ableſt Miniſters of the New-Teſtament, eminently qualified aright to divide the Word of Truth; and who are careful to give to every one their portion in due Seaſon, yet there is not ſuch Increaſe of Converts, as in ſome other Places where they are not favoured with ſuch precious Means, nor with one to go in and out before them ſo eminently gifted and qualifyed for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Oftentimes an honeſt, but weak and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Preacher, ſhall do more good with his Preaching than the moſt learned and judicious Divine. Nay we may obſerve further ſtill even with reſpect to our ſelves, that the very ſame Word or Ordinance has not always the ſame Effect &amp; Influence upon us. There are ſome Paſſages in the Word of GOD, that we have perhaps oftentimes heard &amp; read, and they have had no manner of Effect upon us; and yet at another time the ſame Word will migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily affect our Hearts, and perhaps prove the Means of our Converſion. So on the other hand, what may very much affect us at one time,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:002987_0243_0FE6B1D660DEE2F0"/>
may be very awakening to our Conſciences, and may warm our Affections, and excite our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; may yet at another time have no manner of Effect upon us. Now GOD's dealing in ſuch a various manner, ſometimes with-holding as well as at others affording Succeſs to the Means, is a wiſe Contrivance. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This ſerves to prevent our depending too much upon outward Means, as if there was power or vertue in them to Convert us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are all exceeding prone to truſt to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, and depend on ſecond Cauſes. If perſons do but enjoy the Means of Grace, if they ſet under an eminent Preacher, and give their conſtant Attendance upon divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, they are apt to depend upon them, and think their Condition ſafe, and look no further, concluding theſe will be able to ſave their Souls. But now, GOD by not always proportioning the Succeſs according to the Excellency of the Means, teaches us that Means are of themſelves a vain thing to truſt unto. GOD by with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Bleſſing ſometimes from the beſt of Means, when he affords a remarkable Bleſſing to more ordinary Means, plainly ſhews us that there is no real vertue in the outward Means, that they are dead &amp; ineffectual of themſelves, and are utterly unable of their own power to convey any ſaving Grace into the Soul. For if the Vertue was in the Means themſelves, then the beſt Means would always prove the moſt powerful: but becauſe we often ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it affords ſufficient Evidence that the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:002987_0244_0FE6B1D8A5A81F18"/>
Vertue and Power is not in the Means, and affords a ſufficient Caution againſt depending upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This leads us to have all our dependance upon GOD notwithſtanding the Means, and to give the glory of our Converſion to him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when the Means of Grace are not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded according to the degree &amp; meaſure of them Enjoyed; when the richeſt Means, and the moſt plentiful Enjoyment of them fail of Succeſs equal to more Inferiour Means and a greater Scarcity of them: As it ſhews the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is not in the Means, ſo it makes it very evident that all the ſaving Efficacy is from GOD, and that it is entirely depending on GOD whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means ſhall be ſucceſsful or unſucceſsful, and that when any have been Converted by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, thoſe Means have been accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a ſpecial Bleſſing from GOD, even the powerful Operations of the divine Spirit. So that this way of managing leads or at leaſt has a natural tendency to lead every Perſon to wait upon GOD for his Bleſſing upon the Means of Grace they enjoy, and whenever they prove effectual for Salvation, to paſs over the Means in a thankful Acknowledgment of GOD for them, and to give the Glory of all to him: This will lead us to aſcribe not to Means, but to GOD, acknowledging to his Glory, that how uſeful ſoever Means have been, yet that it is GOD that works the ſaving Change, that it is he that Creates the clean Heart, and Renews the right Spirit within us, and ſo in this way GOD
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:002987_0245_0FE6B1D8B9DD8D88"/>
the Efficient Cauſe of our Regeneration will have the Glory of his own work rendred to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwiſe it would be moſt likely to be paid to the Inſtruments, made uſe of by him therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Inſtance of the Wiſdom of GOD in the Manner of making uſe of Means, <hi>Is his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining us to the particular Means that he himſelf has appointed, and not allowing us to run after the Inventions of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That GOD has inſtituted and appointed certain Means in and by which he will convey his Grace to ſuch as duly attend on them, has been already obſerved. And now, as theſe divine Inſtitutions muſt be carefully attended, in order to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Regenerating Grace of GOD, ſo no other Means, no humane Inventions may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any Expectation of meeting with the divine Grace in them. Altho' GOD is very ready to convey his Grace, yet it muſt be in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels that he himſelf has made for it to flow in. If we would draw the waters of life, it muſt be out of theſe Wells of Salvation that GOD has dug for us, it muſt be out of theſe Ordinances that are appointed by Chriſt for us, &amp; not out of thoſe that are but humane Inventions. GOD confines his Graces to his own Ordinances, them he will own &amp; bleſs, but the multiplying Ordinances, and Ceremonies of our own Invention in the Worſhip of GOD, how plauſible ſo ever they may be, yet is far from being pleaſing to GOD, or any way profitable to us. He inſiſts upon our waiting upon him in the particular ways that he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in order to our obtaining his Grace: And
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:002987_0246_0FE6B1DD8B8CCD68"/>
altho' another way may appear as likely in the natural tendency of it, yet it will by no means anſwer the End. The Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus, Pher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi> and <hi>Abana,</hi> had doubtleſs as much natural vertue in them, as the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> to cure the Leproſy; but <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian muſt bath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Jordan,</hi> if he would be cleanſed, becauſe this was the divine Preſcription, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5 10. And thus GOD expects &amp; requires that in order to obtain his Grace, we ſhould wait upon him in thoſe particular ways that he has preſcribed in his Word, and no other. The Commiſſion to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, was to teach them to obſerve all things that Chriſt had Commanded them, and nothing more, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. They were not to tranſgreſs the Commandments of GOD by their Traditions, as the Phariſees did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.3. For our Saviour ſays, in vain do they worſhip him, that <hi>teach for doctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> as in the 9th. <hi>v.</hi> of that Chapter; that is, To worſhip GOD in a way that is only taught by Men, and no where preſcribed by GOD, is a vain worſhip. In ſhort, the Word of GOD is the Directory for divine Worſhip, and there muſt we reſort for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at all times; and therefore the Inquiry ought to be not ſo much, What ſaith the Church? or what ſay the Fathers? or what ſays humane Reaſon? but <hi>what ſaith the Scripture</hi>? Therein we are taught what is good, and all that the Lord our GOD requires of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we muſt cloſely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the divine Preſcriptions therein, and not multiply Ordinances &amp; Ceremonies, under a vain pretence of pleaſing GOD thereby, or of being in a
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:002987_0247_0FE6B1DDA464BA08"/>
more likely way to obtain his Grace. That ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. is as applicable (from the general reaſon of it) to thoſe under the Chriſtian, as to thoſe under the Jewiſh diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>What things ſoever I Command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> And now here is Wiſdom. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD knows infinitely better than we, what Means of Grace are most proper, and ſuitable for us to attend upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD who has a perfect knowledge of himſelf, of us, and of all things elſe, muſt needs know beſt, which way is the moſt proper for us to wait upon him in, and which the moſt ſuitable way for him to convey his Grace to us: and therefore it is wiſely, as well as graciouſly done in him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the way himſelf, &amp; not leave it to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is Wiſdom in GOD to confine us to the Means &amp; Ways of Worſhip that he has preſcribed, <hi>Becauſe of the vain, fooliſh and extravagant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there is in the heart of Man, with reſpect to the Modes of Religious Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed it is the temper of ſome Men to neglect all Means of Grace, they are for ſitting ſtill, till GOD ſhall by an immediate act of his Power work the mighty Change within them: They are not for attending any Ordinances, but expect the Motions of the Spirit of GOD without it. It was therefore neceſſary that GOD ſhould himſelf preſcribe the Ordinances, and Means of Grace, to quicken ſuch to attend upon them, as ever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with the divine Grace. But then on the other hand, it is the temper of a great part of
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:002987_0248_0FE6B1E9F7AE74A0"/>
Mankind to abound in religious Ceremonies, they are full of their own Inventions, and are for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying religious Ordinances beyond what GOD has preſcribed, thinking to honour &amp; pleaſe GOD, or at leaſt to make ſome Atonement for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in moral Duties, by adding to his Ordinances, and doing more in that way than he requires. We find by Hiſtory and Obſervation, that not only the Ignorant Nations, who have only the light of Nature to guide them, have run into the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious obſervance of a multitude of the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous Ceremonies in Religion, but that even thoſe who have had the light of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to guide them, yet when they have gone off from the divine Directory therein, and have been for adding ſomething of their own Invention to the divine Ordinances, they have by degrees run into as idle, ridiculous and extravagant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as the moſt ignorant Heathen. Thus it was with the Nation of the Jews, they were in their degenerate State continually diſpoſed to add to the divine Inſtitutions, one Ceremony to another of their own, till they came to that Condition they were in, when our Saviour complains of them, for tranſgreſſing the Commandments of GOD by their tradition; for running all their Religion into meer formality, and empty Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſuch as their frequent waſhing their hands, their cups and platters, their Superſtitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from eating with Publicans and Sinners, their Superſtitious building up the Tombs, and garniſhing the Sepulchres of the ancient Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo we find among them that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:002987_0249_0FE6B1EA0F612240"/>
Chriſtians, that by their not confining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Means, the Ordinances, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles had appointed, but giving way to their own corrupt and carnal reaſoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have run unto as burdenſom Ceremonies, as they of the Jewiſh Nation. To inſtance particularly in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how many vain, burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and ridiculous Ceremonies, yea what groſs Superſtition and Idolatry have crept into it, by their not adhering to the Scripture directory, but following their own Inventions. Which ſerves to ſet forth the divine Wiſdom and Prudence, in preſcribing certain Means and Ordinances for us, and limiting us to them, and not allowing us to follow our own fooliſh Imaginations. For in ſhort, vain Man would be wiſe tho' he be born as the wild aſſes Colt: We are wiſe in our own conceit, we are apt to imagine there are many ways of pleaſing GOD, beſides thoſe that he has preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: we are ready to think ſuch a Ceremony and ſuch a Formality in our religious Worſhip would pleaſe the Almighty, would help our devotion and would have a more natural tendency to beget, and to increaſe Grace within us, than barely thoſe plain &amp; ſimple Means that GOD has preſcribed. And by what we have ſeen of others we may be ſatisfyed that if GOD had not given us a general directory how, and after what manner we muſt wait upon him for his Grace, we ſhould quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our ſelves in as heavy a yoke of bondage as that of the Moſaical diſpenſation; inſtead of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt in the liberty where-with Chriſt has made us free. By which it appears how thorowly GOD
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:002987_0250_0FE6B1EB2784CE58"/>

                  <p>Such are without the Means of Converſion and Salvation, and this is the caſe of the Heathen World that have not the Goſpel, nor the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, they are periſhing for lack of viſion; they are in a periſhing State becauſe they are deſtitute of the Means of obtaining that Faith in Chriſt which is neceſſary according to the tenor of the Goſpel for our Salvation: For how ſhould they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher, and how ſhall they Preach unleſs they be ſent? Wherefore we ſhould pity ſuch Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of darkneſs, and ſhould pour out our Souls in Prayer to GOD for them, that he would find out ways for their coming to the knowledge of him,

Now ſuch are inexcuſable whoever they are, and juſtly reprovable; this is to deſpiſe and neglect the way that GOD himſelf has appointed for your Converſion, and ſurely you cant expect to obtain Converting Grace in any other way: for altho' GOD can beſtow this Grace without the help of Outward Means, yet you have not the leaſt reaſon in the world to expect it who live either in the wilful or careleſs neglect of the Means that he has appointed.</p>

And if ſo, ſurely then our Duty and our Intereſt is to ſeek to GOD for his Bleſſing to accompany the Means of Grace that we enjoy. Unleſs we do ſo, it is in vain to attend upon them: for unleſs he bleſſes them, they can be of no ſaving Good &amp; Benefit to us. Therefore when ever we are about to attend upon any of the Inſtituted Means of Grace, we ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge &amp; profeſs, that we don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Means themſelves, but upon him that has appointed them. Accordingly when ever we are about to read, or hear the Word of GOD, or attend upon the holy Sacrament, our Eyes and our Hearts ſhould be up unto GOD for a Bleſſing upon his own Inſtitutions, and this is the way to meet with GOD in his Ordinances. This is the way to receive a Bleſſing from the Lord, and Righteouſneſs from the GOD of our Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>What we have heard of GOD's</hi> Confining <hi>us to the Means of his own Appointment, teaches us the Inſignificancy of all humane Inventions in order to our obtaining the Grace of GOD.</hi> It has been too much the temper &amp; diſpoſition of the Church of GOD in all Ages, but eſpecially in the degenerate Ages of it, to be making ſome additions of their own Invention in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD, when the Life of Godlineſs has
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:002987_0253_0FE6B1F7F5F5C050"/>
failed among a People, they have been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it up in Formality and outward Show. And ſometimes indeed from an indiſcreet Zeal, and from ſome ſuperſtitious Notions with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Almighty, Perſons have been exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo to make ſome Additions to the ways of Worſhip that GOD has Inſtituted. But now ſince GOD in his great Wiſdom is pleaſed to confine us to the Means of his own appointment, all ſuch Inventions of Men muſt needs be vain and inſignificant; and how plauſible ſo ever the Arguments may be that are offered for them, yet they can't by any means be juſtifyed, nor is there any foundation to expect to meet with the divine Grace in our attendance upon them. For in our attending on the Means of Grace, ſo as to receive any Benefit by them, two things ſeem to be neceſſary:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we ſhould attend upon them in <hi>Obedience to GOD.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In <hi>Faith,</hi> depending upon GOD to bleſs his Ordinances, and make them effectual for the End propoſed.</p>
                  <p>But now how can there be either of theſe in our following Ceremonies of meer humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It can't be in Obedience to GOD, becauſe it is what GOD hath not required of us.</hi> And he may well ſay, as in Iſa. 1.12. <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither can there be ſuppoſed to be that Faith and dependance upon GOD, for the ſpecial Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit to render them effectual for the Ends propoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="unknown:002987_0254_0FE6B1F958925FF0"/>For they are far from having the like Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of meeting with the Spirit of GOD in humane Inventions, as in the divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Nay GOD having always ſhown his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at uninſtituted Ceremonies in Religion, there is abundant reaſon to conclude that his Spirit will not accompany them; and ſo they can't be attended with Faith &amp; Dependance upon GOD for his Bleſſing, or at leaſt not with any ſufficient foundation for ſuch a Faith. But then further. The grounds and foundations for adding any Ceremonies of our own in the Worſhip of GOD, to the divine Inſtitutes, is what will naturally draw us off from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing that dependance upon GOD for his Bleſſing in order to their anſwering the End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; for upon Inquiry it will be found that the beſt and moſt plauſible Argument for adding any humane Ceremonies in divine Worſhip, is, <hi>The natural aptitude &amp; fitneſs of them to Compoſe our Spirits, to ſtir up our Affections, and to quicken our Devotion.</hi> They will plead for ſuch or ſuch a Ceremony, that is a very ſignificant one, that it has a natural tendency to help Men's Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But now this Argument naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts &amp; hinders that dependance upon GOD for the Influences of his Spirit, which there ought always to be. By this we ſhall be found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend more upon the natural Power of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, than upon the efficacious Influence of the Spirit of GOD.</p>
                  <p>But I may not detain you any longer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Conclude</hi> at preſent;</p>

                     <pb n="250" facs="unknown:002987_0255_0FE6B1F96CF72B60"/>Let us all admire and adore the ſovereign Goodneſs, and diſtinguiſhing Favour of GOD unto us, that when the greateſt part of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures are periſhing for lack of the outward Means of Grace, we are favoured with a plentiful and peaceable Enjoyment of them, without any unreaſonable Impoſitions of Men. And now let us not Content our ſelves that we live among the divine Ordinances; but let us give our diligent Attendance upon them, <hi>walking in all the Commandments &amp; Ordinances of the Lord</hi>; and when we have done this, let us not depend upon the Means themſelves, but let us wait upon GOD for his Bleſſing, who alone is able to bleſs the Means and make them effectual; and this is the way for us to have GOD owning and honouring his own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo as to make them helpful for our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and for our progreſs in Grace &amp; Holineſs. And now whenever we Experience any of the Means of Grace working their deſired &amp; deſigned Effect within us, let us not aſcribe it to the Means, as if they did it by their own power: much leſs let us aſcribe it to our ſelves, or to any ſtrength or worthineſs of our own; but let us give the glory of all to GOD, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>YOU may remember that in my laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I undertook to ſet forth the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD in the <hi>Means</hi> made uſe of in the Regeneration &amp; Converſion of Sinners. And under this Head I have endeavoured to ſhew the Wiſdom of GOD, 1. In making uſe of any Means at all in our Converſion. 2. In the Manner of his uſing Means in our Converſion: Such as his
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:002987_0257_0FE6B200C1E88680"/>
giving Succeſs ſo frequently to the Means; and then ſometimes by denying his Bleſſing with them, or not giving Succeſs in proportion to the plenty of Means enjoyed; and laſtly, By Confining us to the Means of his own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not allowing us to follow our own Inventions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I now proceed in the third place to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>the Means themſelves,</hi> the <hi>Propriety, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs &amp; ſufficiency of them to anſwer the End propoſed for them,</hi> and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD that appears therein.</p>
               <p>Now the outward Means of Grace may be diſtinguiſhed into thoſe that GOD has expreſly commanded us to attend upon, and thoſe which he in the courſe of his Providence cauſes us to meet withal: <hi>i. e.</hi> The Means of Grace may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>: For the Providences of GOD may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Means of Grace, as well as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Goſpel. And every Converted one that has made any Obſervation of himſelf, and of the manner of his Converſion, will find the Diſpenſations of divine Providence have been very helpful herein.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider the <hi>divine Ordinances,</hi> or <hi>Inſtituted Means of Grace,</hi> and the Wiſdom of GOD that appears in them.</p>
               <p>And here before I proceed to a particular Conſideration of them, I would obſerve in general, <hi>That they are plain, ſimple &amp; eaſy Means.</hi> There is nothing abſtruſe, intricate or difficult in them; they don't abound in number, there
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:002987_0258_0FE6B204A4441A78"/>
are but few of them; they are not pompo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> and coſtly, and ſo are far from being difficult, or burdenſom, but may very eaſily be attended by us. They are not ſo numerous or tedious as to be any great Interruption to our worldly Buſineſs; nor are they ſo dark &amp; myſterious as to require any great Labour &amp; Pains to get a ſufficient Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them. And now there being but a few plain and eaſy Means appointed by GOD for us to attend upon, is an Inſtance of Wiſdom,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As it is an Encouragement to attend upon them, and leaves thoſe the more inexcuſable that neglect them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the proud heart of Man is ſometimes apt to deſpiſe the plainneſs &amp; ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-diſpenſation. Men are apt to be pleaſed with a Religion more pompous, and attended with more coſtly and burdenſome Ceremonies: but yet it is moſt certain that the more eaſy and plain the duties of Religion are, the more encouragement there is to attend upon them, and the leſs they have to ſay for their neglect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naaman the Syrian</hi> was offended becauſe the Prophet directed to ſo plain, ſimple and eaſy a Method of cure, as that of waſhing ſeven times in the waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi> But his Servants argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſtrongly with him for his complying with ſo eaſy a Method, ſince if he had required ſome great thing he would have done it. <hi>My Father</hi> (ſay they) <hi>if the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then when he ſaith unto thee, waſh and be clean,</hi> 2 King. 5.13. So here, if GOD had
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:002987_0259_0FE6B204C060D8F8"/>
appointed many burdenſome Ordinances as he did under the law, we ſhould have thought it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for us to attend upon them; but how much rather now they are ſo plain &amp; eaſy? What will any Perſon under the Goſpel have to plead for the neglect of the Means of Grace? Surely the plainneſs &amp; the eaſineſs of them will render them inexcuſable; and now it is Wiſdom in GOD to leave ſuch without excuſe, becauſe the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable perſons are, the more juſt and righteous will GOD appear in Judging &amp; Condemning them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The plainneſs &amp; ſimplicity of the Means, <hi>has a tendency to prevent our ſinking ſo much into meer Formality, which otherwiſe we ſhould be in danger of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more numerous and pompous the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are, the more apt Men are to reſt in the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of the duty, and loſe that temper and frame of Spirit, which is neceſſary and preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our receiving the divine Grace in and by the Ordinances. And I believe this may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be obſerved, that as where the life &amp; power of Godlineſs decreaſes, the more Ceremony and Formality in Religious Worſhip is inſiſted on: So when Religious Rites and Ceremonies prevail beyond what is Commanded, there the life and power of Religion decays: for at ſuch times Mens hearts &amp; thoughts are ſo taken up with the Form, that they leave the Subſtance; their care will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally terminate in obſerving the particular Form &amp; Mode, and when they have done that they are apt to reſt in it. And therefore GOD in his great Wiſdom preſcribes ſuch plain and ſimple Means, that we might not truſt to them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="255" facs="unknown:002987_0260_0FE6B20D228BA890"/>3. The more ſimple and plain the Means are, by which GOD brings about our Converſion, <hi>the clearer Manifeſtation there is of the Power of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD's Power is always manifeſt according to the greatneſs of the work, and according to the weakneſs of the Means that he makes uſe of therein. The treaſure of the Goſpel is, ſays the Apoſtle, committed to earthen Veſſels, to weak frail Men; to Men ſubject to like paſſions and infirmities with other Men; and what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it? <hi>That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.7.</p>
               <p>But thus much for the Means in general, and of the Wiſdom of GOD in the plainneſs, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of them.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to conſider the Inſtituted Means of Grace themſelves, and the Propriety and Suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of them, and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD in appointing theſe very Means of Grace in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Now the Means of Grace that I ſhall take particular Notice of, are, the Written Word of GOD, the publick Miniſtry of it by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, Prayer, Singing of Pſalms, Sabbaths and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Written Word of GOD is an Inſtituted Means of Grace, in which there appears very much of the Wiſdom of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the beginning of the World even until <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, there dont appear any Written Word; and the only way there was for conveying the knowledge of GOD and of Religion was by Oral Tradition: but when the Age of Man was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and there was a quicker ſucceſſion of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:002987_0261_0FE6B20D37C1C208"/>
Traditions grew ſo uncertain, that GOD ſaw it neceſſary, and did accordingly in his Wiſdom and Goodneſs provide a ſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation for his Church that ſhould be more fixed and certain, and upon which they might ſafely depend. For when he had made choice of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his own peculiar People, he wrote to them the great things of his Law. As for a Summary of the moral Law which was to be a univerſal &amp; perpetual Rule for the Church, GOD himſelf wrote it in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone; and as for that Law that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to commit it to Writing, <hi>Exod</hi> 34.27, 28. And whether Writing was ever known among Men before or no, yet we have no certain account of any ſo ancient as thoſe of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But ſince that, GOD has in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages of the Church till the Apoſtles Times, raiſed up one &amp; another, who being under the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance &amp; Inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all thoſe Books which make up the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old &amp; new Teſtament, collected in our Bibles; and now this is called the Word of GOD, becauſe it was <hi>given by Inſpiration of God: holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. And now this Word is a Method appointed and made uſe of by GOD, for the Regeneration &amp; Converſion of Sinners, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and to bring them out of the Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of the Son of GOD. Thus we find it declared to be a Means of our Regeneration, Jam. 1.18.
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:002987_0262_0FE6B21507D3BD08"/>
                  <hi>Of his own will begat be us with the word of truth.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſays with reſpect to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>That he had begotten them thro' the Goſpel</hi>; that is, the Goſpel was the Means of their Regeneration &amp; Converſion.

And we are told in general by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Rom. 10.17. <hi>That faith,</hi> or ſaving Grace, <hi>Comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> And now the Wiſdom of GOD in appointing this Word of his as the Means, or Inſtrument of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying ſaving Grace, will appear, by conſidering how well it is ſuited and adapted to anſwer the End propoſed. And now he that will but look into this perfect law of liberty, and ſearch the Scriptures thorowly, will find they are every way accommodated to their deſign, and the fitteſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that can be, in the hand of the Spirit, to promote the Regeneration &amp; Converſion of Sinners.

It informs us of our Fall and Apoſtacy in our firſt Parents, and of the wretched Eſtate &amp; Condition we were brought into thereby, and the way of Man's reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by JESUS CHRIST. Moreover, it fully informs us of what is our duty, not only in general, but of our duty in all Caſes, under all the various Stations &amp; Relations, that we ſtand in to GOD, or to one another; for in his Word he hath ſhewed

us what is good, and all that the Lord our GOD requires of us. But then the word of GOD is not only uſeful in enlightning our Minds, but it is as well adapted to perſwade our Wills. It ſets before us the evil Nature of Sin, and the fatal Conſequences of it, &amp; ſo affords the moſt powerful Arguments to repent of all our Sins, and to turn from them. Furthermore, It ſets before us the fulneſs and ſufficiency there is in Chriſt, and his readineſs to receive us, and at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to us our wretched and undone condition without an Intereſt in him: which muſt needs be the moſt powerful arguments to encourage &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to go to him for Life, and to place all our dependence upon him. Moreover, do we need to be excited and perſwaded unto our Duty, to love GOD, to fear Him and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? Surely there is nothing better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to anſwer this deſign than the Goſpel: for it affords the moſt Cogent, and moving Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments herefor that can be imagined: for it not only ſets forth the Greatneſs, the Glory, and the Majeſty of the LORD, to raiſe an holy awe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us towards Him, but it ſets forth his infinite love &amp; goodneſs, eſpecially to the Children of Men in ſuch aſtoniſhing Inſtances, as muſt needs have a moſt powerful tendency to inflame our hearts in love unto him. And it ſets forth the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Religion, the excellency of the divine Commands, the obligations we are under to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, the danger of diſobeying them, the infinite advantage, and the exceeding great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in keeping them; the ſtrongeſt Motives
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:002987_0264_0FE6B21FEB4E3E20"/>
to Obedience. Nay there are no Motives nothing to work upon our Underſtanding, our Will, our Affections, our Hopes, our Fears, but we may find them in the word of GOD. In ſhort, it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>for Doctrine, for Reproof, far Correction, and for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, thorowly furniſhed for all good works.</hi> And it is able to <hi>make us wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> thro' faith in Jeſus Chriſt. And now herein appears the Wiſdom of GOD, that when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to make a revelation of Himſelf, and of the way of Salvation, and happineſs, he has done it ſo fully, as not to leave any one thing unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that is neceſſary for us to know, or that is capable of moving, and exciting us to our duty, and ſo to comply with the terms of life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſufficiency of the Scriptures for the end propoſed, ſets forth the Wiſdom of GOD therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The publick Miniſtry of the Word is another Inſtituted Means of Grace, wherein much of the Wiſdom of GOD appears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD has not only written to us the great things of his Law, and Goſpel, by which we may by a diligent ſearching of the Scriptures get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every thing neceſſary for us to know, with reſpect both to our faith &amp; practice: but beſides this, GOD has inſtituted the publick preaching of his Word. He has appointed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſolemn aſſemblies, and He has appointed an Order of Men, to preach the Word of GOD unto them. This was the buſineſs of the Apoſtles, and for which they were ſeparated, by that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:002987_0265_0FE6B22002F37A58"/>
and Command to them by our Lord, Matth. 28.19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. Or that, in Mark 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> And this is the office and buſineſs of the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this among other things is given in ſolemn Charge to them, <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon.</hi> And now that this publick preaching of the Word by an order of Men ſet apart for that purpoſe, is a Means for the Converſion of Sinners, is abundantly evident from the effects of it. No leſs than three thouſand were Converted by <hi>Peter's</hi> Sermon, after he had received the promiſe of the Father: and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are the inſtances of thoſe to whom the word preached has been quick and powerful for their Converſion, and Edification. Nay, the Apoſtle ſeems to make it abſolutely neceſſary to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or our arriving to a ſaving Faith. Rom. 10.14, 15, 17. — <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be ſent? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> And now the Wiſdom of GOD in this Inſtitution will appear if we conſider, either the publick preaching of the Word it ſelf, and the particular uſefulneſs of it, or the perſons that are imployed in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us conſider the publick preaching of the Word it ſelf, and what a tendency it has to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the deſigned End,</hi> viz. <hi>The Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; and we ſhall ſee much of the Wiſdom of GOD therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="unknown:002987_0266_0FE6B2214A747BB0"/>This is the way to have the Goſpel ſpread, and the knowledge of it prevail among a People, beyond what it would do, if nothing but Reading of it was injoyned. Moreover, this is the way to keep up and promote the Credit of the Goſpel, and of Chriſtianity among a People. This is the way to induce perſons to the profeſſion of Religion, and to the external Practice of it at leaſt. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, by the Preaching of the Word the Doctrines, and Duties of the Goſpel are more fully opened, and explained, the truth and reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them cleared up, which muſt have a mighty tendency to ſtrengthen our faith in the truth of Chriſtianity, and to quicken and encourage us to the practice of it. And then finally, the Doctrines, &amp; Duties of the Goſpel being publickly preached, come with more ſolemnity, and with greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than any other way: and for this I may appeal to the Experience of Chriſtians, whether the truths of the Goſpel delivered in a ſerious and ſolemn manner from the Pulpit, dont uſually come with more weight &amp; authority, &amp; affect you more than the ſame truths received any other way: and now the publick ſolemn preaching of the Word having a tendency thus to affect thoſe that ſit under the diſpenſation of it, ſhows the Wiſdom of GOD in the Inſtitution of it.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g the glorious Goſpel to our truſt will appear, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in the firſt place, That this is the way to have the truths of the Goſpel delivered to us in a <hi>more eaſy, familiar, and leſs terrible manner than could be any other way.</hi> If GOD ſhould ſpeak immediately from Heaven, or ſend his Goſpel to us by the Miniſtry of Angels, as he did the Law to the Children of Iſrael, we ſhould all be ready to ſay, as they did to Moſes, <hi>Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God ſpeak with us, leſt we die,</hi> Exod. 20.19. GOD has therefore conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our frame, and has committed the Goſpel-Miniſtry to ſome of our ſelves, to Men <hi>formed out of the clay,</hi> as we are, <hi>whoſe terror ſhall not make us afraid,</hi> but with whom we may converſe with freedom, and altho' we are to ſit under their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry with reverence, conſidering them as the Meſſengers of the LORD of Hoſts, yet there is nothing to terrify or affrighten us.</p>
               <p>Again, This treaſure of the Goſpel being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Earthen veſſels, to weak frail Men, ſerves <hi>to ſet forth, and make the power of GOD more Conſpicuous,</hi> when it proves Effectual for the Converſion of Sinners.</p>
               <p>The Strength of GOD is made perfect in our weakneſs. And hence ſays the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 4.7.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:002987_0268_0FE6B22E1E1DD2D8"/>
                  <hi>We have this treaſure in Earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God &amp; not of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then again, The Miniſtry of the Goſpel being committed to Men <hi>that can preach more experimentally to others than could be by any other Creatures,</hi> this muſt needs be a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their Miniſtry, and ſo diſcover the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD in appointing them.</p>
               <p>Miniſters being of the ſame frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and under the ſame common circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with other Men; they feel the ſame workings of Corruption, and the ſame workings of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pirit of GOD within them, they meet with the ſame ſnares, and are in all things tempted as other Men, have the ſame failings, infirmities and imperfections, and are to have the ſame work of Grace wrought upon them, and ſo are brought into a Converted, and ſaving State, after the ſame manner that other Men are. And now this muſt needs give great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their Preaching, and wonderfully enable them to adapt and accommodate their diſcourſes to the circumſtances of their hearers. For if a Miniſter does, and every good Miniſter will, frame his diſcourſes very much from his own Experience, he will be ſure of ſuiting the Caſes of many others; for Miniſters and People have the ſame Corruptions, and meet with the ſame Temptations, and doubtleſs, do very often feel the very ſame workings of their Spirits within them. And upon this account, I think I may venture to ſay, That a good Experienced Chriſtian endowed with the ordinary Miniſterial
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:002987_0269_0FE6B22E3234D438"/>
gifts, is better qualified for a Preacher to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, than an Angel from Heaven: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we muſt allow them to be Creatures of much greater Sagacity and wiſdom than Men, yet they have never experienced the workings of a corrupt Nature wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they never knew what it was to endure the Divine Deſertion, or to have the light of GOD's Countenance hid from them, they never knew what it is to be under Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo never experienced the workings of their Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under ſuch Circumſtances: and therefore cant be ſuppoſed to ſpeak ſo feelingly and experimentally, if ſo intelligently, about thoſe things as an Experienced Miniſter, who has felt all theſe things in his own Soul.</p>
               <p>Once more, Miniſters of the Goſpel (if they are as they ought to be) have this advantage, to <hi>give a Specimen or Example if that Religion they recommend to others, in their own lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now their Example is advantagious upon two accounts Namely, that it gives Credit to Religion, by aſſuring their Hearers that they believe what they teach them, and are under the Influence of thoſe Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts they recommend to them. And then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ſhews them that the Religion taught them is practicable, becauſe they ſee ſuch as are under the ſame Corruption, and expoſed to the ſame Temptations, in the practice of it. And this advantage we ſhould loſe if we had Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſent immediately from Heaven unto us. For an Angel from Heaven altho' he be perfectly pure and holy, yet his Example would not be ſo Influential on Mankind as one from among
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:002987_0270_0FE6B230823F0ED8"/>
our ſelves. For if one of thoſe pure &amp; ſpotleſs Spirits ſhould deſcend, and preach up a holy life, and urge it among other things from his own Example, the argument would not be ſo likely to affect us: We ſhould be ready to think that the holineſs he recommends may do for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick order, for thoſe that have no principles of Corruption, and are perfected in holineſs; but we ſhould ſee ſo much Sin &amp; Corruption in our ſelves, as that we ſhould be diſcouraged from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the Imitation of ſuch pure &amp; holy ones.</p>
               <p>But then, as the Wiſdom of GOD appears in appointing Men, and not any other Creature, to Preach the Word, ſo does it alſo appear in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, and fixing upon a certain order of Men for that purpoſe, whom he raiſes up and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies for it. Are all Prophets? Are all Apoſtles? are all Teachers? No, for all are not called, to it, nor qualified for it. And none may take this Office upon them but they that are called of GOD unto it. And now the Wiſdom of GOD in this is very manifeſt: for it is very neceſſary that thoſe who undertake to teach the great Doctrines, and Duties of the Goſpel, ſhould give themſelves wholly to the Study of them. So every Man could not attend upon it, becauſe there are other affairs that muſt of neceſſity be carried on. And therefore GOD in his Wiſe &amp; ſovereign Providence ſo over-rules the hearts, and diſpoſitions of Men, as to incline ſome to one Calling, and ſome to another, for the good order, and comfortable carrying on of the affairs of the World. And ſome he inclines and diſpoſes to be Studying, &amp; thereby accompliſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:002987_0271_0FE6B230975DDF60"/>
and then puts them into the Miniſtry: And having ordained that they who Preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel; and that they who are taught in the Word ſhould Communicate to him that teacheth in all good things: He has hereby made proviſion for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they ſhould give themſelves wholly to the Study, &amp; Miniſtry of the Word. And ſurely in this way GOD has wiſely contrived for the good of his Church. For in this way proviſion is made for the Churches of Chriſt to be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with burning and ſhining lights, with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtors, able Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhall feed the People with knowledge, and underſtanding. Whereas if this ſacred Office was in Common, and every Man might upon every occaſion as he plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, undertake to be a Preacher of the Goſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, we may conclude the knowledge of the Scriptures, eſpecially of the weighty, ſublime, and difficult parts of it would not be upheld among a People, but they would be in the utmoſt hazard of being ſeduced into ſome fatal Errors and Miſtakes or other: for if all undertook to be guides, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there would be but blind guides. And our Saviour has told us, what would be the ſad Effect of that: Namely, <hi>That if the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch,</hi> Mat. 15.14.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the Wiſdom of GOD in Inſtituting a publick Miniſtry of the Word in order to the Converſion of Sinners. I may not proceed at preſent to conſider the other Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Means of Grace, but ſhall Conclude with a word or two by way of APPLICATION.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="267" facs="unknown:002987_0272_0FE6B23C34A7B0C8"/>1. <hi>What an infinite Priviledge do they Enjoy, who Enjoy the Goſpel</hi>!</p>
               <p>Is the Word of GOD an Inſtituted Means of Grace? Is the deſign of it to Convert Men, and bring them out of a State of Nature into a State of Grace? And is it ſo well adapted to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and ſo ſufficient every way as an Inſtrument to anſwer the End propoſed, ſurely then it is the greateſt outward priviledge we can enjoy. They that are without the word, are periſhing for lack of Viſion; whereas they that Enjoy the Goſpel, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that which is able to make them wiſe unto Salvation. Is it ſo well accommodated to inlighten our Minds in the knowledge of Chriſt, and of his will; is it ſo effectual an Inſtrument to perſwade our wills, to work upon our hopes, and fears, and upon every faculty within us? Surely then ſuch are lifted up even unto Heaven in priviledges, that Enjoy the Goſpel; and of ſuch a People it may be ſaid, <hi>What could God do more,</hi> on outward accounts, <hi>than he has done unto them</hi>? And now ſince we are ſo highly favoured of the Lord, how ſhould our hearts be inlarged in thankfulneſs towards him? how ſhould we adore the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign diſtinctions of divine Grace, that when he has hid his Goſpel from the greateſt part of the World, he has revealed it unto us, only becauſe it has ſeemed good in his ſight. And now let us ſee to it that we walk worthy of this infinite Priviledge, by living as this Grace of GOD which has appeared unto us teaches us, even to deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the preſent World.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="268" facs="unknown:002987_0273_0FE6B23C4D52F708"/>2. Is the written Word appointed by GOD as a Means of Grace? Let us then <hi>diligently Read the holy Scriptures,</hi> and teach them to our Children. Chriſt bid his Diſciples, ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for ſearching the Scriptures daily, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Timothy</hi> is commended, in that from a Child he had known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make Men wiſe unto Salvation thro' faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.15. Let us then give attendence to Reading: ſo ſhall we be in the way of the Bleſſing pronounced on the Man, whoſe delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates therein day and night. Pſal. 1.3. <hi>He ſhall be like a Tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon. His leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper.</hi> And let us inſtruct our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the word of GOD. Deut. 6.6, 7. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart. And thou ſhalt teach them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou lieſt, down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Is the Publick Miniſtry of the Word Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by GOD as a Means of Converſion and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>? Hence, we may learn ſeveral things. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That People ought diligently to Attend upon the Publick Preaching of the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if GOD has Ordained and Commanded the Word to be Preached, it neceſſarily implies the duty of People to Attend upon the Preaching
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:002987_0274_0FE6B23D8E63F1D8"/>
of it: It is therefore the Indiſpenſable Duty of all who have the Opportunity for it to hear the Word, and to take heed how they hear. We may not neglect the Publick Worſhip of GOD's Houſe for any frivolous or trifling Excuſe, but ſhould rejoyce at the revolution of ſuch bleſſed ſeaſons, wherein we may hear the Word of Life, and have the glad tidings of Salvation ſounding in our ears. It is the benefit of the Hearers eſpecially, that is propoſed in the Preaching of the Word, it is their Converſion &amp; Edification that is aimed at therein. It is making uſe of the Means GOD has appointed, and a putting our ſelves in the way of GOD's Grace. To ſit under the diſpenſation of the Word, this is the way to receive a bleſſing from the Lord, even righteouſneſs from the GOD of our Salvation. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the Poſts of my doors,</hi> ſays Wiſdom, Prov. 8.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They ought to take Effectual Care for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Goſpel-Miniſtry among them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if ſome particular perſons art to be ſet apart for this ſacred, and important Office, and to devote themſelves entirely to the Miniſtry of the Word, ſurely they ought to be Supported and Provided for, becauſe it is not ſuppoſed that they ſhould divert to ſecular Affairs to provide for themſelves and for their families. And therefore ſince GOD has not only appointed ſuch an order of Men, but has alſo ordained, that they who <hi>Preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> Surely thoſe that live under their Miniſtry, ſhould take care that this Ordinance of the Goſpel ſhould be complyed with.
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:002987_0275_0FE6B23DA3451D20"/>
For as the Apoſtle argues upon it, 1 Cor. 9.11. <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Candidates for the Miniſtry ſhould give diligence to be prepared for ſo high, &amp; holy a Calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The buſineſs you are deſigned for, is of the greateſt Importance of any in the World. It is a Calling Inſtituted by Chriſt, to open Mens eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD. Surely then the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Attainments in Knowledge and Grace, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to accompliſh you for ſuch an important Service. And now what does this ſuggeſt unto you as your duty, but that you apply your ſelves unto your Studies with the utmoſt diligence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Study of the holy Scriptures, which you are to open and explain to others? You are to be the Prieſts of the Lord, whoſe lips are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Knowledge: And the People are to ſeek the Law and Goſpel at your Mouths; ſurely then you ought to give utmoſt diligence to get well acquainted with the great Doctrines and Duties of Chriſtianity, and to be mighty in the Scriptures. But then, as I obſerved, it is highly requiſite, and renders the Preaching of the Goſpel very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, to have the Preachers of it ſpeak Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, feeling the workings of Sin &amp; Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then the workings of Grace in their own Souls, and ſhew that they feel the weight &amp; force of thoſe Truths they offer to others, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

a Speculative, but a Saving, Experimental acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Divine Things. Surely you ſhould pray and ſtrive with all your might, that the work of Grace may be wrought in your own Souls, which you are Inſtrumentally to work in the Souls of others. This it the way to have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſign of this bleſſed Inſtitution of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry anſwered by you. This is the way for you to come in the fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt unto the People that GOD ſhall ſend to you, and to have the pleaſure of the LORD proſpering in your hands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This might be Improved by Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>to Encourage them in, and prompt them to the faithful diſcharge of their Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For conſidering the Goſpel Miniſtry is of Divine Inſtitution, when any are called of GOD to that Office, they may depend upon his preſence and bleſſing to accompany his own Ordinance; nay, it is no more than Chriſt has aſſured them of, when he told his Apoſtles, <hi>That he would be with them always to the End of the World,</hi> Mat. 28.20. But then the conſideration, that the deſign of their Office and Miniſtry is to Convert Sinners, and Edify Saints, ſhould put them upon doing their u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>moſt, that the End of their Office may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Here I might ſay, that Miniſters ought to undertake the Miniſtry of the Word not for any carnal, worldly ſiniſter deſigns, but to anſwer the End of their Inſtitution, which is the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sinners, and having engaged in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they ſhould give themſelves wholly to it; they muſt be diligent in their Studies, earneſt and
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:002987_0277_0FE6B24712CDCFF0"/>
frequent in their Prayers; they muſt in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word give to every one their portion in due ſeaſon; they muſt teach, exhort, and rebuke with all long-ſuffering, and doctrine, and eſpecially muſt they be Examples to their Flocks in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity. And this is the way and the only way for them to Convert Sinners from the Error of their ways, and ſo to anſwer the End of their Miniſtry, and thereby make the Wiſdom as well as the Goodneſs of GOD appear Conſpicuous in inſtituting ſuch an Office, and ſuch an Order of Men among us.</p>
               <p>But to conclude at preſent,</p>
               <p>Let us look upon our ſelves to be advantaged above the greateſt part of the World much every way, <hi>but chiefly for that unto us are committed the Oracles of GOD.</hi> And now as we would adore the Wiſdom of GOD in writing the great things of his Law and Goſpel unto us, and in ſending forth his Embaſſadors to Preach the everlaſting Goſpel, and ſhew Men the way to Salvation; ſo let us adore the ſovereign Goodneſs &amp; Grace of GOD to us, that the lines are fallen to us in ſo pleaſant a place, and that he has given us ſo goodly an heritage; that he has given us his Word to be a lamp to our feet, and as a light unto our paths, and his Miniſters to guide our feet in the way of peace; verily he hath not dealt ſo with many other Nations: for as for his Statutes, and his Judgments they have not known them. And now ſince we Enjoy ſuch precious Means of Grace, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is expected from us, &amp; what will become
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:002987_0278_0FE6B2486B549720"/>
of us, if we ſhould neglect to improve the price that is put into our hands to get Wiſdom and Grace. Let us conſider that our being lifted up to Heaven with Privileges, will be only the means of aggravating our Guilt, and ſo of ſinking us the deeper into the bottomleſs Pit, if we don't Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them aright. Let us take the Apoſtle's Advice &amp; conſider the Argument with which he inforces it, Heb. 2. beg. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip: for if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and every tranſgreſſion &amp; diſobedience recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a juſt recompence of reward, How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was Confirmed to us by thoſe that heard him!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then take heed leſt we receive the Grace of GOD in vain; but let us do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that the Word and the Miniſtry of it which we have ſet under all our Days, may anſwer the Ends of their Inſtitution upon us, and if once we come to be Converted and brought into a State of Grace by the Word and the Preaching of it, then we ſhall riſe in our Eſteem of it and of thoſe that diſpenſe it unto us. The Language of a Soul Converted by the Word of GOD will be like that in Pſal. 19.7.10. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, Converting the Soul: the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple: more to be deſired are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold, ſweeter alſo than honey, and the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.</hi> And as the Converted Soul, the Soul that
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:002987_0279_0FE6B248850B59F0"/>
has felt the Power of the Word will thus prize it; ſo will ſuch highly prize and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thoſe who in Chriſt's Name diſpenſe it unto them; who ſhould eſteem them very highly in Love for their Works ſake, eſpecially ſuch as have been any way Inſtrumental to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or Edification; and we ſhall be ready to break forth in the words of the Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iſa. 52.7. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publiſheth Salvation, that ſaith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth</hi>!</p>

For the Wiſdom of GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as much in appointing proper Means to anſwer the End propoſed, as in propoſing proper Ends. I now proceed to conſider ſome other Inſtituted Means of Grace, the ſuitableneſs and
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:002987_0280_0FE6B2556302C4C0"/>
ſufficiency of them to anſwer the Ends propoſed, and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD in them.</p>
               <p>So then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>PRAYER is an Inſtituted Means of Grace, wherein we may ſee the Wiſdom of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Prayer I can't pretend to deſcribe it better than I have it done to my hands, in that Excellent Catechiſm we have in common Uſe among us. Namely,</p>
               <p>That <q>It is an Offering up of our Deſires to GOD for things agreable to his Will in the Name of CHRIST, with Confeſſion of our Sins, and thankful Acknowledgment of his Mercies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now that Prayer is Inſtituted &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by GOD, appears from the whole current of Scripture, where this is conſidered as an Act of religious Worſhip due to GOD, and what he expects &amp; requires at our hands, and is angry with thoſe that reſtrain Prayer before him; yea and threatens to pour out his Fury upon them that Call not upon his Name; and where he alſo declares himſelf delighted with, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the Prayers and Praiſes of the Upright. But then beſides ſuch plain Intimations of the Duty of Prayer, we find it expreſly required and demanded of us, Eph. 6.18. <hi>Praying always with all Prayer, and Supplication in the Spirit.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. <hi>Pray without Ceaſing.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>I will that Men Pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath &amp; doubting.</hi> And now that this Duty of Prayer is an Inſtituted Means of Grace, or that in the way of this Duty we are
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:002987_0281_0FE6B2557618B970"/>
to obtain the regenerating and ſaving Grace of GOD, is evident from the encouraging Promiſes to ſuch as attend this Duty in a right manner. For thus ſays our Saviour, Matth 7.7, 8. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you: Seek and ye ſhall find: Knock and it ſhall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi> So Joh. 16.23. <hi>Verily, Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</hi> But then the holy Spirit in a particular manner, (by which alone regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſanctifying Grace is wrought in the Soul,) is to be obtained in the way of Prayer, Luk. 11.13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Accordingly the Apoſtle Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to <hi>Come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16. And now Prayer is ſo neceſſary to our receiving, that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining without it. <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not,</hi> James 5.2.</p>
               <p>And now GOD's obliging us to give our ſelves unto Prayer, in order to our obtaining the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace of GOD and to have it carried on in Sanctification, is an Inſtance of Wiſdom, becauſe nothing is more proper in general than that Divine Grace ſhould be ſought for in order to its being obtained. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THIS is the way to have the Fountain of all Grace ſuitably honoured, and acknowledged by us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="unknown:002987_0282_0FE6B25702355690"/>By our applying our ſelves to GOD in a way of Prayer for renewing &amp; ſanctifying Grace, we profeſs and acknowledge him to be not only the Father of all Mercies; but the GOD of all Grace: and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is acknowledged as the meritorious Cauſe of all. Our going to GOD in a way of Prayer for his Grace, plainly implies our belief that he has it to beſtow, and our Coming in the Name of Chriſt, is a practical Acknowlegment that he has purchaſed this Grace for us, and that it is only thro' him that it may be obtained. And accordingly if we obtain the Grace of GOD upon our ſeeking to him for it in a way of Prayer, we ſhall be the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led to give him the Glory of it. When Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace or ſanctifying Grace comes as the Anſwer of our Prayers, we ſhall plainly ſee, and ſo ſhall readily acknowledge, that it is not of our ſelves, but the gift of GOD. And now ſince all Grace is derived from GOD thro' Chriſt, there is all the reaſon in the world that he ſhould have the glory of it, and therefore it is wiſely &amp; prudently Contrived when he inſiſts upon being ſought unto, and inquired of to do it for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By Prayer we Expreſs a Senſe of our being deſtitute of the Grace of GOD, and our deſires of it, which is very proper and ſuitable in order to our receiving the Divine Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very proper and neceſſary that every one in order to his obtaining the ſpecial and ſaving Grace of GOD, ſhould be ſenſible that by Nature he is entirely deſtitute of it, that <hi>in
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:002987_0283_0FE6B25716448408"/>
him</hi> naturally, <hi>that is in his Fleſh, there dwells no good thing</hi>: and it is highly proper we ſhould be ſenſible of the Worth &amp; Excellency of Divine Grace, of the abſolute Need we ſtand in of it, and that we expreſs our deſires of it, becauſe by this means upon our obtaining the Grace of GOD, we ſhall be led not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge GOD as the Author of all Grace, but ſhall acknowledge his beſtowing it upon us with Thankfulneſs, we ſhall look upon it as an Infinite Kindneſs, and ſo ſhall have our Hearts inlarged in Love and Gratitude unto GOD the Giver thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Prayer is a Means of Grace very proper and ſuitable, as it ſerves to diſpoſe and prepare our Hearts to receive the Divine Grace, and to put the ſame into Exerciſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prayer has a tendency to open the Heart, to ſoften it, and thereby fit it to receive the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of divine Grace: the making it our conſtant Practice to ſeek to GOD for his Grace to Renew &amp; Sanctify us, leads us to think of the Excellency and the Neceſſity of it, and this will have a tendency to excite our Deſires after it: and thoſe Deſires if we ſhould not ſuppoſe them to be Grace, yet they open and prepare the Heart to receive it, and will put us upon uſing our Endeavours, in a diligent and careful Attendance upon the Means of Grace in order to our obtaining it, until at length we find &amp; feel the Grace of GOD working within us. This we may doubtleſs have Experienced, that by Exerciſing our ſelves in the Duty of
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:002987_0284_0FE6B25EC47013F0"/>
Prayer holy &amp; gracious Deſires have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited within us, which have grown to holy Purpoſes and Reſolutions, till indeed the Habits of Grace have been rooted in our Souls. He that Prays with that earneſtneſs &amp; fervency that he ought, will find that the very Praying for any Grace in particular, is very helpful to the Exerciſe of it. Thus for Inſtance does a Man Pray that he may Love GOD, he will find that his very Praying for this, and the Arguments that occur to his own Mind, and which he pleads with GOD for it, will help very much to put him in the Exerciſe of Love unto him. The very Praying that he may Love the Lord his GOD with all his Heart, will very much help to inlarge his Heart in Love unto him, he will find his Affections ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and inflamed by the very Petition. And thus we ſhall find it with reſpect to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grace we Pray for, or any particular Sin &amp; Luſt that we Pray againſt. And the ſame may be ſaid with reſpect to the other Parts of Prayer. Such as Confeſſion of Sins, which ſerves to bring our Sins to our Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſo to prepare and diſpoſe our Hearts to Repentance for them, and watchfulneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. So again the Calling to Mind GOD's Mercies, helps to enlarge our Hearts in Love &amp; thankfulneſs to him. And then laſtly, our Interceſſions for others, helps to excite our Charity towards them we Pray for. So that Prayer, if it be duly &amp; carefully attended, has a natural tendency, aptitude and fitneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:002987_0285_0FE6B25ED9E09A70"/>
ſaving Grace into the Soul, or to put it into Exerciſe, which ſhews ſomething of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD in obliging us to give our ſelves unto Prayer in order to our obtaining the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Grace of GOD, and to continue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in order to our growth in Grace, and our advancement to further degrees of Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>SINGING of Pſalms, Hymns &amp; ſpiritual Songs is an Inſtituted Means of Grace, very proper and ſuitable for the End,</hi> and ſo diſcovers the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD therein.</p>
               <p>Under the Law, not only Vocal, but Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick was directed to in the Worſhip of GOD. And hence we find the devout Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in the height of his Devotion frequently Calling, as in the 150th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> upon the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the Pſaltery, the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rp, the Timbrel, the Organs, and all Inſtruments of Muſick to praiſe the Lord And altho' under the Evangelical Diſpenſation which is much more Spiritual, and has much leſs of Pomp &amp; Ceremony in it, than the Legal Diſpenſation; there is no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for Inſtruments of Muſick to be uſed in the Worſhip of GOD; yet there is expreſs Direction for Vocal Muſick, that is for tuning our Voices in Songs of Praiſe to GOD. Thus we find in the New Teſtament expreſs Precepts and Counſels for Singing Pſalms to GOD, and particular Directions how, and when it is to be performed by us. Thus, Eph. 5.19. <hi>Speaking to your ſelves in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, Singing &amp; making Melody in your Hearts to the Lord.</hi> So, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. almoſt the ſame
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:002987_0286_0FE6B26111005350"/>
words. And the Apoſtle directs us as to the manner of it, when he tells us what his own Reſolution was, namely, that he would <hi>Sing with the Spirit, and with the Understanding,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15. Furthermore, We have ſome general Direction as to Times &amp; Seaſons for this Duty in <hi>James</hi> 5.13. Is any afflicted, let him Pray: <hi>Is any merry, let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> By all which it appears that Singing of Pſalms and ſpiritual Songs is a part of Divine Worſhip under the Goſpel as well as under the Law, and to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by all that profeſs the Name of Chriſt, and that as a Means of Grace, an Ordinance in which GOD does ſometimes convey his Grace unto the Soul And now the Propriety &amp; Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of it, and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD in appointing it, will appear, if we conſider in general <hi>the Conſtitution of our Natures, how cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ſenſitive &amp; intellectual Powers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together, and how much they depend upon, and are influenced by each other, in their Motions and Operations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt conſider our ſelves compounded of Body as well as Spirit, and as having bodily and ſenſitive Organs, as well as rational and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Faculties: and theſe ſenſitive &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Powers are ſo blended together in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſtitution, that they very much affect each other, and depend upon each other in their ſeveral Affections &amp; Operations. And now, As Singing or making a melodious Voice does greatly affect and pleaſe our Senſes, particularly our Hearing, ſo it ſerves as we find
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:002987_0287_0FE6B26125AD9588"/>

                  </gap>n conſidering that the Matter &amp; Subject to be ſung with ſuch a melodious Voice are holy Pſalms and ſpiritual Songs, it ſerves to turn that Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit into a religious channel, and to excite an holy Joy and devout Affections: our Singing ſpiritual Songs ſo ſublimates and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualizes our Affections, as that our Joy is in the Lord, and our rejoicing in the GOD of our Salvation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d now many of you can doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs teſtify to the Truth of this from your own Experience, that the tuning the Voice in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Muſick ſerves wonderfully to ſtir up your Affections: and if they have been holy Songs that have been ſung, they have ſtirred up holy &amp; devout Affections much beyond what the bare Reading of them would have done. How much does a Pſalm ſung in harmonious Conſor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affect us beyond what the bare Reading of it would have done? And now if Singing of Pſalms be ſuch a means of ſtirring up holy and devout Affections we muſt acknowledge it a wiſe &amp; prudent thing in GOD to Inſtitute it as a Means to help forward our Converſion and Edification. For the ſtirring up of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in a holy &amp; ſpiritual manner is a great preparative for our Converſion; and when we are Converted, to carry on the work of Grace within us: for when the Affections are once ſtirred up and engaged, they ſerve very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to inlighten the Mind, to perſwade the Will,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:002987_0288_0FE6B26A9BDA3FC0"/>
to remove diſcouragements, and to ſtrengthen every pious &amp; good Reſolution of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The</hi> SABBATH, <hi>or the ſetting apart one Day in ſeven from worldly Buſineſs, for the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Worſhip &amp; Service of GOD,</hi> is an Inſtituted Means of Grace, wherein much of the Wiſdom of GOD appears.</p>
               <p>This GOD ordained from the beginning, that one Day in ſeven ſhould be ſeparated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his immediate Service. GOD finiſhed his Work of Creation in Six Days, and he reſted the ſeventh Day, and GOD bleſſed it, and ſanctifyed it for himſelf. Gen. 2.3. <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh Day, and ſanctified it, becauſe that he had rested from all his work which he had created and made</hi> So early as this was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sabbath; and GOD renewed the Inſtitution of it, when he made it one of thoſe Ten Words or Commandments which he delivered in ſuch an awful &amp; glorious manner upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. 20.8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy: Six Days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the ſeventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt do no manner of Work,</hi> &amp;c. And as this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is founded upon a particular Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> GOD's working Six Days in the Creation of the World, and then Reſting the Seventh Day and Bleſſing it; ſo this is a reaſon that holds for one as well as for another; for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as well as Jews: and upon that account we are all as much obliged to keep a Sabbath as they; that is, one Day in ſeven: if not the
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:002987_0289_0FE6B26AAF4D8710"/>
particular Day; for ſo far it is a moral Precept founded on reaſons perpetually &amp; univerſally obliging. But then as to the particular Day of the ſeven, That is but a poſitive Inſtitution; and for particular Reaſons may be changed. Accordingly ever ſince the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, which was on the Firſt Day of the Week, that Day is fixed upon for the Chriſtian Sabbath, as the ſeventh Day of the Week was for the Jewiſh Sabbath. And this is a Day wherein we are to ſeparate our ſelves from the World, the Cares and the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of it, except what is of Neceſſity &amp; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and Imploy the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now GOD's appointing one Day in ſeven to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the World to the Duties of Religion, is a Means of Grace wherein much of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD appears, becauſe it <hi>has ſuch a happy tendency to promote the work of Converſion and Sanctification within us.</hi> For he that conſiders any thing will be ſenſible that it is abſolutely neceſſary for us in order to our Converſion, and the progreſs of Grace in Sanctification, that our Minds ſhould at ſome particular Times be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the World, the Buſineſs &amp; Cares of it, and fixed upon the things that are Divine, that are heavenly and of a ſpiritual Nature. We muſt have time to think not only of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for our Bodies; but alſo to think how to ſecure the Salvation of our Souls. And we all know too well by Experience that when we are engaged in worldly Buſineſs, we can't
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:002987_0290_0FE648B2DE55B770"/>
attend the Buſineſs of Religion and of our Souls to any purpoſe: We find that when our Hands are engaged in worldly Buſineſs, our Heads and our Hearts will be very much taken up about the ſame, inſomuch that whatever thoughts of GOD or of Religion ariſe in our Minds at ſuch a Time, they are very diſtracted, broken &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, ſeldom or never ripen ſo as to produce any good Purpoſes, much leſs to produce any good Practices. So that we our ſelves, if we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon working out the Salvation of our Souls, ſhould think it highly neceſſary to ſet ſome time apart from our ſecular Affairs to attend that Buſineſs. And becauſe we ſhould find our ſelves very apt, from the hurries of worldly Buſineſs, to poſtpone, and put off the time with the hopes of being more at leiſure, and having a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Opportunity for it; and when that time we allotted upon comes, ſhall find ſomething elſe to interrupt &amp; hinder us: I ſay we ſhould find our ſelves ſo apt to defer &amp; put off the Buſineſs of Religion, that our own Reaſon would tell us, that if ever we intended to purſue the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion &amp; Salvation to any purpoſe, we muſt not leave the Times for the Exerciſes of Religion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, and at uncertainties; but muſt ſix upon ſome certain, ſtated Times, wherein to attend that Buſineſs, and not ſuffer our ſelves (unleſs upon ſome extraordinary Occaſions) to be diverted or hindred from it. Our own reaſon upon a little Experience of our ſelves would ſuggeſt this to be very neceſſary Accordingly this is a Caſe that GOD has wiſely conſidered, and has ſtated
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:002987_0291_0FE6B26CE6164A38"/>
and fixed ſome certain Times for his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Service, &amp; attendance upon religious Duties. He has not left it variable &amp; uncertain, for every one to appoint a time for themſelves as it would ſuit their particular Occaſions; ſome one Day, and ſome another; but he has fixed a certain Time, a particular Day for all to Imploy in ſpiritual Exerciſes, which every one knowing may order their Affairs accordingly. And as there was Wiſdom in having the Time fixed and ſtated, ſo the proportion of time ſet apart for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſes is a further Inſtance of Divine Prudence; <hi>namely, A Seventh part of Time.</hi> GOD in appointing but one Day in Seven, has graciouſly accommodated himſelf to the preſent Circumſtances of Men: for the Sabbaths are not ſo frequent, nor do they take up ſo much of our Time, but that every Man may eaſily ſpare ſuch a proportion from his Secular Occaſions to attend the Service of GOD, and of his Soul; and it leaves Men utrerly inexcuſable, that look upon the Sabbath as a burden, and neglect to ſanctify it as they ought, by reſting from all worldly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments &amp; Recreations. For when GOD who is the Lord of our Time, and has a right to us, and to all our Service, allows ſix Days for our own Imployment, it muſt needs be very baſe &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to deny him the religious Services of the Seventh. But then on the other hand it was Wiſdom in GOD not to ſet the Sabbaths at a greater diſtance from each other. For he knew what Carnal and Earthly Hearts we have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, and how apt we are while imployed in
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:002987_0292_0FE6B276DB2E7730"/>
worldly Buſineſs to have our Affections ingroſſed thereby, and that if the Revolutions of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath were more ſeldom, wherein we were to be called off from worldly Buſineſs &amp; worldly Cares, we ſhould quickly ſink into ſuch a worldly Frame of Spirit, that we ſhould not without the utmoſt difficulty be recovered out of it. We all find by Experience that while we are purſuing our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſs, the World and the things of it ſteal our Affections, and we grow ſo cold, careleſs and unconcern'd about Religion and the grand Affairs of our Souls, that we need to be taken off from our worldly Buſineſs, at leaſt once a Week to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in religious Exerciſes in a ſet &amp; ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to prevent our Souls cleaving unto the duſt, and to elevate and raiſe them up to the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of, and delight in things more noble and truly Excellent.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, The Sabbaths ought to be ſo near together as that with proper and ſuitable Care the Word we Read or Hear, and the Ordinances we attend, may in ſome good meaſure be retained by us for our uſe until the return of another, which we could not ſuppoſe if there was a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance between them. In ſhort, A Sabbath ſeems to be abſolutely neceſſary for the begetting, ſupporting &amp; advancing Religion among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it ſeems as if not only the Life &amp; Power, but the very form &amp; ſhew of Religion would ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fail, if the Keeping of a Sabbath Day ſhould be laid aſide: and therefore it muſt needs be an Inſtance of Wiſdom, as well as Goodneſs in GOD to appoint a Sabbath, and at ſuch diſtance as
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:002987_0293_0FE6B276EE4801D8"/>
that every Man may eaſily ſpare the time from his outward Affairs to attend upon them, and yet ſo near together, as that the good Impreſſions that are made upon our Mind on one, may with Care remain till the return of another.</p>
               <p>I might go on, and ſhow the Wiſdom of GOD in Inſtituting ſolemn Aſſemblies for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, together with the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, from the ſuitableneſs of them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Intention: But I muſt leave the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them at preſent, becauſe I think what has been already ſaid ought not to paſs without ſome particular</p>

                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>So then in the firſt place,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What we have heard concerning the Duty of Prayer, and of it's being a Means of Grace, teaches us, That if ever we would obtain the Converting and Saving Grace of GOD, we muſt</hi> give our ſelves unto Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Since GOD has appointed it as a Means by which he will convey his Grace &amp; Spirit to us, there is all the reaſon in the world that it ſhould be attended by us. Since Converting Grace is to be obtained in the way of Prayer, and it can't be expected without it, ſurely we ſhould <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ceaſing,</hi> and ſhould <hi>Pray always with all Prayer,</hi> even with all Kinds of Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and Private or Family, and Secret or Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We ſhould attend upon</hi> Publick <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prayer is a part of that publick Worſhip that is to be paid to GOD in his Houſe; hence his
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:002987_0294_0FE6B2780BFD36C0"/>
Houſe is called an <hi>Houſe of Prayer,</hi> Iſa. 56.7. We muſt therefore go into GOD's Tabernacle and worſhip at his Footſtool: we muſt joyn the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of GOD's People, in offering up our united Prayers &amp; Supplications to the GOD of all Grace, for the beſtowing his Grace &amp; Spirit upon us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt attend</hi> Family-<hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt ſee to it that our Families be ſuch as <hi>Call upon the Name of the Lord</hi>: Our Houſes muſt be Houſes of Prayer: Our Families little Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for Divine Worſhip; with whom we are to Implore the divine Grace &amp; Spirit to be afforded to us, and to our Children &amp; Servants, that we and they may be renewed by divine Grace, and ſo made the Children and Servants of GOD by Regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But then beſides this, <hi>There is</hi> Cloſet <hi>or</hi> Secret <hi>Prayer to be attended by us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we pray we muſt <hi>enter into our Cloſet, and when we have ſhut the Door, muſt pray to our Father that is in Secret, and our Father that ſets in Secret ſhall reward us openly</hi>; as our Saviour himſelf aſſures us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                  <p>And now, If we would <hi>obtain Mercy &amp; find Grace to help in time of need</hi>; we muſt be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in our Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace: No Day ſhould paſs without our fervent Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Heaven both in the Morning and the Evening of it. Nay the Practice of the devout Pſalmiſt is very commendable, and ſhould be Imitated by thoſe whoſe Buſineſs will allow of it: who ſays, Pſal. 55.17. <hi>Evening &amp; Morning,
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:002987_0295_0FE6B27820DB31A0"/>
and at Noon will I Pray &amp; Cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my Voice.</hi> So is that of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who notwithſtanding the Decree that was made againſt it, and the Danger he knew he run by it, of being Caſt into the Den of Lions, yet Kneeled three times a Day and prayed &amp; gave Thanks, as he did aforetime, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10, 11. Nay in ſhort, We ought always to be in a praying Frame, and ought much more frequently than this to be offering up our pious Ejaculations to GOD, even upon every Occaſion, beſides the more ſtated Times of ſolemn Prayer.</p>
                  <p>And now to move &amp; perſwade to the Practice of this Duty of Prayer, meerly from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that it is a Means of Converting ſaving Grace unto us, let us conſider two or three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The</hi> Excellency <hi>and the</hi> Neceſſity <hi>of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the one thing needful, and comprehends all other Bleſſings. This is the Reſtoration of the Divine Image, and what renders us the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of GOD's Delight &amp; Complacence, and fits us for the ſweeteſt and moſt intimate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, and for the full &amp; everlaſting Enjoyment of him. Now ſurely this is worth our ſeeking &amp; asking for. This is the Wiſdom, the Merchandize of which is better than the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of Silver, and the gain thereof than fine Gold. She is more precious than Rubies, and all the things we can deſire are not to be compared with her: She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth her. Surely then we ought to Cry after this
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:002987_0296_0FE6B27EE8AA3B88"/>
Wiſdom, and lift up our voice for Underſtanding: we ſhould ſeek for her as for Silver, and ſearch for her as for hid Treaſure. For it is infinitely Worth our taking ſuch Pains to obtain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>How</hi> reaſonable <hi>a thing it is that we ſhould apply our ſelves to GOD in a way of Prayer for his Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We could not deſire nor expect to obtain this Grace upon more eaſy terms than asking for it. There are none of us can think it reaſonable or proper that GOD ſhould beſtow his Grace upon us without a ſuitable Acknowledgment of him by humble Addreſſes &amp; Applications to him. There is nothing more juſt &amp; reaſonable than that GOD ſhould be ſought unto and <hi>Inquired of to do it for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider <hi>How</hi> Inexcuſable <hi>we ſhall be, if we remain in our Unconverted State, thro' our Neglect of Prayer to GOD for his Grace to Change us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be feared this is the Caſe of many, that they remain in a graceleſs, unconverted State, becauſe they have not ſought to GOD by Prayer for his Grace: They wickedly &amp; wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Prayer before GOD, they will rather go without the Grace of GOD than ask him for it. Or if they are not ſo ſtubborn &amp; wilful as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pray, yet thro' a ſinful Careleſneſs &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs they neglect it one time after another. Or if they ſhould ſometimes attend the outward part of the Duty yet it is only for Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake, and to ſave their Credit &amp; Reputation among Men; or to quiet &amp; ſtill their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:002987_0297_0FE6B27F00B47738"/>
without any proper deſires of the Grace of GOD: For tho' they worſhip him with their Mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hs &amp; honour him with their Lips, their Hearts are far from him. And now as ſuch Men ſhall not receive any thing from the Lord, but will remain in their graceleſs State: ſo they will be utterly Inexcuſable, they will have no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Plea for their remaining in a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and going on in a ſinful Courſe. It wont be enough for them to ſay they could not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt or Change their own Hearts; becauſe if they would have ſought to GOD aright for his Grace, they might have obtained it; for our Saviour has aſſured us, That <hi>our heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luk 11.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What we have heard of ſinging Pſalms and Spiritual Songs, as an Inſtituted Means of Grace, aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rds Matter of Reproof to ſuch who Undervalue &amp; Neglect this Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a common Thing for ſome Chriſtians to Entertain very ſlighty Tho'ts of this part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſe: they are ready to look upon it as a thing Indifferent, and ſo look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be at their liberty whether to neglect or obſerve it; and becauſe they have not a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious Voice or muſical Ear, they excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely from this part of divine Worſhip. And when the Congregation are united in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Songs of Zion, they are not only ſilent as if they were wholly unconcerned with it; but it ſeems to be loſt time to them, rather than any profitable part of religious Worſhip: for they don't find their Hearts at all moved or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:002987_0298_0FE6B28368D86FA8"/>
with it. But now ſince it is a Means of Grace that GOD has Inſtituted, we may Conclude that he will make it uſeful &amp; helpful to us in our Converſion &amp; for our Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ification. And therefore ſuch are greatly to blame &amp; juſtly to be reproved, that don't make what Improvement they can of this, as well as of the other Means of Grace. Such are to blame who don't Endeavour after ſo much Skill in Singing at leaſt as to be able to joyn with the Aſſembly in carrying on this heavenly Exerciſe: And if there ſhould be any that can't attain to this, yet they are very Criminal if they don't give diligent Attendance to what is Sung, and if they don't Endeavour as much as poſſible to have their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffections &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion ſtirred up her by. And it is not to be doubted but that if Chriſtians made more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of attending upon, or joyning in this Duty, and were more concerned to have the good deſigns of this Ordinance anſwered, it would prove much more beneficial to Chriſtians with reſpect to their advance in Grace &amp; ſpiritual Comfort &amp; holy Joy, than many of them are ſenſible of at preſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What we have heard concerning the Sabbath's being a Means of Grace, gives us all matter of Thankfulneſs that we have the free and peaceable Enjoyment of GOD's Sabbaths, and intimates to us how careful we ſhould be to Improve them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certainly an unſpeakable Privilege to have one Day in ſeven ſet apart for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD, for us to retire from the World, the Buſineſs &amp; Cares of it, and to have Time
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:002987_0299_0FE6B354F71EB3D8"/>
and Opportunity to employ our Minds upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine &amp; heavenly Subjects, and to have both Soul and Body engaged in ſpiritual &amp; heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, ſuch as praying to him, and praiſing of him, hearing &amp; reading his Word, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon him in all his holy Inſtitutions. Now we ſhould be Thankful that GOD has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Mind to us in this matter, and has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a certain Day for us to ſerve him in. And it is as evident alſo that we ſhould with the utmoſt Care &amp; Diligence be employing our ſelves upon this Day in the Buſineſs for which it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and ſet apart. The Sabbath of the Lord muſt be our delight, as well as the holy of the Lord and honourable; and we muſt honour GOD upon his Day, <hi>by not doing our own ways, nor finding our own pleaſures, nor ſpeaking our own words.</hi> Let us ſee to it that we comply with the holy &amp; gracious deſigns of GOD in appointing a Sabbath. <hi>Remember the Sabbath-Day to keep it holy,</hi> is a moral Precept, and perpetually obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, even to Chriſtians as well as Jews. And there is ſcarce any thing that GOD does more inſiſt upon, than that we ſhould <hi>ſanctify his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths &amp; reverence his Sanctuary.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee to the Sanctification of the Lord's Day, by reſting from all worldly Imployments &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, and by ſpending the Time in publick and private Exerciſes of GOD's Worſhip, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Works of Neceſſity &amp; Charity call for. And this is the way to have the ends &amp; deſigns of a Sabbath anſwered: by ſuch a religious Sanctification of the Sabbath, it will became
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:002987_0300_0FE6B360D539AF70"/>
a very powerful Means of Grace; hereby we ſhall be gradually trained up in Grace &amp; Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till we ſhall be fitted for, and brought to that Place where we ſhall celebrate an Eternal Sabbath, and poſſeſs that glorious Reſt which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the People of GOD.</p>

               <head>Sermon, XV.</head>
               <p>THE point that is yet under conſideration is the Wiſdom of GOD, that manifeſts it ſelf in the <hi>Means</hi> he has Inſtituted &amp; Appointed for us to attend upon, in order to our having the Work of Grace begun &amp; carried on in our Souls. And the Manner that I propoſed to illuſtrate the Wiſdom of GOD in the inſtituted Means of Grace, was by ſetting forth the propriety &amp; ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the Means to anſwer the End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. And this I have done already as to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them; ſuch as the <hi>written Word of GOD,</hi> the <hi>publick Miniſtry</hi> of it, <hi>Prayers, Singing of Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> the <hi>keeping of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day,</hi> or the ſetting apart one Day in Seven for the Buſineſs of Religion. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered theſe already, and ſhown the propriety and ſuitableneſs of them to prepare our Hearts for the Grace of GOD, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to carry on the Work of Grace begun in our Souls. Altho' they are inſufficient of themſelves to work ſaving Grace within us, yet they are Inſtruments in the hand of the Spirit ſo well fitted to anſwer their deſign,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:002987_0301_0FE6B360E81C3BF8"/>
that the Wiſdom of GOD very clearly ſhines in Inſtituting &amp; Appointing them.</p>
               <p>I now go on to ſay,</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Solemn</hi> Aſſemblies <hi>for Publick Worſhip, is an Inſtituted Means of Grace ſo well adapted to anſwer the End, that the Wiſdom of GOD very viſibly appears therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That GOD has appointed ſolemn Aſſemblies, holy Convocations for the worſhipping him in a publick manner is very evident from his Word; where the thing is not only plainly &amp; neceſſarily implyed, but fully expreſſed. Thus if we look back into the Jewiſh State, we ſhall find that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, even the Worſhipping GOD in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies was Inſtituted for them. Nay (as one <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Sherlock.</note> obſerves) <q>The whole of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſeems to be of a publick Nature, and to be performed in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manner. Publick Places were appointed for the Worſhip of GOD, ſuch as the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle firſt of all, and the Temple, where all the Sacrifices were brought to be offered by the Prieſts, who were publick Perſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there were publick Times of Worſhip Inſtituted by GOD for that Nation, ſuch as the ſeventh day Sabbath, the new Moons and annual Feſtivals, when all their Males were to appear three times in a Year before the Lord, which are called <hi>holy Convocations,</hi> or <hi>Aſſemblings together.</hi>
                  </q> Lev. 23. And they are called <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> &amp; <hi>ſolemn Meetings,</hi> Iſa. 1.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="unknown:002987_0302_0FE6B36202BD9D48"/>And as there were ſolemn Aſſemblies for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip under the Law, ſo are there under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, and it is a Duty plainly and neceſſarily ſuppoſed all along throughout the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>This is contained &amp; implyed in the very Name of a <hi>Church,</hi> that is given to Chriſtians; for (as the forementioned Author obſerves) <q>the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> properly ſignifys a Meeting and Aſſembly which is called together; hence he defines a Chriſtian Church to be a <hi>Society of Men united, and combined together in the faith and worſhip of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q> It is a Society that agree to worſhip GOD &amp; CHRIST, or GOD thro' CHRIST, in a united, that is a publick manner.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, ſome of the Ordinances of Chriſt were ſuch as was requiſite they ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Meeting of Chriſtians together in one Place, and ſo in a publick manner. As par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of the Lord's Supper. Accordingly we read of their <hi>coming together in the Church,</hi> and their <hi>coming together into one place,</hi> to eat the Lord's Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20.</p>
               <p>But yet to ſay no more on this head, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the Hebrews, Chap. 10.25. Expreſsly cautions and forbids, <hi>The forſaking the aſſembling of themſelves together, as the manner of ſome was.</hi> Now this prohibition neceſſarily ſuppoſes a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept to aſſemble themſelves together; and that aſſembling together could be for nothing elſe than for the publick worſhip of GOD in the ways of his appointment: their Meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to offer up their united prayers &amp; praiſes,
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:002987_0303_0FE6B362188A41D0"/>
to hear the word of the Lord diſpenſed by his Embaſſadors, to attend upon the Sacraments, to receive the Bleſſing that GOD commands in his Houſe, and the like.</p>
               <p>And now GOD's appointing and ordaining Chriſtian Aſſemblies, wherein we may in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick united manner pay our religious worſhip to him, is of ſuch a nature and tendency, both for the honour of GOD, and for the bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their own Converſion, and promoting their Sanctification, that a great deal of the Wiſdom of GOD appears therein. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby GOD has a great deal of Honour done him which is due unto his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one that conſiders who GOD is, and the relation he ſtands in to any of his Creatures, will be ſenſible that all the honour that can poſſibly be paid him by any of them, is due unto him: and it is certainly the Wiſdom of GOD to get all that honour &amp; glory from them that they are capable of rendring to him, becauſe it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt end he can propoſe. And now as every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate act of religious Worſhip is a doing honour to GOD, much more is He honoured by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick acknowledgments, and adorations that are paid unto him. When a People meet together in a ſolemn manner, and offer up their united Prayers and Praiſes to Him, it is ſuch an open, publick acknowledgment of his Infinite Being and Perfections, and of all his wondrous Works, that it ſerves very much to magnify and honour him in the face of the World; and yet it is but an honour that is juſtly due unto him. For he is
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:002987_0304_0FE6B36A87F840B0"/>
our common Father; <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi> Mal. 2.10. Surely then we ought openly to own him as ſuch, and publickly to manifeſt our honour, reverence and regard for him. He is likewiſe our common bountiful Benefactor; He beſtows upon us not only the private perſonal &amp; particular Mercies that we enjoy, but all thoſe publick Bleſſings that we enjoy in common with others. As Men are joyned and united together in Bodies or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, whether Natural, Civil or Eccleſiaſtick, ſo there are mercies &amp; favours which they need, and which they receive as ſuch a Society or Community. And ſurely there is all the reaſon in the World, that as ſuch they ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their dependance upon GOD, by uniting their prayers for the publick Mercies they need, and their praiſes for thoſe favours they have received. But it is not my buſineſs ſo much to conſider the juſtice and reaſonableneſs of publick Worſhip, as it is an honour due to GOD; but as it is an Inſtituted Means of Grace and ſo the ſuitableneſs of it to promote the Converſion, and Sanctification of Sinners.</p>
               <p>Therefore I proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Inſtituting publick Worſhip is an Inſtance of Wiſdom in GOD, as it has ſuch a wonderful aptitude and fitneſs (thro' the operations of the Spirit of GOD accompanying it) to begin and to increaſe the Work of Grace within us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what has been formerly ſaid, it appears that acts of Worſhip, ſuch as prayer, reading and hearing the Word, and the like, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

helps to Converſion, altho' performed in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate manner; but they are much more ſo when they are done in Publick Aſſemblies of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, all joyning together in divine Service And now this way of worſhipping GOD is eminently ſerviceable on theſe accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> as it gives credit to Religion, and as it gives Men an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for making an open Profeſſion of it, and alſo as it ſerves to ſtimulate, to animate and quicken us in our duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The worſhipping of GOD in a publick man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is wiſely contrived as it ſerves to give credit, and reputation to Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certainly of great advantage to the intereſt of Religion, and would very much tend to promote the ſame in and among Men, to have all bars, hindrances and impediments removed out of the way, and to have all poſſible encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to induce, and perſwade us to the embracing of it. And now conſidering how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a good Name is in it ſelf, and conſidering how naturally we deſire the honour and praiſe of Men, no outward conſideration can be more powerful to perſwade us to the external profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and practice of Religion, than its being in faſhion, its being a thing of good report and for a Man's honour to profeſs and practice it. And altho' this be a very inferiour motive to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what will by no means render our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances acceptable to GOD; yet by being brought into the practice of Religion from ſuch a conſideration, they may at length by the Spirit of GOD ſetting in be led to act from higher
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:002987_0306_0FE6B36FF52D8680"/>
and more noble Principles. And now Religion and the worſhip of GOD being carried on in a publick manner ſerves very much to give repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to it, and thereby to recommend it to our practice: for when all Men among whom we dwell make a publick profeſſion of Religion, and in a publick manner attend religious duties, they hereby declare for it, they own it, and approve of it; and ſo it can't be any ſhame or diſgrace, but an honour and reputation to a Man to be religious, nay it is a ſcandal and a reproach to a Man in ſuch a Place not to be religious. And thus we find it among our ſelves, that becauſe every Man almoſt attends upon religious Duties in a publick manner, it is ſo far from being a reproach to be religious, that ſuch are branded with infamy and diſgrace that are openly and profeſſedly Irreligious. So that this is one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of publick Worſhip, or of Religion's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried on in an open publick manner, that it prompts &amp; encourages every Man that has a regard to his credit and good name, to attend upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Publick Worſhip is a very ſuitable means of Grace, and ſo wiſely contrived, as by it <hi>we make a ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>By our joyning our ſelves with any Chriſtian aſſembly in the Worſhip of GOD, we make a profeſſion of Chriſtianity. And by every act of publick Worſhip, we openly, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the People profeſs, and declare our ſelves to be the Diſciples of JESUS CHRIST:
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:002987_0307_0FE6B3700E27CB68"/>
every time we come to the Houſe of GOD for divine Worſhip, we declare CHRIST to be our LORD and Maſter, we profeſs a ſubjection to his Laws and Ordinances, and an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his Will, as it is revealed to us in his Goſpel. We profeſs to love &amp; ſerve him, we profeſſedly &amp; in the eye of the World make a ſolemn ſurrender, and dedication of our ſelves to GOD.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a publick act of Worſhip is very proper, as it is a mighty ſpur and motive to Religion; for he that in a publick ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner profeſſes himſelf to be a Chriſtian, if he be not void of thought and conſideration, will be led to look upon himſelf under peculiar obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be religious, becauſe of his profeſſion: for if he thinks any thing of the matter, he will bethink how unreaſonable and abſurd it is to profeſs to be Chriſtians to the World, and to attend upon the external Duties, and not be Chriſtians in our hearts; he will think how abſurd it is to call Chriſt Lord, Lord, as he does by going to his Houſe &amp; Ordinances, and not be careful to do what he Commands. He will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moſt naturally be led to think how provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it muſt needs be to GOD and CHRIST to mock him, as he does when he don't live as he profeſſes and pretends by his outward Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Ordinances; and now ſurely ſuch thoughts will have a mighty tendency to ſtir Men up to ſee to it that their hearts and lives be more agreable to their profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="303" facs="unknown:002987_0308_0FE6B37C154D8D60"/>3. Publick Worſhip is very proper as <hi>it ſerves very much to quicken and ſtir up our Devotion.</hi>

When Chriſtians joyn together in the Worſhip of GOD, they ſtimulate and ſtir up one another to a higher ſtrain of Devotion, and make one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more lively, active &amp; vigorous in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD. If we are apt to be dull, lifeleſs and formal in private Duties of Religion; yet the joyning with others in thoſe Duties will oftentimes ſerve to cure us of ſloth &amp; dulneſs, and make us fervent in ſpirit when we are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord. The Pſalmiſt ſeems to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, when he was hindred from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Ordinances, by the account he gives of the joy he took in ſuch ſolemn Meetings, and by the earneſt deſires he expreſſes for his return to the enjoyment of them. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, When ſhall I come and appear before him?

Now he could in his abſence wait upon GOD in private acts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:002987_0309_0FE6B37C2989A6D8"/>
but his expreſſing ſuch longing deſires to the Courts of the Lord, muſt be (as he intimates) becauſe he ſaw more of GOD's power and glory in the Sanctuary than in the Cloſet. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may eaſily imagine that the coming with a number of GOD's People to his Houſe, and having the Prayers offered up to GOD by his Miniſters who are conſecrated to this ſacred Office, with gravity ſolemnity and importunity, and having the Word of GOD delivered by his Embaſſadors with Authority and if to theſe we add the devout poſture and countenance of the aſſembly, and all uniting together in ſhouting forth the Praiſes of GOD in Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs; I ſay, conſidering theſe things, we may eaſily imagine that there is a very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency in them to excite that awe and reverence, that ſeriouſneſs, that gravity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in our Souls, as will very much prepare them for receiving the divine Grace, and for our improvement and advancement in it when received. For when the mind is compoſed, grave and ſerious, then is a fit time for GOD to be ſetting in with his Grace, and making ſuch im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Sacraments are Inſtituted</hi> Means of Grace wherein much of the Wiſdom of GOD appears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="unknown:002987_0310_0FE6B37DA2DAE1D0"/>Now the Sacraments of the New Teſtament are <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> both of which are ſo well adapted to anſwer the end propoſed thereby, that the Wiſdom of GOD can't but appear in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Baptiſm is an instituted Means of Grace that ſerves very much to anſwer the end propoſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an Ordinance inſtituted by Chriſt in the Commiſſion he gave to his Apoſtles, Matth. 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And he that conſiders the Nature of this Ordinance, the true ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and meaning of it, will ſee a great deal of propriety &amp; ſuitableneſs in it, and that which with the bleſſing of GOD ſerves very much to prepare the heart to receive the Impreſſions of divine Grace. As for the outward ſign in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, it is the waſhing, or ſprinkling with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which in general ſignifies, and repreſents the blood of Chriſt, with all the ſaying benefits that are purchaſed therewith, &amp; are by the Spirit of GOD applyed to all true Believers. Baptiſm is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, whereby is repreſented the benefits of the Covenant, and GOD's engagement to beſtow the ſame upon us, as alſo our engagement to be the Lord's. It is an Ordinance in which we give up our ſelves to GOD in CHRIST, and whereby CHRIST and all ſaving benefits are conveyed to us: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly Baptiſm ſignifies our being ingraffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to CHRIST, our being united to him, and made Members of that body, of which he is the head,
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:002987_0311_0FE6B37DB7A915A0"/>
and ſo it ſignifies not only our obligations to him but our being in the way of deriving from him all that grace and mercy that we ſtand in need of. That waſhing or ſprinkling with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſignifies our being waſhed from our ſins in the blood of Chriſt, which is called <hi>the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> and which is ſaid to <hi>cleanſe from all ſin,</hi> Heb. 12.24. 1 Joh. 1.7. Hence ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Act. 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptiſed every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> It likewiſe ſignifies our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or new Birth. Hence we read of being <hi>born of water, and of the ſpirit,</hi> Joh. 3.5. As alſo of the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. Furthermore it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as our conforming to Chriſt in his Death, and his Reſurrection, that as he died for ſin and roſe again for our Juſtification; ſo Baptiſm ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our dying to ſin, and living to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For thus ſays the Apoſtle, Rom. 6.3, 4. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptiſed into Jeſus Christ, were baptized into his Death; therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> And now if we conſider theſe things, the outward ſign, and the things ſignifyed by Baptiſm, we ſhall ſee a great deal of ſignificancy, ſuitableneſs and propriety in the Ordinance to anſwer the ends propoſed, even to prepare and diſpoſe us to receive the Grace of GOD; and ſo the wiſdom of GOD in appointing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="unknown:002987_0312_0FE6B38C46FC3928"/>And here I might firſt of all <hi>obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and ſuitableneſs af the outward ſign made uſe of in the Ordinance,</hi> viz. <hi>Water.</hi> Now what is ſignifyed by the Ordinance, is our being waſhed and cleanſed from our ſins, from the guilt, and from the filth of them, our being purged, and purifyed from dead works to ſerve the living GOD. And what could be more ſignificant of this than Water? This is of a cleanſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore what more proper to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth from all ſin, and by which we are ſaid to be waſhed from our ſins? Moreover Chriſt is very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament under this Metaphor. Thus he is called, <hi>A well of living Waters,</hi> and <hi>Streams from Lebanon,</hi> Cant. 4.15. So, Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common than to have the holy Spirit in all the bleſſed Influences of it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us under the ſimilitude of Water. Iſai. 44.3. <hi>For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine offspring.</hi> And now what Element could be more ſignificant, more apt or natural, is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent &amp; ſignify the conveyance of theſe Bleſſings to us, than the pouring, or ſprinkling of water on us, as it is in Baptiſm?</p>

               <p>And now he that conſiders the declared end and deſign of the Ordinance, and what is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuggeſted to us therein, will ſee that it is well adapted to anſwer the End, by preparing and diſpoſing our hearts to receive the Grace of GOD, which he conveys to thoſe that attend this Ordinance in a right manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here I may ſay in the firſt place, <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deſign of this Ordinance is to bind Men unto their duty; and he that conſiders the declared end and deſign of it, will be led to look upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under peculiar obligations to obſerve the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel; an apprehenſion of which will be of great advantage to prepare us for the Grace of GOD.</hi>

Now he that is Baptized, if he will give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf leave to think, will be naturally led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that by his Baptiſm he is laid under the ſtrongeſt obligations to be the Lord's, he will conſider that by his Baptiſm he is made a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that body of which Chriſt is the head, and therefore ought to be in entire ſubjection to him: He will conſider that by his Baptiſm he is dedicated and given up to GOD, and that

In ſhort, as I have ſaid before, it is a Seal of the Covenant of divine Grace wherein Chriſt with all the bleſſings of the Covenant are not only repreſented, but are ready to be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, if we will but receive him: the Word and Covenant of GOD ſtands engaged to this in Baptiſm, which gives us all poſſible aſſurance of obtaining upon our ſeeking. And now our having ſuch aſſurance enables us to ſeek with the confidence that is neceſſary to prepare us to receive it. Many other things might be ſaid as to the uſefulneſs of Baptiſm, and ſo the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Wiſdom of GOD in making it a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church.</p>
               <p>But I proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance wonderfully adapted, for conveying Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; Saving benefits unto our Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="unknown:002987_0316_0FE6B39A4886E838"/>This is an Ordinance inſtituted by Chriſt the Night before he ſuffered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a particular account of which Inſtitution we have, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. And in other Evangeliſts The outward Elements &amp; Signs are Bread &amp; Wine, broken and poured out, eaten &amp; drunk, by which religious Ceremony is repreſented and ſignifyed the Death and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt for us. 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>For as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come.</hi> But then it is not only a repreſentation of his ſufferings, but of all the bleſſings that he has purchaſed by his Death; yea, and an actual Exhibition of them to all that come in a right manner to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. 1 Cor. 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? and the bread which we break, is it not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body of Christ</hi>?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this Ordinance is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, as well as Baptiſm, wherein as GOD promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages all the benefits of the New Covenant to us; ſo we do herein renew our Covenant-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to GOD. Every time we come to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance we profeſſedly renew the dedication of our ſelves to GOD, and lay our ſelves under new and freſh obligations to love him &amp; ſerve him, and to keep all his Commandments.</p>
               <p>And now he that will but conſider the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, the nature, and the deſign of it, will ſee that it is wiſely contrived to anſwer it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, even to convey the Grace of GOD unto us if not for our Converſion, yet at leaſt for our ſpiritual
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:002987_0317_0FE6B39A5B90C340"/>
nouriſhment, and growth in Grace. It is an Ordinance that has a wonderful tendency to put as into a ſerious, devout frame of ſpirit, to ſtir up our affections, and thereby fit and prepare our hearts for the Spirit of GOD to work upon. Nay it gives us ſuch lively repreſentations of Chriſt, of his dying love, and his ſaving benefits, that our eye affects our heart to ſuch a degree as to put every Grace within us into exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Thus for inſtance, what could be contrived more powerfully to diſcover to us the evil of Sin, and ſo to diſpoſe our hearts to unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for all our Sins, than to ſee the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal SON of GOD wounded for our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bruiſed for our iniquities? What could better convince us of the infinite Evil there is in Sin, than to ſee the cruel ſufferings that the Son of GOD endured before he could make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for it? What could be more effectual to ſet us againſt ſin, and to beget an hatred and abhorrence of it within us, than to ſee the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the tortures, the inexpreſſible agonies it put the Son of GOD unto, when it was but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him? And what could ſerve better to ſtrengthen our reſolutions againſt ſin for the time to come, than to ſee Chriſt bleeding and dying for ſin, and to conſider that by our return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to ſin we do as it were crucify afreſh the Lord of Life, and put him to an open ſhame? Now all this is done in the holy Sacrament, for therein Chriſt is evidently ſet forth as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed among us.</p>
               <p>Again, what better way could there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſtir up devout affections, and to inflame
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:002987_0318_0FE6B39CE2B3A2F0"/>
our hearts with love, than to have a ſenſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of an Unparallel'd inſtance of infinite love made unto us? What could ſerve better to fill our hearts with love to GOD and CHRIST, than to ſee GOD expreſſing ſuch infinite love to us as to give his only begotten, and dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son to dye for us? And to ſee the Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST expreſſing a love to us ſtronger than death, which many waters could not quench, nor the floods drown? To ſee him who knew no ſin of his own, made ſin for us, and to bear our ſins in his own body on the tree, and to ſubmit to the moſt cruel, curſed and ſhameful death on our accounts? Verily GOD has commended his love to us in that while we were yet Sinners, CHRIST dyed for us; and ſurely our hearts muſt be very hard and ſtupid, if they are not warmed &amp; melted, if they are not all in a flame of love at the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible repreſentation of this dying love in the holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Again, what better and more effectual method could be taken to excite and ſtrengthen our faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, than to ſee him ſuffering the penalties of the law for us, and ſatisfying the demands of divine Juſtice on our account, and ſo making way for GOD, conſiſtent with his Juſtice, Holineſs, and the honour of all his perfections, to pardon, and accept us? What can ſerve better to convince us that he is the alſufficient Saviour, able to ſave unto the uttermoſt; than to ſee him not only pleading in our behalf, but to ſee him paying the price for our ranſom, to ſee him make his Soul an offering for ſin, and pouring it
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:002987_0319_0FE6B39CF808C1D0"/>
out unto death for us, and thereby finiſhing tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and making an end of ſin, and bringing in an everlaſting righteouſneſs? All which is ſet before us in this bleſſed Ordinance, and that in ſuch a lively and affecting manner, that whilſt we are at it, celebrating the Memorials of his death, our Souls will make their boaſt in GOD their Saviour, ſaying with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt</hi>? Rom. 8.34, 35.</p>
               <p>And thus I might go on to other inſtances, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhow how well this Sacrament is adapted to excite and ſtrengthen divine Grace within us, and ſo the Wiſdom of GOD in this bleſſed Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>And thus I have conſidered the inſtituted Means of Grace, thoſe that we are to make uſe of, and give our Attendance upon, and have taken notice of the Wiſdom of GOD appearing in the ſuitableneſs and propriety of them to anſwer the ends propoſed.</p>
               <p>The next thing I am to conſider is, the Means that GOD himſelf makes uſe of, Namely, The dealings and diſpenſations of his Providence towards us, and to obſerve how wiſely GOD or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders things in the courſe of his Providence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Converſion, and growth in Grace; but this muſt be defer'd to another opportunity: And I ſhall conclude with a brief Improvement of what has been offered at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="315" facs="unknown:002987_0320_0FE6B3A9B439F6F0"/>1. <hi>How Thankful ſhould we be for the free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of theſe bleſſed Ordinances?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt certainly it is an unſpeakable favour and privilege to have liberty to go to the Houſe of GOD, and there to attend upon him in the duties of his publick Worſhip. It is what the Primitive Chriſtians were oftentimes debarr'd from, and when ever they met together for the worſhip of GOD it was in jeopardy of their lives; and this has been the lot, &amp; portion of many of the Saints in almoſt all ages of the Church. But now we, inſtead of having any thing to debar, or hinder us from the publick worſhip of GOD in the ways of his appointment, have all poſſible encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it. We are Invited &amp; Commanded to attend publick worſhip, not only by the Word of GOD, but by the Civil Authority placed over us, even ſo far as to expoſe our ſelves not only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but even to humane Penalties for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Now ſurely this is a favour &amp; privilege that calls for our higheſt thankfulneſs. How thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful would the Primitive Chriſtians, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Saints be for ſuch liberties as we enjoy? And therefore if we have the true ſpirit &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Chriſtians, we ſhall be grateful for, and careful how we improve ſuch peculiar advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. This is the language of the devout Pſalmiſt, and will be of every true Saint in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts! Bleſſed are they that dwell in thine Houſe, they will be ſtill praiſing thee: a day in thy courts is better than a thouſand: I had rather be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the Houſe of my God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>What we have heard, may ſerve to reprove all ſuch as neglect the publick Worſhip of GOD in his Houſe, or either of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very evident that ſome perſons are very careleſs about attending the publick Worſhip and Ordinances of GOD in his Houſe. Some there are that openly contemn and deſpiſe the Houſe and Worſhip of GOD, from Atheiſtical Notions, as if there was no GOD, &amp; conſequently no ſuch thing as religious Worſhip to be paid to any Being. Others there are that from a ſpirit of Deiſm and Infidelity deſpiſe the Ordinances: for denying the divine Authority of the Scriptures, they by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deny the obligations to attend the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances therein preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Others there are that altho' they don't run to the ſame exceſs of folly &amp; madneſs in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet have too ſlighty apprehenſions of the neceſſity of attending the publick Worſhip and Ordinances of GOD's Houſe. They will pretend they can profit as much by ſtaying at home, and Reading ſome good Books in their own houſes, as by going to the Houſe of GOD; that they can Read as good or better Sermons at home than they hear at the Church; and ſo ſometimes from ſome prejudice againſt the Miniſter, or from ſome little bodily Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

in the Seaſon, or for want of faſhionable Clothing. and the like, they will ſuffer themſelves to be very much abſent from the Houſe of GOD, and be well ſatisfyed with it, altho' their excuſe be never ſo trivial.</p>
               <p>And then again, others there are who altho' they come to the Houſe of GOD, and attend the more common parts of divine Worſhip; ſuch as the Prayers, the Singing, and the Preaching of the Word, yet are very careleſs and negligent about attending upon the Sacraments. Some remain Unbaptized for a long time, or if they have been given up to GOD in Baptiſm, yet they neglect to renew the dedication of themſelves by their own act, they live many years without owning the Covenant; and when they do it, they are even forced to it, to eſcape the ſcandal and diſgrace of their Childrens being Unbaptized; &amp; when they have gone ſo far in order to their receiving Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for their Children, yet here they come to a ſtand, and neglect to renew and ratify their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant engagement at the holy Supper, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof for many years, nay oftentimes all their days turn their backs upon that holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Now what we have heard ſerves to reprove all ſuch perſons, and leaves them utterly inexcuſable whoever they are. For ſince theſe are the means of Grace that GOD has inſtituted, ſince theſe are the <hi>Wells of Salvation out of which we muſt draw the water of life</hi>; and the Channels in which he is wont to convey his Grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Such neglect the means of Grace that GOD has appointed, they neglect to go to GOD for his Grace in the ways he has ordained, and ſo they practically deſpiſe and reject his Grace: and no wonder if they remain in a graceleſs, unconverted Eſtate, for they keep themſelves out of the way of GOD's Grace, and who can think that GOD will go out of his way to meet them? Wherefore let ſuch ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how they neglect the means of their own Converſion and Salvation, and how much they are the cauſe of their own Deſtruction; and how little they will have to anſwer for themſelves in the Day of Judgment; verily every ſuch Mouth will be ſtop'd, and GOD will appear very juſt when he ſpeaks, and clear when he judges, and condemns them. <hi>To Conclude,</hi>

               <p>I Am yet upon the conſideration of the Means of Grace, and of the Wiſdom of GOD that appears in the Methods that are taken for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men into, and carrying them on in a ſtate of Grace.

Now I have already conſidered thoſe Means of Grace that GOD has Inſtituted and Appointed for us to attend upon; in order to our having the divine Grace conveyed thro' thoſe ſacred Channels into our Souls; and as I went along I endeavoured to ſhow the wiſdom of GOD in appointing ſuch Means for us, by ſhewing the ſuitableneſs and fitneſs of them to anſwer the end. propoſed in the Inſtitution of them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That GOD makes uſe of Providences as well as Ordinance in bringing Sinners home unto himſelf, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And he that will but conſider the manner of GOD's dealings, and diſpenſations towards Sinners in the courſe of his Providence before their Converſion, and afterwards for their progreſs in Grace, will ſee a great deal of the Wiſdom of GOD therein.</p>
               <p>Here therefore I ſhall conſider the various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of divine Providence made uſe of in the bringing perſons into a ſtate of Grace, and for their progreſs &amp; growth therein, and the wiſdom of GOD that appears in them from the fitneſs; and natural tendency of them to prepare Mens hearts for the impreſſions of divine Grace. For if the diſpenſations of Providence are ſo ordered, is to be very fit means, or inſtruments in the hand of the Spirit for promoting our Converſion and Sanctification, we muſt acknowledge that they are ordered in wiſdom. But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider any of the diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in particular, I would obſerve this in general, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>

Some he chaſtens with the rod of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and that in a very great variety both as to kind &amp; degree. Some he exerciſes with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles, the troubles and diſtreſſes of the Mind; ſome with Outward troubles, ſuch as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pain, poverty, reproach, and contempt, loſſes, croſſes and diſappointments. But then on the other hand, others there are that GOD cauſes goodneſs and mercy to follow them; he ſatisfies their Mouth with good things, and crowns them with loving kindneſs, and tender mercies. But then oftentimes the ſcene is changed with reſpect to the ſame perſons. GOD does ſeldom or never keep the ſame courſe with any perſon all his life long but he is often changing his hand with them, ſometimes laying Afflictions on them, and then removing his hand from off them, and cauſing them to ſee good days according to the days wherein they have ſeen evil. This we ſee to be the Method of GOD's dealings and diſpenſations towards the Children of Men, not confining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any particular, certain way of managing us, but putting us ſometimes into proſperity, and ſometimes into adverſity.</p>
               <p>And now GOD, exerciſing ſuch a variety of Providences is very wiſely contrived. Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is ſuch a difference in the natural Tempers of Men whom GOD brings into a ſtate of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether from the different Formation of our Bodies, or the various Contexture of the Parts, or however elſe it comes to paſs, yet it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:002987_0328_0FE6B3C0D5B96E90"/>
that there is a very great difference in the natural tempers and diſpoſitions of Men, diſtinct from that which is made by the renewing and ſanctifying Grace of GOD; and therefore they require a very different way of management to prepare them for the reception of divine Grace at firſt, or for their improvement in it afterwards. So different are the tempers of Men, that the ſame kind of Providences, conſidered only in their natural tendency, will have a very different effect upon them. And altho' it muſt be acknowledged, that GOD by his Almighty Spirit, can make any Providence produce the ſame effect upon the moſt different &amp; oppoſite tempers; yet a Providence that would be very ſerviceable to one Man on ſpiritual accounts, would (ſeparate from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial operations of the Spirit) be very hurtful to another. Some Mens natural tempers are ſuch that they can't bear a great deal of outward Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, a full ſail would overſet &amp; deſtroy them; it would exalt them above meaſure, and make them grow proud &amp; inſolent, it would lead them into an unmindfulneſs &amp; regardleſsneſs of GOD, and of their duty to him, and all his goodneſs would be turned into wantoneſs; their Spirits are ſuch as need to be kept under, and nothing but a ſeries of Afflictions &amp; Troubles can keep them humble, or make them thoughtful &amp; conſiderate: whereas on the other hand, there are other Men whoſe natural tempers are ſuch, that they can be more eaſily led and drawn to Repentance by the goodneſs of GOD, than driven by Afflictions, that are apt to be dejected, diſcouraged, and even to
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:002987_0329_0FE6B28383877528"/>
fall into deſpair when the hand of GOD lyes heavy upon them: if they meet with Afflictions their Spirits are apt to ſink under them, they are rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly to give out, to neglect their duty &amp; buſineſs from ſuch a deſpairing thought as this, that it is in vain to ſerve the Lord any longer; and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch perſons inſtead of being driven from their ſins, and driven nearer to GOD by Afflictions, they are driven further from him, and make their caſe more difficult &amp; deſperate than before.</p>
               <p>And now conſidering the various tempers of Men, and what different ways of management are requiſite to produce the ſame effect; it muſt needs be wiſdom in GOD to make uſe of a variety of Providences, and deal very differently with thoſe whom he deſigns to bring home unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the moſt likely way to anſwer the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The temper of every particular Man is ſuch, as makes it neceſſary for him to be exerciſed with a great variety of Providences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' from the different tempers of Men ſome require more of one kind of Providences than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet there are none but what require a change of Providences. It is very requiſite for the moſt part that GOD ſhould be changing his hand, ſometimes diſpenſing Mercies, and ſometimes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to us. As for Proſperity, there is ſcarce any Man that can bear an uninterrupted ſeries of it; it would be very difficult, and ſomething extraordinary would be neceſſary to be done to keep down ſuch a Mans Pride, and to make him humble and penitent, and to keep him ſo. How
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:002987_0330_0FE6B28E722D13D8"/>
difficult would it be to convince a Man (that ſhould meet with no interruption or diſturbance in his worldly Enjoyments) of the evil of ſin, when he feels ſo little of the ill effects of it? How difficult to perſwade him that GOD was angry with him for his ſins, when he cauſes goodneſs and mercy to follow him continually? So again how could ſuch a Man have ſuch a feeling, convincing ſenſe of the vanity of the World, and all things in it as to deſpiſe it, and raiſe his heart above it? How would a Man come to himſelf, and be brought to ſerious thought &amp; conſideration? How would he be awakened out of his carnal ſloth &amp; ſecurity, and quickned to ſeek after another and a better Place if he did not meet with afflictions to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his preſent comfort? In ſhort, we are all by nature ſuch fools, as that a life of uninterrupted proſperity would deſtroy us</p>
               <p>And then on the other hand, the caſe would be as difficult and dangerous for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for who could bear with a conſtant courſe of ſorrow and trouble, without any metigation or relief? If Men were kept in the fire of affliction, and under the rod of divine correction, without any mixture of outward comforts; <hi>The Spirit would fail before him, and the ſouls that he hath made.</hi> Men would be very apt to be diſcouraged from ſeeking the Lord or wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him they will (when his hand lyes long and heavy upon them) be ready to murmur and complain, to have hard thoughts of GOD, and think it is vain to ſerve him and will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly want the proper motives to love him: and altho' they may be brought to ſee ſomething of
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:002987_0331_0FE6B28E8997AC58"/>
the evil of ſin from the ill effects of it which they feel; yet this is not likely to produce any thing more than an attrition which is only a ſorrow for ſin, becauſe of the evil effects and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it upon our ſelves, and not that true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of Soul which conſiſts in an hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin from a love to GOD, and becauſe he is diſhonoured and offended thereby.</p>
               <p>And now as we ſee that no particular way of dealing with any perſon ſerves to well as a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Providences, therefore GOD is often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his hand, ſometimes diſpenſing mercies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflictions, as he ſees the caſe calls for: As he is <hi>leading them to Repentance by his goodneſs, drawing them with the cords of a man, and the hands of love</hi>; ſo it is as certain, that <hi>whom the Lord loves he chaſtens, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Such a variety of Providences is very uſeful to Men in their preſent ſtate and condition, let it be what it will, which ſhows the Wiſdom of GOD in ſuch frequent Changes and Alternations he orders out for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such frequent changes of Providence are of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Men, whether they are at preſent in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, or in adverſity.</p>
               <p>Thus, ſuppoſing a Man at preſent in very proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and comfortable Circumſtances, if GOD was not wont to alter his diſpenſations, ſuch an one would think that his mountain ſtood ſtrong, and that he ſhould never be moved, he would put far from him the evil day, and would be ready to ſay, Soul take thine eaſe, eat, drink &amp; be merry,
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:002987_0332_0FE6B28FB0A4A300"/>
for thou haſt goods laid up for many years, and GOD and Religion, and the grand concerns of his Soul would be laid aſide. But now GOD by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſuch frequent Changes, and giving ſuch ſudden turns in his Providences takes away all reaſon and foundation for Mens depending upon a long uninterrupted continuance of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances; for when they ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many changes that have happened to others, they cannot but look upon their own preſent deſireable condition to be very uncertain. The Providences of GOD being ſo various, we can look upon nothing as certain that we poſſeſs. Riches for ought we know may take to themſelves wings &amp; fly away; friends may forſake us, health may be deſtroyed, and all our comforts fail us at once. And now the uncertainty of earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments is of great ſervice to us, and ſo wiſely ordered by GOD, as it ſerves very much to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſen our eſteem of earthly things, and prevent our putting our truſt and confidence in them.</p>
               <p>So on the other hand, if Men were under afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Circumſtances, if GOD never altered his hand throughout the courſe of a Man's life, ſuch would be dejected &amp; diſcouraged, they would ſunk under the thoughts of ſpending all their days in miſery and ſorrow, and would be ready upon ſuch terms to chooſe ſtrangling and death rather than life: but now GOD's varying and changing his hand is a mighty ſupport and encouragement to ſuch. This gives them grounds to hope the ſcene will be changed as to them, and that they ſhall ſee good days according to the days wherein they have
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:002987_0333_0FE6B28FC9CCBE48"/>
ſeen evil; this enables them patiently to bear their preſent calamity, and encourages them to pray for deliverance, and quietly to wait for the ſalvation of GOD.</p>
               <p>But thus much for the wiſdom of GOD in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out variety of Providences for us in general.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider, <hi>Some of the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of divine Providence, that are made uſe of to prepare us for the Grace of GOD, or to advance us in it; and the wiſdom of GOD appearing therein, from the fitneſs and tendency of them to anſwer the end propoſed.</hi> And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us conſider. The <hi>Merciful diſpenſations of divine Providence, and we ſhall ſee them well adapted to anſwer the Ends propoſed, and ſo the wiſdom as well as goodneſs of GOD in ordering out the ſame unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That GOD does frequently diſpence his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the Children of Men, and cauſe goodneſs and mercy to follow them is too evident for the moſt inſenſible or ungrateful to deny, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no need of ſpending time for the proof of it. He is frequently cauſing his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs before us, yea the whole Earth is full of his goodneſs; and we have all taſted &amp; ſeen that the LORD is good, altho' ſome have received more largely of his goodneſs than others. Some are wonderfully ſmiled upon &amp; proſpered in the world. <hi>Job</hi> was ſuch an inſtance, of which he gives an elegant deſcription after the ſcene was changed, Chap. 29th. at the beginning, <hi>O that I were as in months paſt, as in the days when God preſerved me, when his candle ſhined upon my head,
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:002987_0334_0FE6B29A19F35750"/>
— when the ſecret of God was upon my taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, when the almighty was yet with me; when my children were about me; when I waſhed my ſteps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oyl,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the caſe of many perſons, GOD cauſes whatever they do to proſper, he gives them health and ſtrength, riches and honour, peace &amp; pleaſure. And now this is a wiſe and proper management towards ſome perſons that GOD is about to bring or has already brought into a ſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As it may be very helpful in leading them to Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' outward peace and proſperity may be hurtful to ſome tempers, and ſerves to harden them in ſin rather than ſoften, and melt them into penitence: and altho' an uninterrupted courſe of proſperity may be dangerous for any, and lead them into an unmindfulneſs of GOD, and of their duty to him; yet there are ſome that can bear a turn of outward Proſperity; and the merciful Providences of GOD, by the concurring influences of his Spirit, prove ſoftning and melting to them, and help to lead them to or carry them on in an ingenious ſorrow for ſin. For when a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that he as well as others is a Child of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and ſo a Child of wrath, and that he has been as great a Sinner all his days as many others have been, and yet when he ſees GOD puniſhing and correcting others for their ſins, in the ſore afflictions that he is bringing upon them, exerciſing them with poverty and contempt, with ſickneſs &amp; pains, with loſſes and croſſes of every
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:002987_0335_0FE6B29A30833468"/>
kind: and he who has been as great a Sinner is ſpared, and not only delivered from theſe evils; but encompaſſed with all the comforts of life. I ſay, when a Man does thus conſider how boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully GOD deals with him beyond what he has to others, no more unworthy than himſelf; it muſt needs have a tendency to inlarge his heart in love and thankfulneſs to GOD, and help to fill him with ſhame and ſorrow for his ſins, which have been ſuch ungratefull returns to GOD for his benefits. Kindneſſes have a natural tendency to ſoften us, and if there be any ſpark of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they will ſtir it up within us; and this is the end of GOD's goodneſs and kindneſs, to ſtir up our ingenuity, if we have any, and to bring us to an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>genuous ſorrow for our ſins; <hi>the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4. And it is not to be doubted but that many a Man has been very powerfully wrought upon by the goodneſs of GOD: Some remarkable inſtances of it have made ſuch impreſſions upon Mens hearts as have never been worn off, and which have been ſo cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated &amp; improved by the concurring influences of GOD's Spirit, as to produce an ingenuous ſhame and ſorrow for ſin, an hatred of it, and full reſolutions againſt it. Merciful Providences when accompanied with the Spirit of GOD will ſerve wonderfully to ſoften Mens hearts, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them into tears of Godly ſorrow &amp; penitence for ſin, even unto a Repentance unto Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Merciful diſpenſations of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences ſerve to inlarge our hearts in love &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to GOD, and to encourage us in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="unknown:002987_0336_0FE6B29DBAD562D8"/>If GOD ſhould be chaſtning us with the rod, &amp; viſiting us with ſtripes continually, we ſhould be apt to have hard thoughts of him as unkind and unmerciful; we could not have ſuch reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing &amp; ſenſible apprehenſions of his goodneſs and his mercy, as we ought. And if he ſhould continue his hand heavy upon us, whilſt we are endeavouring to ſerve him, and to conform our ſelves unto his precepts, it would be very apt to diſcourage us, and be a ſtrong temptation to lay aſide all religious duties, and break forth in ſuch expreſſions of anger and deſpair, as thoſe, Job 21.15. <hi>What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhall we have if we pray unto him?</hi> And in 2 King. 6.33. <hi>Behold this evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now GOD by diſpenſing his favours to us, and beſtowing the bleſſings and comforts of this life upon us, helps to give us a quite different apprehenſion of him: this convinces us of his goodneſs &amp; his mercy, in the moſt ſenſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by having ſuch ſenſible Convictions of the immence goodneſs of GOD, we ſhall have our hearts inlarged in love and thankfulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and our mouths filled with praiſes. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant was ſo affected with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD in giving him ſuch ſucceſs in his ſeeking a wife for his Maſters Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> That <hi>he bowed his head and worſhipped the Lord,</hi> Gen. 24.26. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo affected with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of GOD in their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the overthrow of the Aegyptians
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:002987_0337_0FE6B29DD861B300"/>
in the Red Sea, as to ſing that ſong of praiſe to the Lord, in <hi>Exod.</hi> ch. 15. And how often do we find the Pſalmiſt ſo affected with the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Providences he met withal, as to break forth in ſongs of praiſe? <hi>I will ſing of thy power, yea, I will ſing aloud of thy mercy— for thou haſt been my defence,</hi> Pſal 59.16. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits; who forgiveth thine iniquities, who healeth thy diſeaſes, and redeemeth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tender mercies,</hi> Pſal. 103 beg.</p>
               <p>But then, the merciful providences of GOD, ſerve not only to excite our love &amp; gratitude, but alſo to encourage us to engage in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to go on in it with the greater chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: Every act of kindneſs helps to confirm us in this, That he is a good Maſter to ſerve, and that he is a plentiful rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. The Pſalmiſt was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to learn and to obſerve GOD's Statutes upon the account of the divine goodneſs both in his nature, and in the communications of it in his Providence, Pſal. 119.68. <hi>Thou art good, and doeſt good, teach me thy ſtatutes.</hi> And ſurely the conſideration hereof, and eſpecially the daily experience of the divine goodneſs and mercy, affords abundant encouragement to engage in the obſervance of his Commandments; for ſince GOD is ſo good, as all the inſtances of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us manifeſt him to be, we may conclude that his Commandments are good, and that in keeping of them there will be a great reward.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="333" facs="unknown:002987_0338_0FE6B2A982F1E030"/>3. <hi>Another wiſe and good End anſwered by the Merciful diſpenſations of divine Providence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe that are in a ſtate of Grace is this, that hereby they have the opportunity for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing and improving ſome particular Graces, which are for the Glory of GOD, and the good of their fellow Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, if GOD is pleaſed to bleſs a Chriſtian with a good Eſtate, and a plentiful ſupply of the good things of this life, it will give him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for, and his heart being inclined by the Grace of GOD, he will actually honour the Lord with his Subſtance, by imploying a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proportion of it in acts of Piety &amp; Charity, in propagating &amp; ſupporting the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by advancing the intereſt of Religion, in which the glory of GOD is moſt of all concerned, and alſo in relieving the diſtreſſes, and ſupplying the wants of the Poor and needy, by which means, <hi>The bleſſing of him that is ready to periſh will come upon him.</hi> And not only ſo, but hereby he will make to himſelf friends of the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteouſneſs, which when he fails will receive him into everlaſting Habitation. So again, is GOD pleaſed in his Providence to ſhew ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to any of his Servants, as to confer places of honour, power, or truſt upon them, very wiſe and good ends are anſwered by it; for as this gives them the opportunity, ſo they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it for the glory of GOD, and the good of others; they will improve ſuch favours by making uſe of their power &amp; influence for the promoting of Religion, for the encouraging of
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:002987_0339_0FE6B2A999278788"/>
vertue and holineſs, and for the ſuppreſſing the growth of ſin and wickedneſs in the places and people where, and among whom they dwell; Such Men will improve their powers for GOD, remembring they received the ſame from him, and ſo will be the Miniſters of GOD for good unto his People. And therefore it muſt needs be as the Preacher tells us, Prov. 29.2. <hi>When the righteous are in authority the people rejoyce, but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes GOD orders out an Afflicted ſtate for thoſe he is bringing, or has brought into a ſtate of Grace, in which there appears a great deal of wiſdom and prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have contracted ſo much baſeneſs, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and ingratitude by the fall, as that we are apt to abuſe the goodneſs and the mercy of GOD, and turn his Grace into wantonneſs, and altho' mercies may be very helpful to draw us to GOD; yet there is ſcarce any Man but what needs to be driven to him by afflictions. And altho' GOD becauſe <hi>He delighteth in mercy</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times begins with mercies; yet when he ſees we won't be drawn with the bands of love, he is then for driving us with the rod of Correction, and this oftentimes with the help of the Spirit proves effectual, when a multitude of mercies have been to little purpoſe. This was the very caſe of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word.</hi> And ſo he argues from it in <hi>v.</hi> 71. That <hi>it was good for him that he had been afflicted, that he might learn Gods ſtatutes.</hi> The Children of
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:002987_0340_0FE6B2AAE3ABF158"/>
Iſrael never came to a ſenſe of their degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſinful departures from GOD, till he opened their eyes by ſome heavy Judgments, but in their afflictions they would confeſs their ſins, <hi>and ſeek him early.</hi> The Prodigal never came to himſelf till he was pinched with extream poverty and hunger, then he reſolved, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally returned to his Father. And this is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the caſe of many; they would never come to themſelves, they would never ſo much as think of returning to GOD, if they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened and ſtirred up to it by ſome ſore Afflictions.</p>
               <p>There is nothing of outward Means that has a more powerful tendency to awaken Men out of their carnal ſloth and ſecurity, to put them upon ſerious thought and conſideration, or that is ſo effectual to diſcover the evil nature and conſequences of ſin, as afflictions. They ſeem neceſſary to bring perſons to GOD at firſt, &amp; to keep perſons cloſe &amp; ſteddy to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Afflictions are as neceſſary for the Soul, as Phyſick is for the Body, they ſerve to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity, and to take away ſin, and make us partakers of divine Holineſs. And now ſince nothing of outward means is more powerful than afflictions for the bringing us home to GOD, ſo the wiſdom of GOD appears in ordering out afflictions for ſuch as he has purpoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to bring into a ſtate of Grace. But as there are ſeveral kinds of afflictions that GOD exerciſes ſuch withal in order to their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo I ſhall mention ſome of them, and very
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:002987_0341_0FE6B2AAF90B5520"/>
briefly hint at the ſpecial uſefulneſs of ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in particular, &amp; ſo the wiſdom of GOD in the particular kinds of afflictions that he makes uſe of. Here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes GOD exerciſes perſons with loſſes and diſappointments, and reduces to Poverty, even to ſuch ſtraits and difficulties that they know not how to turn themſelves, for a comfortable ſupport in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now GOD is very wiſe &amp; prudent in this, becauſe it ſeems abſolutely neceſſary for ſome perſons to be thus dealt withal, and it ſerves for many good purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, it ſerves to <hi>give Men a most ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtration of the Vanity of the World, and ſo affords a powerful argument to wean us from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are all apt to be fond of the World and the things of it, we are apt to place too much dependance upon earthly Riches; but now GOD by depriving us of theſe outward comforts, by conſuming our Eſtates, &amp; waſting our Subſtance, and bringing us to Poverty, he effectually teaches us, they are all uncertain Riches, not fit for us to place any confidence in, he hereby gives us a feeling ſenſe and realizing apprehenſion of the truth of what the Preacher ſays, Eccl. 1.2. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then again, <hi>Cutting us ſhort with reſpect to outward good things, and reducing us to ſtraits and difficulties, may be very ſerviceable to bring us to caſt our care upon GOD, and to place our dependance more and more upon him.</hi>

Such a condition will quicken as to apply our ſelves to our heavenly Father, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has directed, <hi>to give us our daily bread</hi>; for when the ſtreams (on which we had too much dependance) are dried up, we ſhall be naturally led to the fountain.</p>
               <p>But then again, <hi>Such low and difficult Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances give Men the opportunity of Exerciſing and Improving in the Grace of Contentment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time for the Exerciſe of Contentment ſo as to appear any great virtue in us, or for us to improve in this Grace, is the time of outward adverſity, when our circumſtances are low and difficult in the World, &amp; ſo there is the ſtrongeſt temptations againſt it. For by ſtriving after Contentment with ſuch things as we have, and againſt Envy at thoſe who are in better Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we ſhall advance in this excellent Grace, and come nearer and nearer to the ſpirit and temper that was in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <pb n="338" facs="unknown:002987_0343_0FE6B2B346EC7600"/>And then laſtly, <hi>Poverty, and the want of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things, may ſerve very much to quicken us in our purſuits after heavenly Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When all things here below fail, when a Man is poor and low in the World, and has little or nothing of this Worlds goods to depend upon, this will lead him to think of other Riches, and will afford a very good argument to him to be laying up treaſures in heaven. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. That <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> And now when a Mans outward riches fail him, and he grows poor and low in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how natural will it be for him to take encouragement from the words of the Apoſtle to beſtir himſelf ſo as to become rich in faith, and to ſecure a more enduring ſubſtance than any thing here below, even bags that wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens.</p>
               <p>And now if Poverty or Straitneſs of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances has a tendency to, and will if ſanctified by the Spirit of GOD produce ſuch good effects, it is certainly wiſdom &amp; kindneſs in GOD to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it out for the lot &amp; portion of ſome perſons. Indeed <hi>Agur</hi> deſired to be delivered <hi>from Poverty</hi> as well as <hi>Riches,</hi> and it muſt be acknowledged to be a thing very undeſirable, yea, and attended with many ſnares &amp; temptations; yet we have reaſon to believe, and acknowledge that it is a ſtate of life very neceſſary for ſome perſons, whoſe tempers are ſuch, that they would pine and grow poor in Grace, if worldly Riches ſhould be increaſed to them.</p>

               <p>And this he does in wiſdom, for it ſerves many <hi>good purpoſes,</hi> which I muſt only briefly mention.</p>
               <p>Thus ſuch kind of Affliction ſerve very much <hi>to ſubdue and mortify our Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when we ſee others deſpiſe us, and have but a mean opinion of us, it will lead us to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, whether we have not had too high thoughts of our ſelves, and will have a tendency to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our opinion of our ſelves, and bring us to a complyance with the direction of the Apoſtle, Rom. 12.3. <hi>That a man think not of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every men the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But then laſtly, It will have a tendency to make Men careful to approve themſelves unto GOD, and their own Souls, that when others reproach &amp; deſpiſe them, their own Conſciences

               <p>So that upon theſe accounts, reproach and contempt from the World may be a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable Affliction to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Oftentimes GOD afflicts with bodily Sickneſs and pains, by which he brings them down, even to the very gates of the Grave, and ſo under fearful apprehenſions of Death.</hi>

It alſo ſtirs us up to examine our ſelves, upon looking back upon our paſt lives, and renewing our repentance and ſorrow for ſin, and it excites the utmoſt earneſtneſs and diligence in making our Calling and Election ſure. Moreover, ſuch times of ſickneſs and danger, cauſes all the Glory of this World to vaniſh and diſappear, and to be deſpiſed in our Eyes; then we have a more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible apprehenſion of the vanity of the World, and of all things in it.</p>

Now altho' ſuch ſpiritual doubts and fears are ſome of the ſoreſt Afflictions we can meet with in the World; (<hi>for a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi>) yet the tendency of them is ſuch, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>For ſuch kind of afflictions put Men upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining

themſelves with the greateſt ſtrictneſs imaginable, to find what is amiſs; by which means if there be any ſin or luſt lurking in them, it will be diſcovered, to be repented of, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</p>
               <p>And then again, it puts Men upon a more cloſe walking with GOD, and upon the greateſt care and watchfulneſs leaſt they fall into ſin. When a Man is under ſuch doubts &amp; fears about his ſpiritual State, he will be more careful how he performs duty, and more fearful of neglecting it, or being formal &amp; lifeleſs in the performance of it. The diſtreſſes of his mind will make him fervent in ſpirit whilſt he is ſerving the Lord. And then when GOD ſhall return to ſuch an one, and ſpeak peace unto him, the Experience he has had of the ſad Condition of thoſe who have GOD withdrawn from them, will make him careful leaſt he return again unto folly, and thereby ſhould again have the light of GOD's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance hid from him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Sometimes GOD in his holy Providence permits thoſe whom he is bringing, or has brought into a ſtate of Grace, to fall into groſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sins,</hi> which in the concluſion proves very uſeful and ſerviceable to them, and ſo the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD is to be ſeen &amp; acknowledged in it.</p>
               <p>I ſay, GOD permits them to fall, for he does not by any poſitive act of his cauſe them to fall; but he for wiſe and good reaſons ſees cauſe ſo far to withdraw his reſtraining Grace, that they are overcome by the temptations they meet with, and ſo fall into ſome ſcandalous ſin; ſometimes
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:002987_0348_0FE6B2C210C240B0"/>
into the ſin of Drunkenneſs, as <hi>Noah</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.21. Sometimes into Drunkenneſs &amp; Inceſt, as <hi>Lot</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.33, 35. Sometimes into Murder &amp; Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. ch. Now altho' theſe things reflect great diſhonour upon GOD, and are very provoking and offenſive to the pure Eyes of his Glory, wounding to Mens Souls, and hurtful to Religion, yet GOD who can bring good out of the greateſt evil, does ſometimes ſo order it, as that ſuch groſs and ſcandalous falls prove uſeful and ſerviceable to a Man afterwards. Nay I believe it has oftentimes proved a very great inſtrument of a ſinners Converſion: his having committed a ſcandalous ſin puts him upon more thoughtfulneſs than ever he exerciſed before; and he is led by it to conſider the evil there is in ſin in general, as well as of that ſin in particular; and we may oftentimes obſerve perſons growing more ſerious and circumſpect after ſome ſcandalous fall, than ever they were before. Furthermore, it ſerves to humble them, and cauſes them to walk ſoftly all their days. It alſo leads them to conſider the weakneſs, &amp; impotency of Men when left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and will lead them to be more watchful againſt thoſe things that have in times paſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inſnaring to them: and ſo, in ſhort, one foul and ſcandalous ſin ſometimes prevents many leſs notorious ones, which yet might have been as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to GOD. Moreover, the ſcandalous falls of ſome ſerve as warnings to others, and may make them more upon their watch and guard: for they adminiſter this counſel, and admonition to all, 1 Cor. 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinketh that he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:002987_0349_0FE6B3A9CC567668"/>
take heed left he fall.</hi> But now GOD forbid that any from what has been ſaid, ſhould take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to indulge themſelves in any groſs preſumptuous ſins, from vain pretences, that it may be uſeful to them hereafter; for this would be in a moſt horrible perverſe manner to turn the Grace of GOD into wantonneſs.</p>
               <p>I might go on to inſtance in ſome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Afflictions, and ſhow the uſefulneſs of them on ſpiritual accounts. I might likewiſe take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve the diſpenſations of Providence towards the wicked and ungodly, even ſuch as live and dye in their ſins, even the merciful and afflictive diſpenſations of Providence towards ſuch, and ſhow to what good purpoſe they are capable of being improved by others, for the bringing them into, or forwarding them in Grace and Holineſs; and ſo the wiſdom of GOD that appears in them. Thus I might ſhow that the awful Judgments which GOD oftentimes in his Providence brings upon Sinners in this World, is capable of being improved to great advantage by others, as it ſerves very convincingly to diſcover the divine hatred and abhorrence of ſin, and to warn us of the danger of going on in any ſinful courſes; &amp; ſo oftentimes ſerves to deter perſons from going on in their ſinful practices, left they ſhould fall under the like terrible Judgments. The divine J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fear, and not do any more ſo wickedly.</p>
               <p>So alſo might I ſhow how the outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that GOD affords ſometimes to Sinners, may
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:002987_0350_0FE648B66F510980"/>
be of great uſe and ſervice to the Children of GOD. For altho' we are ready to cry out with wonder &amp; ſay, <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked proſper</hi>? And altho' the Pſalmiſt confeſſes, <hi>That his feet were almoſt gone, and his steps had well nigh ſlip'd, and he was envious at the fooliſh, when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked.</hi> Pſal. 73.1, 3. Yet it will appear that GOD has very wiſe &amp; gracious deſigns in it, eſpecially towards his Children, even to ſtrengthen their faith, and to advance them in Grace and Holineſs. Thus for inſtance, it affords a very good argument for a future ſtate, wherein GOD will make a remarkable difference between him that ſerveth GOD, and him that ſerveth him not. Moreover, it may ſerve to give us a more inlarged thought of the glorious rewards of the other World, and a meaner apprehenſion of the goods of this preſent World; for by this we ſee that GOD eſteems the goods of this World as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not worth the making a difference, as to them, between the righteous and the wicked. And then it alſo naturally leads us into this thought, That if GOD will give theſe things ſo freely to the wicked, how great a good muſt that needs be that is laid up for them that love, and fear his Name.</p>
               <p>But this is ſufficient to ſhow the wiſdom of GOD in his Providences, as he improves them as means to bring us into, and carry us on in the ſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with a very brief <hi>Improvement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is matter of ſhame &amp; humiliation, that we have made no better Improvement of the various diſpenſations of divine Providence.</hi>

                  <pb n="346" facs="unknown:002987_0351_0FE6B2C226C8E4E0"/>By what we have heard, we learn, That every Providence whether Merciful or Afflictive may be improved to great advantage, and may help us forward in Grace &amp; Holineſs; but what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have we made of them? GOD has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been for drawing us with the cords of a man, and with the bands of love, by cauſing goodneſs &amp; mercy to follow us; but we have been ſo baſe and diſingenuous as not to be drawn or allur'd by his kindneſs. That goodneſs of his which ſhould have led them to Repentance, has been baſely abuſed, by our taking encouragement there-from to go on ſtill in our treſpaſſes. On the other hand, GOD has been ſometimes driving us by the rod of Correction, but we oftentimes have been ſo ſtupid as to refuſe to receive Inſtruction by it. We have been Murmuring and Impatient under Afflictions, and have hardned our Necks under Reproofs, inſtead of returning to him that has been ſmiting of us. Now we have reaſon to be humble that we have made no better advantage of the various turns of Providence, and may well bluſh and be aſhamed that we have made ſuch an ill improvement of them; and ſurely many of you who have been ſo ungrateful, and ſo incorrigible, may juſtly fear that GOD will ſpeedily leave you to your ſelves, will let you alone, and uſe no more means with you to reclaim you, but will give you up to your own hearts luſts, and then every turn of Providence, inſtead of being any way ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, will only ſerve to help you fill up the meaſure of your ſins, and ripen you the faſter for eternal Deſtruction.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For ſince every Providence is capable of being improved to good advantage, and ſince GOD knows what kind of Providences are beſt for us, we ought to acquieſs in all his diſpenſations. Who need Murmur or be Impatient under Afflictions, when every Affliction may be of ſo great profit to us. Afflictions oftentimes prove the means of our Converſion &amp; Salvation, they ſerve to further the Saints in Grace, and to work out for them a far more exceeding &amp; an eternal weight of glory; what foundation then is there for Murmuring or Impatience under Afflictions? We may be ſure that the Father of Spirits chaſtens his Children for their profit, and therefore if we would govern our ſelves by Reaſon, we ſhould deſire GOD to order out ſuch a ſtate of life for us, as will be moſt for our ſpiritual Advantage, even altho' it be an afflicted one. <hi>To Conclude,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us all obſerve the diſpenſations of divine Providence towards us, and let us conſider how every turn of Providence may be improved by us, and in what ways eſpecially they may be helpful to us in working out our Salvation.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Nature and Degree of the Glory &amp; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that Chriſt has purchaſed, and is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for us, is ſuch as to manifeſt and diſcover the Wiſdom of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed as for this Glory and Happineſs, it is out of the reach of our Capacities to comprehend; much leſs to deſcribe. The Apoſtle tells us, 1 Cor. 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Eye heard, neither have entred into the heart of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the things that God hath prepared for them that have

him.</hi> If this could be ſaid with reſpect to the glorious times of the Goſpel, how much rather may it be ſaid of the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us in the world to come? Nevertheleſs the Scriptures do give us ſome general hints concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtate of the bleſſed by which we may have ſome general, but not adequate Ideas of the heavenly Glory. Thus we may gather from the Scriptures, that altho' the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is repreſented by ſenſible Metaphors; yet that it is not a carnal, but a ſpiritual kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; that we ſhall be made perfect in holineſs; that there wont be the leaſt Inclination, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to ſin remaining in us, but that we ſhall be perfectly pure and holy; and that we ſhall dwell in the preſence of GOD and CHRIST, and have a moſt glorious viſion, and full fruition of him; that we ſhall enjoy every thing that can gratify our pure and perfectly refined natures, even Rivers of pleaſure and fulneſs of joys; and that every thing that can diſturb or afford any uneaſineſs to us ſhall be entirely baniſhed that bleſſed Place; that all the former things will be entirely paſſed away, that there will be no more ſickneſs nor pain no more ſorrow, nor any more death, but all tears ſhall be wiped away from our Eyes. It is likewiſe repreſented as a ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhall have the greateſt honour conferr'd upon us and ſhall be employed in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Exerciſes, even to joyn in Conſort with all the holy Angels in ſinging Praiſes and Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs, giving bleſſing, and honour, and glory and power to him that ſitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="unknown:002987_0356_0FE6B2D6B5AAD888"/>Moreover, the account the Scriptures give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the duration of the Glory is, that it is <hi>Eternal</hi>; and ſo will never have an end: It is called <hi>eternal Life,</hi> an <hi>everlaſting Kingdom; A crown of glory that fadeth not away; an Inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi> And now here is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe this is a glory and happineſs ſuited to our rational Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is infinite goodneſs in GOD to provide a happineſs for his Creatures, ſo he diſcovers his wiſdom in ſuiting the happineſs to the nature of the Creature on whom he beſtows it. That which would be a compleat happineſs to one kind of Beings, would not be ſo to another: that which would be a compleat happineſs to a meer ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Creature, can by no means be ſufficient for a rational one. Now GOD has wiſely conſidered our frame and conſtitution, and has provided a happineſs that is altogether ſuitable to ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as ours. We are in our make and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution not meerly ſenſitive, but rational Creatures: we have rational and immortal Spirits formed within us; and as this is the moſt noble part of our conſtitution, ſo GOD has had a particular regard to the Soul in the happineſs he has provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for us. The good which he has laid up for them that love and fear his Name, is of ſuch a nature, as to gratify all the rational and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſires of our Souls, in a more eſpecial manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed many Men thro' the carnality of their hearts, and their having been ſtrangers to any other but ſenſual pleaſures, are ready to imagine
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:002987_0357_0FE6B2D6CDC01C70"/>
the happineſs of Heaven to conſiſt in the free and full gratification of their ſenſitive Appetites: but what a poor kind of happineſs would this be for a man, for a rational Being? What ſatisfaction would that be to a rational &amp; immortal Soul? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD in his infinite Wiſdom has conſidered us as Men, and not as Beaſts, in the happineſs he has reſerved in Heaven for us: and has ſuited it to our Superiour, that is to our Spiritual &amp; Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal part. But then as our bodily and fleſhly Appetites, if they are ungratifyed afford a great deal of uneaſineſs &amp; diſturbance to us, and would interrupt and hinder the Soul from taking the full delight and ſatisfaction in divine and ſpiritual Enjoyments; therefore GOD has wiſely taken care that we ſhall not carry ſuch groſs &amp; ſenſitive Appetites with us to Heaven. Theſe groſs and corruptible Bodies, and conſequently theſe groſs and carnal and ſenſitive Appetites will be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and our Bodies will be refined and ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized before they get to Heaven. They are to lye down in the Grave and ſee Corruption; but they will be refined in their Reſurrection; <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. And conſequently the deſires of the whole Man will be pure and ſpiritual in the Reſurrection State, and ſo the happineſs of Heaven which is of a ſpiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be altogether ſuited to our refined Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and will perfectly gratifie every deſire, we ſhall carry with us into that high &amp; holy place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe this is a glory and happineſs in, and by which the Grace of GOD is greatly Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Illuſtrate.</hi>

Surely GOD would have manifeſted his Mercy and Compaſſion, if he had only mitigated the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell; and a very high degree of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if he had entirely ſaved us from going down into the pit of everlaſting deſtruction altho' he had beſtowed no poſitive happineſs upon us. And it would be a further manifeſtation of divine Mercy and Grace, to have offered any, even the leaſt degree of poſitive happineſs unto us. But now what infinite riches of grace are manifeſted in beſtowing Heaven it ſelf with all the infinite glories of it upon us! It is an inſtance of grace and favour in a Prince to grant a bare Pardon to a Traitor: but how much greater grace to receive him into his boſom, and put all poſſible marks of kindneſs and reſpect upon him, and inrich him with every thing that he can deſire? But now ſuch Grace, yea infinitely greater Grace than that, is manifeſted in GOD's beſtowing eternal Life and Glory upon any of the Children of Men. Surely here is ſuch an unparallel'd inſtance of love and grace, that the Angels may well ſtand
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:002987_0359_0FE6B2D937DA8DB0"/>
and wonder at it, deſiring to look into it, and yet be never able to comprehend it, for <hi>it paſſeth Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe it is a glory and happineſs worthy of GOD to beſtow on ſuch as he adopts into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and makes his Heirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is highly proper that when GOD is pleaſed of his ſovereign grace to Adopt any of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; bring them into the high &amp; near relation of Children, he ſhould beſtow ſomething on them worthy of ſuch a Father, who is the high Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, to give to ſuch as are his Children and his Heirs. And now as GOD thro' the riches of ſovereign Grace has been pleaſed to make choice of ſome of the Children of Men, to make them his own Children by Regeneration, and by Adoption, ſo they are look'd upon &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Heirs of GOD, even Co-heirs with CHRIST. For thus the word of GOD allows us to argue, Rom. 8.17. <hi>And if Children then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Chriſt.</hi> Now I ſay, ſince they are the Children &amp; the Heirs of GOD, it is highly proper the Inheritance ſhould be ſuch an one as is worthy of ſuch a great, ſuch an heavenly Father to grant, and ſuitable for the Children of ſuch a Father to receive. And thus it is, for it is a glorious, and an eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; it is an Inheritance Incorruptible &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for them. It is an Inheritance that is large enough to afford a ſupply of every thing that can be deſired, and that can make us happy; and it is an Inheritance Intailed upon us for ever, of
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:002987_0360_0FE6B2DF4E1D5F70"/>
equal duration with our Immortal Souls. So that conſidering our Natures and Capacities, GOD could not beſtow a better Inheritance upon us, for it is as much as our Natures in their higheſt inlargements are capable of enjoying. So that how inlarged ſoever the expectations of GOD's Children are, from the conſideration of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a Father who is the ſovereign Lord Proprietor, &amp; Owner of all things, yet there won't be the leaſt fruſtration or diſappointment, nay it will infinitely ſurpaſs all their expectations; <hi>for Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Here is wiſdom inaſmuch as the nature of this Glory and Happineſs is ſuch, as conſiſts in the actual Praiſing and Glorifying of GOD Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have once and again obſerved, that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, wiſeſt and beſt end that GOD can ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is, <hi>His own Glory</hi>: and his infinite wiſdom diſcovers it ſelf in ordering every thing in ſuch a manner, as that his glory ſhall be advanced thereby And now this wiſdom diſcovers it ſelf in the Glory and Happineſs that GOD has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him. For the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of infinite wiſdom in this matter is, that we ſhould have ſuch divine, holy and gracious tempers &amp; diſpoſitions of Soul formed within us, and perfected when we get to Heaven, as that our higheſt Glory and Happineſs, and that which we ſhall take infinite delight and everlaſting ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in, will be the ſerving, praiſing and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying GOD with all our powers. Heaven, and

the happineſs of it is repreſented as conſiſting in our being imployed in giving <hi>Bleſſing, &amp; Honour, and Glory; and Power to him that ſitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever,</hi> in waiting his Commands, and in fulfilling his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This is the preſent happineſs of the holy Angels that are admitted into the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD, and are continually bowing before his throne, adoring and praiſing of him, miniſtring unto him, and ſtanding ready to do his Will.</p>
               <p>And this will be a great part of the happineſs of the Saints in Heaven. For their hearts will be ſo ſwallowed up in love to GOD, and the Lord JESUS CHRIST as that nothing will be ſo great a happineſs to them as to dwell in GOD's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and have ſenſible manifeſtations of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to be bowing before him in the loweſt poſtures of adoration, to be aſcribing greatneſs to their GOD, and giving to him the glory due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Name; in receiving, and then in fulfilling his Commands.</p>
               <p>And now ſurely this is wiſdom in GOD, ſo to ſanctify, change &amp; diſpoſe our hearts unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as that his glory, and our happineſs become not only conſiſtent, but even one and the ſame thing; inſomuch that by the glorifying GOD in the higheſt manner, we ſhall receive the fulleſt ſatisfaction, and taſte the higheſt delights, and pleaſures that we are capable of.</p>

               <p>And now in this appears the wiſdom of GOD.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Saints and true Believers are fitted for this heavenly Glory and Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is highly requiſite that ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by GOD for future Glory and Felicity, ſhould be fitted and qualified for it before hand; for to what purpoſe would it be to bring perſons to a ſtate of Glory and Happineſs that they have no notion of, nor delight in? Therefore this muſt be conſidered as an inſtance of wiſe and prudent management in GOD, that all ſuch as he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal Life &amp; Happineſs, he has taken care that they ſhould be fitted and qualified by his Grace for the Place, the Company, the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and Enjoyments of that glorious State. He receives none to that bleſſed Place that are in their fine, and under the power of their Luſts and Corruptions; he brings none thither that are not fit for the Company &amp; Society of Heaven: None that are not capable of the holy Exerciſes and Imployments, and capable of reliſhing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Heaven. <hi>They are made meet for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in light,</hi> before they are brought into the poſſeſſion of it. <hi>They are choſen to ſalvation thro' ſanctification of the ſpirit.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly all true Believers, who are the only

Heirs of the heavenly Glory, are renewed and ſanctifyed by the Grace &amp; Spirit of GOD. Their Souls are reſtored to their primitive rectitude and perfection: the Image of GOD, which conſiſts in knowledge, righteouſneſs and true holineſs, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impreſſed upon their natures; they are cleanſed from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in holineſs, and thereby are fitted for the preſence of the holy GOD, and to dwell in the high and holy place, and fitted for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of holy Angels, and to joyn with them in holy Exerciſes &amp; Imployments. And after ſuch a manner is every true Believer, who are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons GOP calls to his Kingdom and Glory, fitted and prepared for it beforehand. Every Saint has an heavenly temper wrought in him before ever he is brought to dwell in Heaven. They are all trained up in the buſineſs and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Heaven, whileſt they are here upon the Earth, inſomuch that Heaven may be ſaid be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with them, even whilſt they are here upon Earth: for the devout worſhipping and ſerving GOD in religious duties here in his Tabernacles below, and the ſweet communion &amp; fellowſhip, the delight and joy, the Saints do often experience in them, are emblems of the moſt glorious Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the raviſhing delights and joys of his Temple above. For the difference lies not ſo much in kind, as in perfection and degree. So that the Saints, the Children of GOD, and the Heirs of Heaven, are here in the School of Chriſt trained up to it whilſt on Earth; and when they are made meet for, they are received to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

There is no manner of congruity or agreableneſs between ſuch filthy and impure Creatures, and ſuch an high &amp; holy Place, but the utmoſt oppoſition and contrariety; and therefore it could not be conſiſtent with wiſdom to receive them to ſuch a Place. Moreover, it would be a great reflection upon the Holineſs of GOD; for who could have believed that he was as he declared himſelf, <hi>a God glorious in holineſs, and of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity,</hi> if he ſhould have received ſuch impure, vile and ſinful Creatures as we are by nature, into his moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable &amp; gracious preſence?

And ſo in ſhort, there is no perfection in GOD but what would ſuffer great diſhonour, if he ſhould admit any impure, unſanctifyed ones to partake of the heavenly Glory, while they remain ſuch; and therefore it is wiſely and prudently done by GOD, utterly and everlaſtingly to exclude them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is wiſdom in GOD to receive none but Saints, becauſe no other are fit for, or capable of the Imployments and Enjoyments of Heaven.</hi>

And what ſatisfaction could an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sinner that hates GOD, and all that it is good and holy, take in dwelling for ever in the preſence of GOD, and in being perpetually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſerving, praiſing &amp; glorifying of him? Surely all religious duties are a burthen and a weariſomneſs unto ſuch while here below, and if they carried the ſame temper to Heaven with them how would it be poſſible for them to take any pleaſure or ſatisfaction in ſpending an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in ſuch Exerciſes?

               <p>Now ſurely, it is wiſdom in GOD to exclude all ſuch as are ſo unfit for that glorious place; for why ſhould he receive ſuch into the heavenly Glory, that would not only pollute and defile the place, interrupt and diſturb the bleſſed Society there, but would deſpiſe and reject the glories of that place, and take no manner of delight or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in them!</p>

exceeding, and an eternal weight of Glory pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and provided, and offered and made over to every penitent and believing ſinner: I ſay, if we conſider theſe things, as they will fill us with the utmoſt joy and gladneſs, ſo they will fill us with wonder and aſtoniſhment; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of dwelling with devouring fire, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting with everlaſting burnings, (which is but the juſt deſert of our crimes) there are glorious Manſions prepared for us in Heaven, even in GOD's preſence where is fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand, where are rivers of pleaſures for evermore; we may well cry out with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and amazement, <hi>O the height, the depth, the lenght, and breadth of divine love!</hi> And now how ſhould this inflame our Souls with love, inlarge our hearts in thankfulneſs, and fill our Mouths with praiſes to the GOD of all Grace, who not only ſaves us from the wrath to come, but has called us to eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Since there is ſuch a glory and happineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the Saints, and reſerved in the Heaven for them, let us have our Eye continually upon it.</hi>

                  <p>We ſhould be frequently meditating upon the future glory and happineſs, we ſhould be often thinking with our ſelves of the greatneſs and the excellency of it: we ſhould conſider it as a good ſuited to our natures, to afford a perfect happineſs unto us; as that which is able to ſatisfie the moſt inlarged deſires of our Souls, and what is commenſurate alſo with the everlaſting duration of them. I ſay, let us muſe and meditate on this happineſs, and let us
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:002987_0369_0FE6B2F9DDBB05E0"/>
compare it with the world and all the fading glories of it: and it would ſerve wonderfully to fill us with an holy contempt of this world, and all its enjoyments. Then we ſhall ſee and be convinced, that there is nothing in this world, not all the pomp, riches and grandeur of it, to be compared with the glory that ſhall hereafter be revealed in us. The fervent, ſerious and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing thought of the heavenly glory, would raiſe up our affections from earth to Heaven; we ſhould then ſet our affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and not on things on the earth. If we would ſpend more time to think upon Heaven, and the happineſs of it, our Souls would not cleave unto the duſt, as now they do; we ſhould not look upon this world as our home, we ſhould not look upon the riches of it as our treaſures, nor content our ſelves with a portion here, but we ſhould be for laying up treaſures in Heaven. This would put us upon living above this world, and would q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icken us in our purſuit after, and preparations for the coming world. This would quicken us to endeavour after thoſe things that accompany Salvation, and that are neceſſary to qualify us for the Inheritance among them that are fanctifyed. Having this hope in us, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it frequently in exerciſe, we ſhall <hi>be purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, even is God is pure; cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſs in the fear of God</hi>; that ſo we may be fit <hi>for the high, and the holy place, into which nothing can enter that defiles.</hi> And it is becauſe Men don't take time to think of theſe things,
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:002987_0370_0FE6B2FB271BB418"/>
nor to bring themſelves to a realizing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, that they are ſo little affected with them, and are ſo careleſs in ſecuring an intereſt in them. Wherefore let us think more of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; leſs of the preſent world: and it is moſt certain, that if our treaſure was in Heaven, our hearts would be there alſo; yea, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation would then be more in Heaven than now it is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From what we have heard, we may gather one very good rule by which to judge of our ſelves, whether we have an intereſt in the future Glory, or not; Namely, our being fitted &amp; qualifyed for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For by what has been ſaid, we find that none ſhall ever go to Heaven, but ſuch as by the Grace of GOD are fitted and prepared for it. As the veſſels of wrath are <hi>fitted</hi> for deſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. ſo the veſſels of mercy are afore <hi>prepared</hi> unto glory and ſuch are made <hi>meet</hi> for the Inheritance among the Saints in light, before they become partakers of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. So that none can go to Heaven, but ſuch as are fit for the high and holy place. And therefore the beſt way to know whether we have an intereſt there, is to ſee, and examine our ſelves, whether we are fit for it: if we can find our ſelves fitted and prepared for Heaven, we may depend upon it that we have an intereſt, and ſhall in due time have an open entrance miniſtred to us into the everlaſting Kingdom. For GOD never fits a perſon for glory and happineſs, but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him unto it at laſt. But if we don't find our ſelves fitted for it, if we don't find a ſpiritual,
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:002987_0371_0FE6B2FB4EED55B8"/>
holy, heavenly frame of Spirit, producing a blameleſs, heavenly Converſation, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we have no lot or portion there.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us all Examine and Try our ſelves by this rule; let us look into our hearts, and let us obſerve our lives to ſee what manner of perſons we are. Let us ſee whether we have ſuch a ſuperlative love to GOD and CHRIST reigning in our Souls, as fills us with the moſt longing deſires after, and the greateſt delight in having Communion, and fellowſhip with the Father, and with the Son Chriſt Jeſus. Does it appear to us to be our greateſt happineſs, to dwell in the preſence of GOD, to be imployed in ſerving, praiſing and glorifying of him for ever? Have we ſuch an hatred of ſin, and love to holineſs wrought in our Souls, that Heaven recommends it ſelf to us chiefly, becauſe of its perfect purity and holineſs? Is the Society of the Saints on Earth the moſt delightful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to us? And is ſerious, ſpiritual, heavenly diſcourſe and converſation with them the moſt deſirable and delightful to us? Can we call the Sabbaths of the Lord our delight? And is it with the voice of joy and praiſe, that we go to the Houſe of the Lord, and attend upon him in the duties of Religion? Now if we can find theſe things in us we find a heavenly temper, and a fitneſs for Heaven, and may upon good grounds depend upon obtaining an Entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; theſe heavenly qualifications are earneſts and pledges of the glory &amp; happineſs we ſhall at length be brought to the poſſeſſion of.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="367" facs="unknown:002987_0372_0FE6B309A421ADF8"/>4. <hi>Hence the unreaſonableneſs &amp; folly of thoſe that expect Heaven and Happineſs, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a graceleſs Unconverted State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GOD in his infinite wiſdom has ſeen cauſe for ever to Exclude ſuch the Kingdom of Heaven, who have not been born again, but live and dye in their ſins; and from what we have heard, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſee there is a great deal of reaſon for it. Now therefore what folly is it for an obſtinate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner to hope for or expect it, whilſt he continues in ſuch a ſtate? For Heaven, as we have ſaid, is an high and holy place, into which nothing ſhall or can enter that defiles, that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abomination, or that maketh a lye. Now he that is under the guilt, and filth of ſin, having never been waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, muſt needs be very polluting &amp; defiling to the holy place: and therefore 'tis not poſſible for ſuch an one to enter. Moreover, how can a Man with all his ſins upon him think of approaching before the holy GOD? With what face could he appear in his preſence, that has ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him, before he has humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the very duſt for his ſin, and has obtained pardon and reconciliation with GOD thro' Chriſt? But if we ſhould ſuppoſe that GOD would deny himſelf ſo far, as to permit ſuch an one to enter thro' the gates into the celeſtial City, what would he do there? You that never loved GOD, nor any of his ways here on earth, and whoſe language to GOD has been, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways</hi>; what pleaſure can you think of taking in
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:002987_0373_0FE6B309B95A28D0"/>
approaching before GOD in paying religious Worſhip and Adoration to him for ever, when the ſhort ſervices of his worſhip are ſuch a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſomneſs and burden to you whilſt on earth? You that never loved the Saints on earth, but hated, deſpiſed &amp; rejected them, with what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure can you think of being linked to them for ever? Or what pleaſure could you take in them? Verily you would be burdenſome and uneaſy to each other. In ſhort, as the Apoſtle argues, 2 Cor. 6.14, 15. <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs? and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> No more fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, concord or communion could an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner have with Chriſt, or with the Saints in Heaven. So that it is the greateſt preſumption, folly and madneſs in the world, for any whilſt under the dominion of ſin, to think of going to Heaven; for they will moſt certainly be diſappointed. Such are ſo unfit, as well as unworthy of that place, that it is impoſſible for them to gain admiſſion; the gates of Heaven will be ſhut againſt them, and altho' they cry, Lord, Lord open unto us, it will be in vain, and CHRIST their Judge will in his Wiſdom and Juſtice ſay, Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity.</p>

               <p>IT is the finiſhing ſtroke of our Redemption that is yet under conſideration, Namely, our <hi>Glorification</hi>: Under which head I have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething of the nature of the future glory and happineſs reſerved in Heaven for us, and the wiſdom of GOD appearing therein. I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerved to you the wiſdom of GOD appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the perſons appointed to partake of this glory and happineſs that is to come, <hi>viz</hi> the Saints and they only; they, and only they, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed &amp; ſanctified by the ſaving Grace of GOD.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Evidences and Aſſurances which GOD is pleaſed to give us, that there is ſuch a Glory and Happineſs prepared for us, is a further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the divine Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now GOD is giving us Evidences and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances hereof,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In his holy Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therein we have Him aſſerting and declaring that this ſhall be the Portion of all true Believers. Thus our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25 46. <hi>Theſe,</hi> that is, the wicked, <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi> So Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So, Rom. 2.7. <hi>To them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour and immortality, eternal life.</hi> And ſo in a multitude of other places, is eternal life &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:002987_0375_0FE6B30CF5C06BF8"/>
ſpoken of as what every true Believer ſhall be received unto: And it is ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and that from the beginning before the World began. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, hath promiſed before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> Tit 1.2. But then there is not only the word and promiſe of GOD, but he has for the further certainty of it confirmed it by an Oath. Heb. 6.17, 18. <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w unto the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have a strong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</hi> And now theſe exceeding great &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes being thus confirmed, make it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evident that there is a glory &amp; a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs prepared for all the Children of GOD, to which they ſhall be received. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, there is Almighty Power whereby he is able to accompliſh his promiſes. None can oppoſe or hinder him from accompliſhing every word that he hath ſpoken. He has the keys of Heaven, as well as of Hell, &amp; of Death: as he can ſhut, and none can open; ſo he can open, and none can ſhut.</p>
               <p>And then again, theſe promiſes are ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed by Infinite &amp; Immenſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which inclines and diſpoſes GOD to do good to all his Creatures, and eſpecially to fulfill all the good that he has promiſed to them.</p>
               <p>Again, the infinite Juſtice of GOD ſerves to ſtrengthen the promiſes; for altho' eternal Life
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:002987_0376_0FE6B31586EFDD18"/>
be the free gift of GOD unto us; yet conſidering it with reſpect to Chriſt our Mediator &amp; Surety, it is no more than is juſtly due; for he purchaſed it for us, and now according to the tenor of the new Covenant, it is an act of Juſtice in GOD to beſtow this glory upon the Saints; and we are ſure that <hi>the Judge of all the earth will do right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then laſtly, there is the immutable Truth and Faithfulneſs of GOD, whereby he is not only always of the ſame mind he was when he made the promiſes; but is alſo obliged to fulfill them, and to ſuffer Heaven &amp; Earth ſooner to paſs away, than one word that he hath ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>GOD is giving Evidences of the future Glory, by the conduct of his Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For every one muſt acknowledge there is a great and real difference between Saints &amp; Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that the Saints who love GOD with all their hearts, and keep his Commandments ſhall be diſtinguiſhed by the divine Favours.</p>
               <p>But now we find by Experience, that there is no remarkable difference in this life, with reſpect to the diſpenſations of divine Providence; for as the Preacher ſays Eccl. 9.2. <hi>All things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an Oath.</hi> Oftentimes the wicked proſper and grow great in the world, they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued as other men. They live at eaſe, and have no bands in their
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:002987_0377_0FE6B31599E12AF8"/>
death. <hi>Whilst ſome of the Saints are chaſtned every morning, and plagued all the day long.</hi> And now altho' this is at firſt apt to excite the envy of the Saints, &amp; tempts them before they have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 73.13. <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain.</hi> Yet upon a thorow conſideration, it will be found that theſe are the Providences that afford the moſt comfortable Evidences of the future Glory and Happineſs reſerved in Heaven for them.</p>
               <p>If GOD ſhould make a very remarkable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the righteous and the wicked in this world; that is, if he ſhould cauſe goodneſs and mercy to follow the Saints, even all their days, ſo as to make whatever they do to proſper; and ſhould be conſtantly purſuing the wicked with plagues and judgments, till he had cut them off; we ſhould be ready to look upon this preſent world as the place of rewards and puniſhments, and that the portion of the Godly was in this life. But now ſince the goods and evils of this life are ſo promiſcuouſly diſpenſed to the Children of Men, we may ſtrongly and ſafely argue with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 58.11. <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</hi> As certainly as he is GOD that judgeth in the Earth, ſo certainly there is a reward for the righteous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>GOD is giving ſome ſecret, but as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Evidences hereof unto his Children, by his holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus GOD by his holy Spirit removes all the doubts and uncertainties that are in our minds,
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:002987_0378_0FE6B317B08F0BA8"/>
with reſpect to the truth and reallity of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; he takes out of them their evil hearts of unbelief, ſo that they are no longer faithleſs but believing; the Spirit of GOD endows them with that <hi>Faith which is the ſubſtance,</hi> or confident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation <hi>of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> He enables them to look upon the promiſes, altho' they are afar off, to be as certain as if they were already accompliſhed. Moreover, the Spirit of GOD enables them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the promiſes to their own Souls, to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as having an Intereſt in them, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heaven, and the glories of it as their own. And this the Spirit does by witneſſing together with their ſpirits, that they are the Children of GOD; and ſo enabling them to argue, as in Rom. 8.17. <hi>If Children then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then ſometimes the Spirit affords to them a more ſenſible and affecting evidence of their right and title to Heaven, and of the certainty of their going to poſſeſs that joy &amp; happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by pledges, earneſts and foretaſtes thereof, which he gives the Soul. Chriſt is ſometimes pleaſed to make very glorious manifeſtations of himſelf, and of the future, glory by his Spirit, to Believers; they are put into ſuch a heavenly frame, and are in ſuch raptures and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>GOD knows our frame and conſtitution, and how much we are moved by our hopes &amp; fears; He knows that the proſpect of a reward is one of the moſt powerful motives to duty. And atlho' he requires that we ſhould be influenced to duty from a ſenſe of his Authority, and ſhould act from a principle of Obedience; yet he allows us to have an eye to the recompence of reward, and accordingly propoſes the ſame unto us, to animate and encourage us in the ways of well doing; and ſurely it is a moſt powerful motive, and ſerves wonderfully to encourage us not only to engage in the practice of Religion, but to perſevere therein. It muſt needs be a mighty encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſons to forſake their ſins, and turn into
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:002987_0381_0FE6B32219529310"/>
the paths of righteouſneſs, to be aſſured that as ſin, <hi>when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death</hi>; ſo that <hi>in the way of righteouſneſs is life, and in the path-way thereof is no death.</hi> What could be a more powerful motive, to engage with all our might in the ſervice of GOD, than to be aſſured that none ſhall ſerve him for nought, but that as certainly as he is, ſo certainly he will be a reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them that diligently ſeek him? The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that GOD has given of the future glory, is well contrived to carry us thro' the duties of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and ſelf-denyal; to bear with patience the afflictions and troubles of the preſent life This will enable us patiently and chearfully to bear afflictions with the people of GOD, rather than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, being aſſured that theſe light afflictions which are but for a moment, will work out for us a far more exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory. What could ſupport the Saints under all the difficulties they meet with in their Chriſtian Courſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to perſevere in ways of well doing unto the end, but only the evidence and aſſurance that GOD has given them that they ſhall reap eternal life, if they faint not, but are faithful unto the death?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It ſerves wonderfully to ſupport the Saints, under the fears of Death, and to carry them comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably thro' their Great and Laſt change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death is the king of Terrors: Nature abhors a diſſolution, and ſhrinks at the thoughts of it: ſo that the Saints and Children of GOD need ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſupport them in a dying hour; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:002987_0382_0FE6B3243B301D68"/>
to enable them to look death in the face with courage, and with calmneſs of Spirit to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the fatal ſtroke. And now what could be contrived to afford ſo much courage and comfort to them at ſuch a time, as the joyful proſpect and aſſurance of a glorious Immortality after this life is ended? What can be a greater ſupport to us at our leaving the preſent world &amp; all our friends, eſtates, and earthly comforts behind us, than the hopeful proſpect of going to GOD the beſt friend of all, to the delightful company of Angels and Saints made perfect, and to the poſſeſſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ſubſtantial and enduring riches, honours, and pleaſures, than this world can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afford us? What better cordial could be provided for a fainting dying Saint, when the world, and all things here below fail, and when his fleſh and his heart fail, than the comfortable evidences of GOD's love, and the aſſurances that he will never leave nor forſake him; but will be the ſtrength of his heart, and the portion of his Soul for ever? Verily there is nothing can afford ſo much courage, and patience, under the laſt ſtruggles of nature, and the dreadful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of Death, as the proſpect of having the ſcene ſo quickly changed, and that their paſſing thro' the dark valley of the ſhadow of death is only to bring them to that glorious place, where all tears ſhall be for ever wiped away from their eyes, where there ſhall be no more ſickneſs, nor pain, nor any more death. So that GOD has wiſely and graciouſly conſidered us, in making known his purpoſes of mercy and grace to us:
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:002987_0383_0FE6B32455296B60"/>
how could we have been moved to our duty, or left without excuſe, if we had neglected it? how could we have been ſupported under the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs troubles, and ſorrows of the preſent life; and how could we have been comforted in the hour of death, if GOD had not brought life and immortality to light, and aſſured us of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſt that remains in Heaven for the People of GOD!</p>
               <p>But thus much for the wiſdom of GOD in the Evidences and Aſſurances he is giving us of the future glory.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to ſay in the next place,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If we conſider the Way and Manner by which the Saints are brought to this Glory &amp; Happineſs, we ſhall ſee much of the wiſdom of GOD therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They muſt paſs thro' the dark valley of the ſhadow of death, before they arrive to the Regions of Light and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is appointed for all men once to die, Heb. 9.27. <hi>And what man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death? Shall he deliver his ſoul from the hand of the grave?</hi> Pſal. 89.48. The Saints are no more exempted from this decree of Heaven than Sinners: there is no diſcharge in that war for any; the ſecond death devours one as well as another. The Saints in all Ages have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death as well as other men, and have not arrived to Heaven and Happineſs, but by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going this diſſolution of nature. <hi>Abraham, Moſes, David, Paul,</hi> and all the moſt celebrated Saints that have been in the world, have paſſed to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:002987_0384_0FE6B32FF7C9B148"/>
thro' this dark valley. Indeed there are two and but two inſtances from the beginning of the world to this day, that have eſcaped the mortal ſtroke, and without taſting of death, did paſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Soul &amp; Body into Heaven, (only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing, as we may ſuppoſe ſuch a change as will paſs upon thoſe who ſhall be found alive at our Lord's appearing in Judgment) Namely <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah.</hi> And here by the way I cannot but obſerve the wiſdom of GOD in theſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in giving to theſe eminent Saints an immediate paſſage to Heaven, for among other things this great &amp; good end was anſwered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>viz.</hi> A confirming to the world not only the Doctrine of the future State, but of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body in particular. For when they were ſeen or known to be tranſlated up to glory, it muſt needs afford a very convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to the other Saints, that they ſhall at length come to the participation of the ſame glory, even the glory and happineſs of the whole man, body as well as Soul, altho' the man firſt be made to ſee corruption; and from a ſtate of corruption be raiſed to a glorious immortality, from which thoſe two eminent Saints were freed.</p>
               <p>And then again, we may ſee more of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD, if we conſider the particular times when theſe perſons were in ſuch an extraordinary manner taken up to Heaven. Thus the firſt tranſlation, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch</hi> was in the old world before the flood. The ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Elijah</hi> was under the law; by which there has been a very convincing Teſtimony both to the
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:002987_0385_0FE6B3300F34FD78"/>
old world, and thoſe that lived under the law, of the Reſurrection of the body, and the future State. And as for the Goſpel-ſtate, there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed life &amp; immortality are brought to a much clearer light, not only from the much clearer and fuller account that is given of the matter in the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, than of the old, but alſo from the Example of Chriſt's own Reſurrection from the Dead, and viſible Aſcenſion into Heaven.</p>
               <p>So that there has been a ſenſible teſtimony given for the Reſurrection of the body, and the future ſtate to the three grand Ages of the world; Namely, the <hi>Antediluvian,</hi> the <hi>Legal,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; which ſhews the wiſe &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care GOD has taken to ſupport the ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith of his Church, in the ſeveral Ages of it.</p>
               <p>And then again, as GOD deſigned to make the diſcovery of theſe things in a gradual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo we may obſerve the divine wiſdom in managing theſe tranſlations or aſcenſions into Heaven in ſuch a manner, as to render each one a brighter, and fuller Evidence than the other; thus as to <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was the firſt, we have no further account of his tranſlation, than that <hi>He was not, for God took him,</hi> Gen. 5.24. but no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the circumſtances of it. But in the tranſlation of <hi>Elijah,</hi> the Sons of the Prophets were apprized of it before hand, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> his Succeſſor was made an eye-witneſs of it: for he ſaw the <hi>Chariot of fire, and the horſes of fire,</hi> that came to wait upon his Maſter, and ſaw him actually go up in a whirlwind into Heaven,
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:002987_0386_0FE6B331286ADCE0"/>
2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3, 11. But when life &amp; immortality was to be brought to the cleareſt light, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is more according to the manner, that all the Saints ſhall be received up to glory; for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſubmitted to the ſtroke of death, and then aroſe again from the dead, of which he gave many infallible proofs, being ſeen of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and of the twelve; yea, and of above five hundred at once, and then was ſeen of the Apoſtles actually to aſcend into Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9, 10. But thus much for this Digreſſion. I now proceed to ſhow the wiſdom of GOD in making it the common lot and portion of the Saints to paſs thro' the dark valley of the ſhadow of death before they aſcend to glory. And it is an inſtance of wiſdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is but agreable to the threatning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt our firſt Parents, and all their Poſterity, for their Sin and Apoſtacy from GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD threatned our firſt Parents, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, <hi>That in the day they eat thereof they ſhould ſurely dye,</hi> Gen. 2.7. Now as they were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the Repreſentatives of Mankind and acting in this capacity, when they eat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, ſo we all became equally expoſed to the threatned penalty, &amp; accordingly brought into a mortal dying ſtate: according to what the Apoſtle tells us, Rom. 5.12. <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world, &amp; death by ſin: and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that</hi> (or as in the Margin) <hi>in whom, all have ſinned.</hi> And now altho' with
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:002987_0387_0FE6B331426FFA48"/>
reſpect to the Saints &amp; true Believers, the ſting of death is taken away, and it is made a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and a happy change to them; yet GOD ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges them to undergo this diſſolution, that ſo the letter of the law in the threatning may be executed &amp; thereby the Truth of GOD effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſecured, even altho' it be turned to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One good <hi>End anſwered by the death of the Saints, is the frequent manifeſtation of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power of divine Grace at ſuch a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no time ſo trying to a Man as when Death approaches, and ſtares him in the face and he expects in a few days or hours to leave the world, and take an everlaſting farewell of all things in it; to endure the agonies of death, and then to lye down in the rotting Grave, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to ſee corruption. But now GOD often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times takes ſuch opportunities to diſcover the Power of divine Grace in the Souls of his Saints, and Servants; by enabling them at ſuch times to ſhew ſuch a ſteddy faith and hope, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in GOD; ſuch patience, ſubmiſſion and reſignation, ſuch calmneſs, peace and joy, which nothing leſs than the ſupernatual Grace of GOD is able to effect. How does the Power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace appear in thoſe Saints to whom GOD is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o far, as to give them aſſurance of their future good eſtate, in inabling them to receive the arreſts of death, not only with calmneſs, and compoſedneſs of mind, but with holy triumph, and joy, from the delightful proſpect of being preſent with the
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:002987_0388_0FE6B33A8C3FD570"/>
Lord, when abſent from the body, to behold and partake of his Glory? How powerful does the Grace of GOD appear in ſuch, who from a firm belief of the future State, of that glory, honour and immortality which they are intitled to, can in holy triumph ſay, as 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57. <hi>O Death where is thy ſting? O Grave where is thy victory? the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law, but thanks be to God that giveth us the victory, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Death of the Saints ſeems requiſite, in order to their laying aſide their preſent Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their entring upon an Incorruptible and Immortal Sate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bodies we at preſent carry about with us, are <hi>Corruptible bodies.</hi> Now it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to our entring into the heavenly State, that theſe groſs, heavy, infirm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active bodies ſhould be laid aſide, as being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit for that pure and holy place; or for thoſe refined, and ſpiritual Exerciſes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. Now therefore GOD has wiſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it that we ſhould put off theſe clayie, mouldering tabernacles, in order to our receiving more glorious, and perfect ones at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruction, even more refined and ſpiritual bodies, which will be more fit habitations for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt Men, that will be made perfect, and be no clog and hindrance to the Soul in any of its operations. And this is the account the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gives of the matter, ſpeaking of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, and of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bodies they lay down, and thoſe they
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:002987_0389_0FE6B33A9F3D7F60"/>
ſhall aſſure at the Reſurrection, 1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44. <hi>It is ſown in corruption, is is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power; it is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi> In ſhort, the changing our vile bodies by Death is, as the Apoſtle ſays, for this reaſon, which is certainly a very ſufficient one, Namely, that <hi>they may be faſhoned like unto Chriſt's glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is wiſdom in GOD to order Saints as well as Sinners, to paſs thro' the dark valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, becauſe of the Inconveniency that would ariſe from their poſſing out of the world after a different manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, if there was only this one Inconvenience in it, viz. <hi>That then every man's State with reſpect to another World would be certainly known, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of his paſſing out of the world, by those that are left behind</hi>: I ſay, if there was only this inconvenience, it would be ſufficient to ſhow the divine Prudence in ordering the ſame way of going out of the world both to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to the wicked. If there was any difference made between Saints and Sinners in the way of their leaving the world; that is, if the righteous ſhould be ſo far priviledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to eſcape the pangs of death, and be tranſlated, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi>; but Sinners ſhould be ſubject to the ſtroke of death, then only by knowing which way a man made his Exit, by
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:002987_0390_0FE6B33BB8518AA0"/>
tranſlation, or by death, we ſhould certainly kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w what is become of him, whether he is gone with the wicked into everlaſting puniſhment; or with the righteous into life Eternal But now what inconveniency would ariſe from the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this!</p>
               <p>For altho' we pay ſuppoſe it would afford the greateſt comfort to mourning Relations, to ſee their friends going out of the world in the way aſſigned for the righteous, becauſe this would give them an aſſurance that they are gone to glory and happineſs; yet on the other hand, how inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table would be the grief and the diſtreſs of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Parents, eſpecially, when their Children ſhould be taken from them in the way aſſigned, for the wicked, by which they would certainly know that they are loſt for ever, that they are gone to Hell, to ſuffer the vengeance of eternal Fire!</p>
               <p>It is very cutting and diſtreſſing to have any near Relation go out of the world, That we fear is gone to the place of Hypocrites &amp; Unbelievers: but there is now generally ſome hope mixed with their fears; there is at leaſt a <hi>Who can tell but they have found mercy at the laſt</hi>! Which abates of that diſtreſs of Soul there would be, if we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments. Surely the certain knowledge that our Children (whom we love as our ſelves, and with whom we have the moſt tender ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy) are gone to dwell with devouring fire, and to inhabit with everlaſting burnings, ſeems to be too much for us to bear under our preſent frame, the ſtrength of natural affection, and the
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:002987_0391_0FE6B33BD2117530"/>
preſent Imperfection as to the degrees of Grace afforded to us. But now in the other world when we ſhall be made perfect in holineſs, we ſhall in a ſort loſe that natural affection that ariſe from the nearneſs of Relation; <hi>we ſhall know,</hi> i. e. ſhall acknowledge, reſpect or regard <hi>no man after the fleſh</hi> The love of the Saints in the future ſtate, will be fixed on perſons, not becauſe of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Relation they bore to them in this life, but becauſe of the goodneſs and holineſs they behold in them. And ſo a Parent will then much more eaſily bear to hear the Sentence of Condemnation pronounced upon a wicked Child, than at preſent.</p>
               <p>But Then further, what an ill improvement would be made of ſuch a certain knowledge, with reſpect to every man's future ſtate, as there would be, if there was a conſtant difference between Saints and Sinners, as to the manner of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hence! Then we ſhould find ſome among Sinners, and gone to the place of Torments, who by their profeſſion and outward carriage, every man reckoned among the Saints: And how would this cauſe the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme? And how would it prejudice them againſt the ways of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make them ſuſpicious of and uncharitable towards many Chriſtians that are ſincere, and upright before GOD? Then alſo we ſhould perhaps ſee many whom we ranked with the wicked to belong to the number of the righteous, and how would this Encourage the wicked to indulge themſelves in thoſe things which thoſe that went before them had been guilty of, and yet found mercy. And
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:002987_0392_0FE6B347462CFA78"/>
many other inconveniences would ariſe from the certain knowledge of every man's ſtate that are gone out of the world; and therefore GOD in wiſdom has hid it from us by ſo ordering it that there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, with reſpect to their leaving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world; ſo that no man can know either love or hatred by the manner of his departure: for all die; as dyeth the Sinner, ſo dyeth the Saint, as to the external cauſe of it. And altho' the Souls immediately upon their departure from the body go to very different places, yet this is inviſible, and unknown to us that ſurvive; and we muſt wait till we get among them, if not till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the Judgment, before we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know what is become of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Another ſtep the Saints are to take in order to their arriving at perfect bliſs and happineſs, and in which alſo the wiſdom of GOD appears, is the Reſurrection of their bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine of the Reſurrection of the body (how unknown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſoever to the heathen world, and how incredible ſoever it appeared to them when they firſt heard of it) is nevertheleſs a doctrine according to Truth. For we have not only the Example of Chriſts own Reſurrection, who is head of the Church, which is his body, and every particular Believer a Member of this body, from whence we may argue their Reſurrection; for if the head be riſen, the members will alſo follow: and hence Chriſt in his Reſurrection, is ſaid to <hi>become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. But it is expreſsly taught in the word of
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:002987_0393_0FE6B347590E69D8"/>
GOD, and univerſally believed by the People of GOD; the old-Teſtament Doctrine was, that <hi>Death ſhould be ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> Iſai. 25.8. And Chriſt in the new Teſtament ſays expreſsly, That <hi>the hour is coming in which all that are in their Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, to the Reſurrection of life,</hi> Joh. 5.28, 29. Now this is wiſely ordered by GOD.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe it will be a glorious Manifeſtation of the wonderful Power of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was infinite Power, as well as Wiſdom, and Skill, diſplayed in forming our bodies at firſt out of the duſt of the Earth; and there will be as glorious a Manifeſtation hereof in raiſing them up again at the laſt day; when they have been diſſolved into duſt and ſcattered upon the face of the whole Earth. The doctrine of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeem'd incredible to the heathen world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the difficulties that appeared in it; but the more difficult the work is, the more glorious manifeſtation there will be of the divine Power in accompliſhing it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe it is very requiſite for Compleating the future Glory and Happineſs of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The happineſs of the Soul in its ſeparate ſtate is not the full and compleat happineſs of the Man; for the body is an eſſential part of the humane Conſtitution, and there is not a perfect Man but where Soul and Body are united, and conſequently not a perfect happineſs to the Man, but where both the eſſential parts of his nature are ſharers in it. Now therefore as GOD de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:002987_0394_0FE6B34871921BF8"/>
the happineſs of the Saints in Heaven ſhould be perfect and compleat; ſo it is neceſſary that their bodies be raiſed, that they might be glorified, and made happy with the Soul: and it is neceſſary that it ſhould be raiſed a ſpiritual body, that it might be more like unto the Soul, and ſo inſtead of clogging or hindring, they may be helpful to each other in their operations, and enjoyments in the heavenly world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Another thing neceſſary in order to the Saints arriving at the future Glory, (and in which there appears much of the wiſdom of GOD) is their Appearing before the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST, to be tryed and judged, according as their works have been.</hi>

               <p>As it is appointed for all Men once to dye, ſo after that is the Judgment. And we are expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told, That <hi>we muſt all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10.</p>
               <p>Now here I might obſerve the wiſdom of GOD,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Perſon appointed to be the Judge of the World, Namely, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For he is the moſt ſuitable Perſon that can be for that Office.</p>
               <p>His par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aking both of the divine &amp; the humane Natures, peculiarly qualifies him beyond any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon for Judge of the World.</p>
               <p>His partaking of the divine Nature eminently qualifies him for it; as hereby he is Omniſcient, and ſo can't be deceived, or impoſed on: He muſt needs be alſo infinite in Juſtice, and ſo will do right, and can do no wrong. Moreover as he
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:002987_0395_0FE6B3488AB45F28"/>
is GOD, he is Omnipotent, whereby he is able to execute every Sentence that he pronounceth.</p>
               <p>And then his being <hi>Man,</hi> was a further quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of him for a Judge among the Children of Men. His being of our own Nature aſſures us that he is our friend, and having been touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, having been tempted in all things like as we are, we may conclude that he will make as favourable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for our Infirmities, and imperfections, as can be conſiſtent with the honour of GOD. And thus becauſe GOD had determined to judge the world in righteouſneſs, and becauſe he would have that grand affair carried on with all poſſible fairneſs, and impartiality, he committed it to his Son, the Man Chriſt Jeſus: which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is given for it, Joh. 3.27. <hi>And hath</hi> (i. e. the Father hath) <hi>given him authority to execute Judgment, becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I might obſerve the wiſdom of GOD <hi>in the pomp and glory with which the Son of GOD will appear to judge the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Son of GOD appears to judge the quick and dead, he will appear in Power and great Glory; with his own Glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy Angels; which ſeems to be a piece of honour highly neceſſary to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him. For ſince his firſt appearance was in the form of a Servant, and with all the marks of external meanneſs, and poverty (which indeed very well became the deſign of his firſt coming, which was to make reconciliation for ſins by bearing them in his own body on the tree:)
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:002987_0396_0FE6B353803F00E8"/>
So when he appears again (which will be upon another occaſion, even to ſet as the glorious Judge of the World) it is highly proper for him to appear after a different manner, even with Power and Glory, that ſo thoſe who deſpiſed and rejected him, becauſe he was a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, might ſee and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to conſider what a glorious Perſon they offered ſuch contempt unto. Moreover, this is the way to have the proceſs of that great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table day of the Lord be as it ought, very <hi>auguſt and ſolemn.</hi> And then laſtly, this glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt to Judgment, as it will ſerve to terrifie and torment the wicked, ſo it will be for the comfort and the joy of the Saints. This coming of his with his mighty Angels, as it will be to take vengeance on them that know not GOD, and that obey not his Goſpel; ſo it will be to be glorifyed in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I might alſo obſerve, that GOD's not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Saints to their full glory before they have paſſed a tryal, and have been acquitted, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded at the bar of Chriſt, is wiſely ordered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For hereby the divine Juſtice &amp; Impartiality will be ſufficiently vindicated, even whilſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſome to everlaſting life; and at the ſame time ſends others away into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>When every Saint paſſes an exact tryal at the Bar of Chriſt, and gives an account unto his Judge of his behaviour in the body; and when Chriſt proceeds with him according to the rules of the
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:002987_0397_0FE6B353932B8050"/>
Goſpel which he lived under, (for I meddle with none but ſuch as are under the Goſpel) it will then very clearly appear that with righteouſneſs he judges the world, and the people with equity. It will then appear to his immortal honour, that he who is the Judge of all the Earth will do right, and that with him is no reſpect of perſons, that he acquits none but ſuch as according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant are to be acquitted and diſcharged. And that he condemns none that according to the Covenant of Grace could lay any claim unto a pardon: ſo that Chriſt in going by a certain rule in Judging, without the leaſt bias by favour or affection will give occaſion for that ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, to be ſung of all the Angels and Saints that are about his throne of Judgment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3, 4. — <hi>Juſt and true are thy ways, thou king of Saints: who ſhall not fear thee, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus as the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt will be vindicated and honoured, ſo the Saints themſelves by being brought to Judgment, will be vindicated from all thoſe aſperſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and reflections that have been unjuſtly and uncharitably caſt upon them in this world: and it gives alſo an opportunity for the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the virtues and graces, and good deeds of the Saints to the world of Angels and Men, to their immortal honour; by which means the Saints coming to a tryal, is of unſpeakable advantage to them, as well as great glory to GOD himſelf.</p>
               <p>And now when the Judgment is over, when every Man has received a ſentence according as
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:002987_0398_0FE6B354E2C1FEB8"/>
his works have been; when the Saints have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the bleſſed ſentence, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you</hi>: and the wicked have received that dreadful heart-breaking ſentence, <hi>Go, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels</hi>; and are accordingly bound hand and foot, and caſt into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, to endure that ſtrange puniſhment reſerved for the workers of iniquity; Then ſhall the Saints aſcend with Chriſt, and all the Multitudes of the heavenly Hoſts (that waited on him) into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſhall go every one to thoſe Manſions of Glory, which he is now preparing for them, and ſhall there partake of ſuch a glory and happineſs as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it ſo much as entred into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of: And there to continue not for a few days or years only, but throughout the infinite Ages of ETERNITY.</p>
               <p>And thus I have gone thro' the whole affair of our Redemption, from the foundation to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſtroke of it, and in every ſtep hereof we have ſeen ſo much of divine wiſdom &amp; prudence appearing, and manifeſting it ſelf, as may well fill us all with the moſt admiring &amp; adoring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of that GOD, who has with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable and unerring wiſdom conducted and managed this whole affair, cauſing us to break forth with the Apoſtle, Rom. 11.33. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom &amp; knowledge of God!</hi>

               <p>THE Doctrine which has been ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, is, as you may remember, this:</p>
               <p>Namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in the grand affair of our Redemption by JESUS CHRIST, there have been glorious Manifeſtations of divine Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the illuſtrating and confirming this Doctrine, I have ſhown wherein Wiſdom and Prudence conſiſts. I have likewiſe ſhewn in general, that the wiſdom of GOD has been clearly manifeſted in the work of Redemption: 1. From the End that was propoſed herein; Namely, the Manifeſtation of the Glory of GOD. And then 2ly. The difficulty &amp; ſeeming impoſſibility of accompliſhing this End in our Redemption. And laſtly, by ſhewing how fully this grand end and deſign of GOD has been accompliſhed in the Redemption of fallen Man through JESUS CHRIST, by the glorious Manifeſtations there have been of all the divine perfections in this ſtupendous work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="unknown:002987_0401_0FE6B3C0EB733EC8"/>Since that I have deſcended into particular Inſtances relating to our Redemption, and have ſhown how the wiſdom of GOD thinks in them, from the wiſe and good ends that have been anſwered thereby. Thus, I have particularly conſidered the wiſdom of GOD in refuſing to treat with ſinful Man any other way than by a <hi>Mediator</hi>: And in his inſiſting upon <hi>full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> for the wrong done to him by Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would remit or pardon it. The divine wiſdom has likewiſe been conſidered in <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own, and only Son to be the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us</hi>: As alſo in the <hi>Promiſes and Propheſies</hi> that were delivered concerning him, before his coming. — In his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and the manner of his aſſuming the humane Nature into perſonal Union with the divine Nature. — In the <hi>particular time and ſeaſon</hi> of his appearing in the world. — In the <hi>poverty and meanneſs</hi> of his outward circumſtances. — In the <hi>Methods that were taken to prove him to be the true Meſſiah,</hi> the Anointed and Choſen of GOD. — In his <hi>taking up his abode with us for ſo long a time.</hi> — In the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that he taught us, and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> that he ſet before us. — In his <hi>cruel Sufferings, and occurſed Death.</hi> — In his <hi>glorious Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>triumphant Aſcenſion.</hi> — And laſtly. In the Methods taken for the <hi>Propagating and Eſtabliſhing Christianity</hi> in the world. I ſay the wiſdom of GOD in all theſe Inſtances has been particularly conſidered.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I have conſidered, <hi>the Nature of that Redemption,</hi> which Chriſt has wrought
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:002987_0402_0FE6B3C80803C5E8"/>
out for us; and the <hi>Manner of his Applying the ſame unto us.</hi> Under which head I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly and largely conſidered the Nature and manner of a Sinner's <hi>Juſtification</hi>; of his <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> and of his <hi>progreſs in Grace and Holineſs</hi>; and the <hi>divine Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him,</hi> till he receives him to compleat <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> In all which I have particularly traced the footſteps of divine wiſdom, and ſhown what wiſe, great and good Ends have been anſwered, and what Inconveniences would have happened if things had been ordered other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. So that every thing relating to this grand affair appears to be managed with conſummate wiſdom and prudence. And there don't appear the leaſt error or miſtake, ſo much as in one Article, from the beginning to the end: but every thing has been ſo wiſely and thorowly concerted, as to be done in the beſt manner that could be—.

                  <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Glory that ſhould follow to him, and the Grace &amp; Salvation that is brought about

hereby to Men, by the application of the holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven for that end, ſays, Theſe are the things <hi>which the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. And conſidering what a wonderful work of GOD this is, It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch bright Intelligences are looking and ſearching into it. The <hi>works of the Lord are great ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein,</hi> Pſal. 111.2. And what greater work than that of Redemption? And who can we ſuppoſe to take more pleaſure in ſeeking, and ſearching out ſuch a wonderful work as this, than the holy Angels? Who, altho' they are not for prying into the ſecrets of the Almighty, yet would be ſearching into his great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous works, that they may be led thereby the more to magnify, praiſe, and adore the Author of them in whom they take the greateſt delight.</p>
                  <p>When it is ſaid, Which things the Angels <hi>deſire to look into,</hi> it is obſerved by Expoſitors, That the word ſignifies a bowing down the head, &amp; ſtooping to look into a thing; it is a looking diligently and earneſtly: It implies, (ſays Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>) "A prying, or looking narrowly into it", which argues great deſire to know it. Thus the Angels are looking into the wonderful work of Man's Redemption, admiring the riches of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and grace, that diſcover themſelves therein.</p>
                  <p>This Text is alſo obſerved to have an alluſion to the two Cherubims that ſtood above the Ark, with their faces towards the Mercy-Seat, and their eyes fixed ſteadily upon it, in and under which are concealed all the glorious Myſteries
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:002987_0404_0FE6B3D3C11F9900"/>
of our Redemption: For in the Ark was the law of GOD which we had broken, and ſo had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed our ſelves to all thoſe Curſes that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt every one that continues not in all things that are written in the Book of the law to do them; which ſerved to repreſent the condition of Man in his fallen ſtate without a Saviour, in which ſtate he was expoſed to the wrath of GOD, and the penalties of his broken law, which were death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but now over or upon this law was the Mercy-Seat, which repreſented that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the law was broken, and according to the tenor of it there was no Mercy to be had, yet ſome how or other the law ſhould be ſatisfied, and we ſhould obtain Mercy. In ſhort, here was a repreſentation of Chriſt, who having fulfilled the law, and fatisfied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of it by his Obedience and Death, he has erected a throne of Grace, and prepared <hi>a mercy-Seat</hi> for us to repair unto. And the Cherubims turning their eyes down upon the Mercy-Seat, are only a repreſentation of the Angels, who are actually looking with the greateſt earneſtneſs upon the wonderful contrivance of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. When Man had ſinned, they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thought their caſe as deſperate as that of the fallen Angels; all their wiſdom and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city could not think of a way how GOD could maintain the harmony of his perfections in our recovery. And now when they not only ſee <hi>Mercy &amp; Truth meeting together,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace kiſſing each other</hi>; but that theſe,
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:002987_0405_0FE6B3D3D3F738A8"/>
and all other of the divine perfections, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured and advanced in our Redemption; they behold with wonder and amazement, and are filled with the moſt adoring apprehenſions of infinite wiſdom, in the contrivance, and break forth in ſongs of praiſe, as in Luke 2.14. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> becauſe there is <hi>Peace on Earth, and good will towards men.</hi> And theſe are the conſtant acclamations of the heavenly Hoſt, ſaying, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. Worthy is the Lamb to receive power, &amp; riches, and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing. The more the Angels look into theſe glorious Myſteries, the more they ſee of the wonders of wiſdom, and grace; which keeps them in continual poſtures of, and diſpoſitions to the higheſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and adorations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Has GOD thus abounded towards us in all wiſdom and prudence? ſurely then <hi>the highest honour, eſteem and reverence is due unto him from us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wiſdom is ſuch a diſtinguiſhing excellency, and perfection of a rational Being, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands honour and reſpect wherever it is found.

"maketh him illuſtrious, and venerable —". But now as GOD has diſcovered infinitely more wiſdom and
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:002987_0406_0FE6B3D506FADD80"/>
prudence in the work of Man's Redemption, than is poſſible for Men or Angels to conceive of, much leſs to exerciſe and manifeſt themſelves; ſo there is infinitely more eſteem and honour, and reverence due to him, than there can be to the brighteſt Man or Angel. We ſhould admire and adore him for all his great and marvelous works, becauſe in wiſdom has he done them all; but eſpecially for the aſtoniſhing work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>in which he has ſo abounded towards us in all wiſdom and prudence.</hi> We ſhould think of him, and behave our ſelves towards him, with a profound reverence, as the <hi>only wiſe God.</hi> We muſt honour him in our <hi>hearts</hi> above every other Being; conſidering that his <hi>thoughts are a great deep</hi>; and that he is <hi>wonderful in counſel,</hi> as well as <hi>excellent in working.</hi> Neither may we <hi>ſpeak</hi> of him without the greateſt reverence; and as for our whole carriage and behaviour towards him, it muſt be ſuch as is due to a GOD, that is wiſe in heart, &amp; mighty in ſtrength. Verily we ſhould all, with the holy Angels, ſtand amazed at this wonderful contrivance of our Redemption; and whilſt we are filled with joy and praiſe, for the unſpeakable Mercy that we receive hereby, we alſo ſhould be filled with no leſs fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, for the unſearchable wiſdom and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance there has appeared in it; and the language of our Souls ſhould be that, in Rom. 16 27. <hi>To God only wiſe, be glory thro' Jeſus Chriſt for ever.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Here is enough to ſatisfie us, that however dark and unaccountable any of the ways of GOD

                  </p>

And no wonder there is no ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his underſtanding, <hi>for as our Lord is great, and of great power,</hi> ſo <hi>his underſtanding is infinite,</hi> Pſal. 147.5. GOD's ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts; for as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are his ways than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts. And therefore, altho' ſome of the ways of GOD are dark and myſterious to us, and we can give no account of them, nor what deſigns are anſwered by ſuch a particular way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; yet what we have ſeen of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſdom of GOD in other of his works, eſpecially in that of Redemption, ſhould ſet us down fully ſatisfied, that in wiſdom he performs them all; and that it is owing only to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs, and ſhortneſs of our thoughts, that we don't ſee the wiſdom of GOD in theſe, as well as in other of his works. And therefore as to thoſe diſpenſations of GOD that we can't ſee thro', we muſt be far from calling in queſtion the wiſdom

                  <p>We can't ſee why they might not both have been beloved, and accepted as well as one; or if there muſt be but one we can't ſee why <hi>Eſau</hi> and his Poſterity might not have been accepted, and <hi>Jacob</hi> been rejected. Now the whole account we can give of this matter is, That GOD herein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays his ſovereignty; and if we ſhould ſuppoſe this to be a ſufficient reaſon for his chuſing one and rejecting the other; yet it can be no reaſon why he choſe <hi>Jacob</hi> and rejected <hi>Eſau.</hi> But now altho' we can aſſign no reaſon for it, yet when we conſider with what wiſdom and prudence he acts in other things, we may be ſure he did in this, and that he ſaw reaſon ſufficient for rejecting the Elder, and chooſing the Younger, altho' it don't appear at preſent unto us.</p>
                  <p>So again, <hi>Who can give any reaſon why</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhould come at the bleſſing by falſehood, and lying, as he did?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>ch.</hi> we find that in order to his getting the bleſſing from his elder Brother, he
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:002987_0409_0FE6B3E3147F5080"/>
told a direct and poſitive lye to his Father, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>he was Eſau his firſt-born,</hi> v. 19. <hi>His very ſon Eſau,</hi> v. 24. upon which <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed him, and GOD confirmed the bleſſing to him. But now who can give any account why the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhould be brought about after ſuch a manner, by lying, and deceit, and not in an honeſt way? Eſpecially conſidering that GOD <hi>is a GOD of Truth,</hi> and that <hi>lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> Why did not GOD who has the hearts of all in his hands ſecretly turn the heart of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to his Son <hi>Jacob</hi>? or why did he not let him know that <hi>Jacob</hi> was the perſon that he intended to confer the bleſſing on? as he told <hi>Abraham,</hi> That not in <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Seed ſhould be called? But now, altho' we can't give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this matter, yet we may be ſure that GOD can: and that in this as well in other affairs he has acted wiſely, and that ſome good ends or other are anſwered by it.</p>
                  <p>Again, Who can give the reaſon why the Son of GOD <hi>took not on him the nature of Angels, but the Seed of Abraham?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why did GOD paſs by the Angel that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from him, reſerving them in everlaſting chains under darkneſs to the judgment of the great Day, when he had pity on the fallen race of Adam? But now altho' we can ſee nothing but that the glory of GOD might have been as much advanced, if he had acted quite otherwiſe; yet conſidering the wonderful diſplays of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Redemption that is wrought out for Man, we may be ſure it was wiſely projected by
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:002987_0410_0FE6B3E4493C9020"/>
GOD to make choice of fallen Men, rather than fallen Angels, to make them the Monuments of his free, and ſovereign Mercy.</p>
                  <p>So again, It is unaccountable to us that ſo great a part of the world <hi>lies in Ignorance, and are periſhing for lack of wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſays, Heb. 2.9. <hi>Taſted death for every man</hi>; and is ſaid to be <hi>the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the whole world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2 2. and ſince his ſufferings were infinitely meritorious, and his blood of ſufficient value to waſh away the guilt of the whole world; and ſince it is declared, as in 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>That God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance</hi>: I ſay, conſidering theſe things, it ſeems ſtrange and unaccountable to us, that the greateſt part of the world by far are entirely deſtitute of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and have not ſo much as heard of a Saviour. Since there is merit enough in Chriſt, for the pardon and ſalvation of all, and ſince there is ſo much glory to GOD, and joy in Heaven at the Converſion of every Sinner, why are there not more Converted and Saved, yea, why ſhould not every knee in earth as well as in Heaven bow at the Name of JESUS, and every tongue confeſs him to be LORD, to the Glory of GOD the Father? Or at leaſt why have they not the opportunity to come to the knowledge of theſe things, and the offers thereof made unto them? Now altho' it may be beyond our skill to give an anſwer to theſe things; yet when we conſider with how much wiſdom our Redemption has been
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:002987_0411_0FE6B3E45EA72B00"/>
carried on, we cannot in the leaſt doubt but that GOD has ſome very good reaſons for ſuffering ſo great a part of the world to lie in Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>And to add no more, What account can we give for the death of ſuch Multitudes in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy? That GOD ſhould ſo immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of his own hands, without giving the leaſt opportunity for the Exerciſe of thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Powers, with which he endowed them? But GOD managing other things with ſuch wiſdom, may aſſure us, that he has very good reaſon for this.</p>
                  <p>And ſo there are many other things, which how dark and myſterious ſoever they appear to us, yet we may be ſure that GOD acts with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate wiſdom in them all. And altho' we can't tell the reaſon of ſuch a conduct now; yet we ſhall, if we are the Children of GOD ſome time or other come to ſuch a knowledge of them, as will afford wonderful ſatisfaction to us. As our bleſſed Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> upon his asking with wonder, why he waſh'd his Diſciples feet, <hi>Saying, What I do, thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>How ought we to Acquieſce, and reſt fully ſatisfied with every diſpenſation of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of GOD's dealings with us are very dark and myſterious, eſpcially many of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive diſpenſations of his Providence that he exerciſes us withal; ſo that many of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD are ready to ſay unto GOD with Job, <hi>Job</hi> 10.2. <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendeſt
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:002987_0412_0FE6B3EBE2AB2AF8"/>
with me.</hi> But now, inſtead of being impatient, or diſcontented; inſtead of murmuring, and complaining, we ſhould (from the manifeſtations GOD has made of his wiſdom in the work of our Redemption) ſet down ſatisfied with all the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments of divine Providence, realizing this to our ſelves that GOD governs every thing in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unerring wiſdom; that he knows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better than we do what is beſt for us: and that he has done, and always will do that which is for the beſt; and that he can never err, or be miſtaken in any of his managements. We muſt believe that GOD never took one wrong ſtep in the whole courſe of his Providence, and that he never will or can; and this ſhould q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iet us in all our times of trouble and darkneſs. Are we in poor and low circumſtances? Do we meet with loſſes &amp; croſſes, and diſappointments? Do we loſe our friends, our eſtates, our good names, our health, and eaſe, and the comforts of life? And do we loſe the light of GOD's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which is more than all the reſt? We muſt be quiet, not a murmuring word may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of our mouths, nor an impatient thought be harbored in our hearts: but we ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after this manner, That if GOD in the affair of our Redemption has managed with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate wiſdom, as we have heard, ſurely be knows how to order our circumſtances in the world. And indeed, for us to find fault with any of the diſpenſations of Providence, is to deny the divine wiſdom, and to ſet up our own above it.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="408" facs="unknown:002987_0413_0FE6B3EBF5661310"/>5. <hi>We learn where to go for wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to direct us in all our affairs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, that GOD that has managed the affair of our Redemption, with ſo much wiſdom and prudence, can enable us to manage all our affairs with diſcretion. He muſt needs be the infinitely wiſe GOD, and the fountain of all wiſdom, that managed that affair: and now to whom ſhould we go but unto him? Surely, we ought to apply our ſelves to him to be guided, and directed in all our affairs. We are commanded <hi>to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him in all our ways</hi>; and we are encouraged by his gracious promiſe <hi>of directing our paths for us,</hi> Prov. 3.6. And there is a further Invitation, and Command given us from the ſacred Oracles, Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> Here then <hi>let us ceaſe from our own wiſdom,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and adore the divine wiſdom, by truſting in the LORD with all our hearts, and not lean to our own underſtanding; but at all times, and in all caſes, let us ſeek to him for guidance and direction. This we muſt do in all the ordinary and common affairs of life: but eſpecially ſhould we ſeek for divine direction in all weighty, doubtful and perplexed caſes. We muſt look upon him as he is, <hi>The wonderful Counſellour,</hi> and that no caſe is too difficult for him to direct, or adviſe us in. For ſurely there never was a caſe ſo difficult, and perplexed, as that of our Redemption: and therefore he that could ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage that ſo thorowly, and compleatly without
<pb n="409" facs="unknown:002987_0414_0FE6B3EE5E5292C0"/>
any error or miſtake in the leaſt article, can never be pos'd or puzzled in any caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Verily the moſt dark, and intricate caſes are as plain to him as any. He is never at a ſtand to know what is beſt to be done. Now to this <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> we ought to ſeek, and upon him we ought to wait, for all the wiſdom that is profitable, and neceſſary to direct; and if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for us, we may be ſure of being led in the right way; for as he cannot be deceived, ſo neither will he deceive or fail them that put their truſt in him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Since there has been ſuch glorious diſplays of divine Wiſdom in our Redemption; What inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Folly and Wickedneſs are ſuch guilty of, as refuſe to accept of this Redemption, as it is offered to them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Has infinite wiſdom been exerciſed, not only in the manner of purchaſing, but of applying this Redemption, and in the terms on which it is propounded, and offered unto us? Surely then we practically deny the wiſdom of GOD in this offer, whilſt we wilfully refuſe to accept of pardon, and ſalvation, as it is offered unto us. And now how vile, and wretched, and what pride and ignorance is it, for any of us to deny the wiſdom of GOD in our Redemption? as every one does, that won't accept of Salvation upon the terms that it is offered unto him in the Goſpel. Surely the matter was wiſely concerted, and we may ſafely ſay, That Salvation could not have been brought about in a better way; it could not have been purchaſed, nor could it have been
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:002987_0415_0FE6B3EE73AB43B0"/>
offered on better terms. Now then how inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable are they that find fault with the way of Man's Salvation! What indignity and affront is this to GOD, for ſuch worms of the duſt as we, we who are but of yeſterday, and know nothing, to ſet our carnal reaſoning up againſt the wiſdom of GOD, as if we could have found out a better way for Salvation, than what infinite wiſdom has pitched upon! CHRIST Crucified was to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs; and ſo he is to carnal Unbelieving hearts: But to them that Believe, CHRIST appears to be the wiſdom of GOD, and the power of GOD; and at length muſt appear ſo to the Wicked and Unbelieving, either in this world by their Converſion, or in the world to come to their Confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>We ought to be Studying and Searching more and more into the Wiſdom of GOD, in this grand Affair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more we ſearch into this wonderful work of GOD, the more we ſhall diſcover of the riches of divine wiſdom therein. And the further we trace the foot-ſteps of divine wiſdom, the more we ſhall be led to admire and adore that infinite Being, that is poſſeſſed of this glorious excellency and perfection. Therefore if we would have more inlarged thoughts of GOD, of his wiſdom, as well as of all other perfections of the divine Nature, we muſt he ſearching yet further and further into this glorious and aſtoniſhing work of our Redemption. Here are ſuch Myſteries of
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:002987_0416_0FE6B3FC4862B698"/>
wiſdom as well as ſuch riches of love and grace as are unſearchable; we cannot by ſearching find out GOD, we can never find out his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this work unto perfection. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the more we ſtudy and ſearch into theſe things, the more will theſe Myſteries of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom open unto us: and the more inlarged will our thoughts be of GOD himſelf, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reverence and regard to him will be excited in us. Therefore this ſhould be the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our ſtudies, and of our deepeſt Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; our Time ſhould be very much taken up in a ſerious and devout Contemplation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. A few curſory thoughts upon this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful work won't anſwer the end; they won't inlarge our Minds, nor influence our Hearts. It is when we ſet our ſelves to muſe on theſe things, and when our hearts have dwelt ſome time upon this matter, that the fire burns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. The Apoſtle found ſo much of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage of it, that he <hi>counted all things but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Christ his Lord,</hi> Phil. 3.8. And he was ſo fully perſwaded of the uſefulneſs of it, that he determined to know nothing, or preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing among the Corinthians, but JESUS CHRIST <hi>and him Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2.</p>
                  <p>The Angels have looked further into theſe things than we, and this has filled them with more admiring and adoring apprehenſions, and keeps them in ſuch conſtant poſtures of praiſe, giving bleſſing and honour, and glory, and power
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:002987_0417_0FE6B3FC5C45A008"/>
to him that ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever. And ſo ſhould we, if we had but ſeen as far into theſe glorious Myſteries as they.</p>
                  <p>Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="8">8ly. and laſtly, <hi>How ſhould we long to get to Heaven, to ſee, and celebrate more and more the glories of divine Wiſdom, in this wonderful work</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Whilſt in the preſent State, it is but a ſmall part that we can know of it, and what we do ſee, is darkly &amp; very imperfectly. Our Minds are too much darkned, weakned and contracted by the remains of Sin and Corruption, to have a clear, and full diſcerning of this admirable Contrivance. Whilſt in this world we are in our Child-hood, and we think as Children, and ſpeak as Children, with reſpect to the glorious Myſteries of our Redemption. But when we ſhall arrive at the heavenly world, where that eternal Redemption, which was purchaſed for us, ſhall be perfected in us, we ſhall have an infinitely more inlarged thought, than we can have at preſent, of this affair. Then theſe unſearchable depths of divine wiſdom will open themſelves to us; then the whole Contrivance will be unravel'd, and thoſe things that are dark and unaccountable to us at preſent will be cleared up to us, to our unſpeakable joy and ſatisfaction. Then thoſe diſpenſations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which are very dark to us at
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:002987_0418_0FE6B3FDA4CE2268"/>
preſent, will appear to have been ordered in the wiſeſt, and the beſt manner that could be. And in ſhort, we ſhall then ſee that all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that GOD has taken with us in every ſtep and ſtage of our lives, have been managed with conſummate Prudence: which will fill us with adoring Apprehenſions of him; and not only incline, but inlarge our Souls, to celebrate the glories of his Wiſdom, and of his Grace for ever.</p>
                  <p>And now how ſhould we deſire, and long to be brought to that glorious Place, where the foot-ſteps of divine wiſdom will be made ſo Manifeſt and Conſpicuous? And how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we deſire to be of that bleſſed Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, on whom the divine wiſdom will be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and by whom it will be magnified and adored? How ſhould we rejoyce to think of going to joyn thoſe bleſſed Companies of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels, that are with the greateſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and intenſneſs looking into theſe things; and who have gone ſo far into them, as to be able to inform us of many wonders of wiſdom, and grace, that we never imagined or thought of before?</p>
                  <p>But now, if ever we would obtain a Manſion in that bleſſed Place, where there are ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of the glory of GOD, in the face of JESUS CHRIST, we muſt now be complying with the Terms of Salvation, as they
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:002987_0419_0FE6B3FDB9C31048"/>
are offered to us in the Goſpel. We muſt believe that the Goſpel-way to Salvation is the wiſeſt, and the beſt way that could be; and muſt with all thankfulneſs accept the gracious offers, and invitations that are made to us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. We muſt now believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and accept Him as our only Saviour; we muſt put our ſelves over into his hands, to be juſtify'd and ſanctify'd, to be guided and governed, to be protected and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and to be eternally ſaved by him; depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, to perform all things for us.</p>
                  <p>And then he that has abounded in wiſdom, as well as grace, in purchaſing Redemption for us, will alſo in Applying the ſame unto us. He will then make uſe of the wiſeſt and the beſt Means, not only to bring us into a ſtate of Grace, but to carry us on therein from one ſtep to another, till he bring us to the perfection of it. In a word, He will then guide us with his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and unerring <hi>Counſel, till he receives us up to Glory: Where we ſhall plainly ſee the Wiſdom of GOD, that is now in a Myſtery, even the hidden Wiſdom, which GOD ordained before the World, unto our Glory.</hi>
