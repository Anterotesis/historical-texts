            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING peruſed your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remarks on the Eighteen Preſbyterian Miniſters Letter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Archbiſhop, and therewith your Declaration of your Zeal for the Cauſe of the LORD, and your Deſire to open the Eyes of your Fellow-Chriſtians; it kindled in me a Deſire of Acceſs to you, in Order to my clearer Inſtruction: As I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, I have nothing more at Heart, than to be truly enlightened in the Path of Duty. But as you are pleaſed to conceal yourſelf under the general Characters of <hi>Lay-Man</hi> and <hi>Farmer,</hi> of which we have vaſt Numbers; I could deviſe no other Method to obtain my Deſire, than by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out this Addreſs among the Farmers, hoping thereby, to find out the famous Farmer: For it is a Pity that ſo famous a Talent as his, ſhould be hid; or that ſuch a Candle ſhould be put under a Buſhel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008927_0003_1030872E47E44768"/>As ſeveral ſtrange Things are preſented to me, diſperſed here and there, through your none-ſuch Performance, and I intend to be very brief; I ſhall ſet a few of thoſe Myſteries in one View.</p>
            <p>To begin then with your wonderful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments gathered from the aforeſaid Letter, you obſerve;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the A—hb—p is a Prelate of the Church of England; therefore he cannot be ſuppoſed to have any Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> The Eighteen Preſbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters allow the A—hb—p to have Grace, and the Church of England to be Chriſtian; therefore they are ſecret Enemies to Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> The A—hb—p denies a Parity of Goſpel-Miniſters, and holds Epiſcopal Ordination to be Apoſtolical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be no Friend at all to Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth,</hi> Theſe Eighteen Miniſters ſay, they were providencially convened at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia;</hi> therefore they inſinuate to the A—hb—p, that the Subſcribing ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was a Synodical Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth,</hi> Theſe Men ſigned that Letter; therefore they preſumed to ſap the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oundation of Preſbyterian Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth,</hi> They ſay, a very remarkable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing attended Mr. <hi>MecClanachan</hi>'s Miniſtry; therefore they bring a hard Charge againſt Preſbyterianiſm in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:008927_0004_1030873357176C38"/>
               <hi>Seventh,</hi> They aſſure the A—hb—p, that they will not be accountable for any Man's Prudentials in every Part of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; therefore they inſinuate, that they think themſelves qualified to be Bondſmen for other Peoples Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighth,</hi> They tell the A—hb—p, there are Fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion and Proteſtant Reformation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Church of England, in which they can agree with that Church; therefore they are <hi>Church-Betrayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninth,</hi> They ſay, the A—hb—p pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides over the Engliſh Church; therefore they are hypocritical double-dealing Men, and allow him Precedency; whereas, had they been Chriſtians, they would have dealt plainly with him,—and told him, that he was in a damnable State, till he condeſcended to the Level of his Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenth,</hi> Theſe Men ſay, that a diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Regard to the Fundamentals of Religion, and the Cauſe of Virtue and practical Piety, conſtrained them to engage in this Affair; therefore they have given up with every Objection, that has been advanced againſt the Engliſh Church; for which the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe Doors ſhould be ſhut againſt them.</p>
            <p>THESE, <hi>Sir,</hi> are ſome of your very rare Arguments, which, I confeſs, I ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008927_0005_1030873506A3B500"/>
never have thought of, being as little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Subtilities of School-learning as yourſelf, if not leſs.</p>
            <p>I fear, all the Schools will deny, that ſuch Logick is taught in them; ſo that you are like to have the Honour of that noble Invention to your ſelf. Beſides, I fear it will not find Credit among the greateſt Part of thoſe, you call dear Fellow-Chriſtians, till you have afforded clearer Light to open their Eyes, than you have yet done.</p>
            <p>THE next Point I want Clearneſs in, is about thoſe new Opinions you hold, of the Engliſh Church; namely, that ſhe is not Chriſtian: That if ſhe be poſſeſſed of Truth, the Preſbyterians muſt be poſſeſſed of Error: And finally, that the Dragon and his Angels, ſpoken of in Revelation, are her Prelates and their curſed Curates. Theſe Things, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> I am afraid will ruffle the Temper of ſome of the angry Fellows of the Engliſh Church, and will not go well down with the Bulk of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, unleſs they are better proven; for we have been uſed to think otherwiſe. You tell us, they are not new, but were held by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> and our Godly Reformers; but as we have nothing to ſupport theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions but your bare Word, they will hardly believe for us. They allow, that ſome Miniſters of that Church have been
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008927_0006_10308736B3AF9140"/>
eminent and pious, and preached and wrote ſoundly: ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> and others, that I might mention; but I think, they have juſt Reaſon indeed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is too evident to be denied, that a great Number of them, eſpecially in this Country, are vain and vicious in their Lives, as well as inſipid and unſound in their Doctrine; by which Means many poor Souls have neither proper Example nor Inſtruction to lead them in the Paths of Piety. The Preſbyterians would be glad, and I am well perſuaded, the Eighteen Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not of thoſe among them, who would be leaſt glad, if all, or any of that Church, would truly preach, and warmly inculcate thoſe Articles of the Church of England, in which they have the Happineſs to agree with that Church; for they deſire the Welfare of others, as well as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And ſundry of my Neighbours are of Opinion, that [:let Mr. <hi>MecClanachan</hi> be what he will otherwiſe:] yet if he had not preached and vindicated thoſe Goſpel-Doctrines ſo clearly, and inculcated them ſo warmly as he did, there would not have been ſuch an Uproar made about him; nor would the Remarks on the Miniſters Letter have had ſo many Abettors, who ſecretly rejoice, that they have them to make a Handle of, to promote their own low, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008927_0007_1030873AB246A6B8"/>
ſome perhaps, their malicious Deſigns, to blacken thoſe Miniſters Characters, and deſtroy their Influence, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt proceed a little farther, and enquire with Reſpect to thoſe Eighteen Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Character, who, you ſay, are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, falſe-hearted Preſbyterians, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Heart, illeterate Mechanicks, vainly expecting to be noticed by Men of high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree either in Church or State, and have been boxing the Compaſs for a Living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will they not be apt to charge you with Lying and Slander? And the Truth is, I know not how you will be able to free your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Charge, unleſs you can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port your Allegations by ſome better Proof than your bare SAYSO. Will they not be apt to tell you, that you have not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied them in ſaying, they denied, that their Brethren had Grace, and that they had a Method of judging a Man's State by his Face? with many other Things of like kind; but that you likewiſe belied <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> and the whole Body of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, in telling the World, that theſe never believed, that the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was Chriſtian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet you have not produced one Proof for your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, notwithſtanding you ſaid, you would give an Hundred. But no Doubt you think your Word is ſufficient Proof,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008927_0008_1030873D84666760"/>
being a Man of ſuch ſuperior Abilities, as not only to judge a Man's State by his Face, but to judge the A—b—ps State at ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Miles Diſtance. Will they not be apt to enquire, who told you their Conduct in Synod laſt Year? and to charge you with Slander in aſſerting, that they endeavoured to introduce Innovations into Synod? For I am well inform'd, they only attempted to have good Regulations formed, in Order the better to preſerve the Decorum of the Body, in their judicial Tranſactions, which Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were at length agreed upon without a Diſſenting Vote. Will they not think that inſatiable Malice, of ſome ill Deſign or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moves you and your Abettors, to ſtir up an antient Spirit of Partyiſm and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Do not a Number of your Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too evidently lean that Way? Will not they and the World judge, that they are as fit to ſend a Letter to a Perſon in higher Sphere of Life, as a Number of weak and ſcandalous Creatures have been to appear before ſuch in Perſon, to receive Orders for the holy Miniſtry? If theſe Men are ſo much inclined to the Church, as you would repreſent them, why have not any of them, or of that Side they were formerly united to, whom you ſeem to ſtrike at thro' them, why, I ſay, have not one of theſe gone to, and been received by the Church as well as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008927_0009_103087405EDEB9A8"/>
other Preſbyterians? Is not a Gown as ready for them, as it was for <hi>Hindman, Bell, Lion, Evans</hi> and <hi>Carliſle,</hi> Men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Character, with ſundry others that I might mention? Except the Biſhop would choſe to reject Men of good Character, while he received the weak and the wicked, which I believe you will not venture to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. You ſay they have been boxing the Compaſs for a Living. I believe you did not conſider, when you wrote theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor do others, that are fond to uſe them. What if theſe Gentlemen ſhould enquire, who boxed the Compaſs, when a Number of them left their native Land, not for their beſt Deeds, and ſome not for their great Abilities, and boxed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs here to ſcreen themſelves, and fiſh for a Living among Preſbyterians? What would you think, if they ſhould aſk, who boxed the Compaſs, when a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wrote to <hi>England</hi> reſpecting his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in defending our Frontiers? Exploits done by others, which he called his own, [:as he did the Sermon he printed, which was done by another Gentleman:] for which Lie he got Twenty Pounds annexed to his Salary. What if they ſhould farther enquire, who boxed the Compaſs, when one of this Gentleman's Fraternity, being too vain and dull to be acceptable to Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008927_0010_103087424D3B5C10"/>
applied to the Study and Practice of the Law; but finding himſelf too great a Dunce for that Profeſſion, he forged Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, went and preached to an ignorant People, till he got ſome Money, after which he marched to the Biſhop for Orders. What if they ſhould put theſe and many other Queſtions, which I believe they might with Juſtice do, till I were weary writing and you with reading them? You repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them as-illiterate Mechanicks; but the World is too well acquainted with their Abilities, to conclude them ſuch clowniſh ſcurrilous Flings, that they either want Senſe or Learning. Were an Acquaintance with Mechaniſm a Crime, by far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of them are innocent of it. If two or three did underſtand ſomething of it, will this prove, they had not a regular Education? Your clumſy Calumny equally ſtrikes at the great Apoſtle PAUL himſelf, as an illiterate Dunce; for he was a Tent-maker. But perhaps if the Eighteen Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had been Dupes and Dunces, or even Debauchees, they might have eſcaped all theſe Charges.</p>
            <p>I would now conclude this Addreſs, only I can not help taking Notice of the prodigious Agitation you ſeemed to be put in by theſe Men praying the A—hb—p. And I do not wonder at it, when you found

out ſuch horrible Idolatry in it, as I know not, if ever any of the Children of Men made ſuch a rare Diſcovery of before your own penetrating ſelf. The moſt of us uſed to think, that they might pray a Man to grant a Favour, without ſo much as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, they were chargeable with Idolatry. But then you have not only found theſe Men, together with the greateſt Part of the preſent Generation, guilty of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Crime, but your Aſſertion would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the Patriarch ABRAHAM in the ſame Guilt; for he not only prayed, but bowed down to the Children of HETH. But may not ſome of them enquire, how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is your Conduct, if it is not much worſe, in praying [:perhaps ſome may call it ſwearing:] in the Name of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> who are at beſt but departed Saints?</p>
            <p>Theſe are a few of the Things, that are ſo difficult to me, and to many others, and if you do not come from your Concealment and explain them to us a little better, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there will not be one real Preſbyterian on your Side; conſequently you will loſe your Labour in attempting to open Eyes. But that is not all; for I fear, great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will be tempted to think, that you are ſo far from being a Friend to Preſbyterians, that you are one of their moſt inveterate

Enemies, endeavouring to repreſent them as a very odious and uncharitable Sort of People, ſcarcely fit to live in a civilized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or if you are a Preſbyterian by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they will conclude, that you are an Enemy to them in Practice, and that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice has prompted you to write your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; and perhaps ſome Epiſcopal is joined with you in the Affair. I believe, many will conclude, not only from theſe Gentlemens apparent Diſintereſtedneſs in the Affair, but from their thorough Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, that they had a ſingle View to promote Religion, however they may not have ſo duly conſidered all the Circumſtances of the Caſe, and particularly the ill Uſe that ſpightful Perſons would make of their Letter. But they will be obliged to conclude, that pre-conceived Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt theſe Men, becauſe perhaps you did not find, that they were <hi>Dunces,</hi> or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be <hi>Dupes</hi> to you, moved you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. Or perhaps that you gladly and greedily ſnatched at this Opportunity; to prepare the Way for carrying on ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Plot, by attempting to deſtroy, if poſſible, theſe Mens Influence by Sophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Calumny and Lies. And if this be the Caſe, have you not Reaſon to fear, that the Blaſt of Divine Providence will

conſume your Deſigns, as Snow melts off the Fields by warm Sun-Beams. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Profeſſion is, if this poor Attempt of mine, or any other Invitation of like kind that may be given, may be a Means of bringing you forth to Light, and you can confirm and eſtabliſh theſe Remarks of yours, then I doubt not, but you will meet with ſufficient Encouragement to ſweep you from the Plough-Tail, ſeeing that is ſuch a deſpicable Buſineſs, and without boxing the Compaſs, ſet you in a Sphere large enough to employ your Talent of opening Eyes.</p>
            <p>IF you enquire after me, <hi>Sir,</hi> I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, you will neither find me in the Pulpits, nor in the Schools of Learning, nor have any of thoſe employed in ſuch Places, moved me to this Attempt, or dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to me while I wrote. The Truth of what I now aſſert, the unpoliſhed Plainneſs of my Addreſs will confirm. But you may find me among the Black-Smiths Shops, belonging to the Preſbyterians in Cheſter-County.</p>
