            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE following amendment to the bill providing the means of intercourſe between the United States and foreign nations, being under conſideration, to wit: In the ſection which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that "the Preſident ſhall not allow to any miniſter <hi>plenipotentiary</hi> a greater ſum than at the rate of nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars per annum, as a compenſation for all his perſonal ſervices and other expenſes; nor a greater ſum for the ſame than four thouſand five hundred dollars per annum, to <hi>a chargé des affaires;"</hi> ſtrike out the word <hi>"plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary,"</hi> and inſert in lieu thereof, the words "to Great-Britain, France or Spain;" ſtrike out the words <hi>"chargé des affaires,"</hi> and inſert in lieu thereof the words "any miniſter to any other foreign nation."</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE amendment propoſed to this bill fixes the ſalary of miniſters, employed at foreign courts, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the grade of thoſe miniſters, as has heretofore been the caſe, but according to the courts to which they may be ſent. Its object is to reduce the diplomatic eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nearly to what it was before May, 1796, by confining the ſalary of 9000 dollars a-year to the miniſters at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Paris and Madrid, and allowing only 4500 to all others. The ſhape of the bill precludes an amendment more ſimple in its nature, and by which the ſame object would have been attained. The preſent permanent eſtabliſhment, which the framers of the bill mean to ſupport, requires an annual appropriation of ſixty-four thouſand dollars; and yet twenty-four thouſand dollars of that ſum are thrown

               </gap>, thereby presenting us from propoſing a reduction in the ſum which is openly aſked for the ſupport of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>Before we are permitted to enter into the merits of the queſtion, we are arreſted in the threſhold of diſcuſſion by conſtitutional objections. It is not indeed inſiſted that the amendment itſelf is unconſtitutional; it is not denied that the legiſlature has a right to fix the ſalaries of public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; but the reduction of the eſtabliſhment, is ſuppoſed, in its operation and tendency, to affect the legitimate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the preſident. We are charged with a deſign of ſubverting, by our doctrine, the principles of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we are thus drawn, in an incidental manner, into a previous diſcuſſion of a conſtitutional queſtion.</p>
            <p>The 2d ſection of the 2d article of the conſtitution, amongſt other things, provides, that "the preſident ſhall nominate, and by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, ſhall appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe appointments are not herein otherwiſe provided for, and which ſhall be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by law." The firſt inference, attempted to be drawn from the clauſe, is, not only that the appointment of miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is excluſively veſted in the executive, which poſition is ſelf-evident, but, that an unlimited number of offices of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and other diplomatic agents, is <hi>created</hi> by the conſtitution itſelf, and that the preſident, in appointing, only fills thoſe pre-exiſting offices. It appears to me, that it would be more correct to ſay, that the poſſible exiſtence of thoſe officers is recognized by that ſection, but that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of miniſter to any foreign court, where we have not had any before, is created by the preſident making the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. And it may even be thought doubtful whether a law may not be neceſſary to create the office, before an appointment takes place. This clauſe recognizes the exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of judges of the ſupreme court, as well as that of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters, and gives the ſame unlimited power of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in both caſes to the executive. Nay, the caſe of judges is ſtronger than that of miniſters; for, upon theſe, the conſtitution is ſilent in every other part, whilſt not only
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033777_0004_0FF937F31A1742A0"/>it is here declared, that judges of the ſupreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as well as public miniſters, <hi>may</hi> exiſt, but the 3d article o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the conſtitution poſitively enacts, that there <hi>ſhall be</hi> a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court, and fixes its juriſdiction. Yet it has not been contended that the office of judges of the ſupreme court was created by the conſtitution, or could be created by the mere appointment of the preſident, without the previous authorization of a law. It has not been contended that the preſident had, by the conſtitution, the power of appointing any unlimited number of thoſe judges, to be fixed by his own diſcretion. On the contrary, a law had paſſed defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their number, before any appointment took place; and it is not inſiſted that the executive can appoint more than ſix, as fixed by that law. Had that power, contended for in relation to public miniſters, exiſted in the caſe of judges, that part of the law, which declares that there ſhall be ſix judges, and no more, muſt be unconſtitutional, as we have no right by law, and even with the conſent of the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to diveſt him of any of his conſtitutional authorities. Still, it is not my intention to lay any ſtreſs upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; ſome nice diſcrimination may perhaps be drawn between the two offices; a different conſtruction has here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore prevailed in the caſe of miniſters, and it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to prove the conſtitutionality of our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, to contend for the conſtruction of this ſection. I would not, therefore, have made theſe preliminary obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had it not been to ſhow, that the power of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive to appoint miniſters without the previous ſanction of a law, from which it is attempted to derive by implication the right of controuling the legiſlature in the exerciſe of its own conſtitutional powers, is itſelf of a doubtful nature, and can only be admitted by a very liberal conſtruction of that clauſe of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the conſtitution his expreſsly and excluſively veſted in congreſs, the power of raiſing, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and directing the application of money. The 8th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt article declares, that "congreſs ſhall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts and exciſes, and to borrow money on the credit of the United States." The 1ſt ſection emphatically ſtates, that "<hi>all legiſlative
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033777_0005_0FF937F7609556D0"/>powers</hi> herein granted ſhall be veſted in a congreſs;" and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 9th ſection provides, that "no money ſhall be drawn from the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſury, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in conſequence of <hi>appropriations made by law.</hi>'</p>
            <p>We ſay that congreſs having the ſole power of granting money, are judges of the propriety or impropriety of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a grant, and that they have a right to exerciſe their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion therein; whilſt thoſe who oppoſe the amendment upon conſtitutional grounds, contend that the power of creating the office of public miniſters, veſted in the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, impoſes an obligation upon congreſs to provide an adequate compenſation for as many as he ſhall think fit to appoint. We ſay that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> power of granting money for any purpoſes whatever, belongs ſolely to the legiſlature, in which it is <hi>literally</hi> veſted by the conſtitution: they inſiſt that that power in this inſtance attaches, <hi>by implication,</hi> to the preſident, and that congreſs are bound to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without having a right to exerciſe their own diſcretion.</p>
            <p>In order to eſtabliſh this doctrine, it is aſſerted that, by our conſtitution, each department may have checks within itſelf, but has none upon the others; that each department is ſelf-independent, has its own ſhare of powers, and moves uncontrouled within its ſphere; that, therefore, whenever a certain authority is, by the conſtitution, veſted in any one department, it muſt poſſeſs the means to carry that authority into effect, and that the other departments are bound to lend their aſſiſtance for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe poſitions will not ſtand the teſt of inveſtigation. Whenever the powers veſted in any one department are ſufficient to complete a certain act, that department is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of all the others, and it would be an unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional attempt in any of the others to try to controul it. But whenever the powers have been ſo diſtributed between two departments, in relation to another certain act, that neither of the two can complete the act by virtue of its own powers, then each department is controuled by the other, not in relation to the operation of its appropriate powers, but in relation to the act itſelf. Each department, in that caſe, may go as far as its own authority will permit, but no farther. The refuſal of the other department, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033777_0006_0FF937FD5DE90350"/>its powers in relation to that act, in the ſame direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in concurrence with the firſt department, is no abridgment of the legitimate powers of the firſt. It is the conſtitution which, in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ridges the powers of both, and which has rendered the concurrence of both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the completion of the act. If either of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, in that caſe, after having exerciſed its own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority towards the completion of the act, ſhall pretend to have a right to force the pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of the other in the ſame direction, ſo as to have the act completed againſt or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its voluntary conſent, it is that department which abridges the legitimate exerciſe of the powers of the other. Thus, in the inſtance before us, the preſident may appoint as many public miniſters as he thinks fit, and if he can ſend them to their intended miſſion without the aſſiſtance of any act of the legiſlature; if he can, as in the caſe of conſuls, find men who will ſerve without a ſalary, he has a right to do it, and thus to act uncontrouled by the legiſlature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in this ſuppoſed inſtance, his own authority is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to carry into effect his intentions. But farther than that he cannot go; for the conſtitution, in no part, gives him any power to force the legiſlature to grant the money which may be neceſſary to pay the miniſters. In the ſame manner the legiſlature have a right to appropriate a ſum of money, for the purpoſe of paying twenty public miniſters, if they ſhall, in their judgment, think ſo many neceſſary. But farther than that they cannot go; they cannot force the preſident to appoint twenty miniſters, if he does not think them neceſſary. In this inſtance, the act is placed partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juriſdiction of the executive, and partly under that of the legiſlature—under the juriſdiction of the executive ſo far as relates to the creation of the office and to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment—under the juriſdiction of the legiſlature ſo far as relates to granting the money; and the concurrence of both departments is neceſſary to complete the act.</p>
            <p>The contrary doctrine leads to a palpable abſurdity; for, if it be true that any department, having expreſſed its will in relation to an act, upon which it can operate but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, binds the other departments to lend their aſſiſtance, in order that its will may be completely carried into effect,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033777_0007_0FF938040B9679F8"/>it follows, that whenever two department ſhall differ in opinion as to a certain act, we ſhall have two different wills acting in contrary directions, and each, however, binding the other reſpectively; that is to ſay, that there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>es, that it ſhould, at the ſame time, be done and not be done. But the fact is, that the true doctrine of thoſe gentlemen, though not openly avowed on the preſent occaſion, is not, that each depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may act uncontrouled in the exerciſe of its own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate powers; but that they have two ſtandards, one which they apply to the executive, and another by which they meaſure the powers of the legiſlature; and that in their opinion the powers of the executive are paramount, and muſt limit and controul thoſe of the legiſlature, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they happen to move in the ſame ſphere, whenever the execution of an act depends upon the concurrence of both.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is as novel as it is abſurd. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been taught to believe that in all mixed governments, and eſpecially in our own, the different departments mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally operated as checks one upon the other. It is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple inherent to the very nature of thoſe governments: it is a principle which flows from the diſtribution and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of legiſlative and executive powers, by which the ſame act, in many inſtances, inſtead of belonging excluſively to either, falls under the diſcretionary and partial authority of both: it is a principle of all our ſtate conſtitutions: it is a principle of the conſtitution under which we now act: it is a principle recognized by every author who wrote on the ſubject: it is a principle fully eſtabliſhed by the theory and practice of the government of that country, from which we derive our political inſtitutions. In Great Britain, the power of declaring war is veſted in the king; but the power of granting ſupplies, in order to ſupport the war, is veſted in parliament. It has never been contended there, that parliament were bound by the act of the king to grant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that purpoſe; it is, on the contrary, fully underſtood that a concurrence of opinion is neceſſary, before a war can be carried into effect, that the two departments, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, controul and check each other, and that war is never
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033777_0008_0FF93815C7386F38"/>declared by the king, unleſs he can depend on the ſupport of parliament.</p>

That ſuch was not the intent of the conſtitution, appears, from its not uſing, in the laſt mentioned clauſe, the ſame mode of expreſſion which is applied to mere executive duties. The 3d ſection of the 2d article directs, that <q>the preſident <hi>ſhall take care</hi> that the laws be faithfully <hi>executed.</hi>
               </q> Here no diſcretion is left: the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">

               </gap>tion does not here ſay, that the preſident <hi>ſhall have power</hi> to execute the laws; but, by the phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, he is bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd to have them executed. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the conſtitution means to impoſe a duty, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explicit, and poſitively directs the act to be done; and we may ſafely conclude, that where it gives no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, where it impowers inſtead of commanding, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that it meant to leave a diſcretion.</p>
            <p>It is alſo objected that congreſs cannot, in every caſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that diſcretion we contend for, as thoſe clauſes of the conſtitution which provide "that the preſident and judges ſhall rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve, for their ſervices, a compenſation, which ſhall not be diminiſhed, &amp;c." would be defeated, by the refuſal of the legiſlature to appropriate for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution recognizes the exiſtence of public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as well as that of the preſident and judges. It goes no farther on the ſubject of miniſters; but declares, that the preſident and judges ſhall have ſalaries, &amp;c. Had the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the conſtitution alſo intended that congreſs ſhould be bound to make proviſion for miniſters, they would have introduced a ſimilar clauſe in reſpect to them. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tution is explicit in one caſe, and declares, that ſalaries ſhall be given; it is ſilent in the other, and does not declare that ſalaries ſhall be given. The objection, therefore, cannot reach farther than the ſpecific caſe upon which it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Permit me to add, that in reſpect to the preſident and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033777_0010_0FF9380C69073450"/>judges, the diſcretionary power of the legiſlature to grant money is limited only by the conſtitution, and is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any other department. For the number of thoſe officers being determined, in reſpect to the preſident by the conſtitution, and in reſpect to the judges by <hi>law,</hi> the amount of money neceſſary for their ſupport, which muſt be in proportion to their number, is fixed in the firſt inſtance by the legiſlature and not by the executive. The limitation of the legiſlative power does not go farther there, than to bind ſubſequent legiſlatures for a certain time, by the acts of former ones. But, in reſpect to public miniſters, ſhould the doctrine, againſt which we contend, prevail, as their number would be fixed, not by the legiſlature, but by the preſident, the amount of money, neceſſary for their ſupport, would alſo depend upon him; and the power of granting money, in that inſtance, would be transferred from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to the executive.</p>
            <p>Some gentlemen, embarraſſed by the clauſe reſpecting appropriations, have attempted to diminiſh its force, by connecting it with the following one, which directs the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the accounts of receipts and expenditures of the public money, and repreſenting it as a mere matter of form. It is ſtrange indeed that an attempt ſhould be made to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent appropriation clauſes in the conſtitution as mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of form, as nominal proviſions, whilſt the only ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt ſtanding armies, contained in the conſtitution, conſiſts in the clauſe which provides that <q>no appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of money to raiſe and ſupport armies ſhall be longer than two years.</q> But the ingenuity of thoſe gentlemen cannot eraſe the obnoxious clauſe: and ſo long as it ſhall remain a part of the conſtitution, ſo long ſhall it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that a law be paſſed before any money can be drawn from the treaſury—ſo long ſhall it be neceſſary that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney drawn from the treaſury be applied only in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſuch extent, and for ſuch purpoſes, as ſhall have been previouſly aſcertained by law. It is this clauſe which completes the power veſted in congreſs over money. And it ſhould be well underſtood that the doctrine, for which we contend, is that conſtitutional principle, which gives to the legiſlature an excluſive authority of raiſing and granting money; an authority which our opponents wiſh to place,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033777_0011_0FF9381ABB8C00D8"/>in ſeveral caſes, the preſent one, and that of treaties, in the hands of the executive, allowing him thereby to raiſe and to expend money without the controul of congreſs. I ſay to raiſe money; for it is immaterial to me, whether he does it directly, or whether the legiſlature are bound to do it according to his diſcretion.</p>
            <p>In this inveſtigation, I have confined myſelf ſtrictly to the conſtitutional queſtion, wiſhing to aſcertain what the conſtitution was, and not what it ſhould be. Before I make any obſervations on the tendency and conſequences of the two oppoſite conſtructions, I wiſh to make ſome on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the amendment itſelf.</p>
            <p>We conceive that the effect of the amendment will be, to prevent an extenſion of our political connections with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations, at the ſame time that it will reduce any e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture of money, which, if unneceſſary, may be applied to give an undue influence to the executive, through the means of patronage, even over the legiſlature. But, we do not believe that this amendment will injure our commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe with thoſe nations, or cauſe any prejudice to our commercial intereſt.</p>
            <p>The commercial intercourſe between nations is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the law of nations, by the municipal laws of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective countries, and by treaties of commerce. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe different laws to individual caſes, the protection of individuals againſt acts of oppreſſion not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant with thoſe laws, the protection of our ſeamen and of our citizens trading to foreign countries, fall within the province of thoſe agents known by the name of conſuls. Conſuls are appointed for that ſpecific purpoſe: we have them in all countries with which we trade, whether we have there public miniſters or not; they protect our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce as effectually at Hamburgh, in Denmark or Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where we have no diplomatic characters, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in Spain or Holland, where we have miniſters. It is only when we wiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o obtain a change in the regulations provided by the acknowledged law of nations, or by the municipal laws of the country, that public miniſters are neceſſary, as they alone can negociate with a foreign go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as they alone can form treaties of commerce. But it is only the application of laws and treaties to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033777_0012_0FF9382646F04690"/>caſes which require a continual attention and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent reſidence. The extraordinary occaſions on which it may be neceſſary to negociate treaties, may be provided for by ſpecial miſſions, by extraordinary envoys; and it is worthy of remark, that the two only treaties, which have yet been made, under the preſent conſtitution, with foreign nations, thoſe with Great-Britain and Spain, have both been formed by extraordinary envoys (Mr. Jay and Mr. Pinckney) although we had at that time public miniſters at thoſe two courts. The propoſed amendment affects only the permanent diplomatic eſtabliſhment; it applies neither to conſuls, nor to ſuch extraordinary miſſions as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may render neceſſary.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, however, that it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the extention of our diplomatic eſtabliſhment may tend to increaſe the number of our commercial treaties beyond thoſe which might reſult from extraordinary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But is this a definable object? It would, indeed, be extremely advantageous to obtain from all nations, ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral alterations in the law of nations, as would ſecure the freedom of the ſea, and effectually protect the flag of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral powers, againſt the danger of capture or detention in all poſſible caſes. But have we yet ever formed a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, in which thoſe proviſions were not connected with ſome commercial reſtrictions of a different nature, and which did not even contain ſome clauſes of a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature? I will go farther, and I will aſk, whether we have derived any commercial advantage from the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial treaties we have heretofore made? Let me remind gentlemen on this floor, with the ſituation of our commerce before the organization of this government. The treaties of commerce we had at that time with France, Holland, Sweden and Pruſſia, had not prevented its depreſſion. And to what cauſe muſt we aſcribe the vigour it had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before the preſent European war? Not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaties; for we had formed no new ones. To the want of a general government, having a power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general commercial regulations, was due, the languid ſituation of our trade; and its revival was owing to the adoption of that government, to our own regulations, to ourſelves, and not to any compact made with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:033777_0013_0FF93832D6A0EC48"/>
The reſtrictions which we have laid upon ourſelves, by our commercial treaties, have been attended with political conſequences fatal to our tranquility. We had made two treaties with France, one of alliance avowedly of a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature, another of commerce unconnected with the firſt. I need not remind the houſe of the difficulties in which we have been involved by ſeveral clauſes of the commercial treaty. The articles relative to the admiſſion of prizes of one nation into our ports, and to the excluſion of thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were the cauſe of long and critical diplomatic diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. We have now extended to the other belligerent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſame clauſes, with a reſervation of our prior en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, but to the excluſion of nations with whom we had no treaties, and have not thereby leſſened our difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>But I will again aſk, what commercial advantage have we derived from our commercial treaty with France, which we would not have enjoyed without that treaty? Have we derived any from the commercial part of our treaty with Great Britain? Is our commerce with that nation on a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter footing than it was without the treaty. I do not mean to allude to the conventional part of that treaty, by which our differences were arranged. I do not mean to allude to the political conſequences of that treaty: they are foreign to the preſent diſcuſſion. I ſpeak only of commercial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. All we know on that ſubject is contained in the two acts of parliament communicated to us by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. It reſults from them, that England has opened the Eaſt-India trade to us under the reſtrictions provided by the treaty, and to all neutral nations without thoſe reſtrictions. Whether ſhe means to include us in the general proviſion, which relates to all neutral nations, or to keep us under the treaty reſtrictions, I will not pretend to ſay, and it is not material to the preſent queſtion. But it is evident, that we are placed, by the treaty, in a worſe commercial ſituation, in reſpect to the Eaſt Indies, than we were, in fact, before the treaty, or than we might be by the ſole effect of the municipal laws of Great-Britain. It alſo appears by that act of parliament, that England has laid a countervailing duty on our imports there in American veſſels. This they had a right to do without the treaty; but they had not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033777_0014_0FF9382A773502C8"/>to do it until the treaty took place, becauſe we had till then the natural right of defeating that meaſure, by our own regulations here. We have abandoned that right by the treaty; we have, in order to obtain ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed commercial advantages, laid a reſtriction upon our natural power of making our own general commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations. This act of parliament, however, is the only effect, in relation to commerce, which has as yet reſulted from the treaty. What its conſequences upon our trade may be, I cannot judge; but it places us preciſely in the ſituation in which we were before the year 1789, when we had no efficient general government, when we could not make commercial regulations of a general nature. If the commercial part of our former treaties has not been atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with any beneficial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nſequences; if, on the contrary, it has involved us in a critical ſituation, we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doubt, whether commercial treaties are not as likely to check as to protect our commerce.</p>
            <p>It is not denied that an extenſion of our political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with Europe would be injurious to us; but it is ſaid, that our having no miniſters in foreign countries will not prevent foreign nations ſending their miniſters here, and that our miniſters abroad will not increaſe our political foreign connections. I do not mean to make any perſonal alluſions to the conduct of our miniſters in Europe; but we may judge—from paſt events, we may judge from the conduct of foreign miniſters here, that diplomatic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not likely to be inactive. From the nature of their appointment, from the nature of man, we know that they will try to acquire importance with their own government and credit to themſelves; they are placed in a dangerous vortex, and they will all, more or leſs, according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and to their perſonal character, take a part in the political intrigues or quarrels of Europe; they will attempt to do ſomething—they will attempt to involve us in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical vortex of Europe—they will try to make for us new connections, or to break ancient connections.</p>
            <p>Whether foreign nations, with whom we have no public miniſters, will ſend miniſters here, cannot be abſolutely foretold, but we know that it is not uſual; at all events, it cannot be wiſe to invite a greater number of foreign mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033777_0015_0FF9383C71E9D500"/>here, by extending our diplomatic eſtabliſhment to countries where we have not heretofore ſent miniſters. The amendment under conſideration has no tendency to annihilate that eſtabliſhment, but it will effectually check its extenſion. If our miniſters abroad are neceſſary for the protection of our commerce, or on account of our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſituation in reſpect to the belligerent powers, this amendment will not withdraw their compenſation. Its avowed object, its only poſſible effect, is, to reduce the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment to what it was in 1796, when we had no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at Berlin, and when our miniſter at Liſbon, with a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ry of 4500 dollars, rendered us the ſame ſervices as if he had had 9000.</p>
            <p>But, we are told, that this is not the time to make a reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our ſituation in reſpect to Europe forbids it, and that our differing in opinion with the Preſident on this ſubject, will prove us to be a divided people. I am much afraid, that if now is not the time, it will be with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form as with all others, it will never be time. To evince to European nations that we wiſh not to mix in their political ſphere of action, that we are not deſirous of forming poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical connections, that we wiſh not to interfere, eſpecially at this time, with their political intereſts, is, in my opinion, the beſt mode in our power to prevent their interfering with us, and the moſt likely to produce a termination of our preſent diſpute. Nor can I conceive how our expreſſing on this ground, a difference of opinion with the executive, will tend to prove that we are not united on the ſubject of ſelf-defence. But I believe that now is the time to expreſs our opinion, becauſe the object of the extenſion of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plomatic eſtabliſhment having been explained to us by the Preſident, it is our duty, if we think the object contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be dangerous, not to be ſilent upon this occaſion.

However we may conſider ourſelves, the maritime and commercial powers of the world will conſider the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States of America <hi>as forming a weight in that balance of power in Europe, which never can be forgotten or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</hi> It would not only be againſt our intereſt, but it would be doing wrong to one half of Europe at leaſt, if we ſhould voluntarily throw ourſelves into either ſcale. <hi>It is a natural policy</hi> for a nation that ſtudies to be neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral, <hi>to conſult with other nations engaged in the ſame ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and purſuits:</hi> At the ſame time that <hi>meaſures ought to be purſued with this view,</hi> our treaties with Pruſſia and Sweden, one of which is expired, and the other near expiring, might be renewed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Permit me, before I proceed to make any remarks upon that part of the Preſident's ſpeech, to contraſt it with the ſentiments contained in the late Preſident's addreſs to the people, on his retiring from office.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as poſſible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.—<hi>Here let us ſtop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Europe has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to <hi>us</hi> have none, or a very remote relation. Hence, ſhe muſt be engaged in frequent controverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it muſt be <hi>unwiſe</hi> in us to implicate ourſelves, <hi>by artificial ties,</hi> in the ordinary viciſſitudes of her poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, or the ordinary combinations and colliſions of her friendſhips or enmities.</p>
               <p>Our detached and diſtant ſituation, invites and enables us to purſue a different courſe. If we remain one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal annoyance..... Why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſituation? <hi>Why quit our own to ſtand upon foreign ground?</hi> Why, by <hi>interweaving our deſtiny</hi> with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033777_0017_0FF93848DCDF53B0"/>that of any part of Europe, <hi>entangle our peace</hi> and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity in the toil of European ambition, rivalship, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, humour, or caprice? 'Tis our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world, ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it.... Let thoſe engagements be obſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But, in my opinion, it is <hi>unneceſſary and would be unwiſe to extend them.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Supported by this authority, may I hope to eſcape the cenſure of arrogance, if, on this occaſion, I dare expreſs an opinion in ſome degree oppoſed to the very reſpectable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the preſident of the United States.</p>
            <p>The object of both the late and the preſent preſident is perfectly the ſame; it is that we may not be involved in the political ſyſtem of Europe, that we may not be drawn into the vortex. But they do not ſeem altogether to agree on the means by which to obtain that object.</p>
            <p>The preſident of the United States conceives that it is a natural policy for us to <hi>conſult</hi> with other nations engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame ſtudies and purſuits; and that <hi>meaſures</hi> ought to be <hi>purſued</hi> with this view. The late Preſident thinks it unwiſe, by interweaving our deſtiny with Europe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our peace—unwiſe to implicate ourſelves by artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ties—unwiſe and unneceſſary to extend our engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His opinion is emphatically expreſſed by theſe words, <hi>"Here let us ſtop."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to that balance of power in Europe, which never can be forgotten or neglected, it is a ſyſtem, which, ſo far as relates to Europe itſelf, it is not neceſſary for us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs. And yet, without examining all the uſeleſs wars to which it has ſerved as a cauſe or a pretence, we muſt recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, at what late period the Britiſh miniſtry wanted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the Britiſh nation into a war with Ruſſia, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of preſerving that balance, which might, in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, be affected by the transfer or Oczackow, ſituated as it is in a remote corner of the black ſea, from the hords of Tartars which rule Turkey, to the Tartar hords which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Ruſſia. But, however intereſting that balance may be to Europe, how does it concern us? We may lament the fate of Poland and Venice, and I never can myſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee, without regret, independent nations blotted from the map
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033777_0018_0FF9385D39B46A48"/>of the world. But their deſtiny does not affect us in the leaſt. We have no intereſt whatever in that balance; and by us, it ſhould be altogether forgotten and neglected. If we ever think we have an intereſt in it, ſhall we not be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to throw our weight in the ſcale.—ſhall we not involve ourſelves in the deſtinies and the wars of Europe? If we act on our own ground, is it likely that other nations will ever conſider us as forming a weight in their balance?</p>
            <p>But if we adopt the policy to <hi>conſult</hi> with other nations—if meaſures are to be purſued with that view—if we are to form new foreign political connections; how can we hope to eſcape being unavoidably drawn into the vortex? It was, after having thus communicated his intention—it was in purſuance of that plan, that the preſident thought fit to ſend a miniſter to Berlin. With Pruſſia, we have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Had commerce been the object of that embaſſy, Sweden, Denmark, the Hanſe-towns, or Italy, would have been preferred. The miſſion is avowedly and evidently of a political nature; and if we are to conſult and to form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with nations, who may, in our opinion, be engaged in ſimilar purſuits with ourſelves; if Pruſſia is conſidered as ſuch, with what nation in Europe, may we not and ſhall we not, according to circumſtances, conſult, concert mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and form political arrangements? It is from this view of the ſubject, that I have been induced, however reluctantly, fully to ſtate all the reaſons which impreſs upon my mind a conviction of the importance of the preſent amendment, of the importance of checking at this time, and in its birth, a ſyſtem which tends to increaſe our political connections with Europe.</p>
            <p>So much has already been ſaid on the ſubject of patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, on the danger which might hereafter reſult from an influence obtained through thoſe means over the legiſlature, and on the ſyſtem, ſaid to be adopted by the adminiſtration, to exclude, from every deſcription of office, men who do not ſubſcribe to a certain political creed, that I think it uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to add any obſervations on that ſubject. As, however, the patronage, now veſted by law in the executive, has been ſtated as very inſignificant, I will merely ſtate its real extent.</p>
            <p>It conſiſts in appointment to offices and in the diſpoſal of public monies by contracts. The annual pay of the officers
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033777_0019_0FF93865C25BBAB0"/>in the different departments of the treaſury, of ſtate and of war, and all the ſubordinate offices of loans, mint, &amp;c. of the officers in the North Weſt Territory, of the attorney-general, ſurveyor-general, Indian-agents, diplomatic cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, agents for the protection of ſeamen, agents and commiſſioners appointed by virtue of certain treaties; in fine, the pay of all civil officers, whoſe appointment depends upon the executive or ſome branch of the adminiſtration, including therein all the clerks, but excluding the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary department, added to the pay and other emoluments of the commiſſioned officers of the army and navy, forms an aggregate of about 420,000 dollars. The ſalary and other emoluments of the officers employed in the collection of the impoſt and of the internal revenues, including therein poſt-maſters, amount to about 430,000 dollars. Theſe two ſums amount together to 850,000 dollars yearly, received by officers who derive their appointment from the executive.</p>
            <p>The amount of monies diſpoſed of by contracts, and it is well known that lucrative contracts may be made a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful engine of influence; that amount calculated on ſome objects upon an average of three years, and including thoſe relative to the mint, to the printing of the ſeveral offices, to the printing of the laws, thoſe for the tranſportation of the mail, for ſupplying the proviſions, clothing, horſes, medicines, cannons, arms, of the army, for Indian goods, and all the immenſe details of the quarter-maſter's depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for building and furniſhing all the ſupplies of the navy, for building light-houſes, and for ſeveral other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent expences, exceeds 1,200,000 dollars a year.</p>
            <p>The aggregate of the two ſums exceeds 2,000,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, a ſum by no means deſpicable, when compared with our population and wealth, when compared with a revenue which till laſt year never exceeded ſeven millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>After having ſtated theſe conſiderations, which appear to me immediately applicable to the preſent diſcuſſion, I would not encroach any longer on the patience of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, had not ſome gentlemen brought into view a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of topics of a more general nature, in which, it may not be altogether uſeleſs to follow them.</p>
            <p>The firſt poſition they aſſume is, that there is a natural tendency in the legiſlative department to encroach upon
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033777_0020_0FF938531F2E2998"/>the executive, and they attempt to prove, by hiſtorical facts, that in all countries, where a republican form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever exiſted, the executive has in fact been ſwallowed up by the legiſlature. The inſtance of the Greek republics and their ſubverſion by Philip of Macedon, and that of Rome, have chiefly been inſiſted upon. Both are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inapplicable to the American conſtitution. The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, whether governments, conſtructed on different principles from ours, have been deſtroyed by the effect of thoſe principles, but, whether the hiſtory of thoſe ſimilar to our own will ſupport the aſſertion?</p>
            <p>The ſmall Greek republics, Athens eſpecially, were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned directly and immediately by the people themſelves. In Rome, where the conſtitution, though imperfectly, was better balanced, the popular branch of government was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an aſſembly of the whole people of the city; and when their virtues and their manners, which could alone ſupport ſuch a ſyſtem, had been corrupted by the ſpoils of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered world—when the dregs of every other town of Italy, admitted to the rights of citizenſhip, had reſorted to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt metropolis—when a few citizens, enriched by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Aſia, had it in their power to bribe that mixed maſs, which, alone, and without being controlled by the other parts of an extenſive empire, diſpoſed of every office of honor or power—when theſe offices, thus obtained, placed ambitious leaders at the head of the ſtanding armies, which conſtituted, at that time, the ſole military force of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we cannot be at a loſs to diſcover the cauſes of the civil wars and conteſts for power which terminated in the eſtabliſhment of deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>Theſe inſtances are inapplicable to our own ſituation, becauſe thoſe governments eſſentially differed from that of America; in that, that the legiſlative power was there lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the people reſiding in a ſingle city, and that it is here veſted in the repreſentatives of the whole people. <hi>There,</hi> not only there was no proper or preciſe diſtribution of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but <hi>there</hi> alſo the people themſelves had the authority of deliberating and of enacting laws, and <hi>here</hi> they have only that of electing the perſons who are to make laws for them. All that can be proved by this, is, that power ought not to be veſted in the body of the people. But, becauſe the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033777_0021_0FF938723864EB90"/>heterogeneous maſs, which conſtituted the body of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in Rome, abuſed the power they had, ought we to conclude that the people of America will abuſe the power they have not? Or, that becauſe a government, where the principle of repreſentation was unknown, was deſtroyed by the corruption of the people, and the ambition of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues, the repreſentative government of the United States will be deſtroyed by the repreſentatives themſelves? The hiſtory of thoſe ancient republics may indeed teach us to cheriſh that principle of repreſentation, which is the leading feature of our conſtitution and the ſafeguard of our liberties. It may teach us another leſſon applicable to all times and to all men; that money accumulated in the hands of a ſingle man, or of a few, may be applied with ſucceſs to the deſtruction of any government. The foreign gold of Philip gave the laſt blow to the expiring liberty of Athens. And the ſame engine in the hands of the citizens of Rome was not attended with leſs fatal effects.</p>
            <p>But if we turn our attention from a view of obſcure anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, to modern Europe, how ſhall the aſſertion be ſupported, that, in repreſentative governments, the legiſlature uſually ſwallows up the executive? Hiſtory tells us, that, three centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ago, repreſentative forms of government exiſted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Europe, in which the repreſentatives of the people, or of a part of the people, had more or leſs power and influence, according to the various circumſtances under which they reſpectively aroſe. But, if we look at the preſent ſituation of that country, ſuch at leaſt as it was before the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, where can we diſcover traces of thoſe inſtitutions? What has become of the Cortes of Spain? of the States General of France? Of the Diets of Denmark? Every where we find the executive in poſſeſſion of legiſlative, of abſolute powers. The glimmerings of liberty, which for a moment ſhone in Europe, were owing to a decay of the feudal ſyſtem. When the princes were deprived of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſervices of their vaſſals and of the revenues derived from their ancient domains; when induſtry and commerce rendered money the principal engine of power; thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular aſſemblies which had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>l-then unimportant right of raiſing taxes and granting ſupplies, aroſe, at once, into conſequence. And as the executive, either by force, or by
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033777_0022_0FF938772CCDBDE8"/>fraud, or by the folly of the people themſelves, ſucceeded in wreſting that power from them, they fell again into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe or inſignificance.</p>
            <p>The fate of the European republics would lead us to ſimilar concluſions. Venice, the greater part of Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Holland, would ſhew us the legiſlative powers equally merging into the executive, and a ſelf-created council or hereditary Stadtholder uſurping, by artifice, the legitimate authority of the repreſentative bodies. Almoſt every veſtige of liberty was eraſed from the continent of Europe; and it is to England that we are indebted for the preſervation of thoſe principles, which from the baſis of our conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is from England that we have borrowed our political inſtitutions. Taught by her example, we have improved them, and adapted them to our own ſituation; but her hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſtill that which is moſt applicable to ourſelves; for, notwithſtanding the happy modifications which we have introduced, the great outlines of repreſentation, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of powers, are the ſame; and notwithſtanding the ſtrong diſtinguiſhing features, there has never exiſted a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment more ſimilar, upon the whole, to our own, than that of that country.</p>
            <p>Some gentlemen, leaving out of view that period in the Britiſh, hiſtory, which ſhould naturally attract our attention, have attempted to draw from the events of the reign of Charles the firſt, a proof of their favorite doctrine, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be apprehended from the encroachments of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. They have forgotten that thoſe events were not the effect of the ſlow progreſs of an eſtabliſhed government, but the reſult of an unſettled conſtitution. The preciſe boundaries of power were not aſcertained; parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the acquirement of rights which had been uſurped or enjoyed by the kings. In its beginning, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt was between the king in his own right and parliament in the right of the people. Convulſions, a civil war, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution enſued. But the poſition, which we controvert, is not that the people, or a popular aſſembly, may, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reſt, from the executive, powers originally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by fraud or violence. It is that, when a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive government, with properly diſtributed powers, is once
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033777_0023_0FF9387FA3373E58"/>eſtabliſhed, the legiſlature will finally encroach upon the executive. This poſition cannot be illuſtrated by the events of Charles's reign; but that period, which extends from the revolution of 1688 to the preſent reign, after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution had been ſettled and aſcertained, is that to which we muſt recur as immediately applicable to our own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>It is during that period that a progreſſing patronage, and a ſyſtematic, corrupting influence have ſunk parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a nominal repreſentation, a mere machine, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience uſed by government for the purpoſe of raiſing ſupplies: the medium through which the executive reach, with eaſe, the purſe of the people. And now, when the farce of obtaining even the nominal conſent of parliament is ſufficiently underſtood, the miniſtry diſpenſe with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and have carried ſo far their contempt for that body, that the ſum ſpent during laſt year, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, exceeds the amount ſpent with the conſent of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The executive, there, have acquired the unlimited and uncontrouled power of raiſing and expending money, and the houſe of commons is under a <hi>moral</hi> obligation of making the neceſſary appropriations.</p>
            <p>But, is it to be apprehended, from the ſtructure of our own conſtitution, that the executive will be deſtroyed by the legiſlature? The legiſlative powers, veſted in congreſs, ſeem to have been given under ſuch efficient checks, as ſhould remove any fears of that nature. They are not given to a ſingle popular branch, but to two diſtinct bodies.—The conſent of both is neceſſary to do any act, and one of them, elected not immediately by the people, but through the medium of the ſtate legiſlatures, is, at the ſame time, united with the executive in the exerciſe of its moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant powers, that of appointing to offices, and that of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaties. Thus, no encroachment can be made upon the executive powers, without the conſent of the ſenate; and this body never will give their aſſent to any act, which, by weakening the executive, would neceſſarily diminiſh their own authority. But, ſhould ever ſuch an act paſs both houſes of congreſs, it muſt not be forgotten, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has veſted the preſident with a modified negative. That negative, already twice exerciſed, was, on both occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033777_0024_0FF938864C405270"/>effectual; and, it is an abſurd ſuppoſition, that, at any time, the preſident ſhould not be ſupported, by at leaſt one third of one of the two branches of the legiſlature, ageanſt any unconſtitutional attempt to deprive him of his legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate authority.</p>
            <p>To theſe conſtitutional barriers, may be added, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any ſuppoſed encroachments of this houſe, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree of permanency in the ſenate and preſident, and the ſyſtematic line of conduct, which a ſingle magiſtrate, whoſe powers are always in action, and a permanent body, who, like the ſenate, are only renewed by thirds, are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to purſue; contraſted with the inſulated efforts of this houſe, liable to a total renovation every two years, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of members occaſionally in ſeſſion, but diſperſed, through this extenſive country, the greater part of the year. Nor ſhould the gentlemen, who attach ſo great a degree of influence to the ſuppoſed popularity of this houſe, forget, that to us belongs the moſt obnoxious ſhare of government, that of laying taxes, whilſt the executive enjoys the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e grateful employment of the individual application of the public money.</p>
            <p>The object of our conſtitution has been, to divide and diſtribute the powers between the ſeveral branches of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. With that diſtribution, and with the ſhare allo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted to us, we are fully ſatisfied. We only wiſh to preſerve the equilibrium intended by the conſtitution.—The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional right, which is the ſubject of this diſcuſſion, is of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative kind. By this exerciſe, we may prevent, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act; nor is there any power, claimed by us, which does not equally attach to the ſenate, and lays us under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol. In this inſtance, we aſk only, that the powers, which the conſtitution has ſeparated, may not be blended; that the power of raiſing and granting money may remain invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate in they legiſlature, and that of appointing to offices, or even, in the caſe of public miniſters, of creating offices, in the executive. But the doctrine, introduced by ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, tends, in its immediate effects, to blend thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by veſting that legiſlative authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they repreſent as ſo formidable, in the ſame hands where the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power is lodged, to overſet every barrier and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the moſt fundamental principles of our conſtitution.</p>

In the ſame manner, as in this inſtance, they inſiſt that we are bound to appropriate, they, in the caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Nor do they ſtop there. The moſt important powers entruſted to congreſs, excluſively of that over money, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in regulating; commerce, raiſing armies, providing a navy, and declaring war. And all theſe are ſwept away, and tranſferred to the executive, by the conſtruction put upon the treaty-making power, which reſts on the ſame foundation with that which is now claimed. The executive has the power of appointing public miniſters, of making commercial treaties, of making ſubſidiary treaties, of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaties of alliance offenſive and defenſive. The ſame principle which ſhould bind us in one caſe, binds us in every other. If we are under a moral obligation to lend our aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in order to carry into effect the conſtitutional powers of the executive; if we have no diſcretion left in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our own; if it be not true, that when an act, in order to be completed, requires the concurrence of two depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, each department has an equal right to give or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe its aſſent; if, in the inſtance of public miniſters, we are bound to appropriate; if, in the inſtance of commercial treaties, we are bound to repeal or to make commercial regulations, in conformity with the proviſions of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the inference is unavoidable, that where the executive has formed a ſubſidiary treaty, we are alſo bound, without any diſcretion being left to us, to appropriate the ſums of money neceſſary to pay the ſubſidy, to raiſe the required number of auxiliary troops, and to provide the ſtipulated number of ſhips of war; that where a treaty of alliance offenſive has been made, we are under a moral obligation to make war. Thus would the important powers entruſted to congreſs by the conſtitution, be reduced to thoſe of coining money, paſſing penal lays, granting patents, and eſtabliſhing poſt-roads.

               </gap>uction which, in one inſtance, veſts in the executive the power of granting money, or any other legiſlative authority, makes the transfer in all the caſes I have enumerated. Any conſtruction which ſhall except a ſingle caſe, ſhall reſtore our diſcretion in all.</p>

Can any fatal conſequences attend the full exerciſe of the conſtitutional diſcretion of congreſs, in granting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? Its general effect muſt be, to diminiſh the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of public money. By reſtraining it, you take away the moſt efficient check, provided by the conſtitution, to controul and to keep within proper bounds that expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus, applied to the preſent amendment, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that diſcretion, may prevent too large a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being applied to the ſupport of foreign miniſters. It never can be uſed to increaſe that ſum. Thus it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an appropriation, for the payment of a ſubſidy to a foreign nation; it may prevent an extenſion of our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal foreign connections; it may prevent the raiſing of troops, or the equipping of a fleet; it may prevent a war. But it never can create an expenditure of money, an army, a navy, a war, which, upon the ground of the doctrine ſupported by our opponents, would not equally take place. The checks intended to prevent thoſe evils, and their inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable attendants, taxation and public debts, cannot be too ſtrong. For it is the natural tendency of governments, and I will add, it is the natural tendency of every adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and of every executive, to encreaſe the rate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure beyond the neceſſary demands, and the real abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the nation. It is here, indeed, that we may appeal to the hiſtory of other countries: it is here that it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us inſtructive leſſons, applicable to all times, and to every form of government.</p>
            <p>Wherever the executive have acquired an uncontrouled command over the purſe of the people, prodigality, wars, exceſſive taxes, and ever progreſſing debts, have unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enſued. Not to ſpeak of Spain and Holland, weakened by thoſe cauſes; not to ſpeak of France, whoſe example is ſtill more awful, the fate of England is ſufficient to warn us againſt the dangers of that ſyſtem. In vain did the inſular ſituation of that nation preſerve it from foreign invaſions; in vain did ſhe alone, amongſt the great powers of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, enjoy the advantages of laws which protected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and encouraged induſtry; in vain did her agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture arrive to a ſuperior degree of perfection; in vain did ſhe obtain the commerce of the world; in vain were the treaſures of India poured in her boſom; in vain did the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033777_0027_0FF93894C8FB7FE0"/>of her inhabitants, and the incalculable effects of machinery, raiſe her manufactures to their unrivalled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate; in vain did ſhe enjoy a century of uninterrupted and unparalleled proſperity. The folly and extravagance of government have kept pace with all the efforts of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with every improvement of the individuals. The whole ſurplus of the labour of the induſtrious part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, has been deſtroyed by expenſive wars; or, if any part eſcaped annihilation, it was what was plundered by the direct or indirect agents of government—it was applied to the accumulation of wealth in the few unproductive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers. And now ſhe ſtands on the brink of ruin, overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by a debt of four hundred and fifty millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and by taxes amounting to twenty-five millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a year, and yet inſufficient to ſupport her peace-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at the end.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Can we hope for a greater proſperity—for a more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate concurrence of circumſtances? Have we any ſecurity that we ſhall be preſerved from thoſe evils? And yet, this is the ſyſtem which flows from the doctrine which would wreſt from the legiſlature their excluſive controul over the expenditure of money; that would veſt in the executive, in certain ſpecific but widely extended caſes, the power of raiſing and applying money. It is the ſyſtem which ſeeks for ſupport in the influence of patronage, by increaſing the number of offices, and avowing a determination to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them excluſively as rewards amongſt men of a certain deſcription. It is the ſyſtem which entangles us in new po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical connections, raiſes ſtanding armies, builds navies, ſquanders the public money, ſwells the public debt, and multiplies the burthens of the people.</p>
            <p>Shall we be told that the frequent elections of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive are a ſufficient ſafeguard againſt every danger? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will, provided we are not altogether loſt to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They afford us that remedy to which hereditary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments cannot reſort. But ſhould we, on that account, ſuppoſe that we are not open to danger? No one can ſet a higher value on the benefits reſulting from an elective go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than myſelf. But let us never forget, that the forms of a conſtitution afford us ſecurity, only as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from abuſes, and that they will become uſeleſs,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033777_0028_0FF938A550682A30"/>whenever they ſhall be applied to cover, protect and defend abuſes.</p>
            <p>May we not be alarmed, when we hear the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Bayard) in accents of regret, telling us that our executive is the moſt weak, the infirm branch of government, and that danger is to be apprehended from its weakneſs; contraſting the ſcanty proviſion and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant patronage of our executive, with the immenſe army, the incalculable navy, the church patronage, the nobility-creating power and the civil liſt of the monarch of Great-Britain? And concluding, by delivering an opinion, that, notwithſtanding all thoſe ſources of corrupting influence, the houſe of commons, were the venal boroughs aboliſhed, would lop off every prerogative of the crown, till, though the features of monarchy might remain, the ſubſtance would be gone.</p>
            <p>A government which loſes the ſubſtance, however it may retain the features of monarchy, is in ſubſtance a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public; and the laſt idea of that gentleman is only, that a pure repreſentation and monarchy are incompatible. But in his opinion, provided an equal repreſentation is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, monarchy is deſtroyed, and a ſubſtantial republic may exiſt, notwithſtanding an accumulation of power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence equal to thoſe poſſeſſed at preſent by the king of England. And, when this follows his declaration of the dangers, to be feared from the weakneſs and infirmity of our executive, are we not irreſiſtibly forced to infer, that he thinks, that the introduction of armies, navies, patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and civil liſt are neceſſary to ſtrengthen our executive, and would not injure the principle of our conſtitution?</p>
            <p>To ſuch doctrines avowed on this floor, to ſuch ſyſtems as the plan of government, which the late ſecretary or the treaſury (Mr. Hamilton) had propoſed in the convention, may perhaps be aſcribed that belief in a part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, the belief, which was yeſterday repreſented as highly criminal, that there exiſtſ in America a monarchico, ariſtocratic faction, who would wiſh to impoſe upon us the ſubſtance of the Britiſh government.</p>
            <p>I have allowed myſelf to make this laſt obſervation, only in reply to the gentleman who read the paper I allude to. It is painful to recriminate: I wiſh denunciations to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033777_0029_0FF938B430819270"/>and I am not in the habit of aſcribing improper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to gentlemen on the other ſide of the queſtion. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall I erect myſelf into a high prieſt of the conſtitution, aſſuming the keys of political ſalvation, and damning without mercy whomſoever differs with me in opinion. But what tone is aſſumed, in reſpect to us, by ſome gentlemen on this floor?</p>
            <p>If we complain of the prodigality of a branch of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or wiſh to controul it, by refuſing to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all the money which is aſked, we are ſtigmatiſed as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organizers; if we oppoſe the growth of ſyſtems of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are charged with a deſign of ſubverting the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and of making a revolution; if we attempt to check the extenſion of our political connections with European nations we are branded with the epithet of jacobins. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions and jacobiniſm do not flow from that line of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy we wiſh to ſee adopted. They belong, they excluſively belong, to the ſyſtem we reſiſt: they are its laſt ſtage;— the laſt page in the book of the hiſtory of governments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its influence. It is after centuries of extravagance, vice and oppreſſion, that the people make revolutions; and it is then, it is during the general convulſion that enſues, that the dregs of the nation riſe to the ſurface, and overwhelm in a common ruin both the oppreſſors and the deliverers of the people.</p>
            <p>Are gentlemen ſerious in their fears? Do they, from us, apprehend revolutions, plunder and maſſacre? Have we not an equal ſtake with themſelves? I ſpeak not of myſelf; but I will aſk what benefit could thoſe men, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called jacobins, derive from a convulſion? Have they leſs property? Have they leſs to loſe or more to hope from a change? If you think us deprived of common integrity, you might, at leaſt, allow us ſome ſhare of common ſenſe. But if no confidence is to be placed in ourſelves, ſome might be put in the people of America and in their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In a country, where a ſcattered population covers an extenſive territory, where the means of ſubſiſtence are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, where the dangerous claſs, which conſtitutes an Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean mob, does not exiſt, where actual oppreſſion is yet unknown; the people who enjoy thoſe advantages, who enjoy a better government and more happineſs than any
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033777_0030_0FF938BE73F135F0"/>other nation of the globe, are not the people ready for a revolution. Nor ſhould it be forgotten, that thoſe parts of the union, that are commonly charged with a deſign of overſetting the conſtitution, are thoſe, which, on account of their peculiar ſituation, on account of the unhappy race of men they contain, would be expoſed to the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous convulſion by an internal revolution.</p>
            <p>But the evils we wiſh to prevent, are preciſely thoſe which attach to a nation in our ſituation; they are ſuch as are eaſily engrafted in the body-politic in its infancy; not calculated in their origin to create much alarm, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a powerful number of men who derive an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate benefit from them, and to whom they are the means of acquiring wealth and power.</p>
            <p>Still, in the ſame ſtyle of denunciation, by whom, it is triumphantly aſked, "by whom are thoſe charges made? By men who have rendered ſervices to their country? A Hampden or a Sidney alone have a right to aſſume the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of oppoſition." Was I to anſwer in the name of thoſe gentlemen, with whom I generally agree in political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, a recapitulation of their ſervices would eaſily repel this attack. Was I to anſwer as an individual, I would ſay that I can claim no right of that kind: I derive none from birth, none from perſonal merit, none from perſonal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. But as a repreſentative of the people, I feel it a right, and not leſs a duty than a right, to reſiſt, upon every occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe ſyſtems, which, if adopted, muſt, in my opinion, prove fatal to America. Should I ever, from any perſonal conſiderations, think myſelf unauthorized to exerciſe that right, I would tell my conſtituents,—Reſume your truſt; ſend, as your repreſentative, a man, who, to the ſame zeal and to the ſame principles, may unite thoſe qualifications, which I want, and which will enable him to fulfil his truſt. And, notwithſtanding the partiality they have, heretofore, evinced in my favour, they would find no difficulty in ſupplying my place.</p>
            <p>But, by what ſtrange fatality did the gentleman from Connecticut (M. GOODRICH) mention Hampden and Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? Surely, his evil genius muſt have ſuggeſted the names; for, in the long liſt of Engliſh patriots, no two could be more applicable to the preſent diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:033777_0031_0FF938C85DB3E990"/>
Whenever we hear of Hampden, we muſt recollect that event in his life, which has immortalized his name. The doctrine of the crown, in the caſe of ſhip-money—the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, againſt which Hampden made his noble ſtand, was, that the king being, by his conſtitutional authority, entruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the defence of the country, was the ſole judge of the danger, and of the neceſſity of the meaſures proper to be adopted; that he muſt poſſeſs the means neceſſary to carry into effect his conſtitutional powers; that he had a right to fix the ſum of money neceſſary for that purpoſe; and that he might, by a tax, raiſe that money from the people. It is true that it is not attempted here to claim this loſt power for the executive. Hampden's trial has ſettled this point. But, in all its other parts, the doctrine of ſhip-money, and the modern doctrine ſupported on this occaſion, are the ſame— the object the ſame—the arguments on which they are grounded the ſame. It is ſtill the power of raiſing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying money, claimed by, or for the executive, in certain caſes, with the only difference, that Charles the firſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed it by levying a tax without the conſent of parliament, and that here, it is to be carried into effect, by depriving the legiſlature of the right of with holding their conſent, through the means of amoral obligation impoſed upon them.</p>
            <p>Sidney has left in his writings a ſtill more permanent monument of his talents, Permit me, ſince his name has been mentioned, to trouble the committee with quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that work, written againſt the divine right of kings, which brought him to the block.</p>
            <p>"Men are naturally propenſe to corruption; and if he, whoſe will and intereſt it is to corrupt them, be furniſhed with the means, he will never fail to do it. Power, honors, riches, and the pleaſures that attend them, are the baits by which men are drawn to prefer a perſonal intereſt before the public good; and the number of thoſe who covet them is ſo great, that he who abounds in them will be able to gain ſo many to his ſervice as ſhall be able to ſubdue the reſt. 'Tis hard to find a tyranny in the world that has not been introduced this way; for no man by his own ſtrength could ever ſubdue a multitude; none could ever bring many to be ſubſervient to his ill deſigns, but by the rewards they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or hoped. By this means, Caeſar accompliſhed his
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033777_0032_0FF938D8D9BB5B48"/>work, and overthrew the liberty of his country, and with it, all that was then good in the world. They who were corrupted in their minds, deſired to put all the power and riches into his hands, that he might diſtribute them to ſuch as ſerved him. ....</p>
            <p>"They ſpeak of employing the revenue in keeping the king's houſe, and look upon it as a propriety to be ſpent as he thinks convenient: which is no leſs than to caſt it into a pit, of which no man ever knew the bottom. That which is given one day, is ſquandered away the next: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are always oppreſt with impoſitions, to foment the vices of the court: Theſe daily increaſing, they grow inſatiable, and the miſerable nations are compelled to hard labor, in order to ſatiate thoſe luſts that tend to their own ruin....</p>
            <p>"The baſe, ſlaviſh, and ſo often ſubdued Aſia, by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of men revenged the defeats they had received from the braveſt; and by infuſing into them a delight in pomp and luxury, in a ſhort time rendered the ſtrongeſt and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of nations the weakeſt and baſeſt. I wiſh our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience did not too plainly manifeſt, that theſe evils were never more prevalent than in our days, when the luxury, majeſtic pomp, and abſolute power of a neighbouring king, muſt be ſupported by an abundance of riches, torn out of the bowels of his ſubjects, which renders them, in the beſt country in the world, and at a time when the crown moſt flouriſhes, the pooreſt and moſt miſerable of all the nations under the ſun. We too well know who are moſt apt to learn from them, and by what means and ſteps they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lead us into the like miſery. But the bird is ſafe when the ſnare is diſcovered, and if we are not abandoned by God to deſtruction, we ſhall never be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſettling of that pomp, which is againſt the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all virtuous people, and has brought all the nations that have been taken with it into the ruin that is intended for us."</p>
            <p>The gentleman of Connecticut (Mr. GOODRICH) actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the pureſt motives, has invited us to ſtate our griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and to meet on ſome ground of reconciliation. To operate at once a reconciliation of parties, inflamed as they now are, is perhaps impracticable, but we may not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſucceſsful in eſtabliſhing at preſent ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033777_0033_0FF8C9FE22AA67A8"/>which may hereafter produce that deſirable object. Yet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad I no other hearers but the gentleman of Maryland to my left (Mr. CRAIK) and the gentleman who ſpoke laſt from New-York (Mr. WILLIAMS) I would not make any obſervation on that point.</p>
            <p>The firſt of thoſe gentlemen going upon the ground of an organization of parties, avows an intention of oppoſing party by party.—He looks upon us as incorrigible—he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that his obſervations are not addreſſed to the houſe, but to his conſtituents, and I believe, it is the firſt time, that a gentleman told the houſe that he meant to uſe them only as a medium, through which to make an electioneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeech. When that gentleman made that declaration, I could not think him in earneſt; and I waited with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for arguments, or ſomething that approached towards arguments; but half an hour of hearing convinced me of his ſincerity, and of my miſtake.—Whilſt he remains blinded by ſuch rooted prejudices, no obſervations of mine could, I am ſure, produce any effect upon him.</p>
            <p>The gentleman from New-York, in the extraordinary hiſtory of parties he gave us, ſeems to have deſcribed the fluctuations of his own mind, rather than thoſe of other men, and he appears to have laid a claim to a knowledge of the motives of all parties, becauſe he had, by turns, been acquainted with all. A great portion of his ſpeech was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in proving the unconſtitutionality of refuſing an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation, for the purpoſe of carrying into a effect the powers of the preſident, or an exiſting law. The firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the kind which I witneſſed, was, that made, two years ago, to withhold the appropriations for the ſupport of the mint eſtabliſhed by law. That gentleman cannot have forgotten who made the motion for that purpoſe, and by whom it was moſt ſtrenuouſly ſupported? I need not addreſs that gentleman on the ſubject of a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parties: he may ſafely be truſted on that point to himſelf: his own good ſenſe and the next vibration will, doubtleſs, bring him back to ſupport our principles.</p>
            <p>Whatever difference of ſentiment may exiſt between us on a variety of topics, there is a ground on which we muſt certainly meet—on which, throughout the United States, there can be—there is, but one opinion. The importance,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033777_0034_0FF938E2946A9BB8"/>the neceſſity of preſerving the union, are too univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to require any comments at this time. The conſtitution, which binds us together, cannot, in my opinion, be made an inſtrument to ſow diviſions of a fatal nature. If it met with ſtrong oppoſition, when it firſt made its appearance, the objections have long been buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion; and it is a fact, that they have never ſince been made the inſtrument of oppoſition. Nor do I apprehend any real danger from the geographical ſituation of the different ſtates: the natural bonds of union, which reſult from their mutual wants, and from their relative ſituation, will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver counteract the effect of the ſlight diverſity of intereſts, which may exiſt.</p>
            <p>Without recurring to any abſtract diſcuſſion, has not experience taught us, that the two important ſubjects of diviſion have heretofore been, money ſyſtems and foreign politics? May we not, with truth, aſcribe to thoſe two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the party ſpirit which now rages in America? Is there any real danger to be apprehended from any other quarter? And if we are ſatisfied that the ſyſtems of debt and taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which have been ſo obnoxious to us, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſubſiſt without any attempt on our part to diſturb them; if we are ſatisfied, that our ſubſiſting compacts with foreign nations, however dangerous ſome of them may have appeared to us, ſhall remain inviolate; will the gentlemen, with whom it is our misfortune to differ, agree, that thoſe money-ſyſtems, thoſe foreign connections, ſhall not be extended beyond their preſent ſtate? We aſk not for the redreſs of paſt grievances, but, with the late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, we exclaim, <hi>"Here let us ſtop."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May we not hope that a fixed determination to prevent the increaſe of the national expenditure, and, ſo far as our preſent engagements will permit, to detach ourſelves from any connection with European politics, will tend to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile parties, and that our united efforts may then prove not altogether unſucceſsful in promoting the happineſs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and conciliating the affections of every part of the Union?</p>

               <p>THE funding ſyſtem of Great-Britain, like that of the United States, originated during the war which reſulted from their revolution (that of 1688) and eſtabliſhed their liberty.</p>
               <p>In 1701, at the concluſion of the reign of William III. after the end of the revolutionary war of Great-Britain, and before they had been involved in any new conteſts, the debt of that country amounted to 16,394,702 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <note n="*" place="bottom">Sinclair's Hiſt of public revenue, part 2d, chap. 4th.</note> equal to dollars, 72,865,342. At that time the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of that nation was 3,895,205 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Ditto, part 3d, chap. 1ſt.</note> equal to dollars, 17,312,022.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of January, 1796, the debt of the United States (after deducting the ſtock of the bank held by the United States, and the ſums redeemed by the ſinking fund) amounted to dollars, 79,811,187 <note n="‡" place="bottom">Report of the ſecretary of the treaſury, dated 28th Dec. 1796.</note> and the revenue for the year ending on the 30th September, 1796, amounted to— dollars, 6,665,685. <note n="§" place="bottom">Ditto, including a ſtatement of receipts and expenditures, dated 15th Dec. 1796.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, the apprehenſion of a fate ſimilar to that of Great-Britain cannot be looked upon as unfounded, when we find that our debt at the end of our own revolutionary war, of the war which gave the firſt birth to that debt, exceeds by ſeven millions of dollars, that contracted by England during the war which alſo created their debt; at the ſame time, that the population and reſources of that country, at that time, were more than double, and their revenue almoſt treble of our own.

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of the debate, the poſition, that every department was independent of the others, was at leaſt nominally abandoned, and another argument was introduced, on which it is proper to make a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid, that whenever a <hi>law</hi> had been enacted, it became the <hi>duty</hi> of each branch of the legiſlature, to do any other act, which might be wanting fully to carry that law into effect: that, for inſtance, if an office had been created by law, it was the duty of the legiſlature to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the money neceſſary to pay the officer. And it was then inferred, that the ſame obligation exiſted in the caſe of foreign miniſters, whoſe office was created, in the opinion of ſome gentlemen, by the conſtitution, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others, by the law of nations.</p>
            <p>It will not be denied, that there are ſome laws, which, from their nature, impoſe an obligation upon future legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures. Laws making, or authorizing loans of money, or contracts, impoſe the ſame obligation to diſcharge the debts, thereby created, under which any individual is to pay his own debts. And the conſtitution has, in ſome caſes, that of judges for inſtance, expreſsly enjoined that duty. But, in caſes, where the conſtitution is ſilent, and where no obligation, in the nature of a debt or contract, reſults from the law, it remains to be proven that the right of diſcretion does not exiſt in that body, where the power is conſtitutionally lodged.</p>
            <p>Not only, no ſuch proofs are advanced, but the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite doctrine can be ſupported by the conſtitution it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The 8th ſection of the 1ſt article, provides, that <q>Congreſs ſhall have power to raiſe and ſupport armies; but no appropriation of money to that uſe ſhall be for a longer term than two years.</q> The object of that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033777_0039_0FF93911B47569B0"/>is, to prevent ſtanding armies without the conſent of every ſucceeding congreſs; it is to prevent a legiſlature from paſſing a perpetual law for that purpoſe, which could not be repealed without the conſent of all the branches of future legiſlatures; and that object is obtained, not by ſaying, that no law for raiſing armies ſhall laſt longer than two years, but that the appropriations for that purpoſe ſhall be limited to that period. To ſay, therefore, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation is to laſt no longer than two years, is to ſay, that every ſucceeding congreſs may, by refuſing an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, prevent the army being kept on foot; it is to ſay, that the conſent of <hi>every</hi> branch of the legiſlature muſt be obtained every other year, in order that the army may be continued. But, if the doctrine obtains, that, where a law is made, future legiſlatures are bound to appropriate, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to carry that law into effect, this clauſe of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution proves altogether nugatory. At this very moment. the law, which regulates the military eſtabliſhment of the United States,—which decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iations for the ſupport of the army, for the pay of the offices cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by that law and thus the conſtitution is made to ſay, that "appropriations ſhall be for no longer time than two years;"—but, that appropriations ſhall neceſſarily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed at the end of every period of two years. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is made to ſay, that the conſent of every ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe of repreſentatives is neceſſary to ſupport an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my —but, that every ſucceeding houſe is bound to give its conſent. Either that clauſe of the conſtitution means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either that clauſe muſt be eraſed from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or it admits that there exiſts a right to withhold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations for the ſupport of an eſtabliſhment or office created by law. Otherwiſe the conſtitution, in order to obtain the intended object, would have declared, not that appropriations ſhould be limited in their duration, but, that the laws creating an army and military offices ſhould be temporary. It is remarkable, that in Great-Britain, the ſame object, that is to ſay, a power in the houſe of commons,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033777_0040_0FF9391906590FA0"/>to prevent the exiſtence of a ſtanding army, is obtained through ſimilar means. The mutiny-bill, which ſubjects the army to that diſcipline, that alone can inſure its exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, is always annual; and it has never been denied, that it was for that purpoſe, that that bill was not made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. Yet, according to the modern doctrine of moral obligation, as the laws of England for raiſing armies are not temporary, it would follow, that the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is <hi>bound</hi> to paſs the mutiny-bill yearly; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the cuſtom of making it an annual law is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nugatory.</p>
            <p>The ſecond poſition aſſumed, in ſupport of the doctrine of moral obligation, to appropriate for the ſupport of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters, is as unfounded as the firſt. Neither the conſtitution nor the law of nations, <hi>create</hi> the office of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters. Both <hi>recognize the poſſible exiſtence</hi> of thoſe offices; both declare that thoſe offices <hi>may,</hi> but neither directs that they <hi>ſhall</hi> exiſt. To ſay, that becauſe the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States and Turkey are two independent nations, and may, reſpectively, ſend public miniſters one to the other, it follows, that the office of ambaſſador from the United States to Turkey exiſted from the day of the declaration of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, is to revive the ſcholaſtic entities of the 13th century. To ſay, that becauſe the conſtitution has veſted in the executive, the power of appointing public miniſters, it follows, that the office of ambaſſador from the United States to Turkey, now exiſts; or to ſay, that an office ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> been created more than twenty years, and yet has never exiſted, are metaphyſical ſubtleties, far beyond my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and which I cannot under take to reconcile.</p>
            <p>But, it may confidently be aſſerted, that the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that ſtrange doctrine, do not themſelves ſuppoſe that either the law of nations, or the conſtitution, go any farther than a recognition of the poſſible exiſtence of the office. For, if it was true, that the offices of public mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from the United States, to every other independent nation, were actually created by either, it muſt follow, that, in the ſame manner, as congreſs is ſaid to be bound to appropriate for their ſupport, ſo the preſident muſt alſo be bound to fill, by appointments, all thoſe pre-exiſting offices. He muſt be bound to fill the office of ambaſſador
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033777_0041_0FF9392217A76798"/>to Auſtria, to Turkey, and to the Pope, created by the law of nations, or by the conſtitution: that is to ſay, created by a pre-exiſting and controuling law, in the ſame manner as he is bound to fill the offices of judges, or collectors of the revenue, which have been created by law. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that in this laſt caſe he has any diſcretion, and it is not denied, that in the caſe of miniſters, he may or he may not appoint. The two caſes, therefore, are not ſimilar. The legal obligation which binds his diſcretion in one caſe, does not bind it is the other. In the firſt inſtance, he is bound, becauſe the offices are created by a pre-exiſting law: in the laſt inſtance, he is not bound, becauſe the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not created by any pre-exiſting law.</p>
            <p>It was of importance, that the aſſertion ſhould have been refuted, <q>that thoſe offices were <hi>created</hi> by the law of nations or by the conſtitution, or in any manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted before any appointment had ever been made by the executive;</q> not only in order to eſtabliſh the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional powers of congreſs, but alſo in relation to another point, which was diſcuſſed in a former part of the debate.</p>
            <p>When ſpeaking of the danger, which might hereafter ariſe from an extenſion of the executive patronage, if left unchecked by the power of congreſs over the expenditure of money, it was obſerved, that the offices of public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to foreign courts were preciſely thoſe, which, from their nature and the rate of ſalary, would be moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to gentlemen who held ſeats in the legiſlature. In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that obſervation, it was ſtated, that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 1794, to the preſent time, only five pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic miniſters (excluſively of envoys extraordinary) had been ſent to Europe, and of thoſe five, four were taken out of congreſs, viz. Meſſrs. Munroe, Murray, King, and W. Smith. But ſome further obſervations were made on the ſubject of the appointment of this laſt gentleman. At the beginning of the laſt extraordinary ſeſſion of congreſs, there were five ordinary miniſters in Europe, to wit: four mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters plenipotentiary to Great-Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, reſpectively, and a miniſter reſident to Holland, and the ſums appropriated by law, were fixed according to that eſtabliſhment. During the courſe of that ſeſſion, the preſident of the United States appointed Mr. Adams,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033777_0042_0FF93929C0A8C708"/>(who had been appointed miniſter plenipotentiary to Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, by the late preſident,) miniſter plenipotentiary to Pruſſia, where, till then, we had no miniſter. A new embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy was thus created, which, being filled by the removal of the miniſter to Portugal, left this laſt office vacant. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional appropriation was aſked from congreſs for that purpoſe; it was debated, and oppoſed in the houſe on the 3d of July. Mr. Smith, then a member, argued and voted in favour of it. The motion, made in a committee of the whole, to refuſe that appropriation, was rejected on the ſame day; and on the ſucceeding day, the bill making that, and ſeveral other appropriations, paſſed the houſe. On the following day, the 5th, Mr. Smith was officially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the preſident meant to appoint him to the embaſſy of Portugal, and on the 6th, his nomination was accordingly laid before the Senate. On the ſame day, the propriety of making the appropriation was diſcuſſed before that body, the queſtion was taken by yeas and nays, and carried in the affirmative, and the bill paſſed that houſe with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n amendment. The bill finally paſſed both houſes on the 7th, and became a law on the 10th of the ſame mouth.</p>
            <p>Had the additional appropriation been refuſed, the ſums already appropriated would have enabled the preſident to pay the ſalaries of the miniſters to England, France, Spain and Holland, and alſo that of the new embaſſy to Pruſſia; for thoſe ſums were appropriated generally, and though merely ſufficient to pay five miniſters, might, according to his diſcretion, be applied to pay miniſters to any five fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign countries he choſe: but he could not then have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a new miniſter to Portugal. Mr. Smith, therefore, was appointed to an office which could not have been fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, without that appropriation made by that congreſs of which he was a member,—without that appropriation for which he voted himſelf. A view of thoſe circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to expreſs an opinion, that that appointment was improper, and contrary to the ſpirit of the conſtitution, which enacts, (article 1ſt, ſection 6th,) that "no ſenator or repreſentative ſhall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the United States, which ſhall have been <hi>created,</hi> or
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033777_0043_0FF93930602C6F58"/>the emoluments whereof ſhall have been encreaſed during ſuch time." Had Mr. Smith been appointed miniſter to Pruſſia, inſtead of Portugal, I would have ſaid that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment was contrary to the letter of the conſtitution it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but as the mode adopted was to create a new embaſſy, to fill that embaſſy by the miniſter to Portugal, and then to give the vacancy thus created to the member of congreſs, I was of opinion, although the money voted by congreſs, was in fact applied to pay his ſalary, that the appointment could only be ſaid to be contrary to the ſpirit of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. That opinion was altogether grounded upon the principle that the office of public miniſter to a foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where we had not an before, did not begin to exiſt till the firſt appointment took place. But if the fanciful doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is admitted, that thoſe offices were created by the law of nations or conſtitution, that although not exiſting in fact, yet they were pre-exiſting; it follows, that the ſalutary proviſions of that clauſe of the conſtitution ſhall be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual, and that, at ſome future period, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may appoint members of congreſs, during the time for which they were elected, to as many new offices of ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, as it may be neceſſary, not to <hi>create,</hi> but to <hi>fill,</hi> in order to obtain a majority that ſhall think themſelves under a <hi>moral</hi> obligation to make the requiſite appropriations.</p>
            <p>When it was thought fit to abandon the poſition that the ſeveral departments might have checks within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but could not be checked by the others, an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the caſes in which thoſe checks might exiſt was attempted; and it was ſaid that a department might be checked by another firſt, when the power was expreſsly given by the conſtitution, as in the inſtance of the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the preſident to any law of congreſs; ſecondly, when any department acted contrary to the conſtitution, as in the inſtance of the judiciary, declaring a law to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional; thirdly, when a general power was given to one department, and a ſpecific one, which might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the general one, to another department, as in the inſtance of the general power of making treaties given to the preſident and ſenate, and of the ſpecific power of declaring war veſted in congreſs, which laſt power muſt be ſuppoſed to be an exception to the treaty making pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033777_0044_0FF939406521D048"/>This was the firſt time that a conceſſion was made that the treaty-making power was limited in any inſtance by the ſpecific powers of congreſs; but the conceſſion went farther than was intended; for, upon the ſame principle, it muſt be conceded, that the ſpecific power of regulating commerce, veſted in congreſs, is, alſo an exception to the power of making treaties: and it would be extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſhow how the power of making treaties, or of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ambaſſadors, could be carved out of, and make an exception to the power of granting and appropriating money excluſively veſted in congreſs.</p>
            <p>It muſt, however ſtrike the moſt careleſs obſerver, that the three inſtances, where the conceſſion was thus made, were not brought in, in order to illuſtrate the claſſification, but, that the claſſification was made, in order to ſuit the three caſes, which it was thought convenient to concede. It is abſurd to ſuppoſe that departments can check one another reſpectively, except when one of them acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the conſtitution, or when the power of checking a conſtitutional act, is given by the conſtitution. And that power is given in two different manners, either by firſt giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>full</hi> power to one department, and then declaring, that that power ſhall not, however, be exerciſed without the conſent of another department, as in the caſe of the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the preſident; or, by dividing the power in the firſt inſtance between two departments, giving only a <hi>partial</hi> power to each over the act to be completed, as has already ſufficiently been explained.</p>
            <p>It will not be improper here to repeat what was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the former part of the debate, that this was the firſt time when a conſtitutional objection was made to the power of the houſe, to refuſe an appropriation in this caſe. When the firſt law was paſſed, providing the means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with foreign nations, which was in the year 1790, the following obſervations were made by Mr. William Smith, of S. Carolina. "The arrangement which ſome gentlemen talked of, laid with the preſident and ſenate. It was they who were to determine when and where to ſend ambaſſadors and other public miniſters; all that the houſe had to do, was to make proviſion for their ſupport. The queſtion then is not whether any ſhould be appointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033777_0045_0FF9394D05C2BB40"/>it does not lay with the houſe to determine; to be ſure, if they were of opinion that all intercourſe with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations, ſhould be cut off, <hi>they might decline to make proviſion for them,</hi> but he did not believe this was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any gentleman: perhaps gentlemen may think it queſtionable, whether the preſident can ſend them, unleſs they are previouſly eſtabliſhed by law; but for his part, he thought it was a buſineſs clearly within the executive branch, and with which the legiſlature had nothing to do, but to provide for the payment of their ſalaries and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>and this,</hi> if it was properly conſidered, <hi>was a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent check; if the houſe</hi> at any time <hi>neglected to provide</hi> for ſuch officers, <hi>the preſident muſt</hi> either <hi>recal them</hi> or pay them out of his private purſe." (<hi>See Congreſſional Regiſter-vol.</hi> 3, <hi>p.</hi> 115, 116.)</p>
            <p>On the ſame principle, it is, that the bill has been uniformly limited to two years; and it is the only law, fixing the ſalaries of officers, which is thus limited. Mr. Lawrence, who moved the clauſe to limit the act, ſaid, that "it was proper to do it, becauſe the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the union might require a leſs ſum perhaps than was contemplated at preſent." (do. p. 177.) Was not this allowing that congreſs muſt be judges of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances? for, if the executive alone was to judge, and if congreſs was bound to ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>priate, what danger could reſult from making the act perpetual? or what advantage could be derived from the limitation?</p>
            <p>The only idea thrown out in relation to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional queſtion, which has not been notice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is, that as we had agreed, that, after having made the appropriations neceſſary to carry a treaty into effect, that treaty, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choate it might be before, became then binding upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and upon congreſs; thus, in this inſtance, as congreſs had agreed in 1796, to appropriate at the rate of 9000 dollars each, for the miniſters to Spain and Portugal, and in 1797, to appropriate for the miniſter to Pruſſia, thoſe acts muſt alſo be binding upon us at preſent. It is almoſt an inſult to the ſagacity of the reader, to obſerve, that the <hi>annual</hi> appropriations, made for thoſe miniſters, can give no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſional ſanction to the office, beyond the period of time to which they extend; and that the reaſon why appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033777_0046_0FF9395745EBBF40"/>made to carry a treaty into effect, render that treaty binding upon the nation and congreſs, is becauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the aſſent of the legiſlature to a <hi>compact</hi> with another nation.</p>

               </head>
               <p>That conſuls were adequate to the protection of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, in the caſes here ſpecified, and in common times had been fully conceded in the courſe of the debate by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman well acquainted with the ſubject (Mr. Pinkney.) Their duties are defined by Marten's Law of Nations, (book 4, chap. 3, ſect. 8.) to be, "to watch over the commercial intereſts of the ſtate, <hi>particularly the obſervation of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of commerce,</hi> and to aſſiſt with their advice and <hi>interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> thoſe of their nation, whom commercial purſuits or connections have led to the place for which they are named." But when the law of nations or treaties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by government itſelf, as has frequently been the caſe with the belligerent powers during the preſent war, the interference of diplomatic characters, of public mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becomes neceſſary. The amendment propoſed, would not, if adopted, have affected the miniſters to any of the belligerent powers, and could not, therefore, be charged as withdrawing all protection from commerce. But, it is remarkable, that, when the inconveniences ariſing from the conduct of the belligerent powers were deſcribed, when it was ſtated that conſuls, reſiding in ſea-ports, could not attend at the ſeat of government, and ſpecially at Paris, to protect the intereſts of their fellow citizens, whoſe fate was generally decided there, and when from thence a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was drawn, that conſuls were inadequate to protect commerce, no mention was made of the conſequence of the extraordinary ſituation in which our commerce was thus placed in France. The conſequence was, that a number of extra-miniſterial duties, falling on the public miniſter there, which were not ſtrictly within the province of his office, it became neceſſary to appoint a conſul general to reſide at Paris, to correſpond with the different conſuls in the

In the ſame manner, the numerous captures of the Britiſh, have rendered a new appointment neceſſary in that country, in order to attend to thoſe duties which do not fall within the province of a public miniſter, and a ſpecial agent has been appointed there, to aſſiſt our citizens in proſecuting their claims before courts of juſtice—an office pretty ſimilar to that of conſul general at Paris.</p>
