            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This appeal to your ſenſes and reaſon has become neceſſary, by the unfortunate diviſion that has taken place among the phyſicians of Philadelphia

            <head>A SECOND ADDRESS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE partial change, which the events con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the late epidemic have made in the minds of the citizens of Philadelphia reſpecting its origin, has encouraged me to attempt, by a ſecond addreſs, to produce a more general conviction of truth upon this intereſting ſubject.</p>
            <p>Two opinions chiefly divide our phyſicians and citizens. The one conſiſts in a belief that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a peculiar, or what is called a ſpecific contagion; that it was imported from Siam in the Eaſt Indies nearly ſixty years ago into the Weſt Indies, where it has prevailed ever ſince, and that it has been imported from thence from time to time into this city and other ſea-ports of the United States. Thoſe who deny this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the common bilions fever of warm
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036254_0005_1008A9956E4BDA38"/>
ſeaſons and climates—that it is generated from putrid matters by the heat of our ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal months, and that its late malignity is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the atmoſphere having acquired, what has long been known among phyſicians by the name of an inflammatory conſtitution.</p>
            <p>If it be derived from the firſt ſource that has been mentioned, the condition of our city is hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. <hi>It can never be eradicated.</hi> Our beds, cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and even the timbers of our houſes will retain it till the end of time. The ſooner therefore we deſtroy our capital, and conſign the ſpot upon which it ſtands, to paſture grounds, the better.</p>
            <p>But our epidemic is not the Siam fever. The condition of our city is not hopeleſs. The return of our diſeaſe may be prevented. Its feeds cannot be retained in our beds or houſes from year to year, much leſs can they be imported. As well might a coal of fire be brought from one of the Weſt India iſlands to this country, or a lump of ice be conveyed from this country to one of the Weſt India iſlands, in the open air, as the yellow fever be imported from thence ſo as to become <hi>general</hi> in our city.</p>
            <p>The rare appearance of peſtilential diſeaſes in Europe during the preſent century, has unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036254_0006_1008A9970B5780E0"/>
obliterated much of the knowledge which was formerly collected concerning them. The writers of the laſt century ſpeak conſtantly of the connection between putrid exhalations, an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory conſtitution of the air, and malignant fevers. The animal and vegetable creation bear witneſs that ſuch a ſtate has exiſted in the United States ſince the year 1791.—This inflammatory conſtitution of the air is ſometimes local, but it more frequently pervades whole countries, and ſometimes the whole globe. The yellow fever has ſeldom appeared in one part of America without appearing at the ſame time, or ſoon afterwards in other parts. It was epidemic in Charleſton and Philadelphia in 1699. And again in the ſame cities in 1799. It was ſickly in the <hi>country</hi> as well as in the city of Philadelphia in the year 1747. Of this fact the following extract of a letter from David Palmer to the late Edward Pennington, then in Barbadoes, politely put into my hands by his ſon Edward, contains a ſatisfactory document. The letter is dated the 29th of 6th month 1747. "People are exceeding ſickly in <hi>many parts of the country,</hi> and eſpecially in the city, where upwards of 20 are frequently buried in a day; the yellow fever being very brief, carrying off healthy people in two or three days."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:036254_0007_1008A9989AE18FB0"/>It has been remarked in many publications upon this ſubject, that the inflammatory conſtitution of the air had often been noticed by Hippocrates and Dr. Sydenham. I once believed the knowledge of this elementary fact in the ſcience of medicine, to be general, but the publications of ſeveral Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can phyſicians upon the yellow fever, have convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that this is not the caſe. From numerous teſtimonies of a belief in the influence of a change in the inſenſible qualities of the air, altering the character of epidemics, I ſhall ſelect the following.</p>
            <p>"It is certain (ſays Dr. Moſeley) that diſeaſes undergo changes and revolutions. Some continue for a ſucceſſion of years, and vaniſh when they have exhauſted the temporary but ſecret cauſe which produced them. Others have appeared and diſappeared ſuddenly; and others have their periodical returns."</p>
            <p>The Doctor aſcribes a malignant fever among the dogs in Jamaica (improperly called from one of its ſymptoms hydrophobia) to a change in the atmoſphere in the year 1783. It was ſaid to have been imported, but experience, he ſays, proved the fact to be otherwiſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe upon Tropical Diſeaſes, p. 4<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

In another place he ſays, "It ſeems certain that this unknown matter diſpoſes all the humors to a ſudden and bad putrefaction."<note n="*" place="bottom">Commentaries on Boerhaave's Aphoriſms, Vol. V. p. 226, 230.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. John Stedman has related many facts in his eſſay upon inſalutary conſtitutions of the air, which prove, that diſeaſes are influenced by a quality in it which, he ſays, "is productive of corruption," but which has hitherto eluded the reſearches of phyſicians.<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 135.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Lempriere, a Britiſh military ſurgeon, who has publiſhed in the preſent year practical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the diſeaſes of Jamaica, after mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unuſual mortality occaſioned by the yellow fever within the laſt five or ſix years in that iſland, aſcribes it wholly "to that particular conſtitution of atmoſphere upon which the exiſtence of epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics at one period rather than another, depend."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Vol. II. p. 31.</note>
            </p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:036254_0009_1008A99DD4623360"/>The novelty of a diſeaſe is no proof of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation. Dr. Sydenham deſcribes a fever which appeared with new ſymptoms in London in 1685. It was ſo unlike all the epidemics he had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he calls it a "new fever," but he does not upon this account hint at its being of foreign origin.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. II. p. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Dr. Moſeley ſays the common "nerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remitting fever changed its type in Jamaica, in 1770. It raged with unuſual violence, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off almoſt all the young people who were ſeized. It returned in the ſpring and ſummer of the two ſucceeding years, but has not been there in the ſame form, ſince" The Doctor does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from another country, nor does he aſk, why did it not prevail in former years.</p>
            <p>A malignant fever has lately appeared in York county in this ſtate, which diſcovers itſelf firſt by a pain in the heel. The inhabitants of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have never ſuſpected it to be an alien diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The hiſtories of the firſt ſettlement of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try contain many accounts of the prevalence of the yellow fever among the Indians. The Creeks loſt 600 of their nation by it in the year 1798.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036254_0010_1008A9A305E63D18"/>
Say, ye conjurers who preſide over the health of your tribes, did you ever dream that this diſeaſe was imported?</p>
            <p>The influence of the atmoſphere and of other circumſtances, has been evinced in the changes which our autumnal fever has undergone ſince the year 1760. From that time till 1778 it appeared in the form of a mild intermittent, or a ſlow nerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever. After the year 1778 it appeared chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the form of a mild bilious remittent. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were affected by this fever in the year 1780. It was known by the name of the break bone fever. It made its firſt appearance in Front ſtreet near the <hi>ſhipping,</hi> and yet no one believed it, though a new diſeaſe, in ſome of its ſymptoms, to be of foreign origin. Since the year 1793, both the nervous and mild bilious fevers have nearly diſappeared, and an inflammatory intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or remitting and malignant fever has taken their place. This change in the character of our autumnal fevers has been acknowledged by all our phyſicians. They unanimouſly declare bark to be leſs effectual in them than in former years, and moſt of them find it neceſſary to uſe blood-letting in a greater or leſs quantity, in order to cure them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:036254_0011_1008A9A49D478778"/>It has often been aſked, why was not the yellow fever common before the year 1793? If we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to be imported, I beg leave to aſk, what has become of our nervous and mild remittents? Both queſtions can be anſwered in no other way, than by admitting, the former, to occupy the place of the latter.</p>
            <p>It is no new thing for diſeaſes to vary, not only from changes in the atmoſphere, but from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of agriculture and civilization in a country. Mr. Kalm tells us in his travels through North America, that the old Swedes whom he met on the creeks in Weſt Jerſey, told him that the bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever was a modern diſeaſe among them. Their anceſtors knew no other acute diſeaſe than pleuriſies, and ſuch other fevers as were produced by the changes in the weather in the winter and ſpring months.</p>
            <p>In no part of Europe, and in none of the Weſt India Iſlands, is the yellow fever believed to be ſpread by contagion. Admitting it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated in Philadelphia by contagion, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which compoſes it muſt be ſubject to ſome laws. It ought to ſpread where it prevails in the greateſt quantity, and in the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated ſtate, agreeably to what is obſerved of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036254_0012_1008A9AAC7BD1440"/>
all other contagious diſeaſes—But this we know is far from being the caſe. The diſeaſe has often been ſaid to be communicated through a whole neighbourhood from a ſuppoſed infected ſhip, and to affect a number of perſons at a hundred yards diſtance from the ſhip, and from each other, and yet the ſame diſeaſe when carried into the healthy parts of the city, and even terminating in death with ſymptoms of what is called general putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has periſhed without propagating itſelf in a ſingle inſtance. To ſuppoſe it to be contagious under the above circumſtances, is to make a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, outweigh a mountain, or to believe one, to be more than a thouſand.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid in favor of the contagious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this fever that it often ſpreads through a whole family when introduced into it by an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. This is true, and ſo does the common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent in the ſouthern ſtates, and yet no one has ſuppoſed this mild ſtate of fever to be propagated by contagion. The ſame exhalation which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the diſeaſe in one member of a family, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it in moſt caſes in them all. Fear, grief, and the fatigue induced by attending the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon affected, are its uſual exciting cauſes in all the reſt. There is no inſtance of an individual infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036254_0013_1008A9ADF4DCD640"/>
a whole family when he carries the diſeaſe into a dry and healthy part of the country.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here repeat an argument againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the yellow fever by contagion, derived from its ſudden and general extinction by means of early froſt. The operation of cold in this form, is confined <hi>excluſively</hi> to the atmoſphere. It acts long before it becomes ſo intenſe as to produce ice in our houſes in which the contagion is ſaid to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated, and, where the temperature of the air ſeldom undergoes for many weeks, that degree of cold which is neceſſary to deſtroy the ſeeds of the diſeaſe out of doors. I beg the reader to pauſe, and reflect upon this fact. It cannot be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. Its evidence, unſupported by others, which oppreſs the ſubject by their number, is alone ſufficient to decide the queſtion in favour of the diſeaſe being derived excluſively from domeſtic exhalation, and exiſting in the atmoſphere during the warm weather.</p>
            <p>All error is at war with itſelf. It is painful to a citizen of Pennſylvania to meaſure the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his fellow citizens by the preſent health law. The moſt ſevere penalties are threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon perſons who viſit the Weſt India ſhips during their quarantine at the fort, even in caſes where there is no ſick perſon on board of them,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036254_0014_1008A9B15DD5DCF8"/>
and yet the ſame law permits phyſicians, nurſes, and the members of the board of health to go into any houſe or ſtreet they pleaſe after attending, or viſiting patients in the city in every ſtage of the fever. But there is ſomething much worſe than folly in this health law. By admitting the yellow fever to be propagated excluſively by contagion, it has produced the deſertion of the ſick by friends, and relations, and ſometimes the excluſion of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to periſh in the ſtreet, or in a barn. By theſe means, ſo ſhocking to humanity, it has added greatly to the mortality of the diſeaſe. It has moreover impoſed a painful quarantine of fifteen or twenty days upon our mariners in a ſickly ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hot months, within a few miles of their friends.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of notice, that quarantine laws have never been adopted by Britain, France nor Spain, in their long and extenſive intercourſe with their reſpective iſlands, to guard againſt the importation of the yellow fever. To none of thoſe European countries has that fever ever been communicated by the ſhoals of ſick, and convaleſcent ſailors and ſoldiers that have arrived in them, both in peace and war, from every part of the Weſt Indies. Their quarantine laws are intended to operate chiefly againſt ſhips coming from the Levant and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036254_0015_1008A9B39F9F8138"/>
other ſources of the plague. It was becauſe we derived the yellow fever from Weſt India contagion in 1793, that the court of London impoſed a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine upon veſſels coming from Philadelphia in that year. Our obſtinate attachment to this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has produced a general belief in Europe that our fever <hi>is not</hi> the fever of the Weſt Indies, for this is now known not to ſpread by contagion. But further; our quarantine has combined our ſiſter ſtates againſt us, by teaching them to adopt our error, as ſoon as the diſeaſe makes its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among us, and thereby to add to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which our city has ſuſtained by the diminution of our European commerce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accidental coincidence</hi> is a frequent ſource of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. A peſtilential fever which accidentally ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the introduction of the potatoe into France, produced an edict againſt the cultivation and uſe of that wholeſome root by the French court. There was a time in the infancy of medical knowledge in Philadelphia, when the autumnal fever was aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uſe of the water-melon, a fruit which above all others is calculated to prevent it. In like manner, the arrival of a ſhip from the Weſt Indies, and the ſickneſs or death of a ſailor induced by the putrid exhalation of our docks and wharves, occurring in the months of July or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036254_0016_1008A9B843A8D420"/>
(the uſual time of our bilious fevers appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) has unfortunately connected them together as cauſe and effect, by an aſſociation as unfounded as the two ſimilar errors that have been mentioned.</p>
            <p>It is curious to obſerve the relationſhip of the human race eſtabliſhed in every part of the world, not leſs by the form of their bodies, than by their reſemblance in the nature of their errors.</p>
            <p>There is not a nation upon the face of the earth, that admits the plague to be of domeſtic origin. It has been chaſ'd from country to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, until it has been fought for in the planets. Nay, further, from the reluctance which all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons feel to becoming the parents of this diſeaſe, they have overlooked phyſical or ſecond cauſes in its generation, and have derived it from heaven itſelf. Whatever may be its deſign; it is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſuppoſe a miraculous departure from the ordinary means by which Providence governs our world, to take place in its production.</p>
            <p>A ſimilar relationſhip is eſtabliſhed between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remote from each other, and differing in a hundred particulars, in adopting certain errors as the means of perpetuating their miſery. The ſeeds of the plague have been preſerved for ſeveral
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036254_0017_1008A9BD37589440"/>
centuries in Turkey by a belief in predeſtination. The ſeeds of the yellow fever have been preſerved in Philadelphia for five years, by a belief in impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The fraternity of mankind appears ſtill further in the folly of the meaſures they have adopted to relieve themſelves from their calamities. A pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Virgin Mary was fixed upon a gate at Moſcow to ſtop the progreſs of the plague in that city in the year 1771. The primate of Moſcow was torn to pieces by a deluded mob for an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to cure their prejudices by removing that picture. Equally abſurd and ineffectual have been our quarantines to prevent the annual return of the yellow fever, and nearly as ſucceſsful for a while have been the attacks upon the characters of the phyſicians who have attempted to ſhow their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency for that purpoſe, as the outrage was upon the life of the innocent and benevolent Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Archbiſhop.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid by ſome Phyſicians, that intermitting, and mild bilious fevers only, are produced by exhalations from marſhes and alſo ſources of putrefaction. The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

been mentioned in former publications, that the moſt malignant and fatal epidemics are the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the ſame obvious and putrid cauſes. They are calculated not only to convince, but to alarm every perſon who has fixed his hopes of ſafety upon a quarantine law, and lived at eaſe amidſt filth and danger in our city, and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>
            <p>In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for the year 1796, there is an account by Mr. Pitot of a mortal diſeaſe that prevailed in Languedoc, which was found to be occaſioned by ſtagnating water. In a town called Ague-morte in the year 1745 out of near 1800 perſons, but ten or twelve eſcaped the prevailing fever. Of the children alone there died 200 of thoſe who were affected. The town of Frontignan, but three leagues from that healthy city of Montpellier, was nearly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated, and the village of Baleruc in the ſame neighbourhood, loſt three-fourths of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants by this fatal epidemic. It was remarkable, ſays Mr. Pinot, that it increaſed, and declined in its mortal effects according as the waters were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtagnate, or not, in thoſe and other adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places.</p>

               </note> we find the following account of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever produced by putrid exhalations in the neighbourhood of Carthagena, the mortal effects of which were equal to thoſe which have occurred in 1797, and 1798, from a ſimilar cauſe in our city. "Of diſeaſes, the moſt endemical, are intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and <hi>putrid</hi> fevers. Theſe ariſe from the prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imity of an extenſive ſwamp already mentioned [called Almojar] containing many hundred acres, which might <hi>eaſily</hi> be drained, ſo as to produce the moſt luxuriant crops.

            <p>In the valuable work by Mr. Lampriere before quoted, there are many proofs of the connection between putrid exhalations and the yellow fever in the Weſt-Indies.

            <p>"A malignant fever having raged with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence for two ſummers ſucceſſively in the city of New-York, about forty years ago, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his thoughts to the public, on the moſt probable CURE of the calamity.

draining and cleaning the city, which was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt happy effects."</p>
            <p>If a belief in the importation of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produced no other evils than a miſapplication of public money, and a neglect of internal means to prevent it; the error would be a ſerious calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our city. But it is accompanied with other evils which are of a much greater magnitude. It is the ſource of all the diſſentions of our Phyſicians upon the ſubject of the <hi>treatment</hi> of the fever, and of nearly all the mortality which has attended it ſince its appearance in our city in the year 1793. The truth of this aſſertion will I hope appear by the following conſiderations:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There has been but one morbid ſtate of the body, or in other words, but one epidemic diſeaſe in our city for ſeveral years in the ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal months; and this diſeaſe is at all times the offspring of putrid exhalation. It is known by many names, ſuch as diarrhoea or lax, colera mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, or a vomiting and lax, dyſentery or bloody flux, bilious colic, nervous fever, and bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever. Let not the reader heſitate in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this propoſition. He admits a truth which is ſimilar to it. Every body believes the gout to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036254_0022_1008A9CB5B1015D8"/>
be a <hi>ſingle</hi> diſeaſe, and yet it is well known that it occupies under the different circumſtances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and ſeaſon, the ſtomach, bowels, lungs, and brain as well as the limbs.—In ſupport of this remark, I might add further the authority of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpectable authors, and produce many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred caſes to ſhew that all theſe different forms of diſeaſe frequently appear in the ſame perſon in the courſe of two, or three days, juſt as the gout ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all the parts of the body that have been named, in the courſe of the ſame fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mild intermitting, the common remitting, and the malignant intermitting and remitting yellow fever are all different grades of the ſame form of diſeaſe, and derived from the ſame cauſe. It is ſtrange that this aſſertion ſhould ever have been denied or even doubted by any perſon that has ſeen the immenſe difference between the mild diſtinct, and the malignant confluent ſmall pox. No one has ever ſuppoſed them to be ſpecifically different in their origin and nature, and yet the mildeſt intermittent does not differ more from the malignant yellow fever, than the ſmall pox by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation does from that grade of it which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an univerſal and connected eruption on the ſkin, livid ſpots, and hemorrhages from all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> apertures of the body.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:036254_0023_1008A9CD77B7A430"/>It is to be lamented that medicine is ſtill in the pagan and ſavage ſtate from which religion and philoſophy have happily emerged in our country. We no longer worſhip every inſtrument by which the Supreme Being conveys his goodneſs to us, as a ſeparate deity, nor do we believe with the Indians ſnow, ice, and water to be diſtinct eſſences; but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent forms of the ſame original ſubſtance. The ſame unity obtains in the morbid ſtates of the ſyſtem in the ſummer and autumnal months. All the different forms of diſeaſe in that period are the effects of <hi>one</hi> cauſe. Its force is varied in different months, and in different parts of the city according to the greater or leſs activity of the putrid exhalation, but its nature is always and every where the ſame</p>
            <p>All truth is uſeful. Let us next examine the propoſitions which have been delivered by the teſt of their utility.</p>
            <p>By believing that we have but one diſeaſe in our city after the firſt of June, and that this diſeaſe according to circumſtances, may be a malignant one, we ſhall be led,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To remove filth of every kind from our doors, cellars and yards, and to avoid all the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, or external cauſes of diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:036254_0024_1008A9D18E5FC388"/>2. To avoid all its <hi>exciting</hi> cauſes, ſuch as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, great heat, cold, the night air, coſtiveneſs, intemperance, ice creams, and all ſudden or violent emotions of mind. The benefit of theſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be much aided by keeping up a conſtant and perceptible perſpiration by means of warm dreſſes. The good effects of an increaſe of this diſcharge from the body are ſo well known and eſtabliſhed during the prevalence of the plague in Egypt, that the common ſalutation among friends when they meet, travellers tell us is,—not, how do you do,—but "do you ſweat freely?"—Similar advantages have been derived from the frequent uſe of the warm Bath in ſickly ſeaſons in many countries. Dr. Winterbottom ſpeaks in high terms of it as one of the means of preventing an attack of the malignant fever of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To take a gentle purge, or emetic, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from buſineſs, to bathe the feet in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to take a ſweat upon feeling <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and even the <hi>lightest</hi> ſymptom of indiſpoſition. In the <hi>forming</hi> ſtate of a fever, it is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

and at the ſame time by attacking it before it has time to collect and pour its whole force upon the ſyſtem. The above remedies are generally effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual for this purpoſe. I am ſure I have ſeen the diſeaſe prevented by them in many hundred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It is thus by a ſingle bucket of water, we extinguiſh a fire which, if left to itſelf, would conſume a houſe. Theſe remedies are the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the malignant forms of fever ſometimes ſteal on with ſymptoms of ſo mild a nature, as not to be known by the moſt experienced phyſician.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To treat no form of diſeaſe as trifling, after a ſingle caſe of the yellow fever appears in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Many thouſand people in Philadelphia ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the loſs of relations in whom a yellow ſkin, a black vomiting and the horſe have followed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which was unfortunately believed in its firſt ſtage to be nothing but an intermittent, a colic, the gout, and even a common cold.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A belief in the unity of our autumnal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, will produce unity in ſentiment and practice among our phyſicians, an event which never can take place, while one ſect looks wholly at the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, and another looks for ſigns of a ſhip, or proofs of contagion for the indications that are to be purſued in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036254_0026_1008A9D910B07DD0"/>
treatment of the diſeaſe. The conduct of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſect of phyſicians cannot be too much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is as improper as it would be for a ſeaman to refuſe to let go the halyards of a ſhip in a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſquall of wind, until he had deliberately examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the point of the compaſs from which it came.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Such a belief will deliver thoſe phyſicians who call a malignant caſe of fever by its unpopular name, from the abuſe and perſecution which have followed ſuch acts of candor and benevolence, and prevent all thoſe arts of ſecrecy, or deception, which have been reſorted to by ſome of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to retain their peace, and reputation with their fellow citizens.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame cruel practice of concealing the exiſtence of the plague, or of calling it by leſs unpopular names has been impoſed upon phyſicians in many countries, and has always produced the moſt deſtructive conſequences.

tolerating a ſpirit of independence and humanity, among the phyſicians would be very great. No ſooner would the firſt caſe of yellow fever become public, than all the precautions that have been enumerated would become general. The diſeaſe would thereby be prevented, or eaſily cured. Fear would be deſtroyed, or leſſened, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the city become leſs neceſſary. There was a time when a thunder guſt produced uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal terror, and ſometimes flight into the open air. At preſent we continue buſineſs and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our houſes, without the leaſt fear from its exploſions over our heads. Nearly equal ſafety is in our power from the yellow fever, by an early choice of the proper means to prevent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:036254_0028_1008A9DF0F2DB630"/>As the mortality of our autumnal fever has been much increaſed by certain prejudices and errors which prevail more or leſs, among all claſſes of our citizens, reſpecting its treatment, I ſhall add a few remarks upon this ſubject.—They ſhall be premiſed by three propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The bilious fever in all its forms, is varied by <hi>climate.</hi> It is a widely different diſeaſe in our city, and in the Weſt Indies, and requires a very different mode of treatment in both countries. Of this Dr. Stevens has furniſhed by his practice a memorable proof. He recommended bark, wine and the cold bath for the cure of the yellow fever of 1793, becauſe he had ſeen thoſe remedies moſt effectual in the yellow fever of St. Croix; but he laid all thoſe remedies aſide, and relied chiefly upon a ſalivation for the cure of the fever of 1797 in Philadelphia.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The bilious fever is varied by <hi>ſeaſon.</hi> It has appeared with new ſymptoms every year ſince 1793, and has required a difference in the force and nature of its remedies. The ſame difference appeared in the epidemies in London in the time of Dr. Sydenham. This was ſo great, that the Doctor candidly acknowledges, he generally loſt three or four of the firſt patients he ſaw in a new
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036254_0029_1008A9E0A4675DD0"/>
diſeaſe, before he diſcovered the changes which had been induced upon it by the weather.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſymptoms of the bilious fever are varied by the <hi>age, ſex,</hi> and <hi>habit.</hi> It is ſeldom exactly alike in any two perſons. It generally appears with the moſt force, in a part of the body which has been previouſly ſubject to weakneſs, or diſeaſe. Perſons of robuſt habits ſuffer moſt from it. Hence it appears in its moſt malignant form in new comers in the Weſt Indies, while in the Creoles or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and in perſons whoſe bodies have been aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated to the climate by ten or twelve years reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Iſlands, it puts on the form of a mild remittent.</p>
            <p>It is common for phyſicians to deſcribe what they called <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or characteriſtic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the yellow fever. But from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that have been mentioned which vary this diſeaſe, it would be nearly as abſurd to expect the ſame form and dimenſion of a cloud under every variety of weather and ſeaſon, as to expect an epidemic with exactly the ſame ſymptoms in every country, in every year, and in every conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Theſe propoſitions being admitted, I go on to remark that a malignant bilious <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſomething
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036254_0030_1008A9E415C43078"/>
like a ſtorm in the ſyſtem. It produces derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the circulation of the blood and total or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial obſtructions of all the uſual excretions or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of the body; hence ariſe preternatural excitement or ſtrength in the action of the moving fibres of the body, particularly the blood veſſels, alſo fulneſs, preſſure upon particular parts, and pain. Sometimes this preternatural ſtrength is thrown upon the bowels, where it produces vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpaſms, pain, puking and coſtiveneſs. In proportion as ſtrength is accumulated in the blood veſſels, or bowels, it is abſtracted from the limbs, and hence the inability to walk or move in ſome of the forms of this fever.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the ſtimulus of the exhalation acts upon the blood veſſels of the limbs and ſurface of the body, with ſo much force, as to proſtrate them <hi>below</hi> their common and natural actions. This is the moſt dangerous form of malignant fever. It is known not only by a feeble and ſlow pulſe, but by a cool ſkin, and the abſence of pain.</p>
            <p>The remedies proper to remove this deranged ſtate of the ſolids, and accumulation of the fluids, in all the numerous cavities of the body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to equalize the actions of the former, and to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036254_0031_1008A9E5B2E0CBA8"/>
reſtore the latter to their natural determinations, are EVACUANTS.</p>
            <p>Theſe are bleeding, purges, vomits, ſudorifics, and a ſalivation. To theſe evacuating remedies may be added cold air, cold water and ice. They act by evacuating the heat of the body, when it is preternatural. They have all been conſidered as different remedies by ſome phyſicians, but they all act in <hi>one</hi> way, that is by depleting, or emptying the ſyſtem of a <hi>preternatural</hi> quantity of fluids, or abſtracting their uſual and natural quantity, when the ſolid parts of the body are ſo much irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, or inflamed, as not to be able to bear their cuſtomary ſtimulus. Mild caſes of the fever, yield to purges, and ſweats alone; more violent caſes require the addition of bleeding, and vomits, and caſes of great malignity require the combined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the evacuating medicines that have been mentioned.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe the ſame remedies are proper in the yellow fever in our climate that are uſed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the Weſt Indies, is as abſurd as it would be to uſe the cotton and linen dreſſes of that country, in our autumnal and winter months.</p>
            <p>To preſcribe the ſame remedies in every caſe of yellow fever, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> any regard to its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036254_0032_1008A9E8A5FB4C10"/>
is as abſurd as it would be to attempt to clothe all the citizens of Philadelphia with dreſſes of the ſame form and ſize. There is no ſuch thing as a ſpecific, which acts in a ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known manner without any ſenſible evacuation from the body, in curing this fever. Yeaſt, lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and milk, plantain juice, and centaury tea, have now and then eaſed troubleſome ſymptoms, but none of them ever cured a malignant caſe of yellow fever. If ever durable relief has followed their uſe, it has been, when they have co-operated with more powerful means in promoting diſcharges from the bowels, or pores.</p>
            <p>The force of the evacuating remedies above mentioned, muſt be accommodated to the force of the diſeaſe. I ſhall endeavour to illuſtrate this proportion between the force of the yellow fever, and the proper remedies to cure it, by a familiar ſimile. Let us ſuppoſe the natural ſtrength of a conſtitution to be ten. Let us then ſuppoſe the different degrees of force in the fever, to range from 10 to 100, while the force of the remedies extends from 11 to 110. The point to be gained, is to reduce the force of the diſeaſe by the proper remedies <hi>below</hi> 10, ſo that the conſtitution may be ſuperior to it, and thus overcome it. In mild <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when the force of the diſeaſe exceeds but a
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036254_0033_1008A9EA35C73A28"/>
few degrees the ſtrength of the conſtitution, a gentle purge or a ſweat will turn the ſcale in favor of health, but where the diſeaſe riſes in its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to 100, the powers of medicine, between that number and 110, will be neceſſary to ſubdue it. It is common to ſay of thoſe remedies, that they are worſe than the diſeaſe. This mode of ſpeaking is perfectly correct. They muſt be <hi>worſe,</hi> or in other words, <hi>more</hi> powerful than the diſeaſe, or they will not cure it.</p>
            <p>During the two laſt years, profuſe ſweating, has been the excluſive and popular remedy in the yellow fever with many people. It acts by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting, or leſſening the fulneſs of the blood veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. It is now and then ſucceſsful, but even when it is ſo, compared with the efficacy of blood letting, it is like waiting till a pond of ſtagnating water near a dwelling houſe is diſſipated in vapor by the heat of the ſun, inſtead of removing it in a few hours by a prompt and copious drain.</p>
            <p>But ſweating is often an impracticable remedy. In the fever of 1793 all attempts to excite ſweats were ineffectual. Where theſe attempt fail, they do harm, but where they ſucceed in the moſt copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner the diſeaſe is not always cured by
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036254_0034_10088FC747476358"/>
them, as hundreds can teſtify in the years 1798 and 1799.</p>
            <p>Some practitioners rely <hi>excluſively</hi> upon a ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cure the yellow fever. It is too ſlow and too feeble in its operation, for rapid and violent caſes. Mercury is moreover an uncertain remedy when uſed alone, not more than one in four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being ſalivated by it.</p>
            <p>Bleeding has the following advantages to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſuited to the <hi>ſeat</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The yellow fever is always accompanied with inflammation in ſome part of the body. Out of 130 perſons whom Dr. Phyſick examined after death from this diſeaſe, did not find one in whom there were not marks of <hi>inflammation</hi> in the ſtomach, and occaſionally in the bowels, kidneys and brain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>prompt</hi> remedy, and requires leſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of attendance and nurſing than ſweating, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or a ſalivation. It is moreover ſubject to the controul of a phyſician as to the <hi>time</hi> of uſing it, and as to the <hi>quantity</hi> of fluids to be obtained by it from the body.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:036254_0035_1008A9F11A0C59A8"/>3. It is a leſs weakening remedy than any other. It is likewiſe much ſafer than puking and ſweating, and far leſs diſagreeable than a ſalivation. Its ſafety is guaranteed by the <hi>pulſe.</hi> This index of the force of a fever will always, when underſtood and attended to, prevent any exceſs in the uſe of the lancet. No other remedy poſſeſſes ſuch a faithful criterion by which we can judge of the neceſſity of increaſing, or withholding evacuations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It <hi>aids</hi> the operation of all the other evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating remedies, and renders them leſs dangerous by firſt leſſening the violent commotions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It leſſens, or removes pain, and prevents thoſe alarming diſcharges of blood from the noſe, mouth, lungs, ſtomach, bowels, &amp;c. which ariſe from the burſting of the blood veſſels, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their being overpreſſed, or acting with preternatural force.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a more delicate remedy than any of thoſe which have been excluſively preferred to it. It offends no ſenſe, and renders ſick people leſs diſagreeable to themſelves, and their attendants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:036254_0036_1008A9F56EA1BE80"/>In mentioning theſe advantages of blood letting, let it not be ſuppoſed, that I wiſh an excluſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to be placed upon it—all the other evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating remedies ſhould be combined with it according to circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The degrees of it, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the force of the diſeaſe, and this, as has been remarked, will generally manifeſt itſelf by the ſtate of the pulſe.</p>
            <p>Before I diſmiſs the ſubject of blood letting in the yellow fever, it will be neceſſary to point out two or three of the principal errors that have prevailed in the uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It has been ſaid that great ſenſible weakneſs, is an objection to blood letting. This weakneſs in the beginning, and frequently in every fit of the yellow fever, ſo far from forbidding the loſs of blood, is the moſt vehement call of the ſyſtem for it. It ariſes from the blood veſſels being ſo much overcharged with blood, that they preſs upon the nerves of the muſcles which move the limbs, and thereby deprive them of their uſual ſtrength. By opening a vein, we remove this preſſure, and the weakneſs occaſioned by it; hence we obſerve patients who were unable to move before bleeding; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately afterwards to leave their beds, and in ſome inſtances, to reſume in a few hours, their ordinary buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:036254_0037_1008A9F964437A50"/>2. It has been ſaid, that bleeding ſhould always be proportioned to the conſtitution of the patient. This opinion is not juſt. A man may have a very ſtrong conſtitution, and a weak diſeaſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the loſs of but little blood to cure it, while on the contrary a woman may have a weak conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and a ſtrong diſeaſe which will yield only to the frequent uſe of the lancet. The pulſe in both theſe caſes will always afford a ſure mark to diſcriminate the diſeaſe, from the conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It has been ſaid, that bleeding ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites pain where it did not exiſt before, and even increaſes the force and frequency of the pulſe. Theſe ſymptoms, ſo far from being an objection to this remedy, are a proof that it has done ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by changing a ſuffocated and latent diſeaſe into a ſenſible one. They are a call of the ſyſtem for more blood letting.</p>
            <p>In favor of the uſe of ALL the remedies, that have been mentioned in the treatment of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, it may be ſaid that they have been adopted in all the eaſtern and ſouthern ſtates, and that they are uſed in Philadelphia by moſt of the phyſicians who formerly oppoſed them. They are moreover far more ſucceſsful in their combination, than any <hi>one</hi> of them has been, when excluſively uſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:036254_0038_1008A9FB50186838"/>The following fact is a ſtriking proof of the truth of this aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Four times as many perſons were affected by the yellow fever in 1793, as in 1798. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in both years was nearly equal. In 1793 bleeding, (in addition to other depleting remedies) was ſo general, that many thouſand people bled themſelves, without the advice of a phyſician. In 1798 this remedy, in conſequence of the weak and unreaſonable fears that were excited againſt it the year before, was but little uſed, and the cure of the diſeaſe was truſted chiefly to gentle purges, mercury, and ſweating medicines. It is true, it bore leſs copious bleeding in 1798 than in 1793, but there were few caſes of it which did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the loſs of a greater or leſs quantity of blood.</p>
            <p>Could the uſe of the depleting ſyſtem in all its parts, be begun according to circumſtances, on the <hi>first</hi> day of the fever, and could patients have, throughout all its ſtages, the uſual advantages of good nurſing, conſtant and regular medical attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, comfortable apartments, family ſociety, and exemption from terror, that are poſſeſſed in other acute diſeaſes, there is good reaſon to believe the mortality from it, would not be greater than from a common pleuriſy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:036254_0039_1008A9FE14D2F2A8"/>I have hitherto ſaid nothing of the uſe of bark, wine and opium in this fever. They have been ſuppoſed to be indicated by the debility which <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> precedes the fever, from the operation of its exciting cauſes, and by the weakneſs which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accompanies it. But many facts ſhew, that the weakneſs in both theſe caſes does not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the diſeaſe. It is its prediſpoſing cauſe, or an accidental ſymptom only, and is frequently increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tonic remedies. The weakneſs which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the uſe of evacuations, and the criſis of the fever, is moſt eaſily, and ſafely removed by pleaſant and nouriſhing aliment.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to diſcharge thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to ſociety which nearly forty years inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and obſervations in medicine, have impoſed upon me. Should this attempt be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
