            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS day, which has for many years been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with pious gratitude and joy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to ſocial feſtivity as giving birth to ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a perſon as General GEORGE WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, is now turned into the deepeſt grief and mourning on account of his final departure from this terreſtrial ſtate.

DAYS: SO THE DAYS OF WEEPING AND MOURNING FOR MOSES WERE ENDED.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Moſes was raiſed up, by GOD, to be the principal inſtrument, in the hands of Providence, of redeeming the people of Iſrael from Egyptian bondage, of leading them through the wilderneſs for the ſpace of forty years, and conducting them to the borders of the promiſed land. But it was the will of Heaven that Moſes ſhould not go over Jordan. He was, indeed indulged with a view of that pleaſant, good and fruitful land which the Jews were ſoon to enter and poſſeſs; and he ſaw the happy proſpects before them of enjoying relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and government, peace, liberty and plenty, unexampled proſperity and happineſs in the land of Canaan: But he muſt not live to enjoy them himſelf. For GOD had expreſsly ſaid unto him, "Get the up unto Mount Nebo, and die in the Mount whither thou goeſt up." "So Moſes the Servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD." Then, ſays the ſacred writer, as in the text, <hi>"And the children of Iſrael wept for Moſes, in the plains of Moab, thirty days: So the days of weeping and mourning for Moſes were ended."</hi>
            </p>

deeply affected with, and mourn and lament, the death of eminent perſons, ſuch as have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bleſſings, great benefactors to the human race, and been made inſtruments of redeeming a people from miſery and wretchedneſs, and of vindicating them into freedom and happineſs.</p>
            <p>This appears from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place; it is natural to the human race to be ſenſible of, to be much affected with, and to be grieved and pained at heart, upon the removal of any earthly comfort and bleſſing; and eſpecially of any near relative, or great friend and benefactor:—And what is thus natural cannot be ſinful; (unleſs our grief and lamentation be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exceſs, and we refuſe to be comforted,) but it is lawful, nay commendable and truly ornamental, and agreeable to the will of the wiſe Author of our frame and conſtitution. To be unaffected in ſuch caſes would argue a great inſenſibility of the worth and value of ſuch gifts and that we were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently grateful to GOD for beſtowing them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and further, it would fruſtrate ſome of the important moral purpoſes of the righteous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the world in their removal. Such feelings have been ſanctified and ſanctioned by JESUS CHRIST, our great pattern and exemplar, who, in the days of his fleſh, and when he dwelt among

men, wept upon the death of his intimate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared friend Lazarus.</p>
            <p>Such grief and lamentation has been obſerved from the beginning: And eſpecially has the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been great and general upon the removal of any eminent and good perſon, who had been a benefactor of mankind and a bleſſing to the world. This appears from divers ſcripture inſtances. When Jacob, who alſo was called Iſrael, died, all the children of Iſrael, and all the Egyptians mourned for him threeſcore and ten days: "And when the Canaanites ſaw the mourning, they ſaid this is a grievous mourning." So alſo, it is ſaid "When all the congregation ſaw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the houſe of Iſrael." So when that eminent king Joſiah died, it is thus written, "All Judah and Jeruſalem mourned for Joſiah. And Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah lamented for Joſiah: And all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and made them an ordinance in Iſrael." There are other inſtances recorded in the bible; but I muſt not ſtop to mention them. This of Moſes ſpoken of in the text and context, is very full and particular. The whole nation of the jews deeply lamented the death of this man, who had been ſuch a mighty inſtrument, under GOD, of
<pb n="9"
                   facs="unknown:039095_0007_10139AC1F6E99A18"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
their temporal redemption and ſalvation. And that ſuch mourning and lamentation were agreeable to the divine will, appears, further, from thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein every thing of this kind upon the death of perſons of an oppoſite character was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly prohibited by GOD himſelf: He declared that no ſuch tokens of reſpect and regard for them ſhould be manifeſted: As in the caſe of Aaron's two ſons, Nadab and Abihu, who, for offering ſtrange fire before the LORD, were immediately devoured by fire from the LORD: And GOD forbids Aaron and his other ſons mourning for them at all. It ſeems that thirty days was the length of time in general, in which they exhibited their ſigns and badges of mourning for their dead. But it does not appear that GOD gave any expreſs ſtatute to Iſrael, that they ſhould mourn juſt that term of time for perſons of eminence and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who had been great bleſſings to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the world. Nevertheleſs, it was no doubt from ſome divine intimation that they were led to obſerve ſo many days for public mourning. The inſtances referred to above, are recorded in ſacred hiſtory with evident marks of the divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as what was highly proper, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the relation and condition of mankind; they ſhow that this was a "reaſonable ſervice."</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>From the text and what has been ſaid, we may infer, that it becomes us, that it becomes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe United States, to mourn and lament the death of that great and good man, General GEORGE WASHINGTON, who was, indeed, to this people a Moſes, in many reſpects.</p>
            <p>But in a religious diſcourſe of this kind, we muſt previouſly remark, that it is highly proper that we look above means, inſtruments and ſecond cauſes; to the great firſt cauſe of all things, to the Supreme Arbiter and the Sovereign diſpoſer of all events which take place throughout the Univerſe; and to eye and acknowledge the hand of the Almighty in all this, from the very firſt to the very laſt.</p>
            <p>GOD works by means and inſtruments. When Iſrael muſt go down into Egypt to ſojourn there, Joſeph was conducted thither, by the unerring hand of heaven, to be an inſtrument of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſupport, preſervation and ſalvation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unnatural and unjuſtifiable the means by which Joſeph was at firſt brought into Egypt, "GOD meant it unto good, to ſave much people alive."</p>
            <p>When the people of Iſrael, after four hundred and thirty years, were to be redeemed from cruel Egyptian bondage, then Moſes was brought upon the ſtage, and being of mature age, GOD ſent him

to be the ruler and deliverer of his choſen people. He was furniſhed by the author of his exiſtence, with proper talents and gifts to be their leader, their captain, general, and commander in chief:—And beſides being "learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians;" he was divinely inſtructed to be their lawgiver and judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And was a man approved of GOD among them, by myracles and ſigns and wonders, which GOD did, by him, in the midſt of them. GOD led that people through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the ſpace of forty years, through the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of Moſes, until they came to the borders of the promiſed land.</p>
            <p>When the reformation from Popery was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, GOD prepared his inſtruments. He raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and brought upon the theatre proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to effect the ſame, as Luther, Calvin, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, John Huſs, Jerome, and a large catalogue of others.</p>
            <p>When theſe United States, but then Britiſh prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces, were groaning under the oppreſſive acts of the parliament of England, and when the meaſure of her cruelties was full and running over, and could no longer have been borne, without haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding all our rights liberties and property:—And when we muſt ſtand forth in their defence, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be bound by the acts of the Britiſh Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature

in all caſes whatſoever:—Then GOD, "who ſees the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things not yet done;" brought our WASHINGTON upon the ſtage, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture age, and well furniſhed with natural talents, and acquired accompliſhments to act a moſt conſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous part upon the theatre of the world. Being born on the 11th of February, 1732, old ſtyle, he was but a little more than 43 years of age, when the war between Great Britain and theſe American Colonies, commenced. He was then a member of Congreſs for his native ſtate, and every eye of that auguſt body was directed to him as the moſt ſuitable perſon, to be the head and leader of our armies. For this high and moſt intereſting ſtation, he was, on many accounts, the beſt qualified, of any man in North America, and probably in the world; being then in his full ſtrength and glory, and poſſeſſing thoſe great military talents, which had been matured by age, and the experience of ſeveral years of actual ſervice in American wars; being but about eighteen years of age when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his military career in Virginia, his native State. In the year 1755 he came into more general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, when he acted as Aid-decamp to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate General BRADDOCK, who was killed in the Weſtern Territory, in the beginning of the laſt

Various reaſons combined to lead the American Congreſs to make choice of him: He had already manifeſted great abilities as a commander, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers trying ſituations: He was a man poſſeſſed of very large and moſt extenſive property, which was at ſtake as well as the deareſt intereſts of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: He was a man of a cool and diſpaſſionate temper, and of a moderate diſpoſition, and yet firm in his country's cauſe;—acting upon principle, and from a clear and full conviction in his own mind, that we were injured and wronged by the parent State; and, finally, he was a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible integrity and honor, in whom the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confidence might be placed, if he entered upon a ſtation of ſuch high reſponſibility. That he was formed and furniſhed, by the wiſe author of our being, "who diſtributeth to every man ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he will," to ſerve his country in the military department, was apparent from his earlieſt youth; and his military genius he cultivated and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reading, obſervation and experience. And in the courſe of our revolutionary war, his martial ſpirit, genius and talents, were fully tried in divers

critical and important ſituations, and, through the favor of heaven, they were found ſuperior to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery difficulty and obſtacle which he had to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In a word, when the future, faithful, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial hiſtorian ſhall record and dwell upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing facts, that he at firſt, only headed a body of men entirely unacquainted with military diſcipline or operations, untaught in the principles of juſt ſubordination; but ſanguine in thoſe of liberty:— That, at beſt, they could only be ſtiled an alert and good militia, acting under very ſhort enliſtments, poorly ſupplied with cloathing, arms or military ſtores: And that with ſuch an army he withſtood the ravages and progreſs of near forty thouſand vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eran troops, plentifully provided with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary article, commanded by the braveſt officers in Europe, and ſupported by a very powerful navy, which effectually prevented all movements of ours by water:—When, I ſay, theſe things ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially related and weighed, WASHINGTON will be unanimouſly pronounced the greateſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the age in which he lived, or of any who had gone before him, and that his name will command the applauſe and admiration of the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>"Many nations have been favoured with ſome patriotic deliverer:—The Iſraelites had their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:—Rome had her Camillus:—Greece her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidas:

—Sweden her Guſtavus:—And England her Hamdens, her Ruſſells, and her Sydneys: But theſe illuſtrious heroes, though ſucceſsful in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and defending, did not, like WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, form and eſtabliſh empires, which we hope, will be the refuge of the oppreſſed, and the aſylum of liberty to the end of time."</p>
            <p>You muſt not expect that I give you a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the various events of the war: This is more proper for the hiſtory of his life, than for a ſermon. No doubt the life of General WASHINGTON, his great and noble acts, the might and wiſdom he ſhewed, and how he warred, and all that he did, will be written in a book of the Chronicles of the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and Generals, the Preſidents and Worthies of America, and which will be read with avidity and delight by all grateful Americans of every age.</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice for me to ſay, that he was always care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tender of the lives of the ſoldiery:—And they in return, confided in, loved and cheerfully obeyed him:—That he never hazzarded a battle but where there was the greateſt human probability of ſucceſs:—That he gained divers important victories without much fighting, and ſometimes without the ſhedding of blood. GOD evidently owned him as his inſtrument of ſaving theſe States from the hands of our enemies, of redeeming us from cruel
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039095_0014_10139AD406ABAC10"/>
oppreſſion and bondage, of procuring our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, of ſecuring our ineſtimable rights, lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties and priviledges, both civil and religious, and of enabling us to take our rank among the Nations of the Earth. Through his wiſe and ſuperior gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eralſhip, the war was conducted to a happy and glorious iſſue in about eight years:—A much ſhorter ſpace than we could rationally have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And then he nobly reſigned his command in 1783, and returned to enjoy the ſweets of retirment, and to purſue the agricultural arts wherein he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted.</p>
            <p>But here he was not ſuffered long to reſt: For when the confederation was found inefficient to our ſecurity, honor and happineſs, and a national convention was called for, General WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON was choſen a member:—And when conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was elected preſident of that wiſe, faithful and auguſt body, who formed our preſent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conſtitution of government, which is the boaſt of Americans, the envy of many nations, and the admiration of the world:—And under the benign influence of which, we have riſen to an aſtoniſhing height of national opulence and glory, proſperity and happineſs. When this form of government was put in operation, General WASHINGTON
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039095_0015_10139AD699236CC0"/>
received the unanimous ſuffrages of all the ſtates to be our firſt magiſtrate and ſupreme executive. Here he preſided eight years, (from April 30th, 1789, to March 4th 1797) with great wiſdom and dignity, and made the government and people of America reſpected through the world. In all his public conduct he ſeemed as one inſpired and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of heaven. He had an amazing influence over the public mind; and guided their meaſures without appearing ſo to do. He had great knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of human nature; could ſee far into the views of men; and in moſt caſes knew in whom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide. In the cloſe of the year 1796 he declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being a candidate for the preſidency, at the then enſuing election, chooſing to retire from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic life, and took his leave, in a moſt affectionate farewell addreſs to the people, which does honor to his head and heart;—which ought to be in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery houſe and imprinted on the memory of every acting citizen. <hi>This</hi> ſhews him to have been a great ſtateſman and politician. The ſentiments therein contained, may ſerve as a political ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer and ought to be as a pole ſtar to form and guide the political opinions and conduct of every lover of his country's independence, honor and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of every friend to man.</p>
            <p>But in his longed for retirement he was not ſuffered
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039095_0016_10139AD8223F5198"/>
to remain. When theſe United States were load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inſults and abuſes, and endured the baſeſt ſpoliations, from a haughty, faithleſs, inſidious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we were likely to be driven into war in ſelf-defence, General WASHINGTON was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by Preſident ADAMS, to the command of all our military forces, which he readily accepted, in his advanced age, if thereby he could ſerve his country. This was a moſt judicious appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: —For he was as an hoſt of himſelf:—Our enemies trembled at his very name:—And aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment took hold of them, when they found he would ſerve in that high and important ſtation.</p>
            <p>And here we muſt be careful to mention, that from the year 1775, to his death, he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined receiving any other compenſation for his public ſervices in the cauſe of his country, than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the defraying his neceſſary expences, which greatly heightened our national obligations to him. THIS is what few men could have done, and what we have no right to expect of any, ſince all have a juſt claim to an equivalent for whatever ſervices they render the people.</p>
            <p>But to return; in the high office, of Lieutenant General and Commander of our armies, was he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when a ſudden death, after a few hours illneſs, arreſted him, at his ſeat at Mount Vernon, on the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039095_0017_10139ADBBA878540"/>
14th of December 1799, in the 68th year of his age. His death in this day of our doubtful expectations, notwithſtanding he was grown grey in his country's ſervice, may be a far greater loſs to this land than we are now apprehenſive of: For whether we ſhall be driven into war or not, is yet uncertain.</p>
            <p>But let us not deſpond;—let us place a rational truſt in the everlaſting GOD, who has been our helper hitherto:—And who ſays, "Put not your truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help: His breath goeth forth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to his earth: In that very day his thoughts periſh. Happy are they who have the GOD of Jacob for their help; whoſe hope is in the LORD their GOD, who made heaven and earth, the ſea and all which therein is: Who keepeth truth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever." This GOD, who has begun to ſave us, will not leave nor forſake us, if we do not provoke him, by denying the GOD who made us, and lightly eſteeming the rock of our ſalvation. Had the LORD been minded, to deſtroy this land he would not have conducted us hitherto, nor have wrought for us ſuch great deliverances as in years which are paſt. With Him is the reſidue of the ſpirit; he is able to raiſe up others who ſhall do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and well in the cabinet and in the field. We need not diſtreſs ourſelves, for as Moſes ſaw Joſhua
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039095_0018_10139ADF865621A0"/>
appointed his ſucceſſor, and GOD ſaid to him "As I was with Moſes, ſo will I be with thee;" So WASHINGTON ſaw his ſucceſſor in the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and to him could cheerfully leave the care of this people, knowing his ſuperior abilities, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken integrity, and diſintereſted patriotiſm. We have an ADAMS at the head of our national gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, poſſeſſed of great talents, following the ſteps of his illuſtrious predeceſſor; a man of ſtrict virtue, of real piety and true goodneſs; and who has given many unequivocal proofs of his firm at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the beſt intereſts, proſperity and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his native country.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude my diſcourſe, I would obſerve that while I have not the remoteſt inclination, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or idea to detract from the merit, praiſe and glory of General WASHINGTON, yet I think there is occaſion to ſuggeſt two cautions;—One is, that we guard againſt every thing that favors idolatry. In the writings of ſome Panegyriſts upon this great and good man, we find expreſſions which, when the feelings and paſſions of men ſubſide, they cannot approve or juſtify: And conveying ideas which WASHINGTON himſelf, could he hear them and reply, would diſclaim. We ſhould remember that GOD formed him with all his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039095_0019_10139AE10D4199B8"/>
bright aſſemblage of talents lent him to us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his important life ſo long and made him all that to us which he was, even an ornament and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his country. While then, we highly extol the man, and celebrate his great and patriotic deeds, let us ultimately aſcribe the glory and praiſe to the Moſt High GOD.</p>
            <p>In the next place, we ſhould guard againſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing all, or too much, to one man. General WASHINGTON may be juſtly viewed as one of the firſt and greateſt inſtruments of the temporal ſalvation and happineſs of his country: But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others members of Congreſs and officers and ſoldiers in the army, contributed their ſhare, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their rank and ſtation, to the emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, independence and proſperity of theſe Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States. And <hi>this</hi> General WASHINGTON was always careful to allow and acknowledge. And throughout his whole life he manifeſted this act of piety, that he was always ſenſible of, and failed not to acknowledge that overruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD which made him an inſtrument of ſo much good to the world, and which always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to ſecond his wiſhes and ſmile upon his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions to ſerve and ſave his country. And when cloſing his eyes upon earth, and looking forward into the eternal world, (being in the full exerciſe of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039095_0020_10139AE3BA8333C8"/>
his reaſon) might he not humbly ſay and pray, "Remember me, O my GOD, for good, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that I have done for this people."</p>
            <p>And now, in the midſt of all the ſorrow and grief we ought to expreſs at the removal of this firſt of mere men from this world, let us never forget to manifeſt our gratitude to the all-wiſe Former of our bodies and Father of our ſpirits, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benevolence in raiſing up ſuch a perſon to adorn and diſcriminate the eighteenth century; and that he ſo richly endowed and ſo abundantly, furniſhed him to become ſo great and extenſive a bleſſing to this land. And, in particular, that when jeoparding his life in the high places of the field, when leading our armies, and fighting our battles, GOD covered his head, held him as in the hollow of his hand, kept him as the apple of his eye, and preſerved his life through a long and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing war, and made him ſo great an inſtrument of ſecuring to us our ineſtimable rights, liberties, and privileges, and of eſtabliſhing us as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent nation:—And alſo that he did preſerve and capacitate him to be a rich bleſſing to theſe ſtates in the civil department, as their firſt magiſtrate and ſupreme executive officer; and that under his wiſe and good adminiſtration, in conjunction with
<pb n="23"
                   facs="unknown:039095_0021_10139AE653926040"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
others in government, we could lead quiet and peaceable lives, and have been a growing, proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy people:—And, further, that GOD did protract his days almoſt to the allotted bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of human life, to ſhare in the enjoyment of the ſweets of liberty and peace, and all the rich bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he was ſo inſtrumental of procuring and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing for this land.</p>
            <p>And? Shall not the death of this eminent perſon, after having ſerved his generation by the will of GOD in various high and exalted ſtations, remind all in our national and ſtate governments, who are raiſed up among their brethren to places of power and truſt, whether in the legiſlative, judicial, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or military departments, that although they are called Gods, and all of them children of the Moſt High, yet they muſt die like men, and fall like the princes of the earth into the grave. May they remember their reſponſibility to GOD who is higher than the higheſt among men:—And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he ſtandeth in the congregation of the mighty, and judgeth among the earthly Gods. May theſe thoughts engage them to be inſtant in the faithful diſcharge of the duties of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtations, and improving their various talents, advantages and opportunities for bringing glory to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039095_0022_10139AE9E63F7160"/>
GOD, and contributing each his juſt proportion to increaſe the ſum of human felicity. May a double portion of that excellent ſpirit which dwelt in our WASHINGTON reſt upon each of them, and all their ſucceſſors in office, from age to age:— May they be actuated by a ſpirit of true and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted patriotiſm, and unitedly and uniformly exert their power and influence to raiſe their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſtill higher degrees of proſperity and glory:— Thus ſhall they become miniſters of GOD for good to the people; raiſe to themſelves a monument of fame on earth, and be exalted to a crown of glory in heaven.</p>
            <p>Finally, while we mourn the death of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, and particularly becauſe he loved our nation, and had done ſuch great things for this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let us all, of whatever age, rank or ſtation, remember to imitate the virtues and deeds which have immortalized his name, according to our reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective abilities and opportunities. Like him let us be animated with an ardent love to our country, and exhibit the moſt unremitted exertions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and perpetuate its intereſt and proſperity. Let us remember his ſage maxims in his farewell addreſs, and practice upon them. They are theſe, "Of all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable
<pb n="25"
                   facs="unknown:039095_0023_10139AEB6D0C0350"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be ſimply aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a ſenſe of religious obligations deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition that morality can be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious principle." Could all this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from the higheſt to the loweſt, emulate the virtues of a WASHINGTON, and obſerve theſe his wiſe ſayings, then GOD would delight to bleſs us, to build us up, and plant us, cauſe us to ſee the good of his choſen, to rejoice in the gladneſs of his nation, to glory with his inheritance:—The days of our mourning would ceaſe, and our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, happy proſperous ſtate ſhould not, but with time itſelf, have an end.</p>
