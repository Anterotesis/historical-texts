            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN recounting the numerous bleſſings which have ariſen to mankind from the diſcovery of America, the mind dwells with particular pleaſure and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude upon thoſe Characters, from whoſe hands theſe bleſſings have immediately flowed. That change in the political face of Europe, that liberality of ſentiment, that enlargement of commercial, milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and philoſophical knowledge, which contraſt the preſent with the fifteenth century, are but ſo many conſequences of this great event; an event whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="unknown:020220_0003_0FAE44D826CC4FE0"/>
liberal mind. The illuſtrious line of your royal Anceſtors have been conſpicuous in ſeizing thoſe advantages and diffuſing their happy effects. The great Father of the Houſe of Bourbon will be held in the higheſt veneration, till his favourite political ſyſtem ſhall be realized among the nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and extended to all mankind. But it was left to his more glorious Deſcendant, to accelerate the progreſs of ſociety, by diſregarding the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary intereſts and local policies of other Monarchs, reaching the hand of beneficence to another hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſphere, and raiſing an infant empire, in a few years, to a degree of importance, which ſeveral ages were ſcarcely thought ſufficient to produce.</p>
            <p>THIS is the ſublime of humanity, to feel for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages and diſtant nations; to act thoſe things, as a Monarch, which another can only contemplate as a Philoſopher, or image in the flights of poetry. America acknowledges her obligations to the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of her rights; mankind, who ſurvey your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and poſterity, for whom you act, will ſee that the tribute of gratitude is paid.</p>
            <p>IF to patronize the Arts can add to the praiſe of theſe more glorious actions, your Majeſty's fame in this reſpect will be ever ſacred; as there are none, who can feel the ſubject ſo ſtrongly as thoſe who
<pb facs="unknown:020220_0004_0FAE44D8EB556240"/>
are the particular objects of your royal condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>THE following work, which may be conſidered in part, as the offspring of thoſe reflections which your Majeſty's conduct has taught me to make, poſſeſſes one advantage ſcarcely to be expected in a Poem written in a foreign language. Your Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's permiſſion, that the unfortunate Columbus may once more enjoy the protection of a royal ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactor, has added a new obligation to thoſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore felt—in common with a grateful country. It is the policy of wiſe Princes to encourage the liberal arts among their ſubjects; and, as the human race are the objects of your extended adminiſtration, they may all in ſome meaſure claim the privilege of ſubjects, in ſeeking your literary as well as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical protection.</p>
            <p>WITH the deepeſt ſenſe of your Majeſty's royal munificence to my country, and gracious condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to myſelf, I have the honour to be,</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>EVERY circumſtance relating to the diſcovery and ſettlement of America, is an intereſting object of enquiry. Yet it is preſumed, from the preſent ſtate of literature in this country, that many perſons, who might be entertained with an American production of this kind, are but ſlightly acquainted with the life and character of that great man, whoſe extraordinary genius led him to the diſcovery of the continent, and whoſe ſingular ſufferings ought to excite the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
            <p>THE Spaniſh hiſtorians, who treat of the diſcovery and ſettlement of South-America, are very little known in the United States; and Doctor Robertſon's hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that country, which, as is uſual in the works of that judicious writer, contains all that is valuable on the ſubject, is not yet reprinted in America, and therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to be in the hands of American readers in general: and perhaps no other writer in the Engliſh language has given a ſufficient account of the life of Columbus to enable them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand many of the neceſſary alluſions in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Poem.</p>
            <p>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS was born in the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of Genoa about the year 1447; at a time when the navigation of Europe was ſcarcely extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of the Mediterranean. The mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's compaſs had been invented and in common uſe for more than a century; yet with the help of this
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:020220_0006_0FAE44DA6C008E90"/>
ſure guide, prompted by the moſt ardent ſpirit of diſcovery, and encouraged by the patronage of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the mariners of thoſe days rarely ventured from the ſight of land. They acquired great applauſe by ſailing along the coaſt of Africa and diſcovering ſome of the neighbouring iſlands; and after puſhing their reſearches with the greateſt induſtry and perſeverance for more than half a century, the Portugueſe, who were the moſt fortunate and enterpriſing, extended their diſcoveries ſouthward no farther than the equator.</p>
            <p>THE rich commodities of the Eaſt had for ſeveral ages been brought into Europe by the way of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean; and it had now become the object of the Portugueſe to find a paſſage to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, by ſailing round the ſouthern extremity of Africa and then taking an eaſtern courſe. This great object engaged the general attention of mankind, and drew into the Portugueſe ſervice adventurers from every maritime nation in Europe. Every year added to their experience in navigation and ſeemed to promiſe a reward to their induſtry. The proſpect however of arriving at the Indies was extremely diſtant; fifty years perſeverance in the ſame track, had brought them only to the equator, and it was probable that as many more would elapſe before they could accompliſh their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But Columbus, by an uncommon exertion of genius, formed a deſign no leſs aſtoniſhing to the age in which he lived, than beneficial to poſterity. This deſign was to ſail to India by taking a weſtern direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By the accounts of travellers who had viſited India, that country ſeemed almoſt without limits on the eaſt; and by attending to the ſpherical figure of the earth, Columbus drew this concluſion, that the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean muſt be bounded on the weſt either by India itſelf, or by ſome great continent not far diſtant from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:020220_0007_0FAE44DB28427520"/>THIS extraordinary man, who was now about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven years of age, appears to have united in his character every trait, and to have poſſeſſed every tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, requiſite to form and execute the greateſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes. He was early educated in all the uſeful ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that were taught in that day. He had made great proficiency in geography, aſtronomy and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they were neceſſary to his favourite purſuit of navigation. He had now been a number of years in the ſervice of the Portugueſe, and had acquired all the experience that their voyages and diſcoveries could afford. His courage and perſeverance had been put to the ſevereſt teſt, and the exerciſe of every amiable and heroic virtue rendered him univerſally known and reſpected. He had married a Portugueſe lady by whom he had two ſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diego and Fardinand; the younger of whom is the hiſtorian of his life.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the ſituation of Columbus, when he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thoroughly digeſted a plan, which, in its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration and conſequences, unfolded to the view of mankind one half of the globe, diffuſed wealth and dignity over the other, and extended commerce and civilization through the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To corroborate the theory which he had formed of the exiſtence of a weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern continent, his deſcerning mind, which always knew the application of every circumſtance that fell in his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had obſerved ſeveral facts which by others would have paſſed unnoticed. In his voyages to the African iſlands he had found, floating aſhore after a long weſtern ſtorm, pieces of wood carved in a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, canes of a ſize unknown in that quarter of the world, and human bodies with very ſingular features. Fully confirmed in the opinion that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion of the earth was ſtill undiſcovered, his genius was too vigorous and perſevering to ſuffer an idea of this importance to reſt merely in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:020220_0008_0FAE44DCA8770240"/>
as it had done in the minds of Plato and Seneca, who appear to have had conjectures of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He determined therefore to bring his favourite theory to the teſt of actual experiment. But an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that magnitude required the patronage of a Prince; and a deſign ſo extraordinary met with all the obſtructions, delays and diſappointments, which an age of ſuperſtition could invent, and which perſonal jealouſy and malice could magnify and encourage. Happily for mankind, in this inſtance, a genius, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deviſing the greateſt undertakings, aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in itſelf a degree of patience and enterprize, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and confidence, which rendered him ſuperior, not only to theſe misfortunes, but to all the future ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of his life. Prompted by the moſt ardent enthuſiaſm to be the diſcoverer of new continents, and fully ſenſible of the advantages that would reſult to mankind from ſuch diſcoveries, he had the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to waſte away eighteen years of his life, after his ſyſtem was well eſtabliſhed in his own mind, before he could obtain the means of executing his deſigns. The greateſt part of this period was ſpent in ſucceſſive and fruitleſs ſolicitations, at Genoa, Portugal and Spain. As a duty to his native country, he made his firſt propoſal to the Senate of Genoa; where it was ſoon rejected. Conſcious of the truth of his theory, and of his own abilities to execute his deſign, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired without dejection from a body of men who were incapable of forming any juſt ideas upon the ſubject; and applied with freſh confidence to John the ſecond, King of Portugal, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf as the great patron of navigation, and in whoſe ſervice Columbus had acquired a reputation which entitled him and his project to general confidence and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. But here he ſuffered an inſult much greater than a direct refuſal. After referring the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſcheme to the council who had the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:020220_0009_0FAE44DED562D2B0"/>
of naval affairs, and drawing from him his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ideas of the length of the voyage and the courſe he meant to take, that great monarch had the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conſpire with this council to rob Columbus of the glory and advantage he expected to derive from his undertaking. While Columbus was amuſed with this negotiation, in hopes of having his ſcheme adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and patronized, a veſſel was ſecretly diſpatched, by order of the king, to make the intended diſcovery. Want of ſkill and perſeverance in the pilot rendered the plot unſucceſsful; and Columbus, on diſcovering the treachery, retired with an ingenuous indignation from a court capable of ſuch duplicity.</p>
            <p>HAVING now performed what was due to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that gave him birth and to the one that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted him as a ſubject, he was at liberty to court the patronage of any prince who ſhould have the wiſdom and juſtice to accept his propoſals. He had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his ideas to his brother Bartholomew, whom he ſent to England to negotiate with Henry ſeventh; at the ſame time that he went himſelf into Spain to apply in perſon to Fardinand and Iſabella, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the united kingdoms of Aragon and Caſtile. The circumſtances of his brother's application in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which appears to have been unſucceſsful, is not to my purpoſe to relate; and the limits preſcribed to this introduction will prevent the detail of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars relating to his own negociation in Spain. In this negociation Columbus ſpent eight years, in the various agitations of ſuſpence, expectation and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; till, at length his ſcheme was adopted by Iſabella, who undertook, as Queen of Caſtile, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the expences of the exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was conſtituted high Admiral and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of all the Seas, Iſlands and Continents which he ſhould diſcover; with power to receive one tenth of the profits ariſing from their productions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.

            <p>THESE articles being adjuſted, the preparations for the voyage were brought forward with rapidity; but they were by no means adequate to the importance of the expedition. Three ſmall veſſels, ſcarcely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ſize to be employed in the coaſting buſineſs, were appointed to traverſe the vaſt Atlantic; and to encounter the ſtorms and currents that might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in ſo lengthy a voyage, through diſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſeas. Theſe veſſels, as might be expected in the infancy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the tedious length of time which Columbus had ſpent in ſolicitation and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and the proſpect of being able ſoon, to obtain the object of his wiſhes, induced him to overlook what he could not eaſily remedy, and led him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard thoſe circumſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ances which would have intimid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated any other mind. He accordingly equiped his ſmall ſquadron with as much expedition as poſſible, manned with ninety men and victualled for one year. With theſe, on the 3d of Auguſt 1492, amidſt a vaſt croud of anxious ſpectators, he ſet ſail on an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, which, if we conſider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:020220_0011_0FAE44DFA9BBC2F8"/>
uncertainty of his voyage, and the conſequences that flowed from it, was the moſt daring and important that ever was undertaken. He touched at ſome of the Portugueſe ſettlements in the Canary Iſles; where, although he had had but a few days run, he found his veſſels needed refitting. He ſoon made the neceſſary repairs, and took his departure from the weſtermoſt Iſlands that had hitherto been diſcovered. Here he left the former track of navigation and ſteered his courſe due weſt.</p>
            <p>NOT many days after he had been at ſea, he began to experience a new ſcene of difficulty. The ſailors now began to contemplate the dangers and uncertain iſſue of a voyage, the nature and length of which was left entirely open to conjecture. Beſides the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and timidity natural to men unaccuſtomed to the diſcipline of a ſeafaring life, ſeveral circumſtances contributed to inſpire an obſtinate and mutinous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which required the moſt conſummate art as well as fortitude in the admiral to controul. Having been three weeks at ſea, and experienced the uniform courſe of the trade winds, which always blow in a weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern direction, they contended that, ſhould they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame courſe for a longer period, the ſame winds would never permit them to return to Spain. The magnetic needle began to vary its direction. This being the firſt time that phenomenon was ever diſcovered, it was viewed by the ſailors with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſidered as an indication that nature it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had changed her courſe, and that Providence was determined to puniſh their audacity, in venturing ſo far beyond the ordinary bounds of man. They declared that the commands of their ſovereign had been fully obeyed, in their proceeding ſo many days in the ſame direction, and ſo far ſurpaſſing the attempts of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

navigators, in queſt of new diſcoveries. Every talent, requiſite for governing, ſoothing and temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſſions of men, is conſpicuous in the conduct of Columbus on this occaſion. The dignity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability of his manners, his ſurpriſing knowledge and experience in naval affairs, his unwearied and minute attention to the duties of his command gave him a complete aſcendant over the minds of his men, and inſpired that degree of confidence which would have maintained his authority in almoſt any poſſible cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. But here, from the nature of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, every man had leiſure to feed his imagination with all the gloomineſs and uncertainty of the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. They found, every day, that the ſame ſteady gales carried them with great rapidity from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, and indeed from all countries of which they had any knowledge. Notwithſtanding all the variety of management with which Columbus addreſſed himſelf to their paſſions, ſometimes by ſoothing them with the prognoſtics of diſcovering land, ſometimes by flattering their ambition and feaſting their avarice with the glory and wealth they would acquire from diſcovering thoſe rich countries beyond the Atlantic, and ſometimes by threatening them with the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their ſovereign, ſhould their timidity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience defeat ſo great an object, their uneaſineſs ſtill increaſed. From ſecret whiſperings, it aroſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mutiny and dangerous conſpiracy. At length they determined to rid themſelves of the remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Columbus, by throwing him into the ſea. The infection ſpread from ſhip to ſhip, and involved Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as well as common ſailors. They finally loſt all ſenſe of ſubordination, and addreſſed their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an inſolent manner, demanding to be conducted immediately back to Spain; or, they aſſured him, they would ſeek their own ſafety by taking away his life.
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:020220_0013_0FAE44E5A7756508"/>
Columbus, whoſe ſagacity and penetration had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered every ſymptom of the diſorder, was prepared for this laſt ſtage of it, and was ſufficiently apprized of the danger that awaited him. He found it vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with paſſions he could no longer controul. He therefore propoſed that they ſhould obey his orders for three days longer; and, ſhould they not diſcover land in that time, he would then direct his courſe for Spain. They complied with his propoſal; and, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for mankind, in three days they diſcovered Land. This was a ſmall Iſland, to which Columbus gave the name of San Salvador. Their firſt interview with the natives was a ſcene of amuſement and compaſſion on the one part, and of aſtoniſhment and adoration on the other. The natives were entirely naked, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and timorous, and they viewed the Spaniards as a ſuperior order of beings, deſcended from the Sun, which, in that Iſland and in moſt parts of America, was worſhiped as a Deity. By this it was eaſy for Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus to perceive the line of conduct proper to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved toward that ſimple and inoffenſiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> people. Had his companions and ſucceſſors, of the Spaniſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſeſſed the wiſdom and humanity of that great diſcoverer, the benevolent mind would feel no ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of regret, in contemplating the extenſive advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ariſing to mankind from the diſcovery of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</p>
            <p>IN this voyage, Columbus diſcovered the Iſlands of Cuba and Hiſpaniola; on the latter of which, he erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſmall fort, and having left a garriſon of thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight men, under the command of an Officer by the name of Arada, he ſet ſail for Spain. Returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Atlantic, he was overtaken by a violent ſtorm, which laſted ſeveral days and increaſed to ſuch a degree, as baffled all his naval ſkill and threatened
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:020220_0014_0FAE44E7892F8448"/>
immediate deſtruction. In this ſituation, when all were in a ſtate of deſpair, and it was expected that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſea would ſwallow up the crazy veſſel, he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſerenity and preſence of mind, perhaps never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled in caſes of like extremity. He wrote a ſhort account of his voyage and of the diſcoveries he had made, wrapped it in an oiled cloth, encloſed it in a cake of wax, put it into an empty caſk and threw it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verboard; in hopes that ſome accident might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a depoſit of ſo much importance to the world.</p>
            <p>THE ſtorm however abated, and he at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in Spain; after having been driven by ſtreſs of weather into the Port of Liſbon, where he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in an interview with the King of Portugal, to prove the truth of his ſyſtem by arguments more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing than thoſe he had before advanced, in the character of an humble and unſucceſsful ſuitor. He was received every where in Spain with Royal hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, his family was ennobled, and his former ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting his offices and emoluments was ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt ſolemn manner, by Fardinand and Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella; while all Europe reſounded his praiſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocated their joy and congratulations on the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of a new world.</p>
            <p>THE immediate conſequence of this was a ſecond voyage; in which Columbus took charge of a ſquad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of ſeventeen Ships of conſiderable burthen. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers of all ranks and conditions ſolicited to be employed in this expedition. He carried over fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred perſons, together with all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for eſtabliſhing a Colony and extending his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. In this voyage he explored moſt of the Weſt-India Iſlands; but, on his arrival at Hiſpaniola, he found the garriſon he had left there had been total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:020220_0015_0FAE44E8235EDAF8"/>
deſtroyed by the natives, and the fort demoliſhed. He however proceeded in the planting of his colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and, by his prudent and humane conduct towards the natives, he effectually eſtabliſhed the Spaniſh au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in that Iſland. But while he was thus laying the foundation of their future grandeur in South A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, ſome diſcontented perſons, who had returned from the colony to Spain, together with his former enemies in that Kingdom, conſpired to accompliſh his ruin.</p>
            <p>THEY repreſented his conduct in ſuch a light at court, as to create uneaſineſs and diſtruſt in the jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind of Fardinand, and made it neceſſary for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus again to return to Spain, in order to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act their machinations, and to obtain ſuch farther ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies as were neceſſary to his great political and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent purpoſes. On his arriving at court, and ſtating with his uſual dignity and confidence the whole hiſtory of his tranſactions abroad, every thing wore a favourable appearance. He was received with uſual honours, and again ſolicited to take charge of another ſquadron, to carry out farther ſupplies, to purſue his diſcoveries, and in every reſpect to uſe his diſcretion in extending the Spaniſh Empire in the new World. In this third voyage he diſcovered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America at the mouth of the river Oronoque. He rectified many diſorders in his government of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola which had happened in his abſence; and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing was going on in a proſperous train, when an event was announced to him, which completed his own ruin, and gave a fatal turn to the Spaniſh policy and conduct in America. This was the arrival of Francis de Bovadilla, with a commiſſion to ſupercede Columbus in his government; and with power to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign him as a criminal, and to judge of his former adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:020220_0016_0FAE44E8B3138BD8"/>IT ſeems that by this time the enemies of Columbus, deſpairing to complete his overthrow by groundleſs inſinuations of mal-conduct, had taken the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual method of exciting the jealouſy of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. From the promiſing ſamples of Gold and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er valuable commodities brought from America, they took occaſion to repreſent to the King and Queen, that the prodigious wealth and extent of the countries he had diſcovered would ſoon throw ſuch power into the hands of the Viceroy, that he would trample on the Royal Authority and bid defiance to the Spaniſh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Theſe arguments were well calculated for the cold and ſuſpicious temper of Fardinand, and they muſt have had ſome effect upon the mind of Iſabella. The conſequence was the appointment of Bavadilla, who had been the inveterate enemy of Columbus, to take the government from his hands. This firſt tyrant of the Spaniſh nation in America began his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration by ordering Columbus to be put in chains on board a ſhip, and ſending him priſoner to Spain. By relaxing all diſcipline he introduced diſorder and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs throughout the colony. He ſubjected the unhappy natives to a moſt miſerable ſervitude, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned them out in large numbers among his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Under this ſevere treatment periſhed in a ſhort time many thouſands of thoſe innocent people.</p>
            <p>COLUMBUS was carried in his fetters to the Spaniſh court, where the King and Queen either feigned or felt a ſufficient regret at the conduct of Bovadilla to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this illuſtrious priſoner. He was not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from confinement, but treated with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reſpect. But, although the king endeavoured to expiate the offence by cenſuring and recalling Bova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla, yet we may judge of his ſincerity from his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Nicholas de Ovando, another bitter enemy of Columbus, to ſucceed in the government, and from
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:020220_0017_0FAE44E97052C9E0"/>
his ever after refuſing to reinſtate Columbus, or to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil any of the conditions on which the diſcoveries were undertaken. After two years ſolicitation for this or ſome other employment, he at length obtained a ſquadron of four ſmall veſſels to attempt new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He now ſet out, with the ardour and enthuſiaſm of a young adventurer, in queſt of what was always his favourite object, a paſſage into the South Sea, by which he might ſail to India. He touched at Hiſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iola, where Ovando, the governor, refuſed him admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on ſhore even to take ſhelter during a hurricane, the prognoſtics of which his experience had taught him to diſcern. By putting into a ſmall creek, he rode out the ſtorm, and then bore away for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Several months, in the moſt boiſterous ſeaſon of the year, he ſpent in exploring the coaſt round the gulph of Mexico, in hopes of finding the intended navigation to India. At length he was ſhipwrecked, and driven aſhore on the Iſland of Jamaica.</p>
            <p>HIS cup of calamities ſeemed now completely full. He was caſt upon an iſland of ſavages, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, without any veſſel, and thirty leagues from any Spaniſh ſettlement. But the greateſt providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial misfortunes are capable of being imbittered by the inſults of our fellow creatures. A few of his hardy companions generouſly offered, in two Indian canoes, to attempt a voyage to Hiſpaniola, in hopes of obtaining a veſſel for the relief of the unhappy crew. After ſuffering every extremity of danger and hardſhip, they arrived at the Spaniſh colony in ten days. Ovando, through perſonal malice and jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy of Columbus, after having detained theſe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers eight months, diſpatched a veſſel to Jamaica, in order to ſpy out the condition of Columbus and his crew; with poſitive inſtructions to the Captain not to afford them any relief. This order was punctually executed. The Captain approached the
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:020220_0018_0FAE44EA4A983C08"/>
ſhore, delivered a letter of empty compliment from Ovando to the Admiral, received his anſwer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. About four months afterwards a veſſel came to their relief; and Columbus, worn out with fatigues and broken with misfortunes, returned for the laſt time to Spain. Here a new diſtreſs awaited him, which he conſidered as one of the greateſt he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, in his whole life. This was the death of Queen Iſabella, his laſt and greateſt friend.</p>
            <p>HE did not ſuddenly abandon himſelf to deſpair. He called upon the gratitude and juſtice of the King; and, in terms of dignity, demanded the fulfilment of his former contract. Notwithſtanding his age and infirmities, he even ſolicited to be farther employed in extending the career of diſcovery, without a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of any other reward but the conſciouſneſs of doing good to mankind. But Fardinand, col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ungrateful and timid, dared not to comply with a ſingle propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of this kind, leſt he ſhould encreaſe his own obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to a man, whoſe ſervices he thought it danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to reward. He therefore delayed and avoided any deciſion on theſe ſubjects, in hopes that the declining health of Columbus would ſoon rid the court of the remonſtrances of a man, whoſe extraordinary merit was, in their opinion, a ſufficient occaſion of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. In this they were not diſappointed. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus languiſhed a ſhort time, and gladly reſigned a life, which had been worn out in the moſt eſſential ſervices perhaps that were ever rendered, by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character, to an ungrateful world.</p>
            <p>SOMETIME in this gloomy interval, before his death, the Viſion is ſuppoſed to have been preſented to him; in order to ſatisfy his benevolent mind, by unfolding to him the importance of his diſcoveries, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive influence upon the intereſt and happineſs of mankind, in the progreſs of ſociety.</p>

               <pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:020220_0019_0FAE44EAFA0E7128"/>THE Author has indulged a ſmall anachroniſm in the opening of the Poem, for the ſake of grouping the misfortunes of the hero; as the time of his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al impriſonment was previous to his laſt voyage and to the death of Iſabella.</p>
            <p>THE Author, at firſt, formed an idea of attempting a regular Epic Poem, on the diſcovery of America. But on examining the nature of that event, he found that the moſt brilliant ſubjects incident to ſuch a plan would ariſe from the conſequences of the diſcovery, and muſt be repreſented in viſion. Indeed to have made it a patriotic Poem, by extending the ſubject to the ſettlement and revolutions of North America and their probable effect upon the future progreſs of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety at large, would have protracted the viſion to ſuch a degree as to render it diſproportionate to the reſt of the work. To avoid an abſurdity of this kind, which he ſuppoſed the critics would not pardon, he rejected the idea of a regular Epic form, and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined his plan to the train of events which might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the hero in viſion. This form he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders as the beſt that the nature of the ſubject would admit; and the regularity of the parts will appear by obſerving, that there is a ſingle poetical deſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept in view, which is to gratify and ſooth the deſponding mind of the hero: It being the greateſt poſſible reward of his ſervices, and the only one that his ſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Natives of America appear in viſion. Their manners and characters. Columbus enquires the cauſe of the diſſimilarity of nations. The Angel replies—That the human body is compoſed of a due proportion of the elements ſuited to the place of its firſt creation—that theſe elements; differently proportioned, produce all the changes of health, ſickneſs, growth and decay; and will likewiſe produce any other changes which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the diverſity of men—that theſe elemental propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are varied, not more by climate, than tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many other local accidents—that the mind is likewiſe in a ſtate of change, and will take its phyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical character from the body and from external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: examples. Enquiry and anſwer concerning the firſt peopling of America. View of Mexico. Its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by Cortez. View of Cuſco and Quito, cities of Peru. Tradition of Capac and Oella, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Peruvian empire. Columbus enquires their real hiſtory. The Angel gives an account of their origin, and relates the ſtratagems they uſed in eſtabliſhing that empire.</p>

                  <p>From the traditions of Capac and Oella, mentioned by the Spaniſh hiſtorians, they appear to have been very great and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed characters. About three centuries previous to the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of that country by the Spaniards, the natives of Peru were as rude ſavages as any in America. They had no fixed habitations, no ideas of permanent property; they wandered naked like the beaſts, and, like them, depended on the events of each day for a precarious ſubſiſtence. At this period, Manco Capac and his wife Mama Oella appeared on a ſmall iſland in the lake Titiaca; near which the city of Cuſco was afterwards erected. Theſe perſons, in order to eſtabliſh a belief of their divinity, in the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were clothed in white garments of cotton; and declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſcended from the Sun, who was their father and the God of that country. They affirmed that he was offended at their cruel and perpetual wars, their barbarous modes of worſhip, and their neglecting to make the beſt uſe of the bleſſings he was conſtantly beſtowing, in fertilizing the earth and producing vegetation; that he pitied their wretched ſtate, and had ſent his own children to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, and to eſtabliſh a number of wiſe regulations, by which they might be rendered happy.</p>
                  <p>By ſome extraordinary method of perſuaſion, theſe perſons drew together a number of the ſavage tribes, laid the foundations of the city of Cuſco, and eſtabliſhed what was called the kingdom of the Sun, or the Peruvian empire. In the reign of Manco Capac, the dominion was extended about eight leagues from the city; and at the end of three centuries, it was eſtabliſhed fifteen hundred miles on the coaſt of the Pacific ocean; and from that ocean to the mountains of the Andes. During this period, through a ſucceſſion of twelve monarchs, the original conſtitution, eſtabliſhed by the firſt Inca, remained unaltered; and was at laſt overturned by an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which no human wiſdom could foreſee or prevent.</p>
                  <p>For a more particular diſquiſition on the character and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this great Legiſlator, the Reader is referred to a diſſertation prefixed to the third Book.</p>
                  <p>Mama Oella is ſaid to have invented many of the domeſtic arts, particularly that of making garments of cotton and other vegetable ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>In the paſſage preceding this reference, I have alluded to moſt of the traditions, relating to the manner of their introducing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and eſtabliſhing their dominion. In the remainder of the ſecond, and through the whole of the third Book, I have given what may be ſuppoſed a probable narrative of their real origin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I have thrown the epiſode into an epic form, and given it ſo conſiderable a place in the Poem, for the purpoſe of exhibiting <hi>in action</hi> the characters, manners and ſentiments of the different tribes of ſavages, that inhabit the mountains of South-America.</p>
                  <p>In reviewing this part of my ſubject, I have to lament, that ſo extraordinary and meritorious a Poem, as the Araucana of don Alonſo de Ercilla, of the ſixteenth century, has never yet appeared in our language. The account given of that work by Voltaire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited my curioſity at an early day; as I conceived the manners and characters of the mountain ſavages of Chile, as deſcribed by that heroic Spaniard, muſt have opened a new field of Poetry, rich with uncommon ornaments.</p>
                  <p>That elegant and conciſe ſketch of it lately given to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic by Mr. Hayley, has come into my hands, ſince I have been writing theſe notes, and but a few days previous to the Poem's being put to the preſs. Yet it gives me reaſon to hope, with every friend of literature, that the whole of that great work will ere long be preſented to the Engliſh Reader by the ſame hand.</p>
                  <p>It is uſually preſumed, that every Author muſt have read all that have gone before him, at leaſt on ſubjects ſimilar to what he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; yet the Luſiad of Camoens, a Poem of great merit on the expedition of Gama, I had ſought for in vain in different parts of America, and even ſent to Europe without being able to obtain it; till, a few days ſince, it came to hand in the majeſtic and ſpirited tranſlation of Mr. Mickle. The extenſive and ſublime objects opened to our view in a work which celebrates the diſcovery of one part of the globe, may well be thought worthy the contemplation of a writer, who endeavours to trace the conſequences of a ſimilar event in another. Of this I was before ſenſible; but theſe are not the only diſadvantages that an Author, in a new country, and in moderate circumſtances, muſt have to encounter.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION ON THE GENIUS AND INSTITUTIONS OF MANCO CAPAC.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the original inhabitants of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica in general deſerve to be claſſed among the moſt unimproved ſavages that have ever been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; yet the Mexican and Peruvian governments exhibit remarkable inſtances of order and regularity. In the difference of national character between theſe two empires, we may diſcern the influence of political ſyſtems on the human mind; and infer the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the taſk which a legiſlator undertakes, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to reduce a barbarous people under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of government and laws. The Mexican con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was formed to render its ſubjects brave and powerful; but, while it ſucceeded in this object, it tended to remove them farther from the real bleſſings of ſociety, than they were, while in the rudeſt ſtate of nature. The hiſtory of the world affords no inſtance of men whoſe manners were equally ferocious, and whoſe ſuperſtition was more bloody and unrelenting. On the contrary, the eſtabliſhments of Manco Capac carry the marks of a moſt benevolent and pacific ſyſtem; they tended to humanize the world and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his people happy; while his ideas of the Deity were ſo perfect, as to bear a compariſon with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened doctrines of Socrates or Plato.</p>
            <p>THE moſt diſtinguiſhed characters in hiſtory, who have been conſidered as legiſlators among bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:020220_0074_0FAE453489E35B58"/>
nations, are Moſes, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa, Mahomet and Peter of Ruſſia. Of theſe, only the two former and the two latter appear really to deſerve that character. Solon and Numa poſſeſſed not the means nor the opportunity of ſhewing their talents in the buſineſs of original legiſlation. Athens and Rome were conſiderably advanced in civilization, before theſe characters aroſe. The moſt they could do was to correct and amend conſtitutions already formed. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, in particular, may be conſidered as a wiſe politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; but by no means as the founder of a nation. The Athenians were too far advanced in ſociety to admit any radical alteration in their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if indeed any form can be ſaid to exiſt, where every thing is left to the controul of a capricious multitude. The inſtitutions of Numa were more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and durable; his religious ceremonies were, for many ages, the moſt powerful check upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious and turbulent Romans. By inculcating a remarkable reverence for the Gods, and making it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſult the Auſpices, when any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant was to be tranſacted, he rendered the popular ſuperſtition ſubſervient to the views of policy, and gave the ſenate a ſteady check upon the extravagance of the plebeans. But the conſtitutions of Rome and Athens, however the ſubject of ſo much injudicious applauſe, were never fixed upon any permanent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; though the wiſdom of ſome of their rulers, and the ſpirit of liberty that inſpired the people, juſtly demand our admiration.</p>
            <p>EACH of the other legiſlators above mentioned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a particular conſideration; as acting in ſtations ſomewhat ſimilar to that of the Peruvian lawgiver. Three objects are to be attended to, by the legiſlator of a barbarous people. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that his ſyſtem be ſuch as is capable of reducing the greateſt number of men under one juriſdiction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it apply to ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:020220_0075_0FAE453521D164F8"/>
principles in human nature for its ſupport, as are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and permanent; in order to enſure the duration of the government. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that it admit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements correſpondent to any advancement in knowledge or variation of circumſtances, that may happen to its ſubjects; without endangering the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of government, by ſuch innovations. So far therefore as the ſyſtems of thoſe legiſlators agree with theſe fundamental principles, they are worthy of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and ſo far as they deviate, they may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as defective and imperfect.</p>
            <p>TO begin with Moſes and Lycurgus; it is neceſſary in the firſt place to obſerve, that, in order to judge of the merit of any inſtitutions, we muſt take into view the peculiar character of the people for whom they were framed. For want of this attention, many of the laws of Moſes have been ridiculed by ignorant ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and many eſtabliſhments of Lycurgus cenſured by as ignorant politicians. The Jews, who were led by Moſes out of Egypt, were not only uncivilized, but, having juſt riſen to independence from a ſtate of ſervitude, they united the manners of ſervants and ſavages; and their national character is a compoſition of ſervility and contumacy, ignorance, ſuperſtition, filthineſs and cruelty. Of their cruelty as a people we need no other proof than the account of their avengers of blood, and the readineſs with which the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation turned executioners and ſtoned to death the devoted offenders. The Leproſy, a diſeaſe now whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown, was undoubtedly produced by their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal want of cleanlineſs, continued for ſucceſſive genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In this view the frequent ablutions, the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar modes of trial, and many other inſtitutions may be wholly vindicated from ridicule, and proved to be not only wiſe, but even neceſſary regulations.</p>
            <p>THE Spartan lawgiver has been equally cenſured
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:020220_0076_0FAE4538567AF588"/>
for the toleration of theft and adultery. Among that race of Barbarians, theſe crimes were too general to admit of total prevention or univerſal puniſhment. By veſting all property in the community, inſtead of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging theft, he removed the poſſibility of the crime; and, in a nation where licentiouſneſs was generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, it was a great ſtep towards introducing a purity of manners, to puniſh adultery in all caſes, wherein the crime was not committed by the free conſent of all parties injured or intereſted.</p>
            <p>THOSE conſtitutions of government are beſt calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for immediate energy and duration, which are interwoven with ſome religious ſyſtem. The legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who appears in the character of an inſpired perſon, renders his political inſtitutions ſacred, and intereſts the conſcience as well as the judgement in their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The Jewiſh lawgiver had this advantage over the Spartan. He appeared not in the character of a mere earthly governor, but as an interpreter of the divine will. By injoining a religious obſervance of certain rites, he formed his people to habitual obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; by directing their cruelty againſt the breakers of the laws, he at leaſt mitigated the rancour of private hatred; by forbidding uſury, and directing that real property ſhould return to the original families in the year of Jubilee, he prevented too great an inequality of property; and by ſelecting a particular tribe, to be the guardians and interpreters of religion, he prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its myſteries from being the ſubject of profane and vulgar inveſtigation. To ſecure the permanency of his inſtitutions, he prohibited any intercourſe with foreigners, by ſevere reſtrictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and formed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to habits and a character diſagreeable to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; by which means any foreign intercourſe was prevented, from the mutual hatred of both parties.</p>
            <p>TO theſe inſtitutions the laws of Lycurgus bear a
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:020220_0077_0FAE45394895E810"/>
moſt ſtriking reſemblance. The features of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution were ſevere and forbidding; it was however calculated to inſpire the moſt enthuſiaſtic love of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and martial honour. In no country was the patriotic paſſion more energetic than in Sparta; no laws ever excluded the idea of ſeparate property in an equal degree, or inſpired a more thorough contempt for the manners of other nations. The utter prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of money, commerce and almoſt every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to effeminate nations, entirely excluded fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners from Sparta; and, while it inſpired the people with contempt for others, it rendered them agreeable to each other. By theſe means, Lycurgus rendered the nation powerful and warlike; and to inſure the duration of his government he endeavoured to intereſt the conſciences of his people, by the aid of oracles, and the oath he is ſaid to have exacted from them, to obey his laws till his return; when he went into a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and perpetual exile.</p>
            <p>FROM this view of the Jewiſh and Spartan inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, applied to the principles above ſtated, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in the two firſt articles, conſiderably imperfect, and in the laſt, totally defective. Neither of them was calculated to bring any conſiderable territory or number of men under one juriſdiction; from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance alone, they could not be rendered perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as they muſt be conſtantly expoſed to their more powerful neighbours. But the third object of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that of providing for the future progreſs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which, as it regards the happineſs of mankind, is the moſt important of the three, was in both inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces entirely neglected. Theſe ſyſtems appear to have been formed with an expreſs deſign to prevent all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture improvement in knowledge, or enlargement of the human mind; and to fix thoſe nations forever in a ſtate of ignorance, ſuperſtition and barbariſm. To
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:020220_0078_0FAE4539AB6F1848"/>
vindicate the Spartan from an imputation of weakneſs or inattention in this particular, it may be urged that he was ſurrounded by nations more powerful than his own; it was therefore impoſſible for him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence an eſtabliſhment upon any other plan. And Moſes muſt be vindicated upon this idea, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine moral law, which was deſigned, at a future peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, to regulate and harmonize the whole human race, muſt be preſerved in that nation, which was to give birth to the Saviour of mankind. If we allow him to have had a prophetic knowledge of theſe events, his inſtitutions may be pronounced unexceptionable in every part.</p>
            <p>THE inſtitutions of Mahomet, are next to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. The firſt object of legiſlation appears to have been better underſtood by the Arabian Prophet, than by either of the preceding ſages; his juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was capable of being enlarged to any extent of territory, and governing any number of nations, that might be ſubjugated by his powerful and enthuſiaſtic armies; and to obtain this object his ſyſtem of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was admirably calculated. Like Moſes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced his people that he acted as the vicegerent of Heaven; but with this capital advantage, adapting his religion to the natural feelings and propenſities of mankind, he multiplied his followers, by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſure and the promiſe of a ſenſual para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Theſe circumſtances were likewiſe ſure to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his conſtitution permanent. His religious ſyſtem was ſo eaſy to be underſtood, ſo ſplendid and ſo invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there could be no danger that the people would loſe ſight of its principles, and no neceſſity of future prophets, to explain the doctrines, or reform the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To theſe advantages if we add the exact and rigid military diſcipline, the ſplendor and ſacredneſs of the monarch, and that total ignorance of the people, which ſuch a ſyſtem will produce and perpetuate, the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:020220_0079_0FAE453A69DC2408"/>
eſtabliſhment muſt be evidently well calculated for extent and duration. But the laſt and moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant end of government, that of mental improvement and ſocial happineſs, was deplorably loſt in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And there was probably more learning and real genius in Arabia, in the days of this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry character, than can now be found in all the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh dominions.</p>
            <p>ON the contrary, the enterpriſing genius of the Ruſſian monarch appears to have been wholly bent on the arts of civilization, and the improvement of ſociety among his ſubjects. Happy in a legal title to a throne which already commanded a prodigious extent of country, he found that the firſt object of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was already ſecured; and by applying himſelf with great ſagacity and perſeverance, to the third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he was ſure that the ſecond would be a neceſſary and invariable conſequence. He effected his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, important as they were, merely by the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the arts, and the encouragement of politer manners. The greatneſs of his genius appears not ſo much in his inſtitutions, which he copied from other nations, as in the extraordinary meaſures he followed to introduce them, the judgement he ſhowed in ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adapting them to the genius of his ſubjects, and his ſurpriſing aſſiduity and ſucceſs, by which he raiſed a ſavage people to a dignified rank among Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations. All his plans were formed to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the future progreſs of ſociety; and their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was enſured by their obvious value and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. His ſucceſſors have followed his political mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with great attention to the ſame objects; and the preſent reigning empreſs has rendered herſelf not unworthy of ſo high and honourable a deſcent.</p>
            <p>TO the genius and operation of the ſeveral forms of government above mentioned, we will compare
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:020220_0080_0FAE453B2ACB7D78"/>
that of the Peruvian Lawgiver. It is probable that the ſavages of Peru, before the time of Capac, among other objects of adoration, paid homage to the Sun. By availing himſelf of this popular ſentiment, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, like Moſes and Mahomet, in the character of a divine legiſlator, endowed with ſupernatural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. After impreſſing theſe ideas ſtrongly on the minds of the people, drawing together a number of the tribes and rendering them ſubſervient to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent purpoſes, he applied himſelf to forming the outlines of a plan of policy, capable of founding and regulating an extenſive empire; wiſely calculated for perpetual duration; and expreſsly deſigned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the knowledge, peace and happineſs of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable portion of mankind. In the apportionment of the lands, and the aſſignment of real property, he invented a mode ſomewhat reſembling the Feudal Syſtem of Europe: yet this ſyſtem was wiſely check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its operation, by a law ſimilar to that of Moſes, which regulated landed poſſeſſions in the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee. He divided the lands into three parts; the firſt was conſecrated to the uſes of religion, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſet apart for the Inca and his family, to enable him to defray the expences of government and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſtyle of a monarch, the third, and much the largeſt portion, was allotted to the people; and this allotment was repeated every year, and varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number and exigencies of each family.</p>
            <p>AS the Incan family appeared in the character of Divinities, it was neceſſary that a ſubordination of ranks ſhould be eſtabliſhed; in order to render the diſtinction between the monarch and his people more perceptible. With this view he created a band of Nobles, who were diſtinguiſhed by perſonal and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary honours. Theſe were united to the monarch by the ſtrongeſt ties of intereſt; in peace they acted as Judges, and ſuperintended the police of the empire,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:020220_0081_0FAE453BE619E418"/>
in war they commanded in the armies. The next order of men were the reſpectable peaſantry of the country, who compoſed the principal ſtrength of the nation. Below theſe was a claſs of men, who were the ſervants of the public; who cultivated the public lands. They poſſeſſed no property, and their only ſecurity depended on their regular induſtry and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able demeanour. Above all theſe orders, were the Inca and his family. He was poſſeſſed of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and uncontroulable power; his mandates were regarded as the word of Heaven, and the double guilt of impiety and rebellion attended on diſobedience. To impreſs the utmoſt veneration for the Incan family, it was a fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the royal blood ſhould never be contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by any foreign alliance. The myſteries of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were preſerved ſacred by the high prieſt of the royal family, under the controul of the king; and celebrated with rites, capaple of making the deepeſt impreſſion on the multitude. The annual diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lands, while it provided for the varying circumſtances of each family, ſtrengthened the bands of ſociety, by preventing the different orders from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering with each other; the peaſants could not vie with their ſuperiors, and the Nobles could not be ſubjected by misfortune to a ſubordinate ſtation. A conſtant habit of induſtry was inculcated upon all ranks by the ſurprizing force of example and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The cultivation of the ſoil, which in moſt other countries is conſidered as one of the loweſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was here regarded as a divine art. Having had no idea of it before, and being taught it by the children of their God, the people viewed it as a ſacred privilege, and conſidered it as an honour, to imitate and aſſiſt the Sun in opening the boſom of the earth and producing vegetation. That the government might be able to exerciſe the endearing acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, the produce of the public lands was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:020220_0082_0FAE453EF92092A0"/>
in magazines, to ſupply the wants of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, as a depoſit for the people in times of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſcarcity, and as a reſource in caſe of an invaſion.</p>
            <p>THESE are the outlines of a government, the moſt ſimple and energetic conceivable, and capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the greateſt number of men under one juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; at the ſame time, accommodating its principle of action to every ſtate of ſociety, and every ſtage of improvement, by a ſingular and happy application to the paſſions of the human mind, it encouraged the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of knowledge, without being endangered by ſucceſs. That ſuch a government has a fair chance for perpetual duration is evident from this conſideration, that a band of Nobles are ever the firm ſupporters of regal authority; unleſs the monarch is ſo limited in his power, that the Nobles deſpiſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. This could not be the caſe in Peru; the Nobles were juſtly proud of their elevated ſtation, though they could have no ambition to controul the Inca. They were ſenſible that their intereſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that of the monarch; and, ſuppoſing the influence of religion to be out of the queſtion, they would not attempt to deſtroy an inſtitution on which their happineſs depended. A check equally effective was, by the conſtitution of human nature, impoſed on the Inca. Elevated above the competition and rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which corrode and torment the boſoms of the great, he could have no ambition to gratify and no motive to induce him to an improper exerciſe of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power.</p>
            <p>IN the traits of character which diſtinguiſh this inſtitution, we may diſcern all the great ſtrokes of each of the legiſlators above mentioned. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of Capac to divine authority were as artfully contrived and as effectual in their conſequences, as thoſe of Mahomet; his exploding the worſhip of evil
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:020220_0083_0FAE4540516AA610"/>
beings and objects of terror, forbidding human ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, inculcating more rational ideas of the Deity, and accommodating the rites of worſhip to a God of juſtice and benevolence, produced a greater change in the national character of his people, than any of the laws of Moſes: Like Peter, he provided for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture improvement of ſociety; while his actions were never meaſured upon the ſmall and contracted ſcale, which limited the genius of Lycurgus.</p>
            <p>THUS far we find the political ſyſtem of Capac at leaſt equal to thoſe of the moſt celebrated ancient or modern lawgivers. But in one particular his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is placed beyond all compariſon; I mean for his religious inſtitutions, and the juſt ideas he had formed, by the unenlightened efforts of human wiſdom, of the nature and attributes of the Deity.</p>
            <p>AND here I ſhall premiſe, that idolatrous nations have never been guilty of thoſe glaring abſurdities with which they are uſually charged by the chriſtian world. The Perſian or Peruvian, when he directed his adoration to the Sun, conſidered it as the place of reſidence for the unknown Deity, whom he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and who communicated from thence the bleſſings of light, warmth and vegetation; the Greek, who bowed at the ſtatue of Jupiter, ſuppoſed it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the preſence of his God; the Egyptian Apis, Iſis and Orus, the calf, the leek and the onion, though the theme of univerſal ridicule to other nations, were, in their firſt conſecration, like the Jewiſh Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim, ſymbolical repreſentations of the nature and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of their Deities. No man ever erected a ſtock or a ſtone for a real object of worſhip; but all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant nations have paid their adoration before the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Deity, in ſome ſhape or other, and directed their homage to the place of his ſuppoſed reſidence. Even among enlightened nations, we find many traces
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:020220_0084_0FAE45418FC13BD0"/>
of the ſame ideas; the Papiſt bows to the Picture and the Crucifix; and the Methodiſt rolls up his eyes in prayer to the Sky. Perhaps unaſſiſted wiſdom can riſe no higher; and the reaſon why idol worſhip was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the divine law, was not becauſe of the erroneous ideas of the original inſtitutors, but becauſe the views of the vulgar, in proceſs of time, are apt to ſtop ſhort at the intermediate object, and to loſe ſight of the orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal inviſible Eſſence. But the great crime of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous nations conſiſted in their aſcribing to the Deity the paſſions and attributes of the Devil, and in the horrid and murtherous rites of their worſhip. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are more inclined to conſider the Deity as a God of vengeance than a God of mercy. Even among chriſtians moſt perſons aſcribe afflictions to the hand of Heaven and proſperity to their own merit and prudence. This principle operates in its full effect among ſavages. They uſually form no idea of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſuperintending Providence; they conſider not the Deity as the author of their beings, the Creator of the world and the diſpenſer of the happineſs they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; they diſcern him not in the uſual courſe of nature, in the ſunſhine and in the ſhower, the productions of the earth and the bleſſing of ſociety; they find a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only in the ſtorm, the earthquake and the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; or aſcribe to him the evils of peſtilence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; they conſider him as interpoſing in wrath to change the courſe of nature, and exerciſing the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of rage and revenge. They adore him with rites ſuited to theſe attributes, with horror, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and with ſacrifice; they imagine him pleaſed with the ſeverity of their mortifications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of blood and the cries of human victims; and hope to compound for greater judgements, by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſufferings and horrid ſacrifices, ſuited to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of his taſte.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS no ſingle criterion can be given, which
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:020220_0085_0FAE45421429AEA0"/>
will determine more accurately the ſtate of ſociety in any age or nation, than their general ideas concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and attributes of the Deity. In the moſt enlightened periods of antiquity, only a very few of their wiſeſt Philoſophers, a Socrates, a Tully, or a Confucius, ever formed a juſt idea on the ſubject, or deſcribed the Deity as a God of purity, juſtice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. Can any thing then be more aſtoniſhing than to view a ſavage native of the ſouthern wilds of America, riſing in an age, void of every trace of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or refinement, and acquiring by the mere efforts of reaſon, a ſublime and rational idea of the Parent of the univerſe!</p>
            <p>HE taught the nation to conſider him as the God of order and regularity, aſcribing to his influence the rotation of the ſeaſons, the productions of the earth and the bleſſings of health; eſpecially attributing to his inſpiration the wiſdom of their laws and that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution, which was the delight and veneration of the people.</p>
            <p>THESE humane ideas of religion had a ſenſible ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the manners of the nation. They never began an offenſive war with their ſavage neighbours; and, whenever their country was invaded, they made war, not to extirpate, but to civilize. The conquered tribes and thoſe taken captive were adopted into the nation; and, by blending with the conquerors, forgot their former rage and ferocity.</p>
            <p>A SYSTEM ſo juſt and benevolent, as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, was attended with ſucceſs. In about three hundred years, the dominions of the Incas had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended fifteen hundred miles in length, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced peace and proſperity through the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:020220_0086_0FAE4542A97B0C90"/>
The arts of ſociety had been carried to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of improvement, and the authority of the Incan race univerſally acknowledged; when an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent happened, that diſturbed the tranquility of the empire. Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch, had reduced the powerful kingdom of Quito, and annexed it to his empire. To conciliate the affections of his new ſubjects, he married a daughter of the ancient king of Quito. Thus, by violating a fundamental law of the Incas, he left at his death a diſputed ſucceſſion to the throne. Atabalipa, the ſon of Huana by the heireſs of Quito, being in poſſeſſion of the principal force of the Peruvian armies, which was left at that place on the death of his father, gave battle to his brother Huaſcar, who was the elder ſon of Huana by a lawful wife, and legal heir to the crown. After a long and deſtructive civil war, the former was victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and thus was that flouriſhing and happy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom left a prey to civil diſſentions, and to the few ſoldiers of Pizarro, who happened at that juncture to make a diſcent upon their coaſt. Thus he effected an eaſy conqueſt and an utter deſtruction of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate people. It is however extremely obvious, that this deplorable event is not to be charged on Capac, as the conſequence of any defect in his inſtitution. It is impoſſible that any original legiſlator ſhould effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guard againſt the folly of a futute ſovereign. Capac had not only removed every temptation that could induce a wiſe prince to wiſh for a change in the conſtitution, but had connected the ruin of his author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with the change; for he, who diſregards any part of inſtitutions deemed ſacred, teaches his people to conſider the whole as an impoſture. Had he made a law ordaining that the Peruvians ſhould be abſolved from their allegiance to a prince, who ſhould violate the laws; it would evidently have implied poſſible er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and imperfection in thoſe perſons whom the people
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:020220_0087_0FAE45439B27BC88"/>
were ordered to regard as Divinities: the reverence due to characters who made ſuch high pretenſions, would have been weakened; and, inſtead of rendering the conſtitution perfect, ſuch a law would have been its greateſt defect. Beſides, it is probable the rupture might have been healed, and the ſucceſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ettled, with as little difficulty as frequently happens with partial revolutions in other kingdoms; had not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Spaniards prevented. And this event to a man in that age and country, was totally beyond the poſſibility of human foreſight. But viewing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of theſe fatal accidents, which reduced this flouriſhing empire to a level with many other ruined and departed kingdoms, it only proves that no human ſyſtem has the privilege to be perfect.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, it is evident, that the ſyſtem of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac is the moſt ſurprizing exertion of human genius to be found in the hiſtory of mankind. When we conſider him as an individual emerging from the midſt of a barbarous people, having ſeen no poſſible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the operation of laws in any country, originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plan of religion and policy never equalled by the ſages of antiquity, civilizing an extenſive empire, and rendering religion and government ſubſervient to the general happineſs of mankind, there is no danger that we grow too warm in his praiſe, or pronounce too high an eulogium on his character. Had ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius appeared in Greece or Rome, he had been the ſubject of univerſal admiration; had he ariſen in the favourite land of Turkey, his praiſes had filled a thouſand pages in the diffuſive writings of Voltaire.</p>

                  <p>Since finiſhing the Poem (the whole of which, except a ſmall part of the ſeventh Book, was written previous to the concluſion of the late war) the Author is happy to find that his general ideas, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the future progreſs and final perfection of human ſociety, are ſupported by thoſe of ſo reſpectable a Character as Dr. Price. In his Obſervations on the Importance of the American Revolution, he remarks,
<q>That Reaſon, as well as Tradition and Revelation, lead us to expect that a more improved and happy ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs will take place before the final conſummation of all things. The world has been hitherto gradually improving; light and knowledge have been gaining ground, and human life at preſent, compared with what it <hi>once</hi> was, is much the ſame that a youth approaching to manhood is, compared with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has long been the opinion of the Author, that ſuch a ſtate of peace and happineſs as is foretold in ſcripture and commonly called the millennial period, may be rationally expected to be introduced without a miracle. <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſtate of the arts among the ancients, viewed with reference to the event under conſideration, was faulty or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfortunate in two particulars; <hi>firſt,</hi> in their comparative eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> in their not flouriſhing in more than one nation at a time. Theſe circumſtances were highly favourable to the exertions of individual genius, and may be aſſigned both as cauſes of the univerſal deſtruction of the arts by the Gothic conqueſt, and as reaſons why we ſhould not greatly lament that deſtruction. From the ſituation of mankind in the days of ancient literature, it was natural that thoſe arts which depend on the imagination, ſuch as Architecture, Statuary, Painting, Eloquence and Poetry, ſhould claim the higheſt rank in the eſtimation of a people. In ſeveral, and perhaps all of theſe, the ancients remain unrivaled. But theſe are not the arts which tend greatly to the general improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind. The man, who in thoſe days could have aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the true figure of the earth, would have rendered more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the world, than he that could originate a heaven and fill it with all the Gods of Homer; and had the expences of the Egyptian pyramids been employed in furniſhing fleets of diſcovery, to be ſent out of the Mediterranian, the civilized world would probably never have been ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the ſciences of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography, Navigation and Commerce, with all their conſequential improvements in natural philoſophy and humanity, could not, from the nature of things, be objects of great encouragement or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize among the ancients. They therefore turned their attention to the cultivation of arts more ſtriking to the ſenſes; ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſtrongeſt exertion of the human genius, and would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the higheſt rank in any age of univerſal refinement. As theſe arts were adapted to gratify the vanity of a prince, to fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> were carried to a degree of perfection, which prevented their being reliſhed or underſtood by barbarians. The literature of the world therefore deſcended with the line of conqueſt from one nation to another, till the whole was ſwallowed up in the Roman Empire. There its tendency was to inſpire a contempt for nations leſs civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, and to induce the Romans to conſider all mankind as the objects of their inſult, and all countries as the ſcenes of their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary parade. Theſe circumſtances, through a courſe of ages, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and finally opened a ſcene of wretchedneſs, at which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind has been taught to ſhudder, but it was wiſely calculated to reduce mankind to a ſituation, capable of commencing regular and extenſive improvements. And, however novel the ſentiment may appear, yet the Author will venture to aſſert, that, as to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of univerſal civilization, mankind were in a much more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation in the time of Charlemagne than they were in the days of Auguſtus. The final deſtruction of the Roman empire left the nations of Europe in circumſtances ſimilar to each other; and their conſequent rivalſhip prevented any diſproportionate refinement from appearing in any particular region. The ſeeds of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firmly rooted in the principles of the feudal ſyſtem, laid the foundation of that balance of Power, which diſcourages the Caeſars and Alexanders of mankind from attempting the conqueſt of the world.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems neceſſary, that the arrangement of events in civilizing the world ſhould be in the following order. <hi>Firſt,</hi> all parts of it muſt be conſiderably peopled; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the different nations muſt be known to each other; and <hi>thirdly,</hi> their imaginary wants muſt be increaſed, in order to inſpire a paſſion for commerce. The firſt of theſe objects, was probably not accompliſhed till a late period. The ſecond, for three centuries paſt, has been greatly accelerated, but is now very far from being completely obtained. The third is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a neceſſary conſequence of the two former. The ſpirit of commerce is happily calculated by the Author of wiſdom to open an amicable intercourſe between all countries, to ſoften the horrors of war, to enlarge the field of ſcience and ſpeculation, and to aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate the manners, feelings and languages of all nations. This leading principle, in its remoter conſequences, will produce a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand advantages in favour of government and legiſlation, give Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm the air of Philanthropy, induce all men to regard each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as brethren and friends, eradicate all kinds of literary, religious and political ſuperſtition, prepare the minds of all mankind for the rational reception of moral and religious truth, and finally evince that ſuch a ſyſtem of Providence, as appears in the unfolding of theſe events, is the beſt poſſible ſyſtem to produce the happineſs of creatures. I conceive it is no objection to this plan, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs has hitherto been ſlow; when we conſider the vaſt magnitude of the object, the obſtructions to be removed, and the great length of time that will probably be taken to accompliſh it. To reſume the compariſon of Doctor Price, perhaps the world can hardly be ſaid as yet to be "approaching to manhood"; probably we are rather riſing out of infancy; we have not yet been able to wander over the whole houſe and obſerve upon the furniture. It is poſſible that ſome conſiderable revolutions are yet to happen, before the progreſs will be entirely free from embarraſments. But the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſyſtem appears ſo rational and complete, that it furniſhes a new ſource of ſatisfaction, in contemplating the apparent diſpenſations of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The author firſt ventured upon theſe ideas, in the courſe of the Poem, with all the timidity of youth; determining not to riſk a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious illuſtration of the ſentiment in proſe. But finding that a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo pleaſing to himſelf has not been unnoticed by others, he feels a greater confidence in the ſubject, and hopes the importance of it will apologize to the reader for ſo lengthy a note.</p>
