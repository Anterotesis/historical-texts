            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>AN <hi>ACCOUNT</hi> OF AN IMPRISONMENT IN THE BASTILLE, FOR UPWARDS OF TWENTY YEARS.</head>
                  <p>AFTER an impriſonment of more than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, during which time I was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precluded the uſe of pen, paper, books, and even the poſſibility of hearing the articulation of a ſingle human voice, the reader will not, I hope, expect any very elegant detail of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. My object is truth; my ſecondary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I mean, for ſuch, in truth, I ought to call it, my firſt object being to procure myſelf a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of bread, and which I hope to be able to procure from the publication of my dreadful and almoſt unparalleled misfortunes:</p>
                  <p>One would indeed imagine, that, during ſo long a ſtate of total ſecluſion from the world, the natural and unavoidable conſequence muſt have been, an intire loſs of the uſe of language, reading, and writing: neither of theſe, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030151_0003_0FE4AE1D8DAB1988"/>
in any great degree failed me. In the more fortunate, or rather in the more early part of my life (for I never recollect fortune to have been over and above kind to me) my education had been good, and my application, by no means, inconſiderable: And during the whole of my infamous impriſonment, as ſoon at leaſt, as I had tolerably well got over the firſt ſhock of my unhappy ſituation, I continued to converſe by myſelf, and very frequently to practice writing, or rather the formation of letters, upon the wall of my cell.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to give the melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my being conducted to Priſon, it will not be improper to inform the reader of the cauſe of my being ſent there: although, in fact, no cauſe was aſſigned—but I was accuſed—and, in France, to be accuſed is to be guilty.</p>
                  <p>I was in London when the conteſt ſubſiſted between Mr. Wilkes, or rather between the Public, and the then Miniſters of State, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abolition of General Warrants. And as I came over to England wholly for pleaſure, and as London was at that time a ſcene of riot and confuſion, in which my interference would have beeen uſeleſs and impertinent, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to France after a few weeks, with a full reſolution to viſit that glorious city, when I ſhould be able to paſs my time there more to my ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after my return to France, I went to ſpend a few days with a friend in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Paris, who, amongſt other ſervants had
<pb facs="unknown:030151_0004_0FE4AE20096D2988"/>
an Engliſh Groom who waited upon us at his table. This Groom, having been four years and upwards in France, was as capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and alſo of ſpeaking the French language, as a native. Amongſt other topics the converſation of courſe turned upon my late excurſion to England, and the effort the nation was then making to aboliſh <hi>General Warrants,</hi> which I deſcribed to the company, as nearly analogous to <hi>Lettres de Cachet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being, as I thought, amongſt friends, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was free and without reſtraint, and I believe ſome very ſevere ſtrictures were impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently made by me, in particular, on Lettres de Cachet. And here the matter probably would have ended, had not the Engliſh Groom entered upon a freſh diſcuſſion of it in the ſervants hall. In ſhort, from words they came to blows, and the interference of the maſter and his company became neceſſary: the Valet, who, as he ſaid, had received a blow from the Groom, had drawn out his knife, and had, beyond a doubt put an end to his adverſary's exiſtence, had I not very fortunately ſecured his arm: whereupon turning, in an inſtant, from extreme rage, to extreme coolneſs, he let fall the knife, and muttered to himſelf with a very ſoft and low voice <q>Well, I may perhaps find a better weapon for my purpoſe elſewhere.</q> Firing at this, the Groom imprudently uttered much harſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ſeveral execrations againſt the Police: however, by the authority of my friend, and by the peſuaſion of myſelf and the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the Valet ſeemed to be tolerably pacified; in conſequence of which he was prevailed upon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030151_0005_0FE4AE2893F081E8"/>
to ſhake hands with the Groom. I ſhall never forget the frankneſs and openneſs with which the Groom ſhook him by the hand, nor the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſignificant look of the Valet.</p>
                  <p>The reconciliation on the part of the Valet was external only; the Groom I believe gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly declared his real ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the Valet aſked his Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's permiſſion to go to his father at Paris, who, he ſaid was dying: ſhould he find him better, he would return by one o'clock, but ſhould he find him worſe, or dead, he hoped to be permitted to make a longer ſtay. As he was not returned by ten o'clock at night; we were obſerving that his father was probably worſe or dead. But, alas, no ſooner had the obſervation been made, than the villain arrived with an officer of the Police and a large party of ſoldiers. Not a ſingle word was ſpoken: I never remember a more dreadful ſilence! the Valet put the right hand of the Groom into the right hand of the Officer of Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice: nor even then was a word exchanged on either ſide. The party went off with their booty, the execrable Valet attending them.</p>
                  <p>The conſternation occaſioned in my friend's houſe, by this dreadful circumſtance, may be better conceived than expreſſed: what had my friend to expect but to be ſacrificed to the fury of an angry and malicious Valet. However, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond night, he received a letter from the ſervant "deſiring his arrear of wages, and aſſuring him at the ſame time that <hi>himſelf and his family were ſafe.</hi>" The words being mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030151_0006_0FE4AE2A2D87BB30"/>
were emphatical, and manifeſtly carried with them an implication. As I was the perſon who had introduced the converſation, and had alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfered by taking hold on the Valet's arm, when he was going to ſtab the Groom; I could not but ſuppoſe that by my friend and his family being ſafe, that I was the devoted perſon. However, as after a recapitulation of the whole converſation, and of what paſſed during our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference to part the Groom and Valet, we could not fix upon any thing whereby I could poſſibly have given any particular offence to the Valet, I ſuffered myſelf to be tolerably well paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I ſtaid with my friend ſix nights after the Groom had been arreſted, and then returned home, about three leagues from Paris, where I did not arrive 'till it was dark.</p>
                  <p>On knocking at my door, it was opened to me as uſual by my ſervant: to whom I ſaid, "Well Jacques, is all the family well?" the ſervant gave me no anſwer: it is impoſſible for any one to conceive the horror that came over me: however, I walked into the room, where I ſaw the uſual preparations made for ſupper, and where were ſitting my wife and daughter, a girl of nine years of age, bathed in tears, unable, and afraid to ſpeak a ſingle word. Whilſt I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to unravel this myſtery, I was ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a touch on the ſhoulder from the Valet of my friend, and the ſame officer of Police that had taken up the Groom at my friend's houſe, a few nights before; but the guard of ſoldiers was much ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>Behold reader, a wretched man for no crime
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030151_0007_0FE4AE2BB5811520"/>
whatever reduced from the ſummit of happineſs, to the depth of miſery: his eſtate confiſcated, his family reduced to beggary, himſelf ſhut up for life, and that perhaps unfortunately a long life, in an unwholeſome dungeon.</p>
                  <p>Curſed be that government, which founded on iniquity, and in conſequence thereof, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing with a coward and ſuſpicious eye, devotes with unfeeling indifferance the probable and poſitive offender. But doubly cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be that government, which, not content with pretext of eſtabliſhing it's ſecurity on the miſery of it's ſubjects, meanly calls in avarice to it's aid, in order to ſtrip the innocent relations of the accuſed, of their undoubted right, their daily bread.</p>
                  <p>I have juſt learnt however, that my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate family did not long ſurvive ſo hard a fate: my poor wife, (for tho' ſhe has been dead many years, has to me been dead ſcarcely ſo many days, I having heard of her death but ſince my eſcape from the Baſtile) died within ten days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my commitment, raving mad, and ſtarved to death: for it would have been death, inſtant death, to any perſon whatever to have relieved her. My poor infant daughter was to have been conſigned over to a harder fate, but heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it: on the repreſentation of the officer of the Police to the Marquis de —, a notorious and famous catamite of the court of Lewis the Fifteenth; ſhe was by him ſent for, and orders were given for her being elegantly brought up, 'till ſhe was of proper age to become ſubſervient to his abominable purpoſes. But, heaven be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030151_0008_0FE4AE2D41D67D50"/>
praiſed, ſhe paid the debt of nature, as I am juſt informed within ſix months after ſhe had fallen into the Marquis de —'s hands.</p>
                  <p>Form to yourſelf, reader, the idea of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which the ſubject offers up thanks to Almighty God for depriving him of his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt connections, his wife and family, and think himſelf happy in the loſs of them! Such was France.</p>
                  <p>More than twenty years ago I was forever parted from my wife and only child, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, or rather dragged, in a wretched cloſe cart, from my own houſe to the Baſtile, under a guard of near one hundred ſoldiers: every room in my houſe was filled with armed men, except that in which were ſitting my wife and daughter. The ſalute given me on the ſhoulder by the valet and officer of the Police was the ſignal for their coming out. The Intendant of the Police had given ſtrict orders that none of my family ſhould be permitted to ſpeak, or to leave the houſe on pain of death, a threat which would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been inſtantly put in execution.</p>
                  <p>My two maid ſervants, who, on my arrival were ordered into a private room, had been treated by the ſoldiers in a manner too ſhocking, and too indecent to be committed to paper. Theſe wretched executors of, what they call, juſtice, had been waiting two nights in my houſe expecting my arrival: and the reaſon why I was not apprehended at my friend's houſe, I am told, was, that the valet laid his information againſt me on the Intendant of Police giving his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030151_0009_0FE4AE3607D62638"/>
word and honour that I ſhould not be taken dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my viſit there. One of my maid ſervants died in a few days, in conſequence of the brutal treatment ſhe had received from theſe officers of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> of the footman, and other unhappy fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſervant, no account, I am told, could ever be given: it would have been certain death to have aſked a ſingle queſtion about them.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I arrived at the Baſtile, at a ſignal given, which I never could diſcover, but which I rather think was made by dropping the Lettre de Cachet through a niche, I was received by an officer of the Baſtile, whoſe feelings ſeemed to be as brutal as the odious Police of which he was an executioner. The Lettre de Cachet, which, as he had it in his hand, he muſt, as I ſaid before, have received through a niche, was, together with me, delivered to the Governor of the Baſtile, as great a brute in diſpoſition, but of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal poliſh, than the former. This murderer, for no leſs can I call him, did not do me the ſame honour, which, on peril of his life, he was obliged to do the Lettre de Cachet; for that he was compelled to receive with his own hands, but me he made over to the Deputy Governor, by whom I was conſigned to the common Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, who puſhed me in the dark into my cell. This Deputy Governor was much ſuch a fellow as a good painter would have made of the Police of France had he perſonified it: that is, the meanneſs and cruelty of popery triumphing over an innocent and helpleſs individual. A religion made up of gloſs, hypocriſy, and prieſt-craft: pretending to pardon offences committed againſt Omnipotence, and actually torturing for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark

made on the vile proſtitute of a profligate monarch: forgiving, for a pitiful pittance, crimes againſt nature and againſt humanity: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring the Almighty of the adoration due to him as God Supreme, and conferring it upon Saints, many of them as profligate and obſcure as their adorers.</p>
                  <p>About ſeven o'clock in the morning on the next day, a naſty, ſqualid, cadaverous, figure, who, any where, but in France, would have been taken for the figure of Famine, brought me a blanket, ſome clean ſtraw, a quart of ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, and about four ounces of moſt execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bread. As my appetite was not very good, the bread, as may be ſuppoſed, remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. The water I ſeized with the greateſt avidity, and filthy as it was, drank it off at one draught. At two in the afternoon, the ſame quantity of bread and water was again brought me by the ſame meagre figure, who, obſerving that the bread which he had brought me in the morning, remained untouched, took back with him what he then brought me. At eight o'clock in the evening he came again, bringing the ſame quantity of bread and water; but obſerving, as at two o'clock, that the bread he had brought me remained untouched, he again took, what he brought at eight o'clock, away with him.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry to ſay that I had formed the dreadful reſolution of ſtarving myſelf to death: a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which my <hi>generous</hi> keepers ſeemed themſelves ready to meet me at leaſt half way in. This however, even with their powerful aſſiſtance, I was unable to put into execution. Had I been
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030151_0011_0FE4AE391A128F80"/>
furniſhed with any poſſible means of putting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to death by an act of ſudden violence, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſhould have done it. Such means, however, were effectually denied me. For, previous to my being puſhed into this miſerable apartment, I was ſtripped of my ſhirt, neck-cloth, garters, ſtockings, handkerchief, ſhoe, and knee buckles: in lieu of which I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a flannel ſhirt, and a pair of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flannel ſtockings: ſuch was my dreſs, and by no means too often renewed, during my whole impriſonment: ſuch too, as above ſet forth, was my food.</p>
                  <p>The chamber, if it deſerves that name, in which I was confined, was up one pair of ſtairs. The only furniture of which was an earthen pot, and a ſtone of about half a ton weight which ſerved me for a ſeat; the room was about twelve feet high, and about a foot from the cieling was a window about fourteen inches ſquare, but ſo barricadoed with iron bars, that it would have been utterly impoſſible even for a ſparrow to have paſſed between them. In conſequence of the breadth of the room from the wall to the window, which was ſcarcely five feet, I had no poſſible chance of ſeeing even the ſky; more than that I could not expect to ſee through the ſcanty crevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the iron bars: to have reached the window would have been utterly impoſſible, and as it could have anſwered no poſſible end whatever, but to have created a zealouſy in my brutal keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo did I never once think of attempting it. The length of the room was about eighteen feet: the gloomineſs, and melancholy of it dreadful to a degree: dreadful from the ſad reflection of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030151_0012_0FE4AE3B94E10438"/>
it having been the tomb of many a living corpſe, devoted like me to the zealouſy of a cruel and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical government, and more dreadful to me as being the then unhappy poſſeſſor of it.</p>
                  <p>The cieling of this accurſed appartment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of iron bars, nearly as thick as my wriſt, and within a quarter of an inch of each other croſs wiſe. This, for the two or three firſt months of my impriſonment, I own appeared unaccountable to me, as the floor was of deal.</p>
                  <p>What will not the love of liberty do? and with what improbable and even impoſſible hopes will it not furniſh us? from this conſideration, namely of the floor being compoſed of deal, I flattered myſelf that one day or other I might be able to effect my eſcape: and my hope of doing it was the rather flattered, as I had obſerved that one of the boards was looſe, nearly the whole length of the cell: and I had taken it up, not from any idea of then putting my project into execution, but of getting the thing as it were in train: in a moment I heard the turnkey at the door, and though it took him ſome time to open it, yet was I, unable, from ſurprize, to replace the board, or even to lay it out of my hands, ſo great was my conſternation.</p>
                  <p>The turnkey, on ſeeing my awkward ſituation, immediately locked the door again, and in leſs than five minutes returned with four men whom I had never before ſeen, bringing with them a lanthorn. He was locked with me into my cell, and ſetting his lanthorn upon the ſtone, which I before ſaid was in my cell, very deliberately took
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030151_0013_0FE4AE41662EFE70"/>
up almoſt every board before my face, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, what, 'till then, I never could have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have been the caſe, a floor conſiſting of iron plates at leaſt half an inch thick: having replaced the boards, he gave a rap at the door, in conſequence of which it was immediately opened, and he took his leave of me, with the moſt contemptuous ſneer in his countenance that inſolence could ſuggeſt: here ended my hopes of an eſcape. I was not however, as I expected, put in irons, but was treated by my keeper with exceſſive contempt, and ſilent alluſions to my project of forming an eſcape. During the whole of the ceremony of the turnkey removing the boards, not a ſyllable paſſed between us: as he had poſitive orders no doubt never to utter a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, ſo I, through fear of ill-treatment, and, at the ſame time, conſidering it as uſeleſs, never once opened my lips.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs that on my firſt commitment to that priſon, the diſgrace of a chriſtian country, and the horror of France, I expected every day, or rather every hour, to be put to the torture: this however was not the caſe: my body was no farther put to the rack, than as it partook of the, ſufferings of my mind: let the humane reader form to himſelf the idea of being, to a certainty, confined during life, in ſuch a chamber as I have deſcribed, debarred of bodily exerciſe, of the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of breathing a free or wholeſome air, of the enjoyment of ſuch amuſements as the mind of a rational being, tired of idleneſs and inactivity naturally has recourſe to, and from which it as naturally finds relief, let him form to himſelf, I ſay this id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030151_0014_0FE4AE43EBD004C8"/>
from the moſt ſenſible emotions, in behalf of the unfortunate priſoners. A reflection this, that muſt operate powerfully upon the feelings of any one but of an intendant of French Police, or of his baſe and infamous, but now degraded, employers.</p>
                  <p>To the horror of the above ſcene, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the terrible apprehenſion the priſoner is hourly under, of being put to the torture: of this, no notice whatever is given him: he lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally has no aſſurance whatever of not being taken out of his ſleep and torn to pieces by the cruelty of the officers of the priſon.</p>
                  <p>The laſt human being to whom I ſpoke for more than twenty years, to the day of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe (I relate it with pity to myſelf, and with ſhame for my country) were my unfortunate wife and daughter: and from theſe, the friends of my boſom, I was not ſuffered to receive any anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall endeavour to be as conciſe as poſſible, in the account of my impriſonment, not wiſhing myſelf to reflect upon a ſubject, on which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reflect, but with the greateſt horror and which having no variety in itſelf, cannot but be very unentertaining to the reader.</p>
                  <p>Suffice it therefore to ſay: that I was kept in the ſame room continually: and never once, during ſo many years impriſonment was ſuffered to paſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> the threſhold: my whole and only food was bread and water, both bad, and very bad, in it's kind. I never ſpoke to, or was ever
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030151_0015_0FE4AE457615EAB0"/>
once ſpoken to, by any human creature whatever. The only variety that I ever experienced, was in reſpect of heat and cold, and for this I was indebted to the ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>During the five or ſix laſt winters, the cold was moſt dreadfully puniſhing: I made a ſign to the Turnkey to have an additional blanket, and ſtockings, but of this he took not the leaſt notice. In ſummer the air was foetid, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focating, and frequently to ſuch a degree, that the very Turnkey himſelf who was a walking dunghill, was utterly unable to face the noiſome effluvia on opening the door of my cell. Such, reader, was the variety I ſpeak of, but I ſhall paſs on to that glorious day in which I recovered my liberty.</p>
                  <p>About four o'clock in the morning I heard, what I had never before heard during my whole infamous impriſonment, a variety of voices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my window, and preſently, the cry of "to arms." As I concluded that it was nothing more than ſome poor helpleſs individual who either had, or who was then attempting to make his eſcape, after wiſhing him every poſſible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and having called down every poſſible curſe on the Police of France, I again fell aſleep. The noiſe however did not end here: I then concluded that ſome of the priſoners had actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſen againſt their keepers, and on hearing the firing of a muſquet was more than ever confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in my opinion, that this muſt have been the caſe. But as I well knew that, even had it been the caſe, the conteſt muſt terminate in favour of the officers of the Baſtile, I again laid myſelf down indifferent about the conſequences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030151_0016_0FE4AE47F3880FF8"/>In leſs than an hour I heard a much greater uproar, and a ſhout of <hi>"Vive la liberte,"</hi> Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty for ever. This exclamation thought I, can never proceed from the mouths of the officers of the Baſtile. Nor, indeed, did it: but from the mouths of thoſe forty brave inſurgents who were but a ſmall part of the aſſertors of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious emancipation of France.</p>
                  <p>Theſe unfortunate perſons were admitted within the walls of the Baſtile, on pretext of making terms of ſurrender between the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and the populace. But, ſuch was the faith of a French government, ſcarcely were they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered within the walls of that grave of Liberty, when they were ſet upon by a well armed, though not numerous, Military, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept in the Baſtile, and inſtantly, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the moſt ſolemn promiſe on part of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Baſtile, put to death by fire and ſword. Dreadful Triumph! and ſucceeded by a ſhout very different from that of <hi>"Vive la lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erte"</hi> that of <hi>"Vive la Police"</hi> or ſlavery for ever.</p>
                  <p>It will not be here improper to obſerve, that the Military, and every officer of the Baſtile, except the Governor, is, in fact, as much a priſoner, as any priſoner there, except that he has the whole range of the premiſes of the priſon to walk in. When he enters upon his office he takes it for life, and he would inſtantly be put to the torture, and then to death, were he to be ſeen, or even to expreſs a wiſh to be without the walls of the priſon: nor can the Governor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be abſent more than ten nights together, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030151_0017_0FE4AE4F51E75BD8"/>
that only by permiſſion of the King, and with his ſign manuel. A plain proof this, that the Police is thoroughly aſhamed of the cruelty and injuſtice which it is continually guilty of.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed:</p>
                  <p>I now heard ſilence demanded, and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made (by order of the Governor as I was afterwards informed) to quarter the bodies of the unfortunate perſons, who had ſo nobly on their part, and ſo diſgracefully on the part of the Governor and officers or the Baſtile, loſt their lives in defence of liberty; and to throw their limbs over the battlements to the terror of their companions, in order to ſhew them what they were to expect, as a chaſtiſement of their rebellion, if they did not immediately diſperſe.</p>
                  <p>This however was not put in execution: the barbarians contented themſelves with hanging the dead bodies on the paliſadoes, and expoſing them in a manner the moſt brutal and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in ſuch a manner as would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced an inquiſition, or any thing but a French Police.</p>
                  <p>By this act of brutality, the number of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents, and their fury, was increaſed at leaſt fifty fold. And matters were now come to ſuch a pitch, that nothing but a ſurrender could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſave the lives of the perſons in the Baſtile. This being evident to the Governor, he called all the officers of the priſon together, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (for I heard him with my own ears) to put every priſoner to death, and to bury their bodies,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030151_0018_0FE4AE50DB62D188"/>
in order that nothing relative to that place of confinement, might tranſpire.</p>
                  <p>Reader, if thou haſt any feeling for my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſituation, exert it for me here: if thou haſt one tear, drop it for me here. My very heart bleeds at the bare recollection of the dreadful propoſal.</p>
                  <p>During this converſation amongſt the officers of the Baſtile, the Governor was ſummoned to the wall to know whether he would ſurrender. He would ſurrender, he ſaid, if they would ſwear to him to ſpare his life, This however was even ſo far from being promiſed to him, that he was, in the moſt poſitive and ſolemn manner aſſured, that, in conſequence of his cruelty and breach of ſaith towards their companions, he ſhould infallibly be put to death within three hours after his ſurrender: that if he deferred his ſurrender ten minutes, he ſhould be put to the moſt exquiſite torture. This, however, was ſo far from prevailing upon him to ſet open the gates, that he abſolutely refuſed to give up the priſon, and came down from the battlements.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, the fellow who had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the draw-bridge, and who alſo had the keys of the gate of the priſon, and who (as I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards learnt) was more than fifty yards from the Governor, hearing this reſolution of the Governor, let fall as if by accident, the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and offered immediately to open the gate on condition that they would ſpare his life.</p>
                  <p>This propoſal was made and executed in half
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030151_0019_0FE4AE5263B92FF8"/>
a minute, and the inſurgents were put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete poſſeſſion of the priſon. The military within the Baſtile were ſummoned to lay down their arms, which demand they immediately complied with. The greateſt ſilence and order was obſerved. The Governor was called for, and ordered to go down upon his knees, and to anſwer aloud to every queſtion.</p>

                  <p>Many of theſe poor wretches were ſo emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to be unable to ſtand: ſome of them came forth frantic with joy; others, from the ſenſe of their dreadful ſufferings, and of what they had, in all probability, yet to ſuffer for many a tedious year, had lapſed into a ſtate of idiotcy; and one poor man, in particular, was obliged to be lifted out, being unable to ſtand upon his legs, in conſequence of having had his knees and ancle bones diſlocated by the torture. This unfortunate priſoner had been there upwards of ſeven years, and had been tortured once every year.</p>
                  <p>As many of the priſoners as were capable of bearing arms had the arms and cloaths of ſuch ſoldiers as were in the Baſtile given to them; and, in return, the ſoldiers themſelves were cloathed in the rags of the priſoners, and in that condition turned out of the priſon gates.</p>

                  <p>The gentleman came back in about a quarter of an hour, and ſaid briefly, that he had been eye-witneſs to a ſcene too ſhocking to be looked upon: he then ordered the implements of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be brought out, and to be deſtroyed by the officers of the Baſtile themſelves. After which the Governor was ordered to prepare to die within one hour, and was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be cloſſeted with the Confeſſor of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030151_0023_0FE3F814DF537478"/>
Baſtile. At the expiration of the hour he was brought out, and hanged over the battlements in the ſight of, at leaſt, a hundred thouſand populace, of whom the Giant of this Enchanted Caſtle had long been the terror and dread.</p>
                  <p>The ſhout was univerſal: it aſcended to God's throne an offering of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour. A moſt grateful offering to the Father of Juſtice and Mercy!</p>
                  <p>And now (having ſeen by glorious experiment that the Lord of this caſtle of terror was vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) it was determined to try whether the walls of the priſon were not as liable to mortality. In three days the whole priſon was razed to the ground. What became of the other officers of the Baſtile it is difficult to ſay; ſome of them, on being turned out of the priſon gates, were inſtantly torn to pieces by the populace, not, however, before they had been made to take down the bodies of the men, who had, under truce, entered the priſon, and whoſe bodies, after they had been moſt ſhamefully murdered, had been hung on the paliſadoes, and buried them in the moſt reſpectful manner.</p>
                  <p>Having given a very faithful and accurate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the taking poſſeſſion of this fortreſs, (if ſuch I may call it) which, 'till this day, was thought impregnable, I ſhall proceed to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reader, the manner in which the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of it was carried on.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all Proclamation was made preciſely in the following words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:030151_0024_0FE4AE5EEC0E1380"/>
                     <q>In the name of Almighty God, the Father of Mercies, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, and in the name of the Holy Spirit, be perfect Love and Liberty to this and every Nation under Heaven for evermore: Amen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas this odious priſon called the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile has, in particular, for many years, exiſted the terror and diſgrace of Religion and Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, the diſgrace of former reigns, and of the faithful and good ſubjects of his preſent moſt Chriſtian Majeſty Lewis the Sixteenth, and of his moſt Chriſtian Queen, whom God preſerve; we, the Nation, do hereby condemn to utter annihilation, and perdition, the ſaid odious priſon, as being highly diſgraceful to us as men, and to our country as chriſtians, and highly reflecting upon our allegiance to our moſt Chriſtian King: determining here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to baniſh tyranny and oppreſſion, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of wicked Miniſters, and the damnable power of the Church of Rome, Amen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſooner was the proclamation made, than the demolition of the building was begun, and in the moſt workman-like and methodical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The lead of the roof was firſt of all ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off and thrown down upon the ground, and was then, as were all the other parts of the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, as faſt as they were pulled down, thrown into the ditch which ſurrounded it.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the lead was ſtripped off, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a roof of iron plates half an inch thick, ſcrew'd down to iron bars of four inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that it would have been utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030151_0025_0FE4AE60754CF560"/>
for any priſoner whatever to have got through the roof. This, indeed, the ſcrews being put in from without ſide would have prevented, as would alſo the height of the rooms: thoſe of the upper ſtory being three or four feet higher than thoſe on the lower ſtories: when theſe iron plates, and the bars to which they were ſcrew'd, were removed, an arched roof of ſtone preſented itſelf, built in the form of an oven: under this arch, which was much more difficult to be brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en through than the iron roof, it was preſumed that the cells would appear; but this was by no means the caſe; there was yet another ceiling of large iron bars laid croſs-wiſe, ſcrewed togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er very forcibly, and under that a ceiling of boards. In each of the upper cells was a ſet of iron rings and chains faſtened to the floor, to which a priſoner was to be chained in caſe he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted an eſcape.</p>
                  <p>The roof of the priſon being completely taken off, the walls were next pulled down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the uppermoſt ſet of cells, the floors of theſe cells had nothing peculiar in them: their ſtrength conſiſted in the iron ceiling of the cells below them: which were of plates of iron rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſtead of ſcrewed to very large and cloſe laid iron bars: nor was it poſſible to have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them but by taking the weight of the ſide walls off the ends of them: by this method the matter was effected with tolerable caſe. And now, night coming on, it was agreed to ſuſpend the work by common conſent. And every key belonging to the Baſtile, together with the outer gates of it having been buried in the ditch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome thouſand loads of rubbiſh, and the cells
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030151_0026_0FE4AE688A745888"/>
being open, as many as could get lodging in the priſon did ſo; many returned home 'till the morning, and many thouſands remained abroad the whole night: for my own part, I took up with my old apartment, though with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that inſtead of ſolitude I had company enough, and inſtead of ſpending the night as a miſerable captive, I ſpent it with as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or I hope with more, than if I had been Governor of the Baſtile.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, by break of day, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molition of the priſon proceeded as regularly and in as ſpirited a manner as on the day before: and although the wall was much thicker, the nearer we came to the ground, yet was it lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conſiderable more eaſe than nearer the top of the building, on account of there being leſs lead and iron work amongſt the ſtones.</p>
                  <p>Every hour, or leſs, freſh perſons were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as well to throw down the wall, as alſo to remove the materials into the ditch: and ſo great was the number of people, and ſuch their eagerneſs to ſupply the places of thoſe who had been at work, that had the priſon been ten times as large, it would have been taken down in as ſhort a time: during the whole of this, as alſo on the preceding day, there was no ceſſation of labour whatever, and by the time that it was too dark to carry on the work on the ſecond even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the priſon was taken down to the ſurface of the earth. Whilſt one part of the populace was at work on the Baſtile and Governor's houſe another part was at work on the wall that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the priſon, which was thrown into the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030151_0027_0FE4AE6A1340F480"/>
ditch by the firſt night. The draw-bridge alſo was thrown into the ditch and buried under the rubbiſh.</p>
                  <p>When it was dark, the people retired as on the former night, and the moſt ſtrict order and decorum were obſerved.</p>
                  <p>It muſt doubtleſs appear ſurpriſing that it never once occurred to any perſon preſent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the apartments under ground: nor, 'till the priſon was pulled down to the ſurface, were theſe ſubterraneous cells I believe once thought of:</p>
                  <p>As the doors of theſe chambers of death, if I may ſo call them, had not been opened, and as the keys of them, as well as every key belonging to the Baſtile had, as has been ſaid, been buried under ſome thouſand loads of rubbiſh, it was now impoſſible to open them. Nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore but to come at them by taking off their ceilings. It was ſuſpected that there might be many unfortunate priſoners confined in theſe noiſome and dreadful abodes, which, was it the caſe they muſt be at leaſt forty eight hours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out victuals or drink before they could be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In conſequence of theſe reflexions, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eagerly wiſhing to reſtore their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the joyful face of day, and to the common rights of humanity, and ſenſible at the ſame time what they muſt then ſuffer from hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, and ſtill had to ſuffer before they could poſſibly be relieved, the approach of the morning, was expected, not only with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but even with the moſt painful impatience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:030151_0028_0FE4AE6B9AC856A8"/>By nine o'clock in the morning of the third day, the ceilings over theſe ſubterraneous cells, which were preciſely the ſame with thoſe of the ſett of cells above them, were intirely removed: and in theſe cells, to our infinite ſatisfaction, and utter aſtoniſhment, not a ſingle priſoner was found.</p>
                  <p>Theſe cells were in all reſpects like thoſe above them, except that they had no window in them: inſtead of which there was a little wretched light let in through the doors: and in order to prevent any unhappy perſon who might be the tenant of them, from a poſſibility of ſeeing any thing, a hole was cut in the left hand ſide of the door next the cell, and in the right hand ſide of the outermoſt door.</p>
                  <p>Having already given a very accurate account of the windows of the cells, I now proceed to a deſcription of the doors of them. To each cell there were three doors, all of them of prodigious ſtrength, one of which are opened outwardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the goaler; this door, although of wood, might with much greater propriety be ſaid to be of iron, being ſtudded with nails with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous heads, ſo as almoſt to met each other, and to form, within a very little, a ſuperficies of iron: they were alſo covered tranſverſely with iron bars, ſcrewed on with the heads of the ſcrews al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately placed, one to the outſide of the cell, and one to the inſide of it: between every two ſcrews was a very ſtrong rivet of iron: this door was locked by a prodigious double lock of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtrength and conſtruction, and alſo with a padlock: this being done, a grated door wholly
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030151_0029_0FE4AE6D2395E0E8"/>
of iron was pulled down like a ſaſh, between this and the outermoſt door. The iron bars, of which this ſaſh was compoſed, were ſolid, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring two inches on every ſide: it's interſtices were about four inches wide. This door lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſide into the wall in all reſpects like another door, and was alſo locked by a ſtaple, of prodigious ſtrength, to the ground. This graſe or door being made faſt, the outermoſt door was locked preciſely in the ſame manner as the door next the priſoner: three no bad ſecurities theſe againſt a poor helpleſs individual: nor indeed againſt the good wiſhes of ſuch of his friends as might have any idea of conferring upon him his liberty.</p>
                  <p>A principal reaſon why the priſoners in France (I mean what are called ſtate priſoners) are kept with ſo zealous an eye is, becauſe gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment having generally impriſoned them for nothing, and in moſt caſes having uſed the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is aſhamed and afraid to releaſe them leſt they ſhould tell their hiſtory to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſtate. So the miniſter was afraid to releaſe La Tude, leſt he ſhould write his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs: La Tude —, did write his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires: and they will ever remain a diſgrace to the laſt and preſent reigns of France.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed:</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as it was perceived that no priſoner whatever was confined in theſe ſubterraneous cells, it was determined to dig at the bottom of each of them, in order to examine whether there were any rooms under them: to be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030151_0030_0FE4AE7551CEC2F8"/>
of this, four feet depth of earth was taken out of each cell: but no ſigns of other rooms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, the great ſtones, which compoſed the foundation of the priſon, and which made alſo the ſide walls of theſe ſubterraneous cells, were thrown down into the holes, from which the four foot of earth had been taken, and the earth, which had been dug out, ſerved to cover the place where the infamous Baſtile had ſo long, and ſo lately ſtood: a ſpot now capable of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter harveſt, hitherto fruitful only in cruelty and oppreſſion, in the ſighs and tears of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priſoner and captive.</p>
                  <p>The reader will pleaſe to obſerve that I am not giving a deſcription of the Baſtile, no one can be more improper to undertake a taſk of that ſort than a perſon who was carried in by night, and thruſt into a miſerable dark cell, in which he was kept upwards of twenty years a cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. By the time that I was let out of my cell, the priſon was ſo full of the populace that I could get no competent view of the premiſes of it, nor indeed did I ever think of doing it: whatever the premiſes or gardens of it were, they were deſtroyed, together with the buildings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ever thought of examining them. All I ſhall ſpeak of therefore will be what came imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under my eye.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the priſon itſelf, there were two other buildings, both of them exceedingly low, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls of this gloomy manſion: namely the houſe of the Governor and deputy Governor, both of them under the ſame roof; and a houſe for the common turnkeys. The former, as
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030151_0031_0FE4AE76DA585E98"/>
having nothing peculiar belonging to it, need no deſcription. Of the latter I ſhall ſay but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. At the door of this houſe for the common turnkeys, there uſed to ſtand, night and day, a centinal, into whoſe box came a bell rope, which, when pulled, rang a bell in every room of the houſe at the ſame time, in which the common goalers lived. This was regularly rang three times a day when the goalers went to feed the unhappy priſoners: and in caſe of any alarm; but never elſe upon any occaſion whatever.</p>
                  <p>If the goalers viſited the cells, or any partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular cell, at any other, than at the ſtated hours, it was always done (truely charactereſtic of a French Police) without giving this notice. No turn-key dared to viſit a cell on any pretence whatever, at any other than the ſtated hours on pain of inſtant death, without an order from the Governor, or, in his abſence, from the Deputy Governor, which order was always given in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by word of mouth.</p>
                  <p>The military, I have been informed, never interfered with the priſoners, nor with the goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; nor were they allowed to aſſociate with them, or even to converſe with them. They lived in barracks built againſt the wall of the Baſtile, which ſurrounded the ditch; they were under the command of the Governor, though a Sergeant was always their oſtenſible comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>The houſe in which the goalers lived, was circular; in one part of it was a large room in which they eat, drank, and aſſociated, during
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030151_0032_0FE4AE7866D208B8"/>
the day time: all around this room were other chambers in which they ſlept, and in which, as I before ſaid, a bell was hung, as there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the common room. Under this houſe was a very ſpacious vault, which we took for a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel houſe, but on opening it, it proved to be nothing more than a place in which they kept victuals, and it had in it ſeveral veſſels of weak wine.</p>
                  <p>This vault received its light and air from half a dozen ſmall windows, which were ſecured by a few ſlight iron bars; but, within it was a door, or rather three doors, made preciſely like the doors of the cells in which the priſoners were kept. To break theſe open in any reaſonable time was utterly impoſſible, it was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon to remove them by taking away the ſtone work on the ſide of the poſts; this was, at laſt, effected with infinite la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap> and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the ſtaple to which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or ſaſh door was faſtened to the ground, gave us incredible trouble; it was however determined to open it, and opened it was.</p>
                  <p>The conjectures of what might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this ſtrongly fortified chamber, were numerous, and, as it afterwards proved, all of them erroneous. One conjectured that it muſt be a room ſet apart for torture; another, that it was a vault for burying the dead, or a charnel houſe; others, a mine, in caſe of aſſault: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it turned out to be a very large and ſpacious room full of arms of different ſorts, antient and modern, and had in it alſo ſome gunpowder and ball. The windows of it, which were four
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030151_0033_0FE4AE7AE8C54950"/>
only, were very ſtrongly fortified and glazed; they looked out through the wall that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Baſtile, into the great ditch, and were ſo formed as not to be very viſible on the outſide. Such of the arms as were found in this room, and which were of uſe, were put into the hands of the inſurgents: the old guns which fired with a match, were left behind, and buried in the ruins, as being wholly uſeleſs. The arch which covered this room, (for it ran from under the houſe in which the common goalers lived, to the outſide of the wall of the Baſtile) was dug through, and the room, together with the Baſtile, its gates, walls, Governor's houſe, and, in ſhort, the whole premiſes belonging to it, were razed, not only to the ground, but two feet, at leaſt, beneath the ground: and no trace of the ſpot, on which it ſtood, left behind.</p>
                  <p>This being done, proclamation was made for ſilence: and the herald was ordered to return thanks to Almighty God, for this ſingular nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al delivery, from a tyrannical and oppreſſive government: and a curſe was denounced againſt thoſe who ſhould rebuild, or attempt, or propoſe, or wiſh to rebuild this priſon. The whole was concluded with three acclamations of "Vive le Roi," "Vive la Liberte" "Vive la Nation."</p>
                  <p>I cannot myſelf (I may perhaps be ſingular in my opinion) forbear thinking but that the French Court has ſuffered, in it's turn, for the many acts of cruelty and perfidy it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly guilty of towards a part of it's ſubjects, which, on all occaſions, has lived in the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner under that cruel and oppreſſive government.

                  <p>THE Baſtille, in its original form, ſtood at the entrance of Paris, on the ſide of the Fauxbourg Saint Antoine:—It then conſiſted but of two towers. The deſign of the Caſtle was given, and the firſt ſtone laid April 23, 1369, by Hugh Aubriot, Prevoſt of Paris, who had been charged with the management of the new encloſure and fortifications of that city un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Charles V. The two towers with which the Caſtle was firſt built ſerved as a defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the attacks of the Engliſh; but there were ſoon afterwards added two, for the purpoſe of retreat, fronting to and parrallel with the firſt. The entrance to Paris was lengthened by two ſeperate towers and a double bridge. The ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifice was not completed until the reign of Charles VI. about the year 1383.—That monarch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded four new towers at equal diſtances. He conſtructed apartments between the towers in the ſolid walls, pulled down the bridges, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030151_0037_0FE4AE871EABDA38"/>
ſurrounded the whole eight towers by a dry ditch ſunk twenty-five feet below the level of the ſtreet.</p>
                  <p>All the towers are ſecured at the bottom by ſtrong double doors, with enormous locks and bolts. The filthy dungeons beneath exhale the moſt offenſive ſtench, and are the common abodes of lizards, toads, rats, ſpiders, and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other ſpecies of vermin.</p>
                  <p>It was in theſe dungeons that the tyrannical Lewis XI. confined thoſe whoſe miſerable lives he was deſirous of prolonging by gradual torture; ſuch was his treatment of the princes of Armag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac, who were placed in theſe dungeons, in holes ſunk in the ſtone-work into the forms of ſugar-loaves, terminating in points, ſo conſtructed to deprive their feet of reſt, and their wearied and tortured bodies of all poſſibility of repoſe; from this miſerable ſituation they were taken twice a week—to receive the ſcourge, under the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Philip L'Huillier, then Governor of the Baſtille; and at the end of every three months they had one or two teeth wrenched from their jaws. The elder of theſe princes at length went mad; but the youngeſt was happy enough to be delivered from this dreadful incarceration, by the death of Lewis XI. and from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In a corner of each dungeon is placed a camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, formed by planks laid acroſs iron bars ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wall. It is here they put ſuch priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they wiſh to terrify into any meaſure, and

allow them nothing but a little ſtraw for bed-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. Double doors, each ſeven inches thick, and faſtened by monſtrous bolts, are the entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to theſe horrid and dark dens.</p>
                  <p>After the dungeons the moſt horrible are thoſe containing iron cages, which are three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Theſe cages are formed of beams, caſed with ſtrong plates of iron; and are eight feet high by ſix feet wide.</p>
                  <p>[It is not the intention of the Publiſher to give a full account of the caſtle, towers, &amp;c. of the Baſtille, as the limits of this ſmall pamphlet will not allow of it, but what has been ſaid will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly give the Reader an idea of that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous priſon.]</p>

of the Duchy of Burgundy, and that of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Comte, as a portion with a daughter either of the King of Spain or of the Duke of Savoy, whom they promiſed to give him in marriage. Henry IV. having diſcovered the plot, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately taxed Biron with it, who denied the crime with unconquerable audacity. The Parliament of Paris gave orders for his trial. He was found guilty of the crime of high treaſon againſt his King and Country, and condemned to loſe his head, by an Arret of the 29th July 1602; which ſentence was executed on the 31ſt of the ſame month, in the interior court of the Baſtille.</p>

                     <p>In 1674, Louis Chevalier de Rohan, Grand Veneur of France, having loſt his baggage in a ſkirmiſh, on its being rifled, certain letters were found which gave ground of ſuſpicion, that he was engaged in a traiterous deſign to deliver Havre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-Grace into the hands of the Engliſh. In conſequence of this diſcovery he was ſeized and thrown into the Baſtille. The Sieur de la Tuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derie, who was his emiſſary in the buſineſs, hid himſelf immediately on hearing the news of his principal's arreſt. Sufficient proofs not being brought forward againſt de Rohan, a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was created which aſſumed to itſelf the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of drawing up documents for convicting him of treaſon. La Tuanderie was diſcovered at Rouen, whither proper officers were diſpatched to apprehend him; but perceiving his caſe to be deſperate, he fired on his aſſailants, and was immediately killed on the ſpot. The friends of the Chevalier de Rohan repaired every night to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030151_0040_0FE4AE9154DF2B90"/>
the Baſtille, which they circumambulated, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inceſſantly, with the aſſiſtance of a ſpeaking-trumpet, <q>La Tuanderie is dead, and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed nothing;</q> but this was never heard by the Chevalier. The Commiſſioners finding that they could draw nothing from him, told him, <q>That the King knew the whole of the fact, and was poſſeſſed of convincing proofs; that they only waited his confeſſion; and that they had authority to promiſe him a pardon upon the ſingle condition, that he ſhould declare the truth of the matter.</q> The too credulous Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier avowed the treaſon; when, in an inſtant the perfidious wretches changed their tone, and told him, that it was true, they could not enſure his pardon, but that they had great hopes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, and would go immediately to ſolicit it. Notwithſtanding this promiſe, they felt no compunction in pronouncing, ſoon after, the dreadful ſentence of his death. The Chevalier was condemned to loſe his head; and on the 27th November 1674, he was conducted on foot to the ſcaffold, along a gallery erected on a level with a window of the Fencing-ſchool belonging to the Arſenal, where he was executed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The Sieur Vaillant, a worthy eccleſiaſtic, but who had been unfortunate enough to have been concerned in the affair of the too-famous Bull, was confined in the Baſtille from 1728 to 1731. He was a ſecond time thrown into that priſon in 1734. Some hot-headed fanatics were ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, either by bribes or other means, to ſpread a report, <q>That this prieſt was the prophet Elias,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030151_0041_0FE4AE93DA16DD10"/>
lately deſcended upon the earth; that he was now in the Baſtille, but would ſoon be taken thence and put to death.</q> The partiſans of this eccleſiaſtic obtained the common appellation of Vaillantiſts. In a courſe of time, the rigour with which he was treated in the Baſtille, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his own auſterities, turned his brain. He harboured at times the idea that he was indeed the prophet Elias; and firmly believing that he ſhould one day be caught up in a whirlwind of fire, he made no ſcruple of honeſtly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this opinion to the officers of l'Etat-Major. On the 26th of January 1739 the chimney of his apartment took fire, and he welcomed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo long expected, of his elevation; but the fire was ſoon extinguiſhed, and he remained under lock and key as uſual. He now thought himſelf bound to make a ferious declaration in writing to the Lieutenant de Police, <q>That he, Vaillant, was in no ſenſe the Prophet Elias; that he did not repreſent him, and that he had no authority for announcing him, or for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſpeaking in his name.</q> Long ſolitude impaired his intellects. Having entered the chapel one Sunday to hear maſs, he ſuddenly ſeized the veſtments, put on the cope, &amp;c. and began maſs. The people called for aſſiſtance, and the Major came, and tried in vain to ſtop the prieſt, who, quite regardleſs of all about him, continued the ſervice. The Major ſeized him, the prieſt reſiſted, and the champions at laſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lared each other. This ſcene deprived the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner from ever again attending the maſs. He was afterwards conveyed to Vincennos, where he died.</p>

                     <p>The Comte de Lally was near three years in the Baſtille. He was of a violent diſpoſition, and one of his favourite maxims was, <q>That he knew no pleaſure ſo ſweet as revenge; which was truly the pleaſure of the gods!</q> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <q>The Parliament will judge me with all the rigour of the laws; but the King will favour me and mitigate my ſufferings.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had permiſſion to have his ſecretary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with him; and this man he wearied out with perpetual vexation. One day the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry having obſerved in the great Court a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of coagulated blood, which had been drawn by phlebotomy from one of the ſick priſoners, and which the ſervant had careleſsly thrown there, he conceived an idea that preparations were making for putting him to death, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately became diſtracted.</p>
                     <p>The Major of the Baſtille received orders to conduct the Comte Lally to the palace, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo his final examination. M. le Preſident commanded that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to diveſt him of the rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon of his Order, and the other inſignia of his dignities, but he refuſed to perform that office, which was immediately executed by the Huſſars. The Comte was re-conducted to the Baſtille, and all viſits in future, and permiſſion to walk out, were prohibited. The officers kept him comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any by turns from this time till his execution, which did not take place till three or four days after his condemnation. In the mean time, his friends and relations took opportunity of paſſing in their carriage by the ſide of the gate St. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030151_0043_0FE4AE9C3B236F50"/>
and before his window, making ſigns to him to anticipate his fate by cutting his throat; but all their ſignals were uſeleſs; the priſoner, abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in reflection, never caſt his eyes that way, and left to the executioner, what, had he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their inſtigations, he would certainly have ſaved him the trouble of performing. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor received orders, to remove Lally into, the Conciergerie, there to paſs the night of horror preceding his execution, and to continue with him the whole time. Here he became reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that officer whom he had ever before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted. The next morning M. Paſquier, a Councellor of Parliament, ſaid to him, <q>The King is full of mercy, and will certainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you if you will declare every thing you know of your two accomplices, &amp;c.</q> Lally flew into a rage, called M. Paſquier a perfidious man, abuſed him in the groſſeſt manner, and poured out on him the moſt horrid imprecations and blaſphemies. The magiſtrate gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate orders for gagging him; but ſoon after, the confeſſor appearing, the gag was taken out of his mouth. He then made a feint of removing a little on one ſide, drew a point of a compaſs, which he had ingeniouſly concealed, and ſtabbed himſelf with great violence, with a full deſign of preventing the ignominy which was preparing before his eyes. The attendants however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and diſarmed him, when he vehemently exclaimed; "F—, I have miſſed the blow!" The ſurgeon found the wound not mortal; he became gradually more calm, was confeſſed, and ſoon after executed, May 1766.</p>
