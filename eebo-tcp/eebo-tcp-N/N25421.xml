            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEDRA, whoſe writings have thrown a luſtre over Spain, amuſed Europe, and corrected his century, lived poor, unfortunate, and died almoſt forgotten; we were ignorant till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few years, of the true place of his birth. Madrid, Seville, Lucene and Alcala, diſputed this honour with each other; thus Cervantes, like Homer, Camoens and many other great men, found ſeveral countries after his death, and wanted neceſſaries during his life.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniſh academy under the protection
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033741_0004_0FF8F6A870671918"/>
of its ſovereign, has at length rendered the memory of Cervantes that homage which Spain has owed him for too long a time; they have publiſhed a ſplendid edition of Don Quixotte. It ſeemed as if they had believed that the magnificence of this publication could repair the injuries that the nation had done its author. His life is at the head, written after the moſt exact reſearches, by a diſtinguiſhed academician.

                     </gap> the works of Cervantes, according to the ſentiments they have inſpired me with.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes was a gentleman, ſon to Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Cervantes, and Leonora de Cortinas; he was born at Alcala de Henares, a city of new Caſtile, the 9th day of October 1547, under the reign of the emperor Charles the fifth. From his infancy he loved books; he ſtudied in Madrid under a celebrated profeſſor, where he very ſoon ſurpaſſed the moſt expert ſcholars. The grand ſcience of that time was latin and theology; the parents of Cervantes
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033741_0005_0FF8F6AD2E979108"/>
intended to have made him an eccleſiaſtic or a phyſician, the only lucrative profeſſions in Spain; but he had ſtill this trait in common with many celebrated poets, of making verſes in ſpight of his parents. An elegy on the death of Queen Iſabella de Valois, a number of ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and a little poem called "Filene," were his firſt eſſays; the ſmall regard that they paid to theſe works appeared to him an injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he left Spain, and went to ſettle at Rome, where diſtreſs forced him to become valet de chambre to Cardinal Aquaviva.</p>
                  <p>Diſguſted very ſoon with an employment ſo little fit for him, Cervantes became a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and fought with diſtinguiſhed valour in the famous battle of Lepanto, gained by Don John of Auſtria, in 1571: he received there a wound in his left hand from a muſquet, of which he was lame all his life;—as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for this wound he was put into the common hoſpital at Meſſina. Having left the hoſpital, the trade of an invalid ſoldier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him preferable to that of a deſpiſed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033741_0006_0FF8F6AED19EAE60"/>
poet, he went and enrolled himſelf anew in the garriſon of Naples, in which city he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained three years. As he was repaſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spain on board a galley of Philip the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's, he was taken and brought into Algiers, by Arnaut Mami, the moſt renowned of all the corſairs.</p>
                  <p>Fortune, who exhauſted her rigours upon the unfortunate Cervantes, could not wear out his courage;—ſlave to a cruel maſter, ſure of dying in torments if he durſt make the leaſt attempt to recover his liberty, he concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eſcape with fourteen Spaniſh captives. They agreed to redeem one from among themſelves who ſhould go to his own country, and return with a bark to carry the others dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night; the execution of his project was not very eaſy: it was neceſſary at firſt to get as much money as ſhould pay for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of one of the priſoners, afterwards to eſcape from the houſes of their different maſters, and be able to remain all together, without being diſcovered, till the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the bark ſhould arrive to carry them
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033741_0007_0FF8F6B1ED305048"/>
away. So many difficulties appeared inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable; the love of liberty brought it all about. A captive, a native of Navarre, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by his maſter in cultivating a large gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the borders of the ſea, took on himſelf the taſk of hollowing out a cave in the moſt retired part of the garden, capable of containing the fifteen Spaniards; he ſpent two years in this work, during which time they gained, what with alms and hard work, the ranſom of a Majorcan, named Viane, whoſe fidelity they were ſure of, and who knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well all the coaſt of Barbary. The money being ready, and the cave being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was neceſſary to wait yet ſix months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one was prepared to go there; then Viane ranſomed himſelf, and parted from them, having ſworn to return in a little time.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes had been the ſoul of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; it was he who expoſed himſelf every night in ſeeking food for his companions; as ſoon as day appeared, he retired into the cave
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033741_0008_0FF8F6B66DBD0F88"/>
with proviſions enough for the day. The gardener, who was not obliged to conceal himſelf, had his eyes continually on the ſea, to diſcover if the bark was yet come.</p>
                  <p>Viane kept his word; arrived at Majorea, he went to the viceroy, laid his commiſſion before him, and demanded his aſſiſtance in favour of the enterpriſe; the viceroy gave him a brigatine. Viane, with his heart full of hope, flew to the deliverance of his brothers; he arrived on the coaſt of Algiers, the 28th day of September, of that ſame year 1577, one month from the day he had left it. Viane had obſerved every place ſo well, that he knew them again altho' it was night, he directs his little veſſel towards the garden, where he was expected with ſo much impatience. The gardener, who was on the watch, perceived him, and ran to acquaint the captive Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards of it. All their misfortunes are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at this happy news, they embrace each other, they preſs to get out of the cave, they view with tears of joy the bark of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033741_0009_0FF8C175A39661D0"/>
—but alas! as the prow touched the ſhore, ſome Moors were paſſing that way, and knowing the Chriſtians, cried out to arms! Viane trembling ſpreads his ſails, gains the open ſea and diſappears; the unhappy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, fallen again into their chains, went to weep at the bottom of their cave.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes re-animates them, he made them hope, and flattered himſelf that Viane would return again; but Viane returned no more. Grief, and the dampneſs of their narrow and unhealthy abode, brought diſorders on theſe unhappy people. Cervantes was no longer able to procure neceſſaries for ſome, to take care of others, and to encourage all: he got one of his companions to aſſiſt him, and gave him the charge of providing victuals in his place. The perſon he made choice of was a traitor, he went to the King of Algiers, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Muſſulman, and led himſelf to the cave, a troop of ſoldiers, who put the thirteen Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards in irons, and dragged them before the King; that Prince promiſed them their lives,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033741_0010_0FF8F6B8E55E19E0"/>
if they would declare who was the author of the enterpriſe;—It is I, ſaid Cervantes to him, ſave my brothers, and put me to death. The King reſpects his intrepidity, he gave him back to his maſter Arnaut Mami, who would not put ſo brave a man to death.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy gardener, who had made the cave, was hung up by one leg, till his blood ſmothered him. Cervantes, deceived by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, betrayed by his friend, and returned to his firſt chains, only became more ardent to break them; four times he failed in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and was on the point of being impaled. His laſt effort was to cauſe a revolt among all the ſlaves in Algiers, and to make himſelf maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; they diſcovered this conſpiracy, yet Cervantes was not put to death;—ſo certain it is, that true courage will make itſelf reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected even among barbarians.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that Cervantes being willing to ſpeak of himſelf, in the novel of the Captive, one of the moſt intereſting in Don Quixotte, ſays,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:033741_0011_0FF8F6BB489FEE78"/>
                     <q>That the cruel Azan, King of Algiers was never merciful only to a Spaniſh ſoldier, named Saavedra; who expoſed himſelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the moſt frightful puniſhments, which will not for a long time be forgotten by the infidels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the King of Algiers, willing to be the maſter of ſo famous a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, purchaſed him from Arnaut Mami, and had him cloſely confined. A ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this Prince being obliged to go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, demanded from Spain the ranſom of his priſoner. The mother of Cervantes, Leonora de Cortinas, a widow and poor, ſold all that ſhe had, and ran to Madrid, carrying with her three hundred ducats to the fathers of the Trinity, who were charged with the redemption of captives. This money, which was the intire and only fortune of the widow, was far from being ſufficient. The King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan would have five hundred crowns of gold; the Trinitarians, touched with compaſſion, completed the ſum, and Cervantes was ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033741_0012_0FF8F6BFC9869170"/>
the 19th of September 1580, after a ſlavery of five years.</p>
                  <p>On his return to Spain, diſguſted with a military life, and reſolving to deliver himſelf up entirely to letters, he retired near his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the fond hope of ſupporting her by his works. Cervantes was then thirty three years old, he began with GALATEA, of which he gave but the firſt ſix books, and which he never completed. This work ſucceeded pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well; the ſame year he married Donna Catherine de Palacios, ſhe was deſcended from a good family, but ſhe was poor, and this marriage did not enrich him. To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his family, Cervantes wrote comedies; he aſſures us, that they were well received, but very ſoon after this, he quitted the theatre for a ſmall employment which he obtained at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, where he went to ſettle. It was there he wrote thoſe novels where he paints ſo well the vices of that great city.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes was near fifty years old, when he was obliged to take a journey into La Mancha.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033741_0013_0FF8F6C1967826C8"/>
The inhabitants of a little village named Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamazilla, picked a quarrel with him, threw him into priſon, and left him in it a long time; it was there that he began Don Quixotte, he believed that he ſhould revenge himſelf on thoſe who had inſulted him, by making their country the country of his hero. He affected in the mean time not to mention once in his romance, the town where he had been ſo bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated. He began by giving to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic no more than the firſt part of Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otte, which did not ſucceed. Cervantes knew mankind; he publiſhed a pamphlet called "The Squib,"—this work, which it would be impoſſible to find now, even in Spain, ſeems to be a criticiſm on Don Quixotte that covered his ſlanderers with ridicule;—every one read the ſatire, and Don Quixotte obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this bagatelle, the reputation which ſince has been due only to itſelf.—Then all the enemies of good taſte let themſelves looſe againſt Cervantes.

by his ſucceſs, than ever he had been by his diſgraces, he durſt not venture to give any thing to the public for ſeveral years, his ſilence added to his miſery without appeaſing envy. —Happily the Count de Lemos and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Toledo lent him ſome ſuccours; this protection, which Cervantes conſidered as ſo valuable, was continued to him almoſt to his death, but was never proportioned either to the merit of the protected, nor to the wealth of the protector. Cervantes, to ſhow his gratitude to the Count de Lemos, dedicated his novels to him, which appeared eight years after the firſt part of Don Quixotte; the year following he gave his "Voyage to Parnaſſus," but theſe works brought him but little money, and the ſuccours of the Count de Lemos were always very weak, ſince Cervantes to procure bread was obliged to print eight comedies, which the players had refuſed to perform; he ſeemed deſtined to misfortunes and humiliations of every kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>This ſame year, an Arragonian, who took
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033741_0015_0FF8F6C6B4266B08"/>
the name of d'Avellaneda, wrote a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Don Quixotte; a wretched continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without taſte, without wit, and without gaiety, but in which he ſaid many things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to Cervantes;—this ſort of merit made the book be read. Cervantes replied to it as all the ſatires ought to have been replied to: —he publiſhed the ſecond part of Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otte, ſuperior ſtill to the firſt, every one was convinced of his merit, but the more they were obliged to render him juſtice, the leſs ſorry were they that a rival, even deſpicable, ſhould inſult him whom they were forced to admire.—Spain is not, perhaps, the only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the world, where malignity ſo ſevere on good works is always indulgent to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors. Whilſt Cervantes lived, Avallaneda was read, as ſoon as he was dead, his enemy was forgotten.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of Don Quixotte was the laſt work printed during his life;—he worked ſtill at the romance of "Perfiles and Sigiſmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da," when he was attacked by a complaint of

which he died, it was a dropſy;—he felt very ſoon that he could not be cured, and fearing not to have time to finiſh his work, augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſorder by intenſe application. He was very ſoon at the extremity; tranquil and ſerene on the bed of death, as he had been patient under his misfortunes, his conſtancy and philoſophy never forſook him a moment. Four days before his death he had his ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Perſiles brought to him, and traced with a feeble hand, the epiſtle dedicatory, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Count de Lemos, who juſt then arrived from Italy;—this letter deſerves to be remembered— it is as follows:—</p>

                  <head>OF THE WORKS OF CERVANTES.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt poetical works of Cervantes are not much known, nor do they deſerve it;— his ſonnets and elegies are written too much in the taſte of his age—his beſt work, that which has immortalized his name, is the "Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Don Quixotte;"—the judgment, the gaiety, the fine irony diffuſed through this work, the great truth of the portraits, the purity, the ſimplicity of the ſtyle, have rendered this work immortal: I know that it is not equally pleaſing to all French readers who do not underſtand Spaniſh; this ariſes
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033741_0020_0FF8C179EDC8E2E0"/>
from the faults of the only tranſlation which we have of it, it is very far from the elegance and the delicacy of the original. The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator ſeems to have conſidered Don Quixotte as a common romance, whoſe ſole merit was to be entertaining. He has tranſlated the Spaniſh word by the French one, which he found in the dictionary, without comparing or without chuſing; he forgot that in works of humour no word is ſynonimous to another; that one word alone is apt, and all others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which he has tranſlated the pieces of poetry, of which there are many in Don Quixotte, would perſuade us that the Spaniſh verſes are ridiculous; when, in fact, they are all agreeable—perhaps too abſtruſe.</p>
                  <p>But Cervantes wrote for his nation, whoſe taſte is different from ours; and the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who wrote for us, ought, whilſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the thoughts of Cervantes, to have weakened ſome compariſons, ſoftened ſome of the images, and have, above all, given
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033741_0021_0FF8F6D4B77B23E8"/>
ſweetneſs and harmony to the verſes. He appears to have thought of nothing but being literal, and this among the French, is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a fault. To us almoſt all foreign books ſeem too long; even Don Quixotte has prolixities and ſtrokes of bad taſte, which might be retrenched without the tranſlator's meriting the reproach of not being exact; when a work of entertainment is to be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the tranſlation moſt agreeable, is, without doubt, the moſt faithful.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding theſe faults, the work is ſo excellent in itſelf, the epiſodes ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the adventures ſo comic, that all the world knows it, all the world read it again and again;—our tapeſtry, our pictures and our prints, all repreſent Don Quixotte to us; and even the children laugh when they ſee Sancho Panza.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes's novels fall far ſhort of Don Quixotte; he wrote twelve, and four alone are worthy of him,—"The Curious Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,"
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033741_0022_0FF8F6D71CA494A0"/>
which is inſerted in Don Quixotte; "Riconnet and Cortadille," a whimſical but true picture of the rogues of Seville:—"The Force of Blood," the moſt intereſting and beſt conducted of the whole;—and "The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Dog?." This laſt is a charming piece of criticiſm, abounding with philoſophy and gaiety; the Spaniſh manners are there drawn with all the accuracy, ſimplicity, and ſpirit of Cervantes. We have had within thoſe few years a French tranſlation of theſe twelve novels, but they ought to be read in the original.</p>
                  <p>The "Journey to Parnaſſus," is a poetical work, divided into chapters. Cervantes feigns that Apollo threatened by legions of bad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, ſends Mercury into Spain, to aſſemble all his favourites, and conduct them to defend Parnaſſus. Mercury finds Cervantes, and ſhows him the liſt of thoſe whom Apollo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to aſſiſt him, and of their adverſaries. It is evident what a fine opportunity this fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave a man of wit to be revenged on the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033741_0023_0FF8F6DBA28A6458"/>
dunces who had inſulted him. This work is not very agreeable, nor can we reliſh it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I know not any tranſlation of this, nor of his comedies; they are eight in number, and Cervantes ſays in his prologue, that he had written twenty or thirty; this uncertainty muſt appear wonderful to thoſe who know how difficult it is to write even one comedy;—be that as it may, thoſe which are preſerved, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh our regret for thoſe that are loſt. I have read them all with attention, none of them are tolerable; unintereſting, badly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, often witty, always improbable; ſuch is the characteriſtic of all his plays. In that called "The Happy Ruffian," the hero, who in the firſt act is the greateſt villain in Seville, becomes a Jacobin at Mexico in the ſecond: he is the pattern of the convent; he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent encounters with the devil, upon the ſtage, and always remains conqueror. Being called to attend a lady of the place, then on her death-bed, whoſe life had been very irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular, Father Crux, for ſo he is called, preſſes her in vain, to confeſs her ſins; the dying la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033741_0024_0FF8F6DD6128CCD0"/>
believes herſelf too culpable to hope for pardon:—At laſt Father Crux, anxious to prevent her reprobation, offers to take her ſins on him, and give her his merits; the exchange is made, the bargain ſigned, the dying lady confeſſes, angels receive her ſoul, and devils ſeize upon the Jacobin; who ſees his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy covered with frightful ulcers. In the third act he dies, and works miracles. This is one of the comedies of the author of Don Quixotte, and perhaps, his beſt.</p>
                  <p>There are, beſides, eight little pieces of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes, which the Spaniards call Entremeſes; theſe are better than his comedies; they are comic and natural, ſome of them rather too free, but two of them are charming above the reſt; one called "The Cave of Salamanca," is exactly our Soldier Magician; the French comic opera is formed after the model of the Spaniſh; the other, called "The Miraculous Picture," has furniſhed Piron with the idea of an opera ballad, The Falſe Prodigy, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Cervantes's work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:033741_0025_0FF8F6E074D4F2B8"/>"Perſiles and Sigiſmunda," of which we have two unfaithful tranſlations, is a long ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, loaded with epiſodes and adventures, almoſt always incredible. It ſeems as if Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes wiſhed to imitate the old Greek ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances ſtill eſteemed and formerly admired. But all his imagination, which, perhaps, never was more brilliant than in Perſiles, is inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to render his heroes intereſting; their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs adventures, their improbable dangers, and the conſtant medley of love and devotion, have hindered this work from attaining the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of its author; but the elegance of the ſtyle, the great truth of ſome of the portraits, and the epiſode of "Ruperte" are ſufficient to render it of great value.</p>
                  <p>It remains that I ſhould ſpeak of "GALA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEA," his firſt performance. At the time he wrote it, Spain was the moſt gallant nation in the world, love was the ſole occupation of the Spaniards, and the ſubject of all their books.</p>
                  <p>Montemayor, a celebrated poet, publiſhed the romance of "Diana," which has been
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033741_0026_0FF8F6E4F351C588"/>
tranſlated into French. This work met with the greateſt ſucceſs, and merited it in ſome reſpects; a pure ſtyle, great wit, ſweetneſs and ſentiment, often an enchanting ſtrain of poetry, and the affecting elegant ſimplicity which predominates in the novel of the moor Abindarraes, redeems in the eyes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurs, the improbability of the ſtory, the intervention of magic, and the want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which have been the reproach of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana of Montemayor. Cervantes, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all theſe defects, as may be ſeen from his ſcrutiny of Don Quixotte's library, has, in Galatea, avoided ſome of theſe faults; but not all. His adventures are more natural, his characters more intereſting, but his ſtyle, and above all his poetry, place him below Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temayor.—Infected with the miſerable ſcholaſtic taſte which then prevailed, Cervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes has made his ſhepherds declaim as if in the ſchool, they pronounce long diſſertations for and againſt Love; they cite Minos, Ixion, Antony, Rodriguez and all the heroes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hiſtory: if Tircis wiſhes to conſole
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033741_0027_0FF8F6E737570DA0"/>
his friend who can obtain no mark of favour from his ſhepherdeſs, his ſpeech is to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is allowed by all, that Galatea is ſtill more beautiful than cruel; but they add, that above all, ſhe is diſcreet. Now if this be true, as it ought to be, it follows that by her good ſenſe ſhe ſhould know herſelf, and from this knowledge that ſhe ſhould eſteem herſelf; from this eſteem that ſhe ſhould wiſh not to be loſt, and from this wiſh, that ſhe will not yield to your deſires.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another place, a lover ſeparated from his miſtreſs, ſays in verſe,
<q>Although I ſeem to ſee, to underſtand, and to feel, yet I am only a phantom formed by Love, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Hope.</q>
Through the whole work the ſun only illuminates the world by the light which he receives from the eyes of Galatea. Theſe ſpecimens enable us to form an idea of the bad taſte which formely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and from which even Cervantes was not free. But in the midſt of theſe follies,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033741_0028_0FF8F6E8DB920F48"/>
we find beautiful ideas, true ſentiment, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expreſſed, intereſting ſituations, the emotions and agitations of the heart. Theſe were what induced me to give an imitation of his Galatea; it has never been tranſlated, this romance is utterly unknown to the French.</p>
                  <p>As it is very poſſible my labours will be unſucceſsful, I muſt, for the honour of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes, enumerate here all the changes which I have made in his work. Galatea, in the original, conſiſts of ſix books, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: theſe I have compriſed in three, and have finiſhed it in a fourth. I have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hardly any part, the verſes in particular, only reſemble the Spaniſh ones in the places quoted. I have only taken the heads of the adventures, I have even changed circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where it has appeared neceſſary; I have added entire ſcenes, as the exchange of crooks in the firſt book; the country feaſt and the ſtory of the doves in the ſecond; and the farewell to Elicio's dog in the third; the fourth is entirely my own invention. I ſhall
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033741_0029_0FF8F6EDF6ACBFF8"/>
no doubt, be reproached with the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of epiſodes, and the few events in which Galatea is concerned. In Cervantes, there are twice as many epiſodes, and Galatea does ſtill leſs. Montemayor has committed the ſame fault in Diana, which is in fact, nothing but a recital of different hiſtories; ſuch was the taſte of the times. Such are our great French romances, ſo long the faſhion, where the authors took the Spaniards for their models, as to battles and duels, which one will be perhaps aſtoniſhed to find in a paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral work; it is a tribute which Cervantes paid to his nation. I know no Spaniſh ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or comedy without combats; this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, one of the moſt valiant in Europe, and without diſpute, the moſt amorous, required in a book to pleaſe them, recitals of Love and War. Finally, we ought to pardon Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes, who himſelf met with adventures, the moſt extraordinary, for ſuppoſing that what had happened to himſelf would appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in a romance.</p>
                  <p>I have but one word more to ſay on the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033741_0030_0FF8F6EFB3F57BB0"/>
judgement which I have preſumed to paſs on the works of Cervantes. Notwithſtanding the particular ſtudy I made of his language, I reſted not entirely on my own knowledge; but I have been guided by the information of a Spaniard, who is as much devoted to literature, as to his country, and who has this in common with Cervantes, that he is ſtill more celebrated for his talents than for his misfortunes<note n="*" place="bottom">The Count De Pilos.</note>.</p>

                  <p>Long had he loved Galatea, without being able as yet to flatter himſelf that he was beloved of her. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latea was a ſimple ſhepherdeſs of the ſame village as Elicio; but ſhe had been queen of the world, if the world had been given to the moſt beautiful, and moſt deſerving.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Galatea and Elicio, whoſe adventures I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relate. I ſhall join to theſe ſome others, of whoſe conſtancy love was willing to make trial; and I ſhall alſo deſcribe the manners of a village. Oh! ye whoſe chief pleaſures are centered in a country life; ſouls of ſenſibility! to whom the aſpect of laughing fields, and the noiſe of falling waters afford delights equal almoſt to what are felt in doing of good actions; may you be able to find ſome pleaſure in peruſing me!</p>
                  <p>Of all the ſhepherds who were in love with Galatea, Elicio was the moſt tender, and leaſt confident. Nor was his reſpect alone the ſole cauſe of his timidity; Meoris the father of Galatea was the richeſt huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033741_0034_0FF8F6F9831C3808"/>
in the canton; while all the wealth of Elicio was his cottage, and a few goats.</p>
                  <p>Eraſtres his rival was leſs poor, without being more happy. Eraſtres, ever the moſt inſenſible of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, had not been able however to reſiſt the charms of Galatea; but he did not flatter himſelf that he could be pleaſing to her. Too ſimple to be amiable, he could feel, but he knew not how to expreſs himſelf. Nature in forming him had been content with giving him a good heart.</p>
                  <p>One day as Elicio in a ſolitary dale was thinking of her whom he loved, he ſaw Eraſtres appear, preceded by his flock, which he left the conducting of to his dogs. Theſe faithful animals ſeemed as if they gueſſed that their maſter was too much in love to mind his ſheep. Their attention ſeemed to be doubled. They ran round them, preſſed on the lazy ones, led back thoſe that were rambling from their fellows; thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time their own duty and that of the ſhepherd.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Eraſtres was near Elicio, I hope, ſaid he to him, that you are not ſad, becauſe I am in love with Galatea. You know that it is impoſſible not to love her. May my lambs in the moment that I wean them find nothing in their paſtures but poiſonous herbs, if it be not true that a thouſand times I have been tempted to forget my love. I have conſulted all the doctors in the country, yet none of them have been able to cure me; and I come to aſk your leave to retain my malady to my death. You will riſque nothing in granting me this favour, ſince you who are the moſt engaging of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033741_0035_0FF8F6FD965A1F48"/>
all our ſhepherds, have not been able to move Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea to pity, what have you to fear from a clown like me?</p>
                  <p>Elicio ſmiled at this diſcourſe. My friend, ſaid he, I have no right to be jealous. Our ſorrows are the ſame, and they ought to endear us to each other. From this moment we will ſeparate no more; we will talk unceaſingly of Galatea, and friendſhip, without doubt, will help to aſſuage the pains that love cauſes us to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>The two rivals now become friends, were preparing their pipes to play, when Galatea with her flock ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon the hill. A ſimple bodice, and a petticoat of plain ſtuff, compoſed the whole of her attire. Her ſhape alone rendered this habit charming. Her long light hair floated on her ſhoulders, and a ſtraw hat guarded her face from the ardour of the ſun. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adorned as the ſimple flowers of the field, ſhe was beautiful and ſhe knew it not.</p>
                  <p>Elicio advanced to ſpeak to her, but the dogs of Galatea, who let no perſon approach the flock, ran growling towards the ſhepherd. Scarcely had they recollected him, when aſhamed of their ill behaviour, they ſtooped down their necks, dropt their tails, and went to hide their heads under his careſſing hands. The conducting ram with whom Elicio had often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his bread, perceived him, and came up to him with his head erect, and bell ringing, all the ſheep fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. Elicio opened for them his ſcrip, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the dogs, and to the flock all that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, while tears of joy ran from his eyes. The ſhepherdeſs embarraſſed thus, at ſeeing the ſheep know
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033741_0036_0FF8F702C7633470"/>
her lover ſo well, bluſhed, and haſting to the ram, ſtruck him with her crook, and obliged him to remove from Elicio.</p>
                  <p>The ſhepherd reproached her for this movement of anger; why, ſaid he, puniſh your ſheep when it is me that you wiſh to puniſh. Theſe paſtures are the beſt in the canton; you have power to fly me; but leave here your lambs, and I will neglect my goats to take care of them;—if this favour ſeems too great, chooſe the place where you would wiſh to paſs the day, and I will remove myſelf, becauſe it will be more agreeable to you: Elicio, ſaid Galatea, it is not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void you that I turn my ſheep another way I am lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the brook of palm-trees, where I expect to meet my dear Floriſe;—I am grateful to you for your offers; and I prove it to you by diſſipating your ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions. While ſhe was ſtill ſpeaking, ſhe purſued her way. Eraſtres cried out to her from far, May you yet fall in love with ſome one who will treat you with as little pity as you treat us; May you. . . . he would have ſaid more if Galatea had not began to ſing, as her cuſtom was, whenever ſhe moved with her flock. The moſt angry lover would rather liſten to the voice of his miſtreſs, than ſay injurious things to her; Eraſtres was ſilent, and Galatea ſung theſe words:—</p>

                  <p>Galatea had finiſhed her ſong juſt as ſhe had arrived at the rivulet of palm-trees. Floriſe was already there, her beſt friend, the confident of her moſt ſecret thoughts. They ſat down together upon the borders of the brook, and employed themſelves in gathering the ſurrounding flowers; when they perceived a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs who was unknown to them. This ſtranger, young and beautiful, ſeemed overwhelmed with grief; from time to time ſhe ſtopped, ſighed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>oked up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o heaven, with her eyes ſwimming in tears. Too much occupied with her ſorrows, to perceive Galatea, ſhe approached the brook, took up ſome of the water in her hands, and waſhed her eyes wearied with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Alas! ſaid ſhe, there is no water able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the fire that conſumes me.</p>
                  <p>Galatea and Floriſe ran towards the ſtranger; If Heaven, ſaid they to her, is as much touched with your tears as we are, you would very ſoon have no cauſe to ſhed them; we pity your misfortunes, even though
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033741_0038_0FF8F7074DBE20A0"/>
we do not know them; how often are they aſſuaged by recounting them! a ſatisfaction of that ſort you might feel, by pouring them into our boſoms; yet it would be cruel to demand a recital of what might be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your heart. This recital, replied the ſtranger, will perhaps deprive me of the friendſhip which you ſeem to promiſe me; when you are informed that all my ſorrows ſpring from love; may I hope that you will ſtill pity me? The ſhepherdeſſes, after having aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in the tendereſt manner of their freindſhip, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her into a neighbouring grove—they ſat down in the ſhade, and after a pauſe of a few moments, the ſtranger began her hiſtory:</p>
                  <p>"I was born in a village, ſituated on the banks of the Henares, celebrated for the freſhneſs, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its waters; my father is a farmer, and my life was occupied ſolely in country employments; every morning I led my ſheep to their paſtures, frequently alone, yet ſolitude never weared me. In the woods I liſtened delighted to the birds, I ſung with them; I gathered the red roſe, the lilly without ſpot, and the pink of various dye; this amuſement rendered the day happy, I loved nothing ſo well as my lambs, and I fought for nothing in the country, but flowers and the cool ſhade.</p>
                  <p>"How many times have I laughed at the ſighs and tears of ſome of our ſheperdeſſes, who have made me the confident of their loves? I remember that one day the young Lydia came, and throwing herſelf upon my neck, bathed me with her tears. Alarmed at her deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, I wiped her eyes, and embracing her, enquired

                     </gap> ingrate. I declare to you, amiable ſhepherdeſſes, that I could not hinder myſelf from laughing at this recital, every word of which was cut ſhort with ſighs. Lydia was offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe looked at me, bowed her head, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I would have detained her: Teolinda, ſaid ſhe to me, may you one day feel the ſorrows that I now ſuffer, and experience in your confidents the ſame pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I find in you! Such was her wiſh, perhaps it is you, ſhepherdeſſes, who will accompliſh it this day.</p>
                  <p>"Thus did I live, careleſs, free and happy; but I was not to be long ſo:—One day, it was the vigil of the patron ſaint of our village, I had gone with many other girls to get green boughs, and gather flowers to ornament our church; we found on our way, a troop of ſhepherds, ſitting under the ſhade of myrtles; they were all our friends or relations, and had come out before us, ſix of them requeſted that they might go in our place, to get the green boughs and flowers, which we wanted, we accepted their offer, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reſt of their companions.</p>
                  <p>"Among theſe young people, was a ſtranger, whom I then ſaw for the firſt time. Scarcely had I beheld him, when I felt a fire run through my veins that was unknown to me before, I doubted what it could be, Lydia was there, I thought to have fallen at her feet,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033741_0040_0FF8F70B2BC50848"/>
and aſked forgiveneſs for not having compaſſionated in her, the pains that I already felt.</p>
                  <p>"It was eaſy to read in my face all that paſſed in my heart; but every one was occupied with the ſtranger. They begged of him to finiſh a ſong, which our arrival had interrupted; he agreed, and I trembled, leſt love ſhould be the ſubject; if he be in love, ſaid I to myſelf, he will not think of any thing but love; happily he ſung only the pleaſures of a country life, and the means of preſerving flocks, he ſaid nothing of that, which cauſes the death of ſhepherdeſſes.</p>
                  <p>"Scarcely had he finiſhed, when we ſaw thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, who had gone to cut the green branches; they were ſo loaden, that walking in a line, and linked cloſely together, one would have believed they ſaw a little hill approach, covered with its own trees. When they came near to us, they began a village round, to which we reſponded; ſoon after they laid down their burdens, and offered each ſhepherdeſs a garland of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of flowers. We accepted their preſents, and began to prepare to return to the village; when the oldeſt amongſt them, named Eleuco, ſtopped us: I think, ſaid he, that each of you ought to recompence us for our pains, by giving her garland to him that ſhe loves beſt; that is but juſt, ſaid one of my companions, at the ſame time putting her garland on the head of her couſin; the others followed her example, and every one made choice of a relation. I remained for the laſt, and by good fortune, I had no couſin there.</p>

                  <p>"The ſtranger received my favours with gratitude and modeſty; he ſeized the inſtant when no one could hear him, to ſay to me in a low voice, I have paid you very dear for the garland I have received: you have given me nothing but flowers; and I, I, . . . . . he could not finiſh, for my companions came up, and preſſed me to depart. I anſwered nothing, but I kept my eyes on the ſtranger, as long as it was poſſible; he occupied my thoughs all the way, and when I go home, I could only think of him.</p>

At length I ſaid to him, Artidore the few days you have given us, muſt appear to you as ſo many years, if you have left in your village any one that is dear to you; I would give all that I poſſeſs,

In the evening my ſiſter returned, and told me with an air of myſtery, that ſhe had ſomething to ſay to me of importance; my heart beat violently, already I had a foreboding of my misfortune, I went and ſhut myſelf up with her; judge what my thoughts were, when I heard her ſpeak theſe words:—</p>
                  <p>"This morning, my dear ſiſter. I was conducting the flocks to the banks of the Henares, when I ſaw a young ſhepherd approach me whom I had never ſeen before; he ſaluted me, and took my hand with a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which both ſurpriſed and offended me, neither my ſilence, nor the alteration which he ſaw in my countenance, was capable of ſtopping his tranſports. Alas! ſaid he to me, beautiful Teolinda, do you no longer remember him who loves you better than he does himſelf. I ſaw very clearly my ſiſter, that I was taken for you, and not being willing that ſo forward a ſhepherd as he ſhould have your reputation in his power, and ſo be capable of injuring you; I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to releaſe you for ever, from this impertinent. I took care not to let him know that he deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and aſſuming that ſtyle and manner that Teolinda ought always to have, I replied to his words with an
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033741_0047_0FF8F72451A5E608"/>
haughtineſs and diſdain that did not fail to aſtoniſh and confound him; but all this was neceſſary for your juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, my dear ſiſter, and fortunately for you, my words made a proper impreſſion on him, he looked wildly on me, upbraided me, called me perfidious and ungrateful;—and, as he left me, I think he ſaid ſomething . . . as if you were never to ſee him more!</p>
                  <p>"You may eaſily conceive, amiable ſhepherdeſſes, what I ſuffered during this recital; I would have given the half of my life that it was morning, that I might fly and undeceive my unhapy lover. Ah! what a night for me, how long did it appear!—The ſtars were yet glittering in the Heavens, when I was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the fields; never had my poor ſheep walked ſo faſt before; I haſtened to the ſpot where I had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to meet my Artidore; I ſeek him, I call him, I run over the fields, the woods, and the banks of the river; but I cannot find Artidore! Return, cried I, my beloved, come and behold the true Teo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, ſhe who only lives for to love you. Echo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated my words, but Artidore came not.

I will follow him: yes, (ſaid ſhe, burſting into tears) I will follow thee, my Artidore to the grave:—it is my laſt hope."</p>
                  <p>Such was the recital of Teolinda.

                  <p>The ſun was now ſet, and the ſhepherdeſſes collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſcattered flocks, to lead them to the village; but ſcarcely had they got half way, when Galatea perceived that ſhe had left her crook behind her, ſhe begged of Floriſe and the ſtranger to take care of her ſheep, while ſhe returned alone to ſeek it; ſhe ſoon ſaw through the trees an old ſhepherd, named Lenio, ſitting in the place where ſhe had been, and holding in his hands, the crook that ſhe had come to look for.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame inſtant, Elicio returning to his cottage with his little flock of goats, paſſed that way, and knowing the crook of Galatea, he ſtopped and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Lenio, with an aſtoniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Where did you get that crook? ſaid Elicio, with a

quick voice. I found it here, by chance, ſaid the old ſhepherd, and I intend it for Beliſe, who will hardly refuſe ſo handſome a preſent; I wiſh, ſaid Elicio, that the heart of Beliſe may be ſoftened to tenderneſs by the gift of that crook; but mine is ſtill more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; ſee how the bark, neatly raiſed, ſeems to form a branch of ivy that curls round it, I would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, however, to change it for the one you hold; —you muſt then, ſaid Lenio, give me alſo the beſt of your goats in exchange.—Ah! I agree, I have but ſix, you ſee them here, chooſe which of them that pleaſes you moſt. The old ſhepherd, had no great trouble in deciding of the ſix goats of Elicio; one only was near yeaning, and it was that which he choſe. Elicio, tranſported with joy, gave him the goat, changed the crook, and embraced him with all his heart. The two ſhepherds, equally ſatisfied, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and Galatea, penſive and muſing, flowly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Floriſe and the ſtranger; they aſked her, what news of her crook? ſome one has taken it, replied the ſhepherdeſs, but I do not regret it.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, the ſhades of Night began to darken the mountains; the birds aſſembled together, under the thick foliage, diſputed with a confuſed murmur, the branch where they were to ſpend the night.

There ſhould my happy days glide peaceably away; every moment of my time ſhould be occupied in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, or in rural employments.—I would have beſides, ſomething to live on, and alſo ſomething to give away; for without this, riches are nothing; to have only for one's ſelf, is having nothing.

A happy marriage generally crowned a virtuous attachment. Daranio, the beloved of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veria, was now to become her huſband. At the firſt dawn of the morning, all the inhabitants of the village, and of the neighbouring hamlets, were already aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the public green. Some had made garlands to ornament the doors of the bride and bridegroom; others with flutes and tamborines uſhered in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, with joyful melody; here was heard the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pipe; there the harmonious violin; and farther off, the antique pſaltery. One was employed in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ribbands to his caſtanets; another ornamenting his hat with bunches of flowers.—Every one was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to pleaſe his miſtreſs; all were animated with Love and Joy.</p>
                  <p>The bride and bridegroom did not wait long. They were ſoon diſcovered, coming decked out in their gayeſt apparel; Galatea and the young girls conducted Sylveria;—and Elicio and the ſhepherds ſurrounded Daranio. The happy troop took their way to the church, amidſt the ſound of all the inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>After they had vowed an eternal fidelity, the new married couple returned to the village green, and all the young women ran to ſeek for the preſents which they had deſtined for the bride;—One came and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sylveria, a baſket of fruits; another carried in her hat, eggs that her pullets had newly laid—here one preſented a pullet, another a young cock; every one without regret, and without vanity, made an offering proportionable to their riches.</p>

In ſaying theſe words, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her turtles, Sylveria ſtretched out her hands to receive them, Galatea opened hers. The birds profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moment, eſcaped, and as they ſhot ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the air, bruſhed lightly with their wings, the faces of the ſhepherdeſſes. Sylveria was ſurpriſed and Galatea almoſt ſorrowful; they followed them with their eyes till they had loſt ſight of them; they then looked at each other without ſaying a word, while ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one laughed, except Galatea.</p>
                  <p>Elicio approached her, and ſaid with a low voice, theſe birds have puniſhed you for the little care you took in not keeping them; but they will ſoon wiſh to come back to you again; and I dare anſwer for it, that they will ſoon return to you. I do not, ſaid Galatea, reckon much upon that; but I ſhall conſole myſelf if they are more happy by being free;—and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe went to her ſheep-fold, to ſeek a beautiful lamb, that replaced her doves.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt they were thus offering their preſents, a number of tables were laid out covered with all ſorts of meats, under the thick foliage of the trees. Daranio

                  <p>That nothing might be wanting to this rural treat, no ſooner was the repaſt ended, than Daranio propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a paſtoral conteſt.

                  <p>"I was at that time ill, and in no condition to follow my friend; our parting was mixed with many tears: I promiſed to follow him, as ſoon as my health would permit me; but I ſoon found that the abſence of my friend was more inſupportable to me, even than my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033741_0063_0FF8F74DF489E7C8"/>
and learning that there were four gallies at Cadiz, ready to ſail for Italy, I reſolved to embark. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip gave me that ſtrength which my ſlow recovery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me. I went on board, the wind ſeconded my wiſhes, and in a few days, I arrived at Naples.</p>
                  <p>"It was night when I landed, and as I croſſed a ſtreet, I heard the claſhing of ſwords; I perceived a man with his back againſt the wall, defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſingly againſt four aſſailants. I flew to his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and was ſoon followed by many people, who ſeconded me; this unexpected attack made the four villains take to flight. I ran to the unknown perſon, I ſpoke to him, I looked in his face; it was Timbrio!</p>
                  <p>"I held him in my arms, and ſhed tears of joy; how dear did I pay for this ſweet re-union? my friend was wounded, and the emotion that the ſight of me cauſed in him, exhauſted his ſpirits—he fell into my arms, fainting and bloody.—I ſent inſtantly for ſuccour; a ſurgeon inſpected his wounds, and gave me ſome hopes that they were not mortal. This in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree conſoled me, and Timbrio coming to himſelf, we made an arm chair of our hands, and thus carried to his houſe, my amiable friend.</p>
                  <p>"There it was, that I learned the cauſe of his aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination. Timbrio, on his coming to Naples, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered letters from Spain, to one of the firſt citizens the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ever avowing his love; but an Italian prince, who was in love with Niſida, ſuſpected he had a rival, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the valour, as much as the merits of Timbrio, he was baſe and cowardly enough to attempt having him aſſaſſinated.</p>
                  <p>"This adventure ſoon ſpread through the city, and came to the ears of Niſida's father; he was enraged that the name of his daughter ſhould be brought in queſtion, and be made a public talk of—and forbad the Italian prince, and my unfortunate friend, ever to come to his houſe again.</p>
                  <p>"This denial was worſe to Timbrio than his wounds. Devoured by a paſſion, that obſtacles ſerved only to encreaſe;—in deſpair, not to have declared it when it was in his power, he reſolved to ſee Niſida again, at whatever price it was to be obtained; every means ſeemed eaſy to him, and in the end, was found to be impoſſible. He wrote a thouſand letters, and tore them all again; one impracticable project ſucceeded to another with rapidity in his mind; ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes and vexations, ſerved only to inflame his wounds. My friend was very ſoon in danger; I was reſolved, if poſſible, to ſave him, and to introduce myſelf into the houſe of his miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>"I dreſſed myſelf as a captive newly redeemed, and taking a guitar in my hand, I walked every evening in the ſtreet where Niſida dwelt, ſinging old romances. I paſſed for a Spaniard, redeemed from the hands of the Infidels.</p>
                  <p>"In a little time, there was nothing talked of in that quarter, but the captive muſician, inſomuch that Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſida's father wiſhed to hear my romances; on which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033741_0065_0FF8F7559EB28540"/>
account, I was admitted into his houſe. It was there I beheld this Niſida, it was there that I loſt the repoſe and the happineſs of my life.—I had the temerity to view this celeſtial countenance, this charming ſhape, theſe eyes full or tenderneſs, whoſe brightneſs was tempered by a ſlight ſhade of Melancholy;—I felt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the poiſon of Love run in all my veins, it was neceſſary to fly, but I had not the power; and this ſingle moment made me as bad as Timbrio.</p>
                  <p>"They entreated me to ſing, and I was ſcarce able to ſpeak; I however obeyed, and choſe a romance that a Perſian ſlave had taught me.</p>
                  <p>Here all the ſhepherds begged that he would let them hear this romance. He took his harp, and with a ſoft voice, ſung theſe words:—</p>

She praiſed my voice to a great degree, I thanked her, with my eyes fixt upon her ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>"Their father entreated me to come again; I heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a long time; I debated with myſelf often, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould avail myſelf of this permiſſion. I was certain of adding ſtrength to a diſorder, that tore my heart in pieces; but anxious for my friend, and drawn on by my love, I returned to the houſe of Niſida; I ſaw her again, and all hope of a cure was removed from me for ever.</p>
                  <p>"Judge of the conflicts, that agonized my heart. I loved Timbrio more than my life, and I loved Niſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, perhaps, more than Timbrio; I ſaw her every day, and was incapable of flying from her, even for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of my friend. This dear friend, weak and ſlowly recovering from his illneſs, could not ſuſtain himſelf, but for my tender cares and aſſiduities.</p>
                  <p>"But Time, far from aſſuaging my miſeries, only added to my unhappineſs;—every inſtant redoubled my paſſion, my remorſe, and my torments; my health was no longer proof againſt theſe diſtreſſes, my face ſoon loſt the freſhneſs of youth; my ſunk and languid eyes could ſcarce turn themſelves on her, for whom I was thus dying. At length, the father of Niſida ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his inquietude about me;—ſhe herſelf, and above all, her ſiſter Blanche begged of me one day, with the moſt tender ſolicitude, to open my heart to them and diſcloſe without reſerve, all its ſorrows and pains. What a moment for me! but I ſtrengthened
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033741_0068_0FF8C1924B008740"/>
my ſoul, I recalled to my mind, all that I owed to my friend, and reſolved to expire, rather than betray him, and I ſummoned up all my reſolution to ſay theſe words:</p>
                  <p>"You will pity my ſorrows ſtill more, when I tell you, that they are cauſed by Friendſhip;—A young cavalier, my countryman, and boſom friend, is in love with the moſt beautiful, and moſt amiable of women; he reſpects her ſo much, that he fears ever to mention his paſſion to her, and this reſpect is, in fact, cutting ſhort his life. It is him that I weep.—It is the moſt generous and the moſt accompliſhed of men, that Love is bringing to an early grave.</p>
                  <p>"At this place, Niſida interrupted me. Fabian, ſaid ſhe, I have never known Love, but it appears to me to be ſimplicity to die, rather than tell a woman, that one loves her; the firſt avowal of it would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhould think, to offend her; but even ſuppoſing that it wras badly received, there are always opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities enough found for dying. Beautiful Niſida, ſaid I, when one looks on love with the eyes of indifference, they ſee nothing in it, but the playfulneſs of children, which they laugh at, or at beſt but pity: but when the heart is wounded, the underſtanding, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of uſe to us, is the firſt to lead us aſtray.—Such is the ſtate of my friend; by dint of intreaties and prayers, I got him to write to the object of his affection; I am charged with this letter, and I carry it always about me, in hopes of being able to deliver it. Could not one ſee this letter, ſaid Niſida, for I am, I confeſs, curious to know the ſtyle of a lover, who is truly ſmitten?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033741_0069_0FF8F760CE1B82E0"/>"I did not let ſo good an occaſion as this eſcape me. I drew from my boſom the billet that Timbrio had given me, a few days before; it was conceived in theſe terms:—</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I had determined, madam, never to have broken ſilence, happier in the thought of having in death deſerved your pity, rather than live under your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: but it was too terrible to live, and not let you know that I adore you. If this avowal ſhould not offend you, I feel that I ſhall ſtill che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh life, to conſecrate it to you; but ſhould my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity appear to you worthy of puniſhment, my death ſhall ſoon expiate my offence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Niſida read this letter with great attention. I do not think, ſaid ſhe, that a declaration ſo reſpectful as this, can diſpleaſe; and I adviſe you to deliver the billet, without being apprehenſive that it will be badly received.—As yet I have had no opportunity, ſaid I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but my friend, in the mean time, is dying, and I think, that you have it in your power to ſave his life;—How is it poſſible?—Do you reply to this bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, as if it was addreſſed to you; this innocent device will reſtore him to new life, and will give me time to find the occaſion that I ſo ardently wiſh for. No, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Niſida, I have never as yet returned anſwers to love-letters; and I would not wiſh to begin now by a deceit.—But ſaid ſhe, after a moment's pauſe, what is to hinder you from letting your friend know all that has now happened; ſubſtituting the name of her whom he loves, in the place of mine? You may tell him that ſhe has read his letter, that ſhe had preſſed you to give it to her: that in fact you durſt not tell
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033741_0070_0FF8F765ED422A98"/>
her that the billet was for herſelf; but that you had, nevertheleſs, room to hope that ſhe will yet hear of it, without anger. This ſtratagem will be of uſe to the health of your friend, and cannot be contradicted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you have ſpoken to his real miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>"Surpriſed at this invention, I ſtammered out ſome expreſſions of thanks, and I ran to report every thing to Timbrio; the hopes which he conceived, his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and his gratitude, were ſo many links, that chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſtill more to my duty.</p>
                  <p>"I redoubled my attentions towards Niſida, and tho' the prey of a paſſion, which her ſight could not fail but to encreaſe; I never ſpoke to her but of my friend. I employed for him the expreſſions which my heart furniſhed me with for myſelf; and thus I made ſubſervient to the cauſe of Friendſhip, that very feeling, which might have deſtroyed it.</p>
                  <p>"At length, I took the reſolution to acquaint her of every thing. I told her that the perſon who was ſo near dying for her, was Timbrio. I extolled his birth, dwelt on his good qualities, and his virtues; and in a word, I painted him as I ſaw him. Niſida had not forgotten him, ſhe expreſſed a ſurpriſe, true or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reproached me with my preſumption, menacing me, to tell all to her father;—but acroſs the anger that ſhe forced herſelf to aſſume, I ſaw clearly that Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio was beloved.</p>
                  <p>"This was the laſt ſtroke for me; a long time I had waited for it, yet it was not ſenſibly felt when it came. I reſolved to let Timbrio know his good fortune, and then to fly immediately afterwards, and die in a deſert.</p>
                  <p>"I reckoned, however, too much on my courage;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033741_0071_0FF8F76A27D3A5F0"/>
the moment that I undertook to ſay to my rival that he was beloved, I loſt the power of ſpeech, my eyes filled with tears, vainly would I have hid my trouble; my ſighs betrayed me, my ſtrength failed, and I fell upon the boſom of my friend, and bathed him with my tears.</p>
                  <p>"Timbrio, ſurpriſed and terrified, ſupported me in his arms, embraced me with tenderneſs, nor would he be ſatisfied without knowing the cauſe of ſo keen an affliction. I was ſilent, he preſſed me, unable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I threw my eyes down on the ground. Ah! I underſtand you, ſaid he, you love her! you love her! 'twas not poſſible but that you muſt have loved her; thy faithful heart groans under the ſacrifice it would make to thy friendſhip. O my Fabian, I ſhould be indeed unworthy, if I accepted of her. Continue to love Niſida, for I will never ſee her more; I ſhall, perhaps, be able to live without her, but I ſhould be certain of dying, were I the cauſe of thy unhappineſs. In ſaying theſe words, he turned away his face to hide his tears, while he preſſed me againſt his boſom.</p>
                  <p>"Friendſhip inſpired me in this moment, I felt as it were lift above myſelf. You are miſtaken, replied I, it is not Niſida that I love, it is her ſiſter, whoſe heart I have not been able to touch, and the violence of an unrequited love, is the ſole cauſe of my deſpair. You deceive me, Fabian, ſaid he, looking ſtedfaſtly in my face. No, my dear Timbrio, I adore Blanche, but ſhe deſpiſes my vows, pardon me then, if the compariſon of thy happy ſtate with mine, draw ſome tears from me. I promiſe you, however, that I ſhall weep no
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033741_0072_0FF8F76C795E5B08"/>
more. Go, my friend, I feel, that while near you, my happineſs does not depend upon Love.</p>
                  <p>"Timbrio, either did, or feigned to believe me; he was reſolved, however, to aſſure himſelf of the truth of what I ſaid, the firſt opportunity that he had, but I had determined myſelf, to make every ſacrifice neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his quiet. It was not enough, that I ſhould immolate my real paſſion; it was neceſſary that I ſhould feign to feel another. The very next day I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Blanche who I was, and ſpoke to her of Love.</p>
                  <p>"Blanche had loved me for a long time, without dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avow it, even to herſelf; but no ſooner did ſhe believe herſelf beloved, than ſhe told it to her ſiſter; this confidence became uſeful to Timbrio. Niſida had ſtill oppoſed a ſentiment that ſhe dreaded, leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid in finding a companion, ſhe ventured to give way to it, ſhe ſpoke of her love, and was penetrated the more with it. The two ſiſters, in expreſſing their fears, mutually ſtrengthened each other; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that diffuſed itſelf over their ſouls, made them feel more ſenſibly the happineſs of being beloved.</p>
                  <p>"By favour of my diſguiſe, I preſerved a free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into the houſe. I conſtantly carried the letters of my friend; and I procured him the pleaſure of ſeeing his miſtreſs. While thus I continued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double all my attentions to Blanche, Timbrio remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with joy, how well I was beloved, felicitated me, holding me in his arms, ſwore never to eſpouſe Niſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, until that day that I ſhould become the huſband of her ſiſter; I bowed my head, reſigned to every thing that Friendſhip ſhould ordain for me.</p>
                  <p>"We waited now for nothing but news from Spain,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033741_0073_0FF8F76F5DED8F60"/>
to demand the hands of Blanche and Niſida in form; when Pranſil, the cavalier, who had the quarrel with Timbrio at Xeres, arrived at Naples, to fight with him.</p>
                  <p>"The nature of the quarrel was ſuch, as to render a public reparation neceſſary. The Viceroy's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to be obtained, and Judges appointed; in fine, all things were fixed, and this terrible combat was to take place in eight days from that time, in a large plain, at a little diſtance from the city.</p>
                  <p>"The news of this made a great noiſe, and ſpread it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf far and near; in ſpite of our utmoſt precautions, it reached the ear of Niſida. Her inquietude and grief was as keen as her love was ardent, a prey to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſorrow, ſhe paſſed in tears, and without nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the eight days of delay, which ſeemed to her ſo long, and yet—ſo ſhort; a frightful incertitude, more cruel even than the misfortune ſhe ſo much dreaded, ſoon exhauſted her ſtrength, ſhe fell ill; and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ignorant of the cauſe, reſolved, in order to re-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh her health, to bring her to his houſe in the country.</p>
                  <p>"The day of their departure, which was the eve of the combat, Niſida had me called to her; when I came near her bed, ſcarcely could I recollect her, I was ſhocked beyond the power of telling it; I ſaw her that my ſoul doated on, pale and worn away, her long dark eye-laſhes moiſt with tears. Fabian! ſaid ſhe to me, with a weak and feeble voice, you muſt carry my laſt adieus to Timbrio, tell him, that my life is joined to his; and that to-morrow, he has my life to defend. As for you, next to me, his beſt

friend, ſure I am, that you will not quit him; ſhould any miſchance happen, you will be there to ſuccour him. Ah! would to Heaven, that I had the power to be with you alſo—hold, added ſhe, untying from her neck, a precious relique, which ſhe wet with her tears, carry this to him, and tell him that it has ever preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me from dangers of every kind; it is to-morrow, . . . that I expect it to preſerve me indeed. I have ſtill one ſervice more from you. I am going to my father's country-houſe, which is but half a league from the fatal field;—promiſe me, to come there inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let me know the event of the combat; if my Timbrio be the vanquiſher, faſten this white ſcarf upon thy arm, I ſhall ſee it from far, it will ſave me ſome moments of torment.—Should he be overcome —I ſhall want thee no more!—</p>
                  <p>"You may eaſily conceive, my good friends, what I muſt have ſuffered during this interview, I promiſed her every thing ſhe aſked. I ran to Timbrio, it elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hopes; it redoubled his ardor; he kiſſed it, laid it next to his heart, it raiſed him out of himſelf; ſure of being invincible, he would have defied the univerſe.</p>
                  <p>"At length the moment arrived, the whole city of Naples were already upon the field of battle. Pranſil and Timbrio preſented themſelves, they choſe for weapons, the ſword and poiguard. The barrier is opened, the trumpets ſound, and the two enemies ruſh upon each other!</p>
                  <p>"The combat was furious, and for a long time equal. Pranſil was active, ſkilful and valiant; he wounded Timbrio, and Victory hung wavering; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033741_0075_0FF8F77588D006F8"/>
heart beat with anxiety. At length, Love had the advantage. Timbrio ſtruck Pranſil to the ground, no ſooner was he down, than my generous friend flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ſword, and ran to aſſiſt him; Pranſil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelf vanquiſhed, and the ſpectators rent the air with their applauſes.</p>
                  <p>"The frightful uncertainty that I had been in for ſo long a time, the grief that I felt, when I ſaw Timbrio wounded, and the ſudden joy that ruſhed upon my heart for his victory, diſturbed my mind ſo much, that I forgot the white ſcarf, and I ran without it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our good fortune to Niſida. Oh! hapleſs maiden, O beauteous Niſida, thy bleſt ſhade, has long ere this, pardoned my cruel inadvertency, and looks with divine compaſſion on the ſorrows of an heart, that never more can feel the bleſſing of a moment's peace. As the moment of the combat approached, the fever burned with double violence in her veins; notwithſtanding her weakneſs, ſhe had herſelf carried up to the higheſt windows of the houſe; there, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by her women, her eyes fixt upon the road, ſhe waited her life or her death; ſhe perceived me; ſaw no white ſcarf, and fell motionleſs into the arms of her ſiſter. At this moment, I arrived, all the houſe were in tears; I preſſed thro' to Niſida, we were prodigal of uſeleſs ſuccours, nothing could reſtore her! I ſaw her eyes faſt ſhut, her mouth open, her lips pale;— then it was, I began to recollect that I was the cauſe of all this ruin, wild with deſpair, I ruſhed out of the houſe, I durſt no more ſee my friend, to whom I was certain of giving his death. Deſolate in mind, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſtracted, I took the firſt road that I found;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033741_0076_0FF8F777C9AE7078"/>
I had not gone far, when I heard a loud voice calling after me to ſtop.—I turned round, it was Felix, the page of Timbrio, who told me to come quickly to his maſter; Felix, ſaid I, thy maſter I ſhall never ſee again; Niſida is dead, and it is I who have killed her. In pronouncing theſe words, I redoubled my ſpeed. I arrive at Gaietta, a veſſel is pulling before the wind, for Spain; I embark, I arrive once more in my native country, where I have taken this habit, which I ſhall now never quit.</p>
                  <p>"You have had, my friends, a faithful recital of my misfortunes. I had hoped to find peace in this hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, alas! I have found nothing but ſolitude. In vain I force myſelf to turn my thoughts to that Great Being, that ought to occupy them intirely. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what I have loſt, purſues me unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. I ſay to myſelf every day, that I ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Niſida and Timbrio, and every day I weep their loſs."</p>
                  <p>The ſhepherds were unable to conſole the hermit; but they joined in his ſorrows. And now the night being far advanced, and the moon at the height of her courſe, the ſhepherds took their leaves of Fabian, and quitting the hermitage, ſoon arrived at the cottage of Elicio; where, after a frugal meal, they ſtretched themſelves upon the ſoft ſkins of goats, to enjoy that reſt which temperance and exerciſe never fail to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
                  <p>When Elicio perceived that his companions were faſt aſleep, he roſe up, and went ſoftly out to execute a project which he had meditated all day.</p>
                  <p>Juſt before his door there was a beautiful cherry-tree,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033741_0077_0FF8F77AB2CB3838"/>
which he had himſelf reared, and which was covered with the fineſt fruit in the country, though yet very young, and the ſtem ſlender, it afforded delicacies to its poſſeſſor; two white doves had choſen it to build in, they had placed their neſt near the top, in a forked part of the tree formed by four branches;—far from diſturbing them, Elicio looked upon it as an happy omen, their coming to build ſo near his cottage; he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carried under the cherry-tree, ears of corn and hemp-ſeed, and even wool for the doves to line the inſide of their neſts with, and that their little ones might lie more ſoft.</p>
                  <p>While Elicio was at the nuptials of Sylveria, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Meoris, came and ſpread his nets over the cherry-tree, took the turtles and carried them inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his maſter's daughter. They were the ſame that Galatea had let eſcape, and Elicio who knew them, had promiſed his ſhepherdeſs that they ſhould return to her again.</p>
                  <p>He was willing to keep his word, he went out of his cottage to ſeize on the father and mother while they were aſleep, and to put them into a cage with their young ones; by the help of a ladder which he laid againſt the chimney of his cottage, he mounted to the higheſt branch, ſtooped his body forward, removed ſoftly the leaves, and ſaw by the light of the moon, the two turtles in the neſt, the head under one wing, and the other wing ſpread out, the better to cover their little ones. They did not waken, and Elicio had no more to do than to take them, but he had not the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; no, ſaid he, dear charming birds, ye ſhall not be deprived of your liberty, you ſhall belong to Galatea
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033741_0078_0FF8F77F93753B50"/>
without being ſlaves; you ſhall live near her, though free to live elſewhere. He deſcended quickly from the ladder, ran to ſeek a ſpade, and coming back to the cherry-tree, he dug a trench round about it, and when it was held only by its bottom roots, he cautiouſly and without the leaſt violence, placed his ſpade horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and cutting the roots, looſened it entirely from the ground; then, he took it in his arms, lifted it ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the trench, and with a ſlow, but firm ſtep, which ſcarcely agitated the branches, he gained the cottage of Galatea.</p>
                  <p>The chamber where ſhe ſlept had a window, that looked into the fields, before this window he laid down his burden, with the utmoſt precaution; the tree ſtood firm and upright, ſupported by the ball of clay which was attached to its roots. Elicio, who had taken care to carry his ſpade with him, dug a hole, ſet his beloved cherry-tree in it, and placed it in ſuch a manner as to have the neſt oppoſite the window, and ſo near, that Galatea by ſtretching out her hand, might be able to careſs the little turtles. Pleaſed with his work, he looked to ſee if he had not diſturbed the doves, they had been juſt awakened, he could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their head, which they had ſtretched out now upon the moſs of their neſt. Pardon me, ſaid he to them, pardon me, gentle birds, if I have diſturbed your ſleep; 'tis for your good, as well as my happineſs, you are now Galatea's; as ſoon as ſhe opens her window, fly upon her ſhoulder, peek at her beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hair, teach your little ones to love and careſs your miſtreſs, when I know that you are near her, I ſhall not regret you; but ſhould a rival ever preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033741_0079_0FF8C194D489B4A8"/>
at this window, Oh! fly away, conſtant birds, come and find me again; when I hear thy melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murmurs on my cottage, I will ſoon join my ſad complaints to thine.</p>
                  <p>The dawn now began to appear, and the ſwallows were already twittering upon the chimney of Galatea when Elicio, with his ſpade on his ſhoulder, took the way to his cottage. He had not gone far, when he heard ſome one walking after him, he looked back, it was Meoris, the father of Galatea. Elicio trembled when he ſaw him, as if had been conſcious of doing a bad action; but Meoris ſoon ſet him at reſt, for he did not even queſtion him as to the reaſon of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſo early in the village.—Elicio, ſaid he to him, I was going to you; I have a ſecret to entruſt you with, and I have a piece of ſervice to demand from you, in which my daughter is nearly concered.—The ſhepherd, full of joy, kiſſed the old man's hands with tranſport.</p>
                  <p>They then retired into a little wood of myrtles, at ſome diſtance from the road.</p>

                  <p>The ſhepherds, alarmed by theſe tender plaints, ran towards Elicio, they found him ſitting beneath a beech, his face bathed in tears. Scarce had he perceived them, when riſing up haſtily, he ran and threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the neck of Eraſtres. My friend, ſaid he, we are going to loſe Galatea; alas! ſhe quits us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever! liſten, added he, looking on Tircis and Damon, to the ſad ſecret that Meoris has this morning made me the confidant of; I am going to repeat it to you, in his own words.</p>
                  <p>"Elicio, ſaid he to me, I owe you the utmoſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the attachment you have ever ſhowed me, and you are the firſt to whom I confide the intended mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of my daughter; I concluded all laſt night, ſhe is to wed a rich Portugueſe, whoſe numerous flocks cover the banks of the Lima; four ſhepherds ſent by the future ſpouſe, are now at my houſe, and to-morrow they depart with Galatea; I know you ever had the affection of a brother for her, and I have therefore made choice of thee, my dear Elicio, and do beſeech you to accompany her to Portugal, to be preſent at her
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033741_0084_0FF8F78CA8489B58"/>
marriage, and to bring me back the certain intelligence of her happineſs."</p>
                  <p>In ſpight of the ſorrow that his diſcourſe overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with, I recovered my voice ſufficiently to reply to him. How! ſaid I, have you been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſeparate yourſelf now in your old age, from your only child? Have you had the heart to condemn her to live far from her father and her friends? Are you very certain that you will not be the cauſe of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery to her, by thus exiling her into a ſtrange land? Do you not think but ſhe will regret . . . . ?—I have founded the heart of my daughter, ſaid Meoris, interrupting me, I have made her acquainted with my intentions: ſhe replied to me with her uſual gentleneſs that ſhe would be always ready to obey me. I diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, even in her countenance a ſlight emotion, the certain mark of that joy, which the moſt ſenſible and modeſt girl feels when ſhe is going to be married. Do not therefore be uneaſy about her unhappineſs, but go and prepare yourſelf for the journey; I expect it from your friendſhip.—Behold, my friends, what Meoris ſaid to me, behold that event, which I dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than death.</p>
                  <p>Tircis, Damon, and above all, Eraſtres, afflicted themſelves with Elicio.—But, ſaid Damon to him, ſince Meoris eſteems and loves you, how comes it that you have never been tempted to make an avowal of your paſſion, and demand Galatea in marriage of him? You do not, ſaid Elicio, know him as well as I do, he has repeatedly declared that his ſon-in-law muſt have wealth equal to what he can give his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If I durſt have ſpoken to him, he would have
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033741_0085_0FF8F78FA62B87B8"/>
believed that it was her fortune I loved, and his friendſhip for me would have been changed into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Meoris is too rich not to be miſtruſtful, and I am too poor to be confident.</p>
                  <p>My friend, ſaid Tircis, do not loſe all hope, let us go and find Galatea, let us know from herſelf if it be true ſhe conſents to marry this Portugueſe, and if, as I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that it will wound her deeply to obey her father, we will endeavour to break this unfortunate marriage. Love and Friendſhip will inſpire us, ſingly they have worked miracles; what will they not do when united?</p>
                  <p>Elicio followed the counſel of Tircis; the four ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds took the road to the fountain of Ardoiſes, where Galatea retired in the extreme heat of the day; they hoped to find her there, nor was their expectation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; the ſhepherdeſs was ſitting near the edge of the water, and in ſo profound a reverie, that ſhe did not perceive the ſhepherds when they approached; her eyes, moiſt with tears, were fixed upon the fountain, her head reclined on one of her hands, with the other the careſſed the dog of Elicio; this dog, that for a long time had been oftener with her than with his maſter. The faithful animal ſat at the feet of Galatea, his head was laid upon her knees, his eyes fixed on hers, and his air ſeemed wiſtfully to demand of her, why he was this day careſſed more than uſual.</p>
                  <p>Elicio made his companions ſtop, that he might enjoy this pleaſing ſight; a ſoft ſatisfaction replaced already the grief that was painted upon his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>Galatea, who believed herſelf alone with the dog, began to ſing theſe words:—</p>

                  <p>The tears that Galatea ſhed, prevented farther ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; Elicio wept alſo, but his were tears of joy; he was no longer maſter of his tranſports, he ran to the ſhepherdeſs, fell upon his knees before her, and ſeizing one of her hands, preſſed it to his lips; Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea thus ſurpriſed, made ineffectual efforts to get away, ſhe perceived that the other ſhepherds were

looking at her, ſhe would have appeared angry, but ſhe could not, ſhe would have fled, but the dog hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her, jumping and running round her, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately careſſing them both—one would have ſaid, that he enjoyed the happineſs which he was procuring to his maſter.</p>
                  <p>Tircis, Damon, and even Eraſtres, beheld this ſcene with tenderneſs, and durſt not approach the two lovers.—Galatea called them to her, made Elicio riſe, and endeavouring to dry up her tears; I can no longer pretend, ſaid ſhe to them, to hide a ſecret my imprudence has betrayed; yes, I regret my country, and I leave, perhaps, my heart in it, but I am not the leſs reſolved to obey my father; the ſacred duty that I owe him will ſupport me in every trial. I conjure you not to double, by your ſorrows, a grief that would be uſeleſs, and above all, not to diſturb a ſolitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary to me, after the avowal I have juſt made.—At theſe words, ſhe bent her ſteps towards the village, leaving the four ſhepherds immoveable with ſurpriſe; the dog of Elicio alone durſt follow her, ſhe perceived him, and would have hindered him by threatening him with her crook, but the dog ſtill fawned at her feet, and the poor Galatea could not bring herſelf either to beat him or drive him away.</p>
                  <p>The four friends ſtaid together, holding council upon the moſt likely manner of breaking this fatal marriage;—Tircis adviſed to have all the ſhepherds of the country aſſembled together, to go in a body, and ſupplicate Meoris not to part with that treaſure which was the pride of them all. Damon was for going to Portugal to menace the future ſpouſe, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033741_0088_0FF8F7968184B7B8"/>
terrify him, ſo that he ſhould of himſelf, renounce Galatea. Elicio inclined to this part; No, no, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the good Eraſtres, who had been as yet ſilent, none of theſe expedients will ſerve any purpoſe but to irritate Meoris; I have a project which will not fail to render every one happy—except myſelf, I have reſolved on it, and will go and inſtantly put it in practice. In ſaying theſe words, he embraced Elicio, and departed.</p>
                  <p>The ſhepherds, who did not reckon much on the invention of ſo ſimple a man as Eraſtres, propoſed to go and conſult the hermit Fabian.—They had already proceeded on their way, when they were met by a cavalier ſuperbly clothed, and mounted on a noble horſe; two ladies on jennets, were by his ſide, and the numerous troop of ſervants which followed, ſhowed them to be perſons of diſtinction;—The ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ſaluted them as they paſſed, the cavalier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned their civility, and ſtopping Elicio—Have the goodneſs, ſhepherd, ſaid he to him, to direct us to ſome convenient place in theſe foreſts, where we may paſs a few hours; the ladies whom you ſee, are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with the heat and the length of the journey, and would be willing to reſt themſelves here. Elicio, who always forgot his own concern in the wiſh to oblige others, conducted them to the fountain of Ardoiſes, which was only a few paces diſtant.</p>

of the two—but perhaps, ſhe would not have had this advantage, but for the deep ſorrow that cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the features of her younger ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Elicio now preſſed his companions to depart for the hermitage, but the cavalier detaining them, ſaid, let me enjoy a little longer the happineſs I feel in meeting with you; it would be my wiſh to live with ſhepherds —What a difference between your happy condition, and that of the inhabitants of towns, Nature has given you for nothing thoſe pleaſures, of which we purchaſe the image. Indolence ſhortens our days; Labour prolongs yours. Deceit, Laſſitude, and perpetual conſtraint is the round we live in. Freedom, Mirth, Content and Sincerity mark your happy lives;—this day I would turn a ſhepherd, if Niſida would become a ſhepherdeſs.</p>
                  <p>At the name of Niſida, Elicio looked at the two women with a countenance expreſſive of ſo much aſtoniſhment, that it was remarked by the cavalier. Pardon me, ſaid Elicio, if the name of Niſida has made ſo viſible an impreſſion on me;—it is not long ſince one of our friends ſhed many tears, in talking to us of Niſida. Have you then, ſaid the cavalier, any ſhepherdeſs who is thus called? No, replied Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, ſhe that I mean is no ſhepherdeſs; ſhe is not even of theſe parts, Naples is her country. How! do you then know? I will explain it to you ſaid Elicio, but firſt tell me if your name be not Timbrio;—and if this young perſon be not Blanche, the ſiſter of Niſida. You have indeed, ſaid the cavalier, mentioned their names. Ah! Fabian, Fabian, what an happy day for you!—Is he then here, cried Blanche, and as ſhe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033741_0090_0FF8F79BB2996268"/>
ſpoke, the paleneſs of her face was inſtantly effaced by a deep and brilliant red.</p>
                  <p>Yes, replied Elicio, he is here, and the miſery of having loſt you, was near putting an end to a life that he has now conſecrated to penitence. Fabian is an hermit, and his hermitage is near this. Let us fly and embrace him, ſaid Timbrio; Blanche, ſtarted up, and inſtantly ſet off without knowing the road ſhe was to take. Niſida leaned on the arm of her lover; and Tircis, Damon and Elicio, guided them towards the hermitage.</p>
                  <p>It was almoſt night when they arrived at the foot of the hill. Timbrio, Niſida, and above all, young Blanche, mounted the hill by the winding path, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever taking breath. When they came to the door of the hermitage, they found it open, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, but could ſee no one in the cell; uneaſy at not finding him there, they were going to call and to run and ſeek him over the hill. The prudent Tircis ſtopped them. Fabian, ſaid he, is without doubt, near this place; but this unhappy friend, who has not even an hope of ever ſeeing you more;—who laments you without ceaſing, would die with joy, ſhould you ſuddenly preſent yourſelves to his view, manage it ſo as to reſtrain your tranſports, and we will find the means to prepare his ſoul to receive a pleaſure which it could not otherwiſe ſuſtain.</p>
                  <p>Every one approved the advice of Tircis, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it was neceſſary to ſend forward the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, that they might announce to Fabian with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, the arrival of thoſe tender friends, that he was once more going to behold again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:033741_0091_0FF8F79D538DBCC0"/>Whilſt they were thus conſulting, Blanche was conſidering, by the light of the moon, the inſide of the cell; a mat of ruſhes, a ſtool and a crucifix of box-wood, was all the furniture that Fabian had. Blanche examined them a long while, ſhe then drew near the crucifix, and throwing herſelf on her knees before it, in a low voice, poured out her thanks to Heaven, for having conducted her to the hermitage.</p>
                  <p>Timbrio and the ſhepherds were regarding with looks of tenderneſs, this affecting ſight; when deep ſighs and the plaintive voice of ſorrow gave them to underſtand that Fabian was not far off: they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the hermit under a wild olive, on his knees, upon the fragment of a rock, his arms ſpread to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. At this ſight, the two ſiſters and Timbrio would have thrown-themſelves upon his neck; Tircis was unable to reſtrain them: but Fabian beginning to pray, they all ſtopped to liſten. Niſida and Timbrio remained with their arms extended forward; Blanche ſcarcely reſpiring, raiſed her head over their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and endeavoured every inſtant to wipe away the tears which prevented her almoſt from ſeeing her lover.</p>
                  <p>God of all mercy, ſaid Fabian, Being Supreme, whom only I ought to love, Thou who filleſt this world, and ſhould fill my heart, be not offended at my tears.—I have loſt all—I do not murmur—Oh! my God, calm the agonies that I ſuffer, but do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from me entirely the remembrance of my misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>When Fabian began his prayer, Blanche wept in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033741_0092_0FF8F6A1169E4880"/>
ſilence; but at the laſt words, ſhe cried aloud. Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, fearing that ſhe would be heard, deſired Damon to go with Elicio, and interrupt the hermit,—while he remained with Timbrio and the two ſiſters, to hinder them from ſhowing themſelves too ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>The two ſhepherds obeyed, Fabian received them with kindneſs: you complain always, ſaid Elicio, and your misfortunes perhaps draw to a concluſion. You are acquainted with them, replied the hermit, judge then if they can ever end; without doubt they might, ſaid Elicio; you ſaw Niſida under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of death, but you are not ſure that ſhe was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead.—What if ſhe were alive? Ah! impoſſible. On the contrary, replied Elicio, I heard this day, that ſhe and her ſiſter, together with Timbrio, have been unceaſingly occupied in ſearching all Spain, in hopes of finding you. What ſay you? are you very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this is my friend? that theſe are the two ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!—Ah! do not ſport with an unfortunate, have pity on my ſorrows, and do not come to agitate me, by abuſing me with a falſe hope.</p>
                  <p>As he ſaid theſe words, Tircis ſpoke to Niſida, and adviſed her if ſhe could recollect any ſong, to ſing it in the place where ſhe then ſtood, without as yet, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering herſelf to the eyes of the hermit.</p>
                  <p>Niſida followed his counſel, and began the firſt couplet of a ſong that Fabian had formerly made.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Friendſhip, thy empire now regain,</l>
                     <l>O'er the blind god of lovers reign:</l>
                     <l>He pleaſes but while life's in prime,</l>
                     <l>But thou mak'ſt happy every time.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:033741_0093_0FF8F7A29E0695A0"/>
                     <l>He gives birth to ardent fires,</l>
                     <l>But gentle ties thy breath inſpires:</l>
                     <l>He is the ſoul's delicious pleaſure,</l>
                     <l>But thou its beſt, its ſureſt treaſure.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Fabian was yet ſpeaking, when the voice of Niſida ſtruck his ears; he ſtopped, he liſtened, he remains immoveable! his eyes are fixed and his mouth open, preſently looking with a wild air, his reaſon abandons him; terror is painted on his face, he takes the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds for phantoms, and views them with affright! In the mean time, the voice continued, it penetrated to the bottom of his ſoul. By little and little his fears are diſſipated, his features regain their ſweetneſs, his eyes recover their ſoftneſs; he comes to himſelf, darts like an arrow to the place from whence the voice came, and fell motionleſs into the arms of his friend.</p>
                  <p>Niſida and Timbrio call out, the ſhepherds ran to them, they are all anxiouſly employed in endeavouring to bring him to life; Blanche had already flown to ſeek for water in his cell, ſhe threw it on his face, ſhe held his hands in hers, <q>And viewed him with all the mingled agonies of hopes and fears.</q>
At length he recovers his ſenſes, he opens his eyes, but is ſtill doubtful of his good fortune. Is it you then indeed? ſaid he to Timbrio, is it you whom I have wept and ſorrowed for ſo long? Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is me, it is thy friend, who owes his life to thee. They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each other, they mingle their tears together, and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033741_0094_0FF8F7A439C28B78"/>
remain a long time locked in each other's arms. No more of grief, ſaid Timbrio to him, we are all re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: behold Niſida thy good friend, and Blanche, who would have died if we had not found thee.—What more could you deſire? Ah! nothing, replied the hermit ſmiling, and weeping at the ſame time. Blanche and Niſida held out their arms to him; Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would have ſpoken, but he made vain efforts; he took the hands of the two ſiſters, and joining them both together on his breaſt, fell on his knees, and bathed their hands with his tears.</p>
                  <p>After this tender ſcene, Fabian led his friends into his cell, and there gave them a detail of all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him ſince their ſeparation; the recital was ſhort. The prudent Fabian, always the victim of friendſhip, ſpoke of his love for Blanche, as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent that had moſt occupied him during his ſolitude; the happy Blanche was unable to ſpeak, but ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her ſiſter, and dropped the tears of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon her boſom.</p>
                  <p>The hermit now entreated his friend to relate to them in his turn, all his adventures from the moment that he left him on the field of battle, to go and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the news of his victory to Niſida. The ſhepherds all joined with him in the ſame requeſt; and Timbrio willing to oblige, began thus:—</p>
                  <p>"After my combat with Pranſil, impatient to ſee Fabian again, I ſent my page to the country-houſe of Niſida; he came back with terror in his looks, and announced to me, the death of my miſtreſs, and the flight of my friend, ſtunned as if by a ſtroke of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033741_0095_0FF8F7A5DB67F9D8"/>
I inſtantly departed to inform myſelf of the full extent of my misfortunes. I arrived at the country, houſe, but neither intreaties, preſents, nor ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could gain me an entrance; while the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and tears of the domeſtics, confirmed me in the belief of Niſida's being no more.</p>
                  <p>"It would be impoſſible for me to tell you what my thoughts were at that moment; ſurely one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die of grief, or I ſhould have expired on the ſpot. —In the midſt of my deſpair, I remembered that there ſtill remained to me a friend, and all wounded as I was, I followed his tracks to Gaietta; when I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in that city, I was forced to wait the departure of a Catalonian veſſel that was to return in a few days to Barcelona, the captain received me on board, and my affliction redoubled as we quit the ſhores of Italy, where I had loſt the deareſt object of my heart.</p>
                  <p>"The wind, which was at firſt favourable to us, fell all of a ſudden, and our veſſel but little removed from the ſhore, was almoſt motionleſs with the calm; I ſhould have ſeen a tempeſt with more pleaſure. Unceaſingly occupied with my miſeries, always weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my loſt Niſida, I beſought Heaven that I might die or find my friend. Now my laſt reſource, the only moments that I found leſs bitter, were thoſe that I ſpent playing on a lute, belonging to one of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and accompanying it with my voice.</p>
                  <p>"The ſecond day of our departure, in the moment when the morn began to glow in the horizon, I was ſitting upon the poop, viewing the vaſt ſea, whoſe tranquil waves reflected the ſtars, now ready to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; all was huſhed around me, the officers and ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors

were buried in profound repoſe;—and even the pilot ſlept upon his helm. The ſails were furled, one heard no noiſe but what the prow of the veſſel made, as it moved ſoftly through the water. This profound ſilence, this grand ſpectacle of the ſea and the heavens; Aurora, that came gently on to revive the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, made me but more keenly feel my ſorrows.

In the name of Heaven, cried ſhe, have the goodneſs to tell me if your veſſel be not the Catalan that ſailed a few days ſince from Gaietta. Judge of my aſtoniſhment, it was the voice of Blanche, the ſiſter of my Niſida. Ah! my ſiſter! cried I, as by the help of a rope I deſcended like lightning into the bark, I flew to throw myſelf into the arms of Blanche, and I found myſelf in thoſe of Niſida.</p>

                  <p>"Recovered from my firſt tranſports of joy, my next care was to get the tender Niſida and her amiable ſiſter into the ſhip; they were both in the habits of pilgrims, but the captain, inſtructed by me, received them with the reſpect that was due to their birth. It was then that I learned from Blanche, how Fabian's forgetting the ſcarf had thrown her ſiſter, who was weakened down with illneſs, into ſo deep a ſwoon that every one believed her to be dead; ſhe did not come to herſelf, till the end of eight hours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They arrived two days after the departure of the ſhip, by dint of money they procured rowers, who endeavoured to overtake us; the calm unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ſeconded their efforts—and Love, who doubtleſs protected theſe amiable ſiſters, conducted them without any accident to our veſſel.</p>
                  <p>"I found my Niſida, but you were wanting to us, my dear Fabian, and this was paying very dear for the favours that we received from Fortune. Blanche felt this as ſenſibly as I did, thy abſence was all that we had to lament.</p>

His friend held him in his arms; yes ſaid he, his very neceſſary that you ſhould come to Toledo, to eſpouſe thy dear Blanche, ſhe adores thee; never has ſhe been one inſtant without thinking of thee, You loved her always. Is it not true? More than my life, replied Fabian, but I love thee ſtill more; come, added he ſmiling, I ſhall quit this habit of an hermit, and you muſt find me one more proper for a bridegroom; but if you will be adviſed by me, when we ſhall be united to theſe two charming ſiſters, we will come back here and live with theſe good ſhepherds, who love us, and who deſerve that we ſhould love them. I have already formed the project, replied Timbrio, I am tired of the parade of the world, and I would wiſh to finiſh my life in theſe ſweet retreats, and enjoy what yet remains of it between my wife and my friend.</p>
                  <p>After this converſation they came back, and gave an account of it to the two ſiſters and the ſhepherds; every one ſeemed delighted, and applauded the deſign.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the night advanced, Elicio adviſed them to haſten to the village; I have no houſe, ſuch as would accommodate you, ſaid he, to the four lovers, but I will conduct you to that of Galatea; Meoris her father, will feel himſelf honoured by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving you.</p>
                  <p>His advice is followed, they ſet out, they double their pace, they arrive; Meoris was going to ſit

                     </gap>hepherd, honoured by ſuch gueſts, received them with reſpect, he called his daughter, and made her add to the ſupper whatever was good in the houſe, and inviting them to ſit down to table, made excuſes for what they had; giving them to underſtand that better fare would have been provided, had they been expected.</p>
                  <p>During ſupper Galatea endeavoured all in her power to hide the grief that preyed on her heart. Elicio placed himſelf as far off from the Portugueſe as he could, he viewed them with rage;—and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his eyes met thoſe of Galatea. The repaſt being ended, they all roſe from table, and went to enjoy the cooling freſhneſs of the air, upon the ſtone benches which were at the door of the houſe. Old Meoris was willing to recount to his gueſts the brilliant marriage which he was making for his daughter; he dwelt upon the riches of his intended ſon-in-law, riches which the Portugueſe did not fail to exaggerate. The two friends, and the two ſiſters, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to felicitate Galatea, ſhe made no reply; and the unhappy Elicio devoured his tears. Suddenly they were alarmed with the diſmal ſound of a trumpet, which was heard in the village.</p>
                  <p>Meoris, his gueſts, and all the inhabitants ran to the public green, from whence the ſad ſounds ſeemed
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033741_0101_0FF8FB0F77623CE8"/>
to proceed, they perceived four men cloathed in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and crowned with cypreſs, two of them carried lighted flambeaus in their hands, the two others ſounded the trumpets, in the midſt of the four was a miniſter of the Eternal, cloathed in his ſacerdotal robes.</p>
                  <p>This was the venerable Salvadore, the paſtor of the ſhepherds, who conſoled them under their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and who returned thanks to Heaven for their happineſs; all the village was his family, all the orphans his children; for forty years he had filled the ſublime employment of praiſing God, and being ſerviceable to man.</p>
                  <p>Shepherds, ſaid he to them, to-morrow is the day that I have choſen in this year, to honor the aſhes of our brothers in the valley of tombs; think on this ſacred duty, and at the earlieſt dawn aſſemble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at this place, in the ſad apparel ſuitable to this intereſting occaſion.</p>
                  <p>After having with a ſtrong voice pronounced theſe words, Salvadore took the road to his own houſe. Every one agreed to meet there at the point of day, to fulfil ſo holy a duty; Meoris was not willing that his daughter ſhould be abſent. He prayed the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe that they would defer their departure. Elicio bounded with joy, and Galatea conceived ſomething like Hope, to flutter in the bottom of her heart.</p>
                  <p>Niſida, Blanche, Teolinda, and the two friends, requeſted of the inhabitants of the village permiſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to accompany them to the valley of tombs. They were flattered with their demand. The four Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe then ſolicited the ſame favour; but they were

                  <p>MELANCHOLY, thou ſoothing power, I yield myſelf up to thy influence, come and ſhed over my laſt ſcenes thy ſoft and ſombre gloom, ſo pleaſing to to the heart of ſenſibility; fear not to awaken every tender emotion, the tears which you cauſe to flow, are to feeling ſouls what the dew is to flowers; where is the lover baniſhed from his miſtreſs, the friend deprived of his friend, the mother far diſtant from her beloved child, who does not conſider thee as the deareſt poſſeſſion fate has left them. How delicious are thoſe moments in which, ſeparated from the world, alone with our hearts and remembrance only, we retire into ourſelves, or rather fill our mind with the dear idea of the object of our affections; what a pleaſure to recall the various aeras of progreſſive love; the firſt hour we have felt that paſſion, the firſt avowal we have made of it, the air with which that avowal was heard, the fears, the ſuſpicions, and even

the quarrels all are preſent, all are traced with delight, we enjoy anew the pleaſures we have experienced, we enjoy even the diſquietudes we have ſuffered. If every hope be torn from the heart, if unpitying death has cut off in the hour of youth and beauty, the object of our love; the tears which we give to her memory have charms, the recollection of her ſtill leaves upon our hearts an impreſſion of happineſs; we would perhaps be more deſerving of pity if it were poſſible we could be conſoled.</p>
                  <p>Thus thought the wiſe Salvadore; he conſecrated one day in the year to tears of tender recollections of Friendſhip and of Love. This day was now come, Salvadore, cloathed in his ſable veſtment, appeared on the green; ſoon after him came the inhabitants of the village covered with crapes, crowned with cypreſs and carrying their crooks bound round with black ribbands. Salvadore regulated the order of the march, he ſeparated the ſhepherds from the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes, and ranged them in two files.</p>
                  <p>On the right moved Niſida, Blanche, Teolinda, Floriſe; and the young maidens moved under the conduct of Galatea. On the left ſide oppoſite theſe marched Timbrio, Fabian, Damon, Tircis, and all the young lads, having Elicio at their head, Eraſtres alone was abſent. After theſe came the married women conducted by Sylveria, and their huſbands led by Daranio; this happy troop were almoſt as handſome as the firſt, they were followed by a third, leſs brilliant indeed, but more reſpectable, theſe were the widows and the old men, they were guided by Meoris and the mother of Eraſtres; they wore no

crowns, but their white hair gave them an intereſting and affecting appearance, their trembling hands carried ebony ſticks, with which they ſupported themſelves. Alas! it was to theſe above all, that the ceremony was affecting; they went to weep upon the tomb of a child, a ſiſter, a wife, or an huſband.</p>
                  <p>Salvadore cloſed the march, he had choſen this place, to be near the moſt unhappy; at each ſide of him four beautiful children, clothed in linen robes and crowned with flowers, carried with reſpectful awe, the holy water, the incenſe and the fire: proud of this employment, which was the reward of a year's good behaviour, they advanced more gravely than the old people.</p>
                  <p>To arrive at the valley of tombs, it was neceſſary to go near a league upon the banks of the Tagus, and under a green canopy formed by a double row of poplars. The ſhepherds marched in ſilence through fields, upon the verdant turf, thick ſown with flowers which were ſtill moiſt with dew. The ſun began to gild the tops of the mountains, and announced one of the fineſt days of ſummer, all the expanſe of heaven was a deep azure, a ſoft breeze gently agitated the leaves, and lulled the little birds in their neſts; the lark, already loſt in the air, made himſelf be heard though he could not be perceived; the nightingale, fatigued with having warbled through the night, reanimated himſelf to hail the return of day; the turtle and her mate joined their reſponſive plaints to the melody of the linnet's voice; the flowers exhaled their ſweets; the fiſhes ſported upon the ſmooth waters of the river; all nature at the moment of its revival, ſeemed to thank

the bountiful Creator for the new benefits which he beſtowed.</p>
                  <p>Timbrio, Blanche and Niſida, little accuſtomed to this ſpectacle, contemplated it with ſurpriſe; the entering into the valley of tombs filled them with freſh admiration.</p>
                  <p>Upon the bank of that beautiful river, whoſe waters roll over golden ſands, is a ſpace of a mile ſquare, girt on all ſides by a chain of hills, but one paſſage leads into it through a long defile, the ſides of which are lined with rows of cypreſs that riſe above each other like an amphitheatre, and ſo cloſely locked together, that their interlacing branches form a thick wall and high as the tops of the hills; roſes and wild <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>And drop a tear upon the virtuous dead.</l>
                  <p>In the interior of the valley the cypreſs reigned all around, in the midſt a fountain of water, ever

moiſtened and refreſhed the green turf; the tombs are ſcattered here and there, ſome are already covered with ivy, others ſtill ornamented with garlands; but each of them encloſed what was mortal of a being that loved virtue.</p>
                  <p>The honour of being interred in this valley was not granted to all the dead; it was the recompence of an irreproachable life. The village, in aſſembly adjudged it; alas! the tombs were but few!</p>
                  <p>The ſhepherds being arrived at the fountain, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there; and Salvadore raiſing his voice, ſeparate yourſelves ſaid he, you will aſſemble near me, when the trumpet ſounds again. At theſe words every one diſperſes; each widow, each orphan, ran to the ſtone that covered the object of their tears.</p>
                  <p>Timbrio, Fabian and the two ſiſters loſt ſight of Elicio, they looked around the valley for him; they ſoon diſcovered him on his knees before the tomb of his mother, his hands were joined together, and his eyes, full of tears raiſed up to heaven—Oh! my mother, ſaid he, you are ſurely happy, ſince you were always good; look down upon me from your dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above, watch over me, and ſo inſpire my heart that I may love virtue as well as I have loved you. In pronouncing theſe words, he preſſed his face upon the tomb, while his tears ran along upon the ſtone.</p>
                  <p>The four lovers liſtened to him in ſilence, they approached him, and Timbrio taking the hand of the ſhepherd, worthy ſon, ſaid he to him, you fill my heart with tenderneſs and reſpect; promiſe to be my friend, and from this moment, I will renounce the world, become a ſhepherd, with Niſida, Blanche,

                  <p>He was ſtill ſpeaking when the trumpet ſounded. Explain to us ſaid Timbrio, why Salvadore now recalls us;—to honour, replied Elicio, the aſhes of the laſt ſhepherd whom we have loſt,—we ſhall immediately hear the hiſtory of his life, which will be ſung to us by the moſt diſcreet of our ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes.</p>
                  <p>Everyone was now aſſembled at the fountain; their venerable conductor guided them to a tomb, the ſtone was ſtill white, and this ſimple inſcription on it: HERE RESTS A GOOD SON.</p>

                  <p>My friends, ſaid Salvadore, your own hearts ſpeak better to you than it is poſſible for me to do, you are all moved to tears at the relation of a virtuous action; think then, what muſt be the delight of doing one. After theſe few words, the venerable paſtor led the ſhepherds out of the valley; he broke the order of their march, and all diſperſed themſelves among the beautiful meadows that were watered by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</p>
                  <p>The two friends, and the two ſiſters, who had not forgotten the promiſe of Elicio, took the road to the fountain of Ardoiſes. The unhappy ſhepherd recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them his love, and the deep deſpair that he felt at the thoughts of Galatea's marriage. Fabian, Blanche and Niſida endeavoured to conſole him, while Timbrio was deviſing by what means he might have him united to his miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>Behind theſe at a little diſtance, Galatea, Floriſe,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033741_0113_0FF8FB306747C940"/>
Teolinda, Tircis and Damon walked together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking. The daughter of Meoris reflected that the very next day was to be the day of her departure. Floriſe was forming the project of following her into Portugal; while the ſad Teolinda envied the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who ſlept in the valley of tombs.</p>
                  <p>To reach the fountain of Ardoiſes, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to quit the banks of the Tagus and croſs ſome hills covered with wood. The dog of Elicio, who was not that day permitted to follow Galatea, remained in the village; he ſaw ſome of the ſhepherds coming home; but not perceiving either his maſter or his miſtreſs he ran to ſeek them, and joined them juſt as they entered the wood.</p>
                  <p>After having friſked from one party to another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately careſſing Elicio and Galatea, he ran about the mountain and ſtarted a wild kid, which he cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued; the kid fled and paſſed near to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes. Fear gave him ſtrength, he gained, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſtopped, a cavern, which he entered bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the dog followed him; Galatea cried out for ſome one to ſave the little goat; every one ran, they arrive at the mouth of the cave, and Elicio in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, darts into it after the dog.</p>
                  <p>Tircis, Damon and the two friends, laughing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, to quiet the fears of the ſhepherdeſs, and waited at the mouth of the cave expecting to ſee the lover of Galatea appear with the young goat in his arms.—But ſuddenly a frightful noiſe aſſailed their ears from the bottom of the cavern; they ſoon ſaw Elicio come forth, ſtruggling with a man whoſe aſpect was terrifying; he was covered with tattered rags, a
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033741_0114_0FF8FB3208568198"/>
black and thick beard hid half of his face, his long hair floated in diſorder on his ſhoulders, his arms naked and nervous, were employed in an endeavour to ſtrangle Elicio; the ſhepherd, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſs vigorous, held his left hand againſt the hairy breaſt of the wild man, his right hand faſtened in his hair, pulled back the head of his enemy; they were ſilent, their eyes darting fire at each other, their limbs were twiſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; while each with all his force, endeavoured to throw his adverſary to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The dog of Elicio had not quit his maſter, and would have made efforts to ſuccour him, but a wild goat gave him enough to do to defend himſelf; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that he ſhould not get to her ſide, ſhe puſhed him before her, ſtill menacing him with her horns, whilſt the young kid now loſing all fear, jumped round its mother, and ſeemed to brave him that he ſo lately dreaded.</p>
                  <p>Tircis, Damon and the two friends, flew to ſeparate the combatants, and Timbrio ſeizing the ſavage, had need of all his force to hold him—but Teolinda faints, and every one ran to her aſſiſtance; the wild man throws his eyes upon her, he remains immoveable, gazing intently upon the pale face of the ſhepherdeſs. Suddenly ſtarting from the arms of Timbrio, he caught up the young goat, the innocent cauſe of ſo many accidents, he fell on his knees to Teolinda, and preſented it to her with a ſubmiſſive air; ſcarcely had the ſhepherdeſs come to herſelf, when ſhe fell on the neck of the wild man. Ah! is it you, cried ſhe, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidore, my dear Artidore, you have not then forgotten your poor Teolinda. At the name of Teolinda, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidore
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033741_0115_0FF8FB34F37C7F08"/>
changed colour, he ſprings up, and looking wildly on the ſhepherdeſs, Teolinda! ſaid he, ſhe has deceived me;—I remember her well; Is ſhe here? —Yes, replied Teolinda, with a trembling voice, ſhe is here, ſhe only lives for you! Liſten, ſaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, ſpeaking to her in a low voice, you muſt bring me to her, I wiſh to reproach her with her perfidy, I wiſh to tell her that I no longer love her. Afterwards we will return and dwell in my cave, you ſhall be my friend, and I will give you my little goat.</p>
                  <p>Teolinda ſaw by his diſcourſe, that grief had unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the reaſon of the unfortunate Artidore. She looked on him with earneſtneſs, while the tears ran down her eyes, and preſſing his hand with tenderneſs, I deſire nothing more, ſaid ſhe, I will never quit you again, I will remain with you to the laſt hour of my life, I hope to prove to you that Teolinda was not to blame. In ſaying theſe words, ſhe took the arm of Artidore, and led him with her into the road that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to the fountain of Ardoiſes, the goat and her young one followed them, while the reſt of the ſhepherds kept a few paces behind, impatient to ſee the end of this adventure.</p>
                  <p>As they went along, Teolinda uſed every effort to recall him to a recollection which ſhe at once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ared and wiſhed; attentive to ſay nothing that might be diſpleaſing to her lover, ſhe ſpoke with precaution of herſelf, brought with tenderneſs their loves to his memory, recounted the hiſtory of her twin ſiſter, and all the tears ſhe had coſt her. She obſerved the effects of each word upon the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Artidore, followed ſtep by ſtep the progreſs
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033741_0116_0FF8C1FFAB9D92B8"/>
that ſhe made on his reaſon, and ſtrained every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her ſoul to bring back the affections of her lever. Artidore liſtens to her like a man come out of a long ſleep; he replies properly to ſome queſtions, makes her repeat others; by little and little, his memory and his ideas come to him; Love bereft him of reaſon, Love ought to give it back to him again; he ſtops, he conſiders Teolinda, recollects her, falls at her feet, holds her in his arms, and his tears proved to the ſhepherdeſs, that her lover was no longer inſenſible.</p>
                  <p>They arrived at the fountain, where every one joined them; Floriſe and Galatea had related as they went along, all that they knew of the loves of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and Teolinda. After having felicitated the ſhepherdeſs, they begged of her to prevail on her lover to begin a recital of his adventures from the moment that the twin ſiſter had ſo cruelly deceived him. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidore conſented, and though a little aſhamed of the ſituation in which he found himſelf, he continued thus his hiſtory:—</p>
                  <p>"The diſcourſe of the falſe Teolinda threw me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt dreadful deſpair, I reſolved to fly for ever from her whom I believed ſo perfidious; I was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, to let her know that I ſtill loved her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I engraved my eternal farewell upon the bark of a poplar; I do not even remember what I wrote.

                  <p>"I was in this ſtate of calm deſpair, neither fearing nor deſiring that my ſufferings ſhould be long, when a plaintive bleating ſtruck my ears.

In ſpight of myſelf I was affected, I riſe up, I run to where the noiſe came from, and I perceived the little goat that I had ſaved, he had paſſed his white noſe between the ſtone and the rock, and ſeemed to demand of me to open it to him.</p>

                  <p>"I examined where ſhe bled, I knew the marks of the wolf's teeth, I went to ſeek ſome water, I waſhed the wounds, ſtaunched the blood, and I tied them up with a part of my clothes; after this operation, the goat ſeemed to regard me with tenderneſs, ſhe lay ſoftly down, ſhowed her paps full of milk, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to invite me to partake the nouriſhment of her little one, whom I reſtored to her.</p>

I ſtill believed her to be there, when I ſaw her run in, all trembling and purſued by a dog; very ſoon after a man appeared, I declare to you, that at this ſight, I was no longer maſter of my fury, I ran upon him with the idea of ſtrangling him, ſo much was I enraged that a man ſhould come to take from me the only friends that I thought remained to me in the world. You have been witneſſes of my combat, and its fortunate iſſue; this day is the happieſt of my life, I have found my Teolinda, and I feel my reaſon reſtored to me again.

                  <p>In ſaying theſe words, he careſſed them with one hand, and held out the other to Teolinda.</p>
                  <p>The recital of Artidore had filled them all with tenderneſs, and they thanked him with tears in their eyes. He begged Elicio, in a low voice, to procure him the means of cutting off his beard, and to furniſh him with another habit;—come with me, ſaid the ſhepherd, I have in my cottage, all that is neceſſary for you. Go then, added Timbrio, we will wait for you here, and in your abſence, I ſhall conſider of ſomething to ſay to the father of .... he ſtopped himſelf there;—Galatea bluſhed—Artidore went with Elicio, Teolinda begged of him not to ſtay long, and the goat and her kid followed him.</p>
                  <p>Galatea had heard that Timbrio intended to ſpeak to her father, ſhe gueſſed that her preſence would be
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033741_0120_0FF8FB4086F50568"/>
a reſtraint; and ſeigning to be obliged to return to her houſe, ſhe toook leave of Blanche, Niſida and Teolinda, and took the road to the village, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by no one but her dear Floriſe.</p>
                  <p>They had gone but a little way, when four men ſtarted from behind a hedge, ſeiſed the two ſhepherd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes, prevented them with their handkerchiefs, from crying out, and forced them upon two mules that they had there, ready prepared for the purpoſe; Galatea and Floriſe obeyed them trembling, the four men mounted on horſeback, placed the mules in the centre, and ſet off in a full gallop towards the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Caſtile.</p>
                  <p>The raviſhers were the four Portugueſe, who had for ſome days been at the houſe of Meoris; they ſaw how coldly they were received by all the village, they remembered the manner that Elicio had looked at them, after ſupper, and the tenderneſs with which he viewed Galatea, had made them ſuſpect the truth; the delay that Meoris had made to go to the valley of tombs, the refuſal of the inhabitants to let them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them to that valley, ſeemed to them to be a pretext and an inſult; they feared beſides, to return without Galatea, and they conceived that the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her off, would be pardoned when the daughter of Meoris was married to their maſter; every thing as yet had ſucceeded to their wiſhes, they fled with their prey—but Love watched over Galatea.</p>
                  <p>Artidore having changed his clothes in the cottage of Elicio, was returning with him to the fountain, they ſaw at a diſtance, the four cavaliers, and knew the ſhepherdeſſes; Elicio gave a great cry and flew to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033741_0121_0FF8FB44AFDEF970"/>
his miſtreſs, with both his hands he ſtopped the mules. One of the Portugueſe raiſed his arm to pierce Elicio with a lance; at the ſame inſtant Artidore ran to his aſſiſtance, and with the ſtroke of a ſtick he broke the arm of the barbarian;—the two ſhepherdeſſes ſeiſed the moment of confuſion, ſlipped from their mules, and being well acquainted with the place, ran with all their ſpeed to look for ſuccour at the fountain. In the mean time Elicio had ſeiſed upon the lance of the wounded man, and ſtanding cloſe to Artidore, theſe two brave ſhepherds on foot, and armed only with a lance and a ſtick, made head againſt the three treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous cavaliers, who wiſhed to avenge their compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
                  <p>This unequal combat was long continued, but cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was yielding to force. Elicio, wounded in the arm, could no longer defend himſelf—when Timbrio, ſword in hand, fell like thunder upon the Portugueſe, at the firſt ſtroke, he made the head fly from the ſhoulders of him that preſſed hardeſt on Elicio. Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Damon and Fabian were now arrived, when the two remaining Portugueſe, putting ſpurs to their horſes, fled with the utmoſt ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>The wounds of Elicio were not dangerous, but he loſt much blood; Galatea is terrified, ſhe ſtops it with her handkerchief, ſhe dreſſed the wound herſelf,— this alone, would have been ſufficient to have cured Elicio; they led him to the village, his arm in a ſcarf, Galatea ſupporting him, and this favour more than paid him for the danger he ran in ſuccouring her.</p>

Behold, ſaid Timbrio, preſenting the wounded man to him, the deliverer of your daughter, Elicio deſerves to poſſeſs her whom his valour has ſaved; his poverty alone could have made you heſitate to conſent to his happineſs;—but he is to day as rich as you yourſelf. I poſſeſs a large fortune, and I am willing . . . . . . as he ſaid theſe words, they heard a great noiſe at the door of the houſe; they ſaw entering into the yard, a beautiful ram ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ribbands of various colours, his enormous bell was diſtinguiſhed amongſt thoſe of an hundred ſheep that followed him—each with its lamb. Eraſtres came after them attended by two dogs, with whom he left the care of this beautiful flock, and with his crook in his hand, ſpoke thus to the father of Galatea:—</p>
                  <p>Meoris, ſaid he, I was myſelf in love with your daughter, and I might have diſputed her with the Portugueſe, to whom you have given her: but I muſt be juſt, neither I nor the Portugueſe merit Galatea; Elicio alone is worthy of her. You may believe this avowal, when it comes from the mouth of his rival; you required that your ſon-in-law ſhould be rich, behold this flock, which is in itſelf a fortune, it is Elicio's, it is not I who have beſtowed it; I have done no more than go among the neighbouring ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Elicio has ſo many friends, that each of them gave him a lamb and its mother; and in two days I have formed this flock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="unknown:033741_0123_0FF8FB49DAC299E8"/>He had ſcarcely done ſpeaking, when Elicio bathed him with his tears. Ah! my friend, whatever be my fate, thy friendſhip will make me worthy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing envied: I dare not hope for Galatea, but . . . . She is yours, ſaid Meoris, with tears in his eyes, come my daughter, I will beſtow you on your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; come and embrace thy huſband. Galatea, bluſhing deeper than the roſe, approached, yet feared to advance too quick; Elicio was on his knees, and held out to her with reſpect, the only hand he had at liberty;—Galatea looked at him, ſtopped, threw down her eyes, her face glowed with a deeper crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Her father, who enjoyed this tender embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, took her by the hand, and conducted her to her happy lover, even then he was obliged gently to force her to join her mouth to Elicio's; and that kiſs was the firſt that Galatea had received in all her life.</p>
                  <p>They then made Eraſtres acquainted with the vile attempt, that had been made to carry off Galatea and Floriſe. Timbrio came to him; ſhepherd, ſaid he to him, you have wreſted from me one of the ſweeteſt moments of my life. I intended to divide my fortune with Elicio, that he might have eſpouſed Galatea, but you have prevented me; you do not love him better however than I do, but as you have loved him longer, 'tis but juſt that you ſhould be preferred. I hope, at leaſt, added he raiſing his voice, that you will ſuffer me to accompliſh another deſign; I will make four parts of my fortune, the firſt ſhall belong to my friend Fabian; I ſhall preſent the ſecond to Teolinda and Artidore, to engage them to fix here;
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033741_0124_0FF8FB4B785470D0"/>
the third ſhall be put into the hands of Salvadore to be diſtributed among the poor of the village; and the fourth part ſhall be diſpoſed of in purchaſing an houſe, lands, and a flock for Niſida and me. Yes, my good friends, I will become a ſhepherd, I will end my days with you and Fabian; our cottages ſhall be near each other, our families ſhall be united, we will live an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the village, and we will grow old together in peace, in happineſs, and in love.</p>
                  <p>Every one admired the generoſity of Timbrio; Artidore and Teolinda held him in a long and ſilent embrace. Meoris was willing that the contracts ſhould be all ſettled that evening; he ran to ſpread in the village the news of ſo many happy events, and brought back with him the notary and the venerable Salvadore.</p>
                  <p>The contracts were ſoon finiſhed, and it was agreed that Timbrio, the very next day, ſhould ſend back all his ſuite to Toledo; with a confidential ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who ſhould carry the news to the relations of Niſida, and bring back in ready money, the fortune of his maſter. In the mean time, Meoris was to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the flocks and farms for the new ſhepherds: and till all was got ready, Timbrio and Fabian, with their wives, were to remain at the houſe of Meoris; and Teolinda and Artidore at that of Eraſtres.</p>
                  <p>Nothing was now wanting but to fix the day of their four marriages; Elicio, notwithſtanding his wounds, was decided that it ſhould be the next day, nor could the wiſe Salvadore prevail on him to defer it. The reſt, without ſaying any thing, were of opinion with Elicio.</p>

As ſoon as their repaſt was over, they all aſſembled in the garden, they ſat down on ſeats of green turf in a beautiful arbour of vines, the moon ſhed her pureſt light, all was ſtill and peaceful.

                  <head>AMELIA: OR THE FAITHLESS BRITON.</head>
                  <p>THE revolutions of government, and the ſubverſions of empire, which have ſwelled the theme of national hiſtorians, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in every age, furniſhed anecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveliſt. The objects of policy or ambition are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, indeed, accompliſhed at the expence of private eaſe and proſperity; while the triumph of arms, like the funeral feſtivity of a ſavage tribe, ſerves to announce ſome recent calamity—the waſte of property, or the fall of families.</p>
                  <p>Thus, the great events of the late war, which produced the ſeparation of the Britiſh empire, and eſtabliſhed the ſovereignty of America, were chequered with ſcenes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſorrow, and the ſucceſs of the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of domeſtic life. The lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the widow and the orphan, mingled
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033741_0133_0FF8FB611EB10288"/>
with the ſong of victory; and the ſable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with which the hand of friendſhip cloathed the bier of the gallant MONTGOMERY, caſt a momentary gloom upon the trophies his valour had atchieved.</p>
                  <p>Though the following tale then, does not exhibit the terrible magnificence of warlike operations, or ſcrutinize the principles of national politics, it recites an epiſode that too frequently occurs in the military drama, and contains a hiſtory of female affliction, that claims, from its authenticity, at leaſt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the feeling heart. It is the firſt of a ſeries of novels, drawn from the ſame ſource, and intended for public communication, but as the author's object is merely to glean thoſe circumſtances in the progreſs of the revolution, which the hiſtorian has neither leiſure nor diſpoſition to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and to produce, from the annals of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, ſomething to entertain, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to improve his readers, the occaſion will yield little to hope from the applauſe of the public, and nothing to dread from its candor.</p>
                  <p>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a reſpectable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the ſtate of New-York. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had rewarded his induſtry in trade with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033741_0134_0FF8FB65A768E9B8"/>
an ample fortune; and his mind, unconta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by envy and ambition, freely indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the former character he ſuperintended the education of a ſon and a daughter, left to his ſole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and council were uniformly exerciſed for the relief of the diſtreſſed, and the information of the illiterate.</p>
                  <p>His mercantile intercourſe with Great Britain afforded an early opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the diſpoſition of that kingdom with reſpect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furniſhed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war. The texture of his mind, indeed, was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calm and paſſive, and the ordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a life of ſixty years duration, had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eradicated all thoſe paſſions which rouſe men to oppoſition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the gauntlet was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the ſpirit of diſcord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from public clamour, to a ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered cottage, in the interior diſtrict of Long-Iſland; and conſecrating the youthful
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033741_0135_0FF8C207A17F8BD8"/>
ardour of his ſon, Honorius, to the ſervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</p>
                  <p>Amelia had then attained her ſeventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uniſon with the mildneſs of her aſpect, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite harmony of her ſoul, was reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſymmetry of her perſon. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompliſhment that depends upon tuition; and it was the ſingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our ſex, and the favourite of her own. From ſuch a daughter, Horatio could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every ſolace of which his generous feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſuſceptible in a ſeaſon of national calamity; but the din of arms that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted the ſilence of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreſts, and the diſaſtrous intelligence which his ſon occaſionally tranſmitted from the ſtandard of the union, ſuperceded the cheerful avocations of the day, and diſpelled the peaceful ſlumbers of the night.</p>
                  <p>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happineſs of Horatio's family, the ſound of artillery announced a battle, and the horſemen who were obſerved gallopping acroſs the grounds, proved that the ſcene of action could not be remote. As ſoon, therefore, as the tumult of hoſtility
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033741_0136_0FF8FB68219AEF90"/>
had ſubſided, Horatio advanced with his domeſtics, to adminiſter comfort and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the wounded, and to provide a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traverſing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, whoſe exhauſted ſtrength juſt ſerved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the preſervation of this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exertions might be crowned with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Having bathed, and bound up his wounds, the youthful ſoldier was borne to the cottage; where, in a ſhort time, a ſtronger pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe, and a freer reſpiration, afforded a flattering preſage of returning life.</p>
                  <p>Amelia, who had anxiouſly waited the arrival of her father, beheld, with a mixed ſenſation of horror and pity, the ſpectacle which now accompanied him. She had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ſeen the ſemblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwithſtanding the pallid countenance of the wounded gueſt, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed an elegance of perſon, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural operations of female ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, added ſomething perhaps, to her commiſeration for his misfortunes. When,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033741_0137_0FF8FB6AA26ACA80"/>
however, theſe firſt impreſſions had paſſed away, the tenderneſs of her nature expreſſed itſelf in the moſt aſſiduous actions for his eaſe and accommodation, and the increaſing ſymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</p>
                  <p>The day ſucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who had made an ineffectual ſearch for his body among the ſlain, arrived at the cottage, and diſcovered him to be <hi>Doliſcus,</hi> the only ſon and heir of a noble family in England.</p>
                  <p>When Doliſcus had recovered from the ſenſeleſs ſtate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effuſion of blood) the firſt exerciſe of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profeſſion of gratitude. To Horatio he ſpoke in terms of reverence and reſpect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus had been reared in the ſchool of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to conſider virtue only as an obſtacle to pleaſure, and beauty merely as an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the gratification of paſſion. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033741_0138_0FF8FB6C40E8B638"/>
ſoon enabled him to diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſolicitude of the artleſs Amelia beyond the dictates of compaſſion and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality; and even before his wounds were cloſed, he conceived the infamous project of violating the purity and tranquility of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exiſtence, and the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of his health. From that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, however, which betrayed her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, while ſhe was herſelf ignorant of their ſource, he anticipated the extremeſt difficulty and danger. To improve the evident predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, required not, indeed, a very ſtrenuous diſplay of his talents and addreſs; but the ſacrifice of her honour (which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable antipathy to the matrimonial engagements made neceſſary to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his purpoſe) was a taſk that he juſtly foreſaw, could be only executed by the deteſtable agency of perfidy and fraud. With theſe views then he readily accepted the ſolicitations of his unſuſpecting hoſt, and even contrived to protract his cure, in order to furniſh a plea for his continuance at the cottage.</p>
                  <p>Amelia, when, at length, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his ſafety were removed, employed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033741_0139_0FF8FB6F2F079CA0"/>
all the charms of muſic and converſation to diſſipate the languor, which his indiſpoſition had produced, and to prevent the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, with which retirement is apt to affect a diſpoſition accuſtomed to the gay and buſy tranſactions of the world. She experienced an unuſual pleaſure, indeed, in the diſcharge of theſe benevolent offices; for in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Doliſcus ſhe inſenſibly forgot the anxiety ſhe was wont to feel for the fate of her abſent brother; and the ſympathy which ſhe had hitherto extended to all the ſufferers of the war, was now monopolized by a ſingle object. Horatio's attachment to the ſolitude of his library, afforded frequent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for this infatuating intercourſe, which the deſigning Doliſcus gradually diverted from general to particular topics—from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon public manners and events, to inſinuations of perſonal eſteem and partiality. Amelia was incapable of deceit, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuſpicion. The energy, but, at the ſame time, the reſpect, with which Doliſcus addreſſed her, was grateful to her feelings; his rank and fortune entitled him to conſideration, and the ineſtimable favours that had been conferred upon him, offered a ſpecious ſecurity for his truth and fidelity. The acknowledgment of reciprocal regard
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033741_0140_0FF8FB731806BDD8"/>
was, therefore, an eaſy acquiſition, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſcus triumphed in the modeſt, but expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit avowal, before Amelia was apprized of its importance and extent. From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however, he aſſumed a penſive and dejected carriage. He occaſionally affected to ſtart from the terrors of a deep reverie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the vivacity of his temper, which had never yielded to the anguiſh of his wounds, ſeemed ſuddenly to have expired under the weight of ſecret and intolerable affliction. Amelia, diſtreſſed and aſtoniſhed, implored an explanation of ſo myſterious a change in his deportment; but his reiterated ſighs, which were for a while, the only anſwers ſhe received, tended equally to encreaſe her curioſity and her ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>At length he undertook to diſcloſe the ſource of his pretended wretchedneſs; and, having prefaced the hypocritical tale with the moſt ſolemn proteſtions of his love and conſtancy, he told the trembling Amelia that, were it even poſſible to diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from an alliance which had been early contracted for him with a noble heireſs of London, ſtill the pride of family, and the ſpirit of loyalty, which governed his father's actions, would oppoſe a union unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the acclamations of dignity, and formed with one whoſe connections were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033741_0141_0FF8FB755FB19238"/>
zealous in the arduous reſiſtence to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Britain. "While he lives," added Doliſcus, " it is not in my power to chooſe the means of happineſs—and yet, as the time approaches when it will be inconſiſtent with the duty and honour of a ſoldier to enjoy any longer the ſociety of Amelia, how can I reflect upon my ſituation without anguiſh and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair!" The delicate frame of Amelia was agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſenſations which this picture had excited; and, for the firſt time, ſhe became acquainted with the force of love, and the dread of ſeparation from its object. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſcus traced the ſentiments of her heart in the ſilent, but certain indications of her countenance, and when tears had melted the violence of her firſt emotion into a ſoft and ſympathetic grief, the treacherous ſuitor thus proſecuted his ſcheme againſt her peace and innocence.</p>
                  <p>"But it is impoſſible to reſolve upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual miſery! One thing may yet be done to change the ſcene without incurring a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's reſentment and reproach:—can my Amelia conſent to ſacrifice a ſentiment of delicacy, to enſure a life of happineſs?" Her complexion brightened and her eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitively turned towards him. " The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of public marriage" he continued,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033741_0142_0FF8FB7847CE3EC8"/>
"neither adds ſtrength or energy to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: for, form is the ſuperfluous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of faſhion, not the reſult of reaſon. The poor peaſant whoſe nuptial contract is only witneſſed by the hallowed miniſter that pronounces it, is as bleſt as the prince who weds in all the oſtentation of a court, and furniſhes an additional feſtival to a giddy nation. My Amelia has ſurely no vanity to gratify with idle pageantry; and as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy of the marriage does not take from its ſanctity, I will venture to propoſe—nay, look not with ſeverity—at the neighbouring farm we may be met by the chaplain of my regiment, and love and honour ſhall record a union, which prudence fetters with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſecrecy."</p>
                  <p>Hope, fear, the ſenſe of decorum, and the incitements of a paſſion pure, but fervent, compleated the painful perturbation of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's heart, and, in this critical moment of her fate, deprived her of ſpeech and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>An anxious interval of ſilence took place; but when, at length, the power of expreſſion returned, Amelia urged the duty which ſhe owed to a parent, the ſcandal which the world imputed to clandeſtine marriages, and the fatal conſequences that might ariſe from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033741_0143_0FF8FB7A8AADB038"/>
the obſcurity of the tranſaction. But Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, ſteady to his purpoſe, again deprecated the folly of purſuing the ſhadow in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſubſtance, of preſerving fame at the expence of happineſs, and of relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bleſſings of connubial life, for the ſake of its formalities. He ſpoke of Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's inflexible integrity, which could not brook even the appearance of deception, and of his punctilious honour, which could not ſubmit even to the appearance of intruſion upon the domeſtic arrangements of another, as inſurmountable arguments for denying him the knowledge of their union. Finally, he deſcribed, in the warmeſt colouring of paſſion and fancy, the effects of Amelia's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal upon the future tenor of his life, and bathing her hand with his obedient tears, practiſed all the arts of flattery and frenzy. The influence of love ſupercedes every other obligation: Amelia acknowledged its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and yielded to the perſuaſion of the exulting Doliſcus. The marriage ceremony was privately repeated—but how will it excite the indignation of the virtuous read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when he underſtands, that the ſacred character of the prieſt was perſonated by a ſoldier whom Doliſcus had ſuborned for this iniquitous occaſion! Ye ſpirits of ſeduction!
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033741_0144_0FF8FB7C4A6CDE78"/>
whoſe means are the proſtitution of faith, and whoſe end is the deſtruction of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, —tremble at impending judgment, for "there is no mercy in heaven for ſuch unheard of crimes as theſe!"</p>
                  <p>But a ſhort time had elapſed after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtep, when the mandate of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer obliged Doliſcus to prepare for joining his corps. A ſilent, but pungent ſenſe of indiſcretion, added to the anguiſh which Amelia felt in the hour of ſeparation; and not all his ſtrong aſſurances of inviolable truth and attachment, with the ſoothing proſpect of an honourable avowal of their union, could efface the melancholy impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her mind The farmer at whoſe houſe the fictitious marriage had been rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was employed to manage their future correſpondence; and Doliſcus, finally, left the cottage with vows of love and gratitude at his lips; but ſchemes of fraud and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in his heart. The ſmall diſtance from New-York, where he was quartered, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it eaſy to maintain an epiſtolary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; which became, during its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the only employment, and the only gratification of Amelia's exiſtence. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, however, exceeded not a few weeks. Doliſcus ſoon aſſumed a formal and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033741_0145_0FF8C2095F8C4758"/>
diſpaſſionate ſtyle, and the number of his letters gradually diminiſhed, and every allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that marriage, which was the laſt hope and conſolation of Amelia, he cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided.</p>
                  <p>But an event, that demanded the exerciſe of all her fortitude, now forced itſelf upon Amelia's thoughts. She was pregnant; yet could neither reſort for council and comfort to the father whom ſhe had deceived, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from the lover by whom ſhe had been ſeduced. In the tendereſt and moſt delicate terms ſhe communicated her ſituation to Doliſcus, emphatically called upon him to reſcue her reputation from obloquy, and ſolicitouſly courted his return to the cottage, or, at leaſt, that he would diſcloſe to Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio the ſecret of their union. To prevent any accident, the farmer was prevailed upon to be the bearer of the paper which contained theſe ſentiments, and, on his return pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the following epiſtle.</p>

                  <p>"Gracious God!" exclaimed Amelia, and fell ſenſeleſs to the ground. For a while, a convulſive motion ſhook her frame, but gradually ſubſiding, the flame of life ſeemed to be extinct, and all her terrors at an end. The poor farmer, petrified with horror and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033741_0147_0FF8FB83549C69B8"/>
amazement, ſtood gazing on the ſcene: but the exertions of his homely ſpouſe, at length, reſtored Amelia to exiſtence and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>It has often been obſerved, that deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency begets boldneſs and enterprize; and the female heart, which is ſuſceptible of the gentleſt ſentiment, is, likewiſe, capable of the nobleſt fortitude. Amelia perceived all the baſeneſs of the deſertion meditated by Doliſcus; ſhe foreſaw all its ruinous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſhe bore; and wiping the uſeleſs tears from her cheek, ſhe reſolved publicly to vindicate her honour, and aſſert her rights. Animated then, with the important purpoſe, ſupported by the preſumption of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus in New-York, ſhe immediately repaired to that city—but alas! he was gone! This diſappointment, however, did not defeat, nor could any obſtacle retard the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her deſign: a ſhip that ſailed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding day waſted her to Britain, friendleſs and forlorn.</p>
                  <p>Innumerable difficulties and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were encountered by the inexperienced traveller, but they vaniſhed before the object of her purſuit; and even her entrance into
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033741_0148_0FF8FB85DD801BD8"/>
London, that chaos of clamour and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, produced no other ſenſations than thoſe which naturally aroſe from her approach to the dwelling of Doliſcus.</p>
                  <p>Amelia recollected that Doliſcus had often deſcribed the family reſidence to be ſituated in Groſvenor-place; and the ſtage, in which ſhe journeyed, ſtopping in the evening at a public houſe in Picadilly, ſhe determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome viſit. The embarraſſed and anxious manner with which ſhe inquired for his houſe, expoſed her to unjuſt ſurmiſe and ſenſeleſs ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of obſervation, and her purity was ſuperior to inſult.</p>
                  <p>Doliſcus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence, and fortune, which devolved upon him in conſequence of his father's death, had ſwelled his youthful vanity to exceſs, and ſupplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was liſtening in extacy to that ſervile crew, the victim of his arts, the deluded daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the preſervation of his life, ſtood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pauſe of ſome minutes, procured her admiſſion. Her memory recognized the features of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033741_0149_0FF8FB88CB5CCC58"/>
ſervant that opened the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doliſcus at the cottage — ſhe remembered not where or when ſhe had ſeen him.</p>
                  <p>After conſiderable ſolicitation, the porter conſented to call Doliſcus from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conducted Amelia into an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter ſucceeded the delivery of her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and the word <hi>aſſignation,</hi> which was repeated on all ſides, ſeemed to renovate the wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant hoſt, inflamed with champagne, was not diſpleaſed at the imputation; but obſerved, that as a lady was in the caſe, it was unneceſſary to apologize for a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of his friends and wine.</p>
                  <p>At the ſight of that lady, however, Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſtarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and haggard with fatigue and ſorrow; her perſon was oppreſſed with the burthen which ſhe now bore in its laſt ſtage, and her eye, fixed ſteadfaſtly upon him, as he entered the room, beſpoke the complicated anguiſh and indignation of her feelings. Her aſpect ſo changed, and her appearance ſo unexpected, added to the terrors of a guilty conſcience, for a moment, Doliſcus thought the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſupernatural. But Amelia's wrongs having inſpired her with courage, ſhe boldly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033741_0150_0FF8FB8B0E8E5D38"/>
reproached him with his baſeneſs and perſidy, and demanded a public and unequivocal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to ſooth and divert her from her purpoſe, in vain to perſuade her to ſilence and delay,—his arts had loſt their wonted influence, while the reſtoration of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured fame and honour abſorbed every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her mind.</p>
                  <p>At length he aſſumed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he, "I am not to be thus duped or controuled. I have a ſenſe of pity, indeed, for your indiſcretion, but none for your paſſion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not ſubmit to your frenzy." "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe ſomething to a father's peace, I ſhould deſpiſe to call thee huſband."—"<hi>Huſband</hi>" cried Doliſcus, with a ſneer, "Huſband! why truly, I remember a rural maſquerade, at which an honeſt ſoldier, now my humble porter, played the parſon, and you the bluſhing bride—but, pr'ythee, do not talk of huſband."—</p>
                  <p>This diſcovery only was wanting for the conſummation of Amelia's miſery. It was ſudden and fatal as the lightning's blaſt—ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unk beneath the ſtroke. A deadly ſtupor
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033741_0151_0FF8FB8F982507C0"/>
ſeized upon her ſenſes, which was ſometimes interrupted with a boiſterous laugh, and ſometimes with a nervous ejaculation.</p>
                  <p>Doliſcus, unaffected by compaſſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, was ſolicitous only to employ this opportunity for Amelia's removal, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed her into a coach, a ſervant was directed to procure lodgings for her, in ſome obſcure quarter of the city. She ſpoke not a word during the tranſaction, but gazing with apparent indifference upon the objects that ſurrounded her, ſhe ſubmitted to be tranſported whither ſoever they pleaſed to conduct her. After winding through a dreary and dirty paſſage in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's, the carriage ſtopped at a hovel which belonged to a relation of the ſervant that accompanied her, and, he having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in a ſhort whiſper the object of his viſit, an old and decrepid beldame led Amelia into a damp and narrow room, whoſe ſcant and tattered furniture proved the wretchedneſs of its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>A premature birth was the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the conflict which had raged in Amelia's mind. She had entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but a few moments, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that event gave a turn to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and called her drooping faculties once more into action. Without comfort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033741_0152_0FF8FB91374A2108"/>
aſſiſtance, in the hour of extreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs (ſave the officious ſervices of her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated hoſt) ſhe was delivered of a ſon; but the fond ſenſibility of the mother obtained an inſtantaneous ſuperiority over every other conſideration. Though, alas! this ſolitary gratification too, continued not long;—her infant expired after a languid exiſtence of three days, ſerving only to increaſe the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Amelia's portion.</p>
                  <p>Amelia caſt her eye towards heaven as the breath deſerted the body of her babe:—it was not a look of ſupplication, for what had ſhe to hope, or what to dread?—neither did it indicate diſſatisfaction or reproach, for ſhe had early learned the duty of reverence and reſignation—but it was an awful appeal to the throne of grace, for the vindication of the act by which ſhe had reſolved to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate her woes. A phial of laudanum, left by a charitable apothecary, who had viſited her in her ſickneſs, preſented the means, and ſhe wanted not the fortitude to employ them. Deliberately, then, pouring the baneful draught into a glaſs, ſhe looked wiſtfully for a while upon the infant corpſe that lay extended on its bed, then bending on her knee, uttered, in a firm and ſolemn voice the melancholy effuſions of her ſoul,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033741_0153_0FF8FB942068FB58"/>
—"Gracious Father! when thy juſtice ſhall pronounce upon the deed which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricates me from the calamities of the world, let thy mercy contemplate the cauſe that urged me to the perpetration. I have been deluded into error; but am free from guilt: I have been ſolicitous to preſerve my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and honour; but am expoſed to infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ſhame. The treachery of him to whom I entruſted my fate, has reduced me to deſpair—the declining day of him from whom I received my being, has been cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my indiſcretions, and there is no cure left for the ſorrows that conſume me, but the dark and ſilent grave. Viſit me not then, in thy wrath, oh! Father, but let the exceſs of my ſufferings in this world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the crime which wafts me into the world to come—may thy mercy yield com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Horatio's heart, and teach Doliſcus the virtue of repentance!"</p>
                  <p>She roſe and lifted the glaſs. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, a noiſe on the ſtairs attracted her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and a voice anxiouſly pronouncing —"It muſt be ſo! —nay, I will ſee her—" arreſted the dreadful potion in its paſſage to her lips. "It is my Amelia!" exclaimed Horatio, as he haſtily entered the room.</p>
                  <p>Amelia ſtarted, and looked for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033741_0154_0FF8FB96996ADDD0"/>
intently on her father, then ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arms, and anxiouſly concealed the ſhame and agony of her countenance, in that boſom, from which alone ſhe now dreaded reproach, or hoped for conſolation. He, too, beheld with horror the ſcene that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his view: he preſſed his deluded, miſerable daughter, to his heart, while a ſtream of tears ran freely down his cheeks; till, at length, his imagination, infected with the objects that ſurrounded him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the dreadful purpoſe of the draught, which had fallen from Amelia's hand, and anticipated a ſorrow, even beyond the extremity of his preſent feelings. When, however, he collected ſufficient courage to reſolve his fears, and it was aſcertained, that the meditated act had not been perpetrated, a momentary ſenſation of joy illuminated his mind, like the tranſient appearance of the moon, amidſt the gloomy horrors of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>When the firſt impreſſions of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interview had paſſed away, Horatio ſpoke comfort to his daughter. "Come my child, the hand of Heaven, that afflicted us with worldly cares, has been ſtretched out to guard you from everlaſting wretchedneſs: —that Providence which proves how vain
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033741_0155_0FF8FB9903C149D8"/>
are the purſuits of this life, has beſtowed upon us the means of ſeeking the permanent happineſs of that which is to come. Cheer up, my Amelia! The errors of our conduct may expoſe us to the ſcandal of the world, but it is guilt alone which can violate the inward tranquility of the mind." He then took her hand, and attempted to lead her to the door. "Let us withdraw from this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſcene, my love!"—"Look there!" ſaid Amelia, pointing to the corpſe. "Look there!" "Ah!" ſaid Horatio, in a faultering accent-"but it is the will of Heaven!" "Then it is right," cried Amelia—"give the poor victim a little earth—ſir! is it not ſad to think of?—but I am reconciled." She now conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit the room, and was conveyed in a carriage to the inn, at which Horatio (who immediately returned to ſuperintend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment of the child) had ſtopped on his arrival.</p>
                  <p>It is now proper to inform the reader, that after Amelia had left the Cottage, and the alarm of her elopement had ſpread around the neighbourhood, the Farmer haſtened to communicate to Horatio the tranſactions which he had witneſſed, and the ſuſpicions which his wife had conceived of Amelia's ſituation. The wretched father ſickened at the tale. But it was the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033741_0156_0FF8FB9A9F9E1DC0"/>
of compaſſion, and not of reſentment, that oppreſſed his ſoul. There are men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſo abject in their ſubjection to the opinion of the world, that they can ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice natural affection to artificial pride, and doom to perpetual infamy and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a child, who might be reclaimed from error by parental admonition, or raiſed from deſpair by the foſtering hand of friendſhip. Horatio, however, entertained a different ſenſe: he regarded not the weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue as an object of accuſation, but liberally diſtinguiſhed between the crimes and the errors of mankind; and, when he could not alleviate the afflicted, or correct the vicious, he continued to lament, but he forebore to reprobate, "My poor Amelia! how baſely has her innocence been betrayed! —But I muſt follow her:—it may be her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries have diſtracted her, and ſhe has fled, ſhe knows not whither! Come! not a moment ſhall be loſt: I will overtake my child, wherever her ſorrows may lead her: for, if I cannot procure redreſs for her wrongs, I will, at leaſt, adminiſter comfort to her miſeries." Such was the language of Horatio, as ſoon as he could exerciſe the power of utterance. A few days enabled him to arrange his affairs, and having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033741_0157_0FF8FB9D8D016050"/>
the route which Amelia had taken, he embarked in the firſt veſſel for England. The peculiar object of his voyage, and the nature of his misfortunes, determined him to conceal himſelf from the knowledge of his friends and correſpondents; and a lucky chance diſcovered the wretched abode of his Amelia, the very inſtant of his arrival in London.</p>
                  <p>"Can you tell me, ny good hoſt, where Doliſcus the lord—, reſides?" ſaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio as he entered the inn. "Marry, that I can," replied the landlord:" his ſervant is juſt now talking with my wife; and if you will ſtep into the next room, perhaps he will ſhow you the way to the houſe." Horatio ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the room door, and, upon looking through a glaſs pannel in the door, he beheld the identical ſervant that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Doliſcus at the Cottage, in eager converſation with the hoſteſs. He pauſed. "She is delivered; but the child is dead:" —ſaid the ſervant. Horatio ſtarted; his imagination eagerly interpreted theſe words to have been ſpoken of Amelia, and he could ſcarcely reſtrain the anguiſh of his feelings from loud exclamation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.—"My lord's conſcience grows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſually troubleſome" continued the ſervant;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033741_0158_0FF8FBA00EDC13C0"/>
"he has ordered me again to inquire after her health, and to provide for the funeral of the child—would ſhe were ſafe in America! for, to be ſure, her father is the beſt old man that ever lived!" "It's well!" cried Horatio. "Did you call, ſir?" ſaid the hoſteſs, opening the door. The ſervant took this opportunity of withdrawing, and Horatio ſilently followed him, at a diſtance, till he arrived at the habitation of Amelia, in the critical moment which enabled him to ſave the life he had given, and to reſcue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded daughter from the deſperate ſin of ſuicide.</p>
                  <p>When Horatio returned to the inn, after diſcharging the laſt ſolemn duties to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted infant, the landlord preſented a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, which a ſervant had juſt left at the bar, and aſked if he was the perſon to whom it was addreſſed. As ſoon as Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio had caſt his eye upon the ſuperſcription, he exclaimed, "What myſtery is this?—A letter left for my ſon Honorius at an inn in London." He eagerly ſeized the paper, and retiring into an adjoining chamber, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed its contents with increaſed amazement and agitation.</p>

                  <p>The voice of Honorius, inquiring for the letter, rouſed Horatio from the reverie into which its contents had plunged him. The honour of his ſon, the villainy of his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, and Amelia's ſufferings, contending with the feelings of the father, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the chriſtian, at laſt prevailed with him to ſuffer the hoſtile interview to which Doliſcus had thus conſented. When therefore Honorius entered the room, and the natural expreſſions of tenderneſs and ſurprize were mutually exchanged, they freely diſcourſed of the lamentable hiſtory of Amelia, and warmly execrated that treachery which had accompliſhed the ruin of her peace and fame. Nor had Doliſcus confined his baſeneſs to this object. The chance of war had thrown Honorius into his power ſhortly after his departure from the cottage, and diſcovering his affinity to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033741_0160_0FF8FBA25697EB98"/>
the perſevering hypocrite artfully inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated to the commander in chief, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius meditated an eſcape, and obtained an order for his impriſonment on board a frigate, which ſailing ſuddenly for England, he was lodged upon his arrival, in the common gaol, appropriated for the confinement of American priſoners. Here it was, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he acquired the information of Amelia's elopement, and heard the cauſe to which it was imputed from the captured maſter of an American veſſel, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been employed in the ſervice of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, and had received the communication from the lips of his ancient patron, in the firſt moments of his grief. The fate which had unexpectedly led him to Britain, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius now regarded as the miniſter of his revenge. He frowned away the tear which ſtarted at the recital of his ſiſter's wrongs, as if aſhamed to pity 'till he had redreſſed them; and feeling, upon this occaſion, an additional motive for ſoliciting his freedom, he employed the intereſt of Horatio's name, which notwithſtanding the political feuds that prevailed, was ſufficient, at length, to procure his diſcharge upon parol. Having eaſily learned the abode of Doliſcus, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addreſſed that note to him which
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033741_0161_0FF8FBA499C09720"/>
produced the anſwer delivered to Horatio.</p>
                  <p>When Honorius was informed that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia was, at that time, beneath the ſame roof, he expreſſed an eager deſire immediately to embrace his afflicted ſiſter; but Horatio ſtrongly repreſented the impropriety of an interview 'till the event of the aſſignation with Doliſcus was aſcertained, and it was, therefore, agreed for the preſent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his arrival from her knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Abſorbed in the melancholy of her thoughts, Amelia had not uttered a ſyllable ſince the removal from her dreary habitation, but ſuffered the buſy attention of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the inn, with a liſtleſs indifference. The agitation of her mind, indeed, had hitherto rendered her inſenſible to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her frame; but exhauſted nature, at length produced the ſymptoms of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching fever, and compelled her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, to retire to her bed. When Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio entered the room, the fever had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably increaſed, he therefore requeſted the aſſiſtance of a neighbouring phyſician, who pronounced her ſituation to be criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dangerous. In the evening, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual vivacity of her eyes, the incoherence of her ſpeech, and repeated peals of loud and vacant laughter, proved the diſordered
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033741_0162_0FF8FBA6DE55EE20"/>
ſtate of her underſtanding, and increaſed the apprehenſions of her attendants. "A few hours will decide her fate," ſaid the Doctor, as he left the room. "My poor Amelia!" cried Horatio, raiſing her hand to his lips—ſhe looked ſternly at him for a moment, then relaxing the ſeverity of her features, ſhe again burſt into a boiſterous laugh, which terminated in a long and heavy ſigh, as if her ſpirits were exhauſted with the violence of her exertions.</p>
                  <p>The taſk which Horatio had now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, was difficult indeed! The virtue and fortitude of his ſoul could hardly ſuſtain a conflict againſt the grief and paſſion that conſumed him; whilſt on the one hand, he beheld the diſtraction of his daughter, and, on the other, anticipated the danger of his ſon. He reſolved, however, to keep Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's indiſpoſition a ſecret from Honorius, with whom he arranged the dreadful buſineſs of the morning, and, having fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his bleſſing there, he returned to paſs the night in prayer and watching by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's ſide.</p>
                  <p>Honorius retired to his chamber, but not to reſt. It was not, however, the danger of the approaching combat, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a moment's anxiety or reflection; for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033741_0163_0FF8FBA95734EEE8"/>
his courage was ſuperior to every conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſonal ſafety. But that courage had hitherto been regulated by a ſenſe of obligation conſiſtent with the precepts of religion—he had often exerted it to deſerve the glorious meed of a ſoldier, but he ſcorned to employ it for the contemptible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a duelliſt; it had taught him to ſerve his country, but not to offend his God. "If there is a cauſe which can juſtify the act, is it not mine? 'Tis not a punctilious honour, a viſionary inſult, or a petulant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that influences my conduct:" ſaid Honorius, as he muſed upon the ſubject. "A ſiſter baſely tricked of her innocence and fame, a father ungratefully plundered of his peace and hopes, in the laſt ſtage of an honourable life, and myſelf (but that is little) treacherouſly tranſported to a remote and inhoſpitable land—theſe are my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and Heaven, Doliſcus, be the judge between us!"</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the dawn appeared, Honorius repaired to the place of appointment, where a few minutes before the hour, Doliſcus had likewiſe arrived. He was attended by a friend, but perceiving his antagoniſt alone, he requeſted his companion to withdraw to a diſtant ſpot, from which he might obſerve
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033741_0164_0FF8FBABA0961E08"/>
the event, and afford aſſiſtance to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed party.</p>
                  <p>"Once more we meet, Sir," ſaid Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, "upon the buſineſs of death; but that fortune which failed you in your country's cauſe, maybe more propitious in your own." "What pity it is," exclaimed Honorius,
<q>that thou ſhould'ſt be a villain, for thou art brave!</q>
"Nay, I come to offer a more ſubſtantial revenge for the wrongs I have committed, than merely ſubmitting to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſo groſs an epithet—take it, Sir,— it is my life." They inſtantly engaged. Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus for awhile defended himſelf with ſuperior addreſs, but laying, himſelf ſuddenly open to the paſs of his antagoniſt, he received his ſword in the left breaſt, a little below the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat of the heart!</p>
                  <p>"Nobly done," cried Doliſcus as he fell, "it is the vengeance of Amelia; and oh! may it ſerve to expiate the crime of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer." His friend who had attentively viewed the ſcene, advanced, when he ſaw him on the ground: and aſſiſted by Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, bore him to a carriage which had been directed to attend within call. He was then conveyed to the houſe of an eminent ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who having ordered the neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, examined the wound, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033741_0165_0FF8FBADE3FC5378"/>
pronounced it to be mortal." "Fly, ſir," ſaid Doliſcus, turning to Honorius, at this intelligence—"your country will afford you an aſylum, and protect you from the conſequences of my fate. I beſeech you embitter not my laſt moments with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of your danger—but bear with you to the injured Amelia, the ſtory of my repentance, and, if you dare, aſk her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me." The reſentments of Honorius were ſubdued; he preſented his hand to the dying Doliſcus, in whoſe eye a gleam of joy was kindled at the thought, but it was quickly ſuperceded by a cold and ſudden tremour; he attempted, but in vain, to ſpeak; he ſeized the offered hand; he preſſed it eagerly to his lips, and in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that expreſſive action, he expired.</p>
                  <p>Honorius now haſtened to inform Horatio of this fatal event, and to contrive the means of eſcape. But when he returned to the inn, confuſion and diſtreſs were pictured on every face; a wild, but harmonious, voice, occaſionally broke forth into melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtrains, and the name of Doliſcus was repeatedly pronounced in accents of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſion.—"How is it my ſon?" cried Horatio eagerly. "Doliſcus is no more!" replied Honorius. "Would he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033741_0166_0FF8FBB0266A7518"/>
had lived another day! I wiſhed not the ruin of his ſoul." "But he repented, ſir." "Then heaven be merciful!" exclaimed Horatio.</p>
                  <p>Here their converſation was interrupted, by the melodious chauntings of Amelia.</p>
                  <l>I'll have none of your flow'rs tho' ſo blooming and ſweet;</l>
                  <l>Their ſcent, it may poiſon, and falſe is their hue;</l>
                  <l>I tell you begone! for I ne'er ſhall forget,</l>
                  <l>That Doliſcus was lovely and treacherous too.</l>
                  <p>Honorius liſtened attentively to the ſong; it vibrated in his ear, and ſwelled the aching artery of his heart. "Come on!" ſaid Horatio leading him to Amelia's chamber. They found her ſitting on the bed, with a pillow before her, over which ſhe moved her fingers, as if playing on a harpſichord. Their entrance diſturbed her for a moment, but ſhe ſoon reſumed her employment.</p>
                  <l>He ſaid and he ſwore he lov'd me true:—was it a lover's part,</l>
                  <l>To ruin good Horatio's peace and break Amelia's heart?</l>
                  <p>A heavy ſigh followed theſe lines, which were articulated in a wiſtful and ſympathetic tone, and ſhe ſunk exhauſted on her bed. —In a few minutes, however, ſhe ſtarted
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033741_0167_0FF8C210822BF050"/>
from this ſtill and ſilent ſtate, and having gazed with a wild and aching eye around the room, ſhe uttered a loud and piercing cry —it was the awful ſignal of her diſſolution —and her injured ſpirit took its everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flight.</p>
                  <p>The reader will excuſe a minute deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſucceeding ſcenes. The alarm raiſed by the death of Doliſcus compelled Honorius to quicken his departure, and he joined the ſtandard of America a few hours before the battle of Monmouth, in which, for the ſervice of his country, he ſacrificed a life that misfortune had then taught him to conſider of no other uſe or eſtimation.</p>
                  <p>As for the venerable Horatio—having carried with him to the cottage the remains of his darling child, in a melancholy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he conſumes the time; his only buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meditation and prayer; his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation a daily viſit to the monument, which he has raiſed in commemoration of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's fate; and all his conſolation reſting in this aſſurance, that whatever may be the ſufferings of virtue HERE, its portion muſt be happineſs HEREAFTER.</p>

                  <head>HISTORY OF AMELIA, OR MALEVOLENCE DEFEATED.</head>
                  <p>MRS. Winifrid Wormwood was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ruſtic merchant, who, by the happy union of many lucrative trades, amaſſed an enormous fortune. His family conſiſted of three girls, and Winifrid was the eldeſt: Long before ſhe was twenty, ſhe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with lovers, ſome probably attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſplendid proſpect of her expected portion, and others truly captivated by her perſonal graces; for her perſon was elegant, and her elegance was enlivened with peculiar vivacity. Mr. Wormwood was commonly called a kind parent, and an honeſt man; and he might deſerve, indeed, thoſe honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appellations, if it were not a profanation of language to apply them to a narrow and a ſelfiſh ſpirit. He indulged his daughters in many expenſive amuſements, becauſe it flattered his pride; but his heart was engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033741_0169_0FF8FBB269F02138"/>
by the proffits of his extenſive traffic: He turned, with the moſt repulſive aſperity, from every propoſal that could lead him to diminiſh his capital, and thought his daughters unreaſonable, if they wiſhed for any permanent ſatisfaction above that of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their father increaſe in opulence and ſplendor. His two younger children, who inherited from their diſeaſed mother a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der delicacy of frame, languiſhed and died at an early period of life, and the death of one of them was imputed, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to a ſevere diſappointment in her firſt affection. The more ſprightly Wini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid, whoſe heart was a perfect ſtranger to genuine love, ſurmounted the mortification of ſeeing many ſuitors diſcarded; and by the inſenſate avarice of her father, ſhe was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally led into habits of artifice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue. Poſſeſſing an uncommon ſhare of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhrewd and piercing wit, with the moſt profound hypocriſy, ſhe contrived to pleaſe, and to blind, her plodding old parent; who perpetually harangued on the diſcretion of his daughter, and believed her a miracle of reſerve and prudence, at the very time when ſhe was ſuſpected of ſuch conduct as would have diſqualified her, had it ever been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the rank ſhe now holds in this eſſay.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033741_0170_0FF8FBB72EE6E988"/>
She was ſaid to have amuſed herſelf with a great variety of amorous adventures, which eluded the obſervation of her father; but of the many lovers who ſighed to her in ſecret, not one could tempt her into marriage, and, to the ſurpriſe of the public, the rich heireſs of Mr. Wormwood reached the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven, without changing her name. Juſt as ſhe arrived at this mature ſeaſon of life, the opulent old gentleman took his leave of a world, in which he had acted a buſy part, pleaſed with the idea of leaving a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as a monument of his induſtry, but wanting the ſuperior ſatisfation, which a more generous parent would probably have derived from the happy eſtabliſhment of a daughter. He gained, however, from the hypocriſy of Winifrid, what he could not claim from her affection, the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamented with a profuſion of tears. She di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033741_0171_0FF8FBB973DABC08"/>
ſupport the utmoſt efforts of provincial ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Miſs Wormwood now expected to ſee every batchelor of figure and conſequence a ſuppliant at her feet; ſhe promiſed to herſelf no little entertainment in ſporting with their addreſſes, without the fear of ſuffering from a tyrannical huſband, as ſhe had learned cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her father, and had privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to truſt any man with her money; a reſolution the more diſcreet, as ſhe had much to apprehend, and very little to learn, from ſo dangerous a maſter! The good-natured town, in whoſe environs the rich Winifrid reſided, very kindly pointed out to her no leſs than twenry lively beaux for her choice; but, to the ſhame or the honour of thoſe gentlemen, they were too timid, or, too honeſt, to make any advances. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her youthful frolics, and the dread of her ſarcaſtic wit, had more power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than her perſon and her wealth had to attract. Paſſing her fiftieth year, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſerious name of miſtreſs, without the dignity of a wife, and without receiving a ſingle offer of marriage from the period in which ſhe became the poſſeſſor of ſo opulent a fortune.</p>
                  <p>Whether this mortifying diſappointment had given a peculiar aſperity to her temper
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033741_0172_0FF8FBBBEEBD6C70"/>
or whether malevolence was the earlier cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of her mind, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that from this autumnal or rather wintry ſeaſon of her life, Mrs. Wormwood made it her chief occup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to amuſe herſelf with the moſt ſubtle devices of malicious ingenuity, and to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate every promiſing ſcheme of affection and delight, which ſhe diſcovered in the wide circle of her acquaintance. She ſeemed to be tormented with an inceſſant dread, that youth and beauty might ſecure to themſelves that happineſs, which ſhe found wit and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were unable to beſtow; hence ſhe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the moſt piercing eye, all the lovely young women of her neighbourhood, and often inſinuated herſelf into the confidence of many, that ſhe might penetrate all the ſecrets of their love, and privately blaſt its ſucceſs. She was enabled to render herſelf intimate with the young and the lovely, by the opulent ſplendor in which ſhe lived, and by the bewitching vivacity of her converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her talents of this kind were, indeed, extraordinary; her mind was never poliſhed or enriched by literature, as Mr. Wormwood ſet little value on any books, excepting thoſe of his counting-houſe; and the earlier years of his daughter were too much engaged by
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033741_0173_0FF8FBBDD2D0F4A0"/>
duplicity and intrigue, to leave her either leiſure or inclination for a voluntary attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to more improving ſtudies. She read very little, and was acquainted with no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but her own; yet a brilliant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and an uncommon portion of ready wit, ſupplied her with a more alluring fund of converſation, than learning could beſtow. She chiefly recommended herſelf to the young and inexperienced, by the inſinuating charm of the moſt lively ridicule, and by the art of ſeaſoning her diſcourſe with want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton inuendos of ſo ſubtle a nature, that gravity knew not how to object to them: She had the ſingular faculty of throwing ſuch a ſoft and dubious twilight over the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious images, that they captivated curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and attention, without exciting either fear or diſguſt. Her malevolence was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually diſguiſed under the maſk of gaiety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe completely poſſeſſed that plauſibility of malice, ſo difficult to attain, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly recommended in the words of lady Macbeth:</p>

With a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in malice, ſhe firſt encouraged, and afterwards defeated, thoſe amuſing matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial projects, which the young and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful are ſo apt to entertain.

gallant youth, who unhappily loſt his own life in preſerving that of his dear friend, her brother: ſhe devoted herſelf to his memory with the moſt tender, unaffected, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable attachment; refuſing ſeveral advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous offers of marriage, though her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was ſo narrow, that neceſſity obliged her to convert her whole fortune into an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, juſt before the calamitous event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which made her the only guardian of poor Amelia. This lovely, but unfortunate girl, was turned of fourteen on the death of her father. She found, in the houſe of his ſiſter, the moſt friendly aſylum, and a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe heart and mind made her moſt able and willing to form the character of this engaging orphan, who appeared to be as highly favoured by nature, as ſhe was perſecuted by fortune. The beauty of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia was ſo ſtriking, and the charms of her lively underſtanding began to diſplay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo enchanting a manner, that her affectionate aunt could not bear the idea of placing her in any lower order of life: ſhe gave her the education of a gentlewoman, in the flattering and generous hope, that her various attractions muſt ſupply the abſolute want of fortune, and that ſhe ſhould enjoy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſettled in marriage, before her death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her lovely ward to that poverty, which was her only inheritance.—Heaven diſpoſed it otherwiſe. This amiable woman, after having acted the part of a moſt affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died before Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now apparently deſtitute of every reſource; and expoſed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the loſs of a moſt indulgent protector. A widow lady of her acquaintance very kindly afforded her a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the firſt moments of her diſtreſs, and propoſed to two of her opulent friends, that Amelia ſhould reſide with them by turns, dividing the year between them, and paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four months with each. As ſoon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as ſhe delighted in thoſe oſtentatious acts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent beneficence, which are falſely called charity, ſhe deſired to be admitted among the voluntary guardians of the poor Amelia. To this propoſal all the parties aſſented, and it was ſettled, that Amelia ſhould paſs the laſt quarter of every year, as long as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſingle, under the roof of Mrs. Wormwood, This lovely orphan had a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of heart, which rendered her extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grateful for the protection ſhe received,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033741_0177_0FF8C212B0A83CE0"/>
but which made her ſeverely feel all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of dependance. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, preſuming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wounded her ingenuous pride. Her perſon, her mind, her manners were univerſally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife, "Amelia (they cried) is an enchanting creature; but who, in theſe times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, ſupported by charity?" Though this prudential queſtion was never uttered in the preſence of Amelia, ſhe began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its influence, and ſuffered a painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to thoſe friends, by whoſe generoſity ſhe ſubſiſted; ſhe wiſhed, a thouſand times, that her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate aunt, inſtead of cultivating her mind with ſuch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any ſtation of life, where ſhe might have maintained herſelf by her own manual labour: ſhe ſometimes entertained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of making ſome attempt for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſhe once thought of changing her name, and of trying to ſupport herſelf as an actreſs on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her honeſt pride had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033741_0178_0FF8FBC7C06F1968"/>
was effectually ſuppreſſed by her modeſty; and ſhe continued to waſte the moſt precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetualy wiſhing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almoſt two years had now elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince the death of her aunt, and without any proſpect of marriage, ſhe was now in her ſecond period of reſidence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's underſtanding was by no means inferior to her other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſhe began to penetrate all the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſguiſe, and to gain a perfect and very painful inſight into the real character of her preſent hoſteſs. This lady had remarked, that when Miſs Nevil reſided with her, her houſe was much more frequented by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, than at any other ſeaſon. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was true; and it unluckily happened, that theſe viſitors often forgot to applaud the ſmart ſayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the ſweet countenance of Amelia; a circumſtance full ſufficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the moſt bitter envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood deteſted her lovely gueſt with the moſt implacable virulence; but ſhe had the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular art of diſguiſing her deteſtation in the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033741_0179_0FF8FBCA03B562F8"/>
language of flattery: ſhe underſtood the truth of Pope's maxim,</p>
                  <p>"<hi>He hurts me moſt who laviſhly commends.</hi>" and ſhe therefore made uſe of laviſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, as an inſtrument of malevolence towards Amelia; ſhe inſulted the taſte, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared herſelf convinced, that he was a fool, becauſe he had not choſen that moſt lovely young woman. To more than one gentleman ſhe ſaid, you muſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Amelia; and, as few men chuſe to be driven into wedlock, ſome offers were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevented, by the treacherous vehem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her praiſe. Her malice, however, was not ſufficiently gratified by obſerving that Amelia had no proſpect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, ſhe reſolved to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe this unhappy girl with the hopes of ſuch a joyous event, and then to turn, on a ſudden, all theſe ſplendid hopes into mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deluſion. Accident led her to pitch on Mr. Nelſon, as a perſon whoſe name ſhe might with the greateſt ſafety employ, as the inſtrument of her inſidious deſign, and with the greater chance of ſucceſs, as ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard. Mr. Nelſon was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who, having met with very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033741_0180_0FF8FBCC45051C48"/>
events, had contracted a great, but very amiable ſingularity of character:—he was placed early in life, in a very lucrative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſituation, and was on the point of ſettling happily in marriage with a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young lady, when the houſe, in which ſhe reſided, was conſumed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the deſtined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in looſing the object of his ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by ſo ſudden a calamity, loſt for ſome time the uſe of his reaſon; and when his health and ſenſes returned, he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the oppreſſion of the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had loſt in ſo ſevere a manner, ſuggeſted to his fancy a ſingular plan of benevolence, in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which he recovered a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his former ſpirits. This plan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſearching for female objects of charity, whoſe diſtreſſes had been occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private expences very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he was able to relieve many unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted itſelf with the idea, that in theſe uncommon acts of beneficence he was guided by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033741_0181_0FF8FBCE8A4AFE98"/>
of that lovely angel, whoſe mortal beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had periſhed in the flames. Mr. Nelſon frequently viſited a married ſiſter, who was ſettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood reſided. There was alſo, in the ſame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular eſteem. This lady, whoſe name was Melford, had been left in very ſcanty circumſtances on the death of her huſband, and reſided at that time in London, where ſhe had been involved in additional diſtreſs by that calamity, to which the attentive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mr. Nelſon was forever directed: he more than repaired the loſs which ſhe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by fire, and aſſiſted in ſettling her in the neighbourhood of his ſiſter. Mrs. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was ſtill the moſt valuable friend of that lovely orphan, who paid her frequent viſits, though ſhe never reſided under her roof. Mr. Nelſon had often ſeen Amelia at the houſe of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politeneſs, whenever he viſited Mrs. Wormwood; a circumſtance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She perfectly knew all the ſingular private hiſtory of Mr. Nelſon, and firmly believed, like all the reſt of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but ſhe thought
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033741_0182_0FF8FBD10B03AFD8"/>
it poſſible to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his reſolution; and nothing ſhe ſuppoſed, could more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually mortify her gueſt, than to find herſelf derided for ſo vain an expectation.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to inſinuate, in the moſt artful manner, that Mr. Nelſon was very particular in his civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities to Amelia, magnified all his amiable qualities, and expreſſed the greateſt pleaſure in the proſpect of ſo delightful a match. Theſe petty artifices, however, had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the natural modeſty and diffidence of Amelia; ſhe ſaw nothing that authoriſed ſuch an idea in the uſual politeneſs of a well-bred man of thirty-ſeven; ſhe pitied the misfortune, ſhe admired the elegant and engaging, though ſerious manners, and ſhe revered the virtues of Mr. Nelſon; but, ſuppoſed his mind to be entirely engroſſed, as it really was, by his ſingularly charitable purſuits; ſhe entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired, in her youth, the very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous talent of forging any hand that ſhe pleaſed; and her paſſion for miſchief had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her much practice in this treacherous
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033741_0183_0FF8FBD2A66AE278"/>
art. Having previouſly and ſecretly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Mr. Nelſon to drink tea with her, ſhe wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the moſt perfect imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hand. The billet ſaid, that he deſigned himſelf the pleaſure of paſſing that afternoon at the houſe of Mrs. Wormwood, and requeſted the favour of a private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Miſs Nevil in the courſe of the evening, intimating, in the moſt delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent deſire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her huſband. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia ſhould not receive this billet till juſt before dinner-time, that ſhe might not ſhow it to her friend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect its fallacy before the hour of her intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humiliation arrived.</p>
                  <p>Amelia bluſhed in reading the note, and, in the firſt ſurpriſe of unſuſpecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood; who burſt into vehement expreſſions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; congratulated her bluſhing gueſt on the full ſucceſs of her charms, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her own prophetic diſcernment. They ſat down to dinner, but poor Amelia could hardly ſwallow a morſel; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of pleaſure and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. The malicious impoſter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying her confuſion, allowed her no time
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033741_0184_0FF8FBD598231B90"/>
to compoſe her hurried ſpirits in the ſolitude of her chamber. Some female viſitors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to tea; and, at length, Mr. Nelſon entered the room. Amelia trembled and bluſhed as he approached her; but ſhe was a little relieved from her embarraſſment by the buſineſs of the tea-table, over which ſhe preſided. Amelia was naturally graceful in every thing ſhe did, but the preſent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her mind gave a temporary awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to all her motions: ſhe committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politeneſs of Mr. Nelſon led him to ſay ſo many kind and graceful things to her on theſe petty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that, inſtead of encreaſing her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, they produced an oppoſite effect, and the tumult of her boſom gradually ſubſided into a calm and compoſed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nelſon, and thought them expreſſive of that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which promiſed a happy end to all her misfortunes. At the idea of exchanging miſery and dependance for comfort and honor, as the wife of ſo amiable a man, her heart expanded with the moſt innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and gave ſuch an exquiſite radiance to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033741_0185_0FF8C2159BB05D18"/>
all her features, that ſhe looked a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Wormwood ſaw this improvement of her charms, and, ſickening at the ſight, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reduce the ſplendor of ſuch inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable beauty, and haſtily terminate the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of her deluded gueſt. She began with a few malicious and ſarcaſtic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes, which they frequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of an imaginary lover; but finding theſe remarks produced not the effect ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſhe took an opportunity of whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations, for the billet ſhe had received was a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and a mere piece of pleaſantry. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia ſhuddered, and turned pale: ſurpriſe, diſappointment, and indignation, conſpired to overwhelm her. She exerted her utmoſt power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her boſom was too violent to be diſguiſed. The tears, which ſhe vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſuppreſs, burſt forth, and ſhe was obliged to quit the room in very viſible diſorder. Mr. Nelſon expreſſed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; but he was checked in his benevolent inquiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who ſaid; on the occaſion, that Miſs Nevil
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033741_0186_0FF8FBD7DB81EE60"/>
was a very amiable girl, but ſhe had ſome peculiarities of temper and was apt to put a wrong conſtruction on the innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry of her friends. Mr. Nelſon obſerving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might contribute to reſtore the interrupted harmony of the houſe, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult, like a fiend, over that lovely vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of her ſucceſsful malignity. She found not the perſon whom ſhe was ſo eager to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. Amelia had, indeed, retired to her chamber, and paſſed there a very miſerable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and ſtill more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which ſhe condemned with that exceſs of ſeverity ſo natural to a delicate mind in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning itſelf. She would have flown for immediate conſolation to her friend, Mrs. Melford, but ſhe had reaſon to believe that lady engaged on a viſit, and ſhe therefore reſolved to take a ſolitary walk for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of compoſing her ſpirits; but neither ſolitude nor exerciſe could reſtore her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; and, as it grew late in the evening, ſhe haſtened to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her returned. Her worthy old
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033741_0187_0FF8FBDA592BAE08"/>
confidant was, indeed, in her little parlour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſtreſs; and the old lady, with her uſual tenderneſs, exclaimed, "Good heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becauſe," replied Amelia, in a broken voice, and burſting into a freſh ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of tears, "becauſe I am a fool?"—Mrs. Melford began to be moſt ſeriouſly alarmed, and, expreſſing her maternal ſolicitude in the kindeſt manner. Amelia produced the fatal paper—"There," ſays ſhe, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nelſon; it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been ſuch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who in her firſt alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was herſelf greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in diſcovering the truth, and ſaid many kind things to conſole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Amelia, "that I am fooliſhly in love with Mr. Nelſon, though I think him the moſt pleaſing as well as the moſt excellent, of men; and though I confeſs to you, that I ſhould certainly think it a bleſſed lot to find a refuge from the miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry of my preſent dependance, in the arms of ſo benevolent and ſo generous
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033741_0188_0FF8FBDBF456F4D0"/>
a protector."—"Thoſe arms are now open to receive you," ſaid a voice that was heard before the ſpeaker appeared. Amelia ſtarted at the ſound, and her ſurpriſe was not a little encreaſed in ſeeing Mr. Nelſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who entering the room from an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tranſport of tenderneſs and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine modeſty, was for ſome minutes more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtreſſed by this ſurpriſe, than ſhe had been by her paſt mortification: ſhe was ready to ſink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her ſecret to the man, from whom ſhe would have laboured moſt to conceal it. In the firſt tumult of this delicate confuſion, ſhe ſinks into a chair, and hides her face in her handkerchief. Nelſon with a mixture of reſpect and love, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of encreaſing her diſtreſs, ſeizes one of her hands, and continues to kiſs it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, almoſt as much aſtoniſhed, but leſs painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuſed than Amelia, beholds this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſcene with that kind of joy which is much more diſpoſed to weep than to ſpeak —And, while this little party is thus abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſilence, let me haſten to relate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which produced their ſituation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:033741_0189_0FF8C1F76E374C80"/>Mr. Nelſon had obſerved the ſarcaſtic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, and, as ſoon as he had ended his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable viſit, he haſtened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her ſome little account of what had paſſed, and to concert with her ſome happier plan for the ſupport of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, inſulted orphan. "I am acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," ſaid he, "with ſome brave and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy officers, who have ſerved with the father of Miſs Nevil, and often ſpeak of him with reſpect; I am ſure I can raiſe among them a ſubſcription for the maintenance of this tender unfortunate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that ſhall enable her to eſcape from ſuch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a ſervant." Mrs. Melford was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at this idea; and, recollecting all her obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his generoſity; and, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amelia at ſome diſtance, through a bow window, which commanded the ſtreet in which ſhe lived, "thank Heaven," ſhe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "here comes my poor child, to hear and bleſs you for the extent of your goodneſs." Nelſon, who delighted moſt in doing good by ſtealth, immediately extorted from the good old lady a promiſe of ſecrecy: it was the beſt part of his plan, that Amelia ſhould
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033741_0190_0FF8FBE1556E05E0"/>
never know the perſons to whom ſhe was to owe her independence. "I am ſtill afraid of you, my worthy old friend," ſaid Nelſon "your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Miſs Nevil ſees me here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night."—"Well," ſaid the delighted old la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, "I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will, probably, not ſtay with me ten min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes; you may amuſe yourſelf, for that time, in my ſpacious garden; I will not ſay you are here; and, as ſoon as the good girl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."— "Admirably ſettled," cried Nelſon; and he immediately retreated into a little back room, which led into a long ſlip of ground, embelliſhed with the ſweeteſt and leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amuſement to Mrs. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Nelſon, after taking a few turns in this diminutive garden, finding himſelf ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chilled by the air of the evening, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again into the little parlour he had paſſed, intending to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely ſlight, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the tender confeſſions of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irreſiſtible impulſe, in the manner already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:033741_0191_0FF8FBE3123B4450"/>Mrs. Melford was the firſt who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by their general ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; and ſhe enabled the tender pair, in the proſpect of whoſe union her warm heart exulted, to regain that eaſy and joyous poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their faculties, which they loſt for ſome little time in their embarraſſment. The applauſe of her friend, and the adoration of her lover, ſoon taught the diffident Amelia to think leſs ſeverely of herſelf. The warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Mrs. Melford declared that theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences were the work of Heaven. "That," replied the affectionate Nelſon, "I am moſt willing to allow; but you muſt grant, that Heaven has produced our happineſs by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a ſpirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the torment of its poſſeſſor, I muſt beg, that ſhe may not return, even for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle night, to the houſe of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her ſenſe of paſt obligations, and wiſhed to take a peaceful leave of her patroneſs; but ſhe ſubmitted to the urgent entreaties of Nelſon, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when ſhe was united to the man of her heart. Nelſon had the double delight of rewarding
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033741_0192_0FF8FBE5FA4FB048"/>
the affection of an angel, and of puniſhing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in perſon to Mrs. Wormwood, his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when the treacherous Old Maid had amuſed herſelf with the hope of deriding her gueſt; whoſe return ſhe was eagerly expecting, in the very moment Nelſon arrived to ſay, that Amelia would return no more.</p>
                  <p>The ſurpriſe and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aroſe almoſt to frenzy; ſhe racked her malicious and inventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated a report for that purpoſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and deſpiſed. Amelia was not only married, but the moſt admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the moſt beloved, and the happieſt of human beings; an event which preyed ſo inceſſantly on the ſpirit of Mrs- Wormwood, that ſhe fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her miſchievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy life, a memorable example, that the moſt artful malignity may ſometimes procure for the object of its envy, that very happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which it labours to prevent!</p>
