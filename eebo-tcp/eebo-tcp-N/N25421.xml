            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEDRA, who≈øe writings have thrown a lu≈øtre over Spain, amu≈øed Europe, and corrected his century, lived poor, unfortunate, and died almo≈øt forgotten; we were ignorant till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the≈øe few years, of the true place of his birth. Madrid, Seville, Lucene and Alcala, di≈øputed this honour with each other; thus Cervantes, like Homer, Camoens and many other great men, found ≈øeveral countries after his death, and wanted nece≈ø≈øaries during his life.</p>
                  <p>The Spani≈øh academy under the protection

of its ≈øovereign, has at length rendered the memory of Cervantes that homage which Spain has owed him for too long a time; they have publi≈øhed a ≈øplendid edition of Don Quixotte. It ≈øeemed as if they had believed that the magnificence of this publication could repair the injuries that the nation had done its author. His life is at the head, written after the mo≈øt exact re≈øearches, by a di≈øtingui≈øhed academician. I ≈øhall follow this authority, as far as regards facts, permitting my≈øelf to ≈øpeak o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the works of Cervantes, according to the ≈øentiments they have in≈øpired me with.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes was a gentleman, ≈øon to Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Cervantes, and Leonora de Cortinas; he was born at Alcala de Henares, a city of new Ca≈øtile, the 9th day of October 1547, under the reign of the emperor Charles the fifth. From his infancy he loved books; he ≈øtudied in Madrid under a celebrated profe≈ø≈øor, where he very ≈øoon ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed the mo≈øt expert ≈øcholars. The grand ≈øcience of that time was latin and theology; the parents of Cervantes
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033741_0005_0FF8F6AD2E979108"/>
intended to have made him an eccle≈øia≈øtic or a phy≈øician, the only lucrative profe≈ø≈øions in Spain; but he had ≈øtill this trait in common with many celebrated poets, of making ver≈øes in ≈øpight of his parents. An elegy on the death of Queen I≈øabella de Valois, a number of ≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and a little poem called "Filene," were his fir≈øt e≈ø≈øays; the ≈ømall regard that they paid to the≈øe works appeared to him an inju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he left Spain, and went to ≈øettle at Rome, where di≈øtre≈øs forced him to become valet de chambre to Cardinal Aquaviva.</p>
                  <p>Di≈øgu≈øted very ≈øoon with an employment ≈øo little fit for him, Cervantes became a ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and fought with di≈øtingui≈øhed valour in the famous battle of Lepanto, gained by Don John of Au≈øtria, in 1571: he received there a wound in his left hand from a mu≈øquet, of which he was lame all his life;‚Äîas a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for this wound he was put into the common ho≈øpital at Me≈ø≈øina. Having left the ho≈øpital, the trade of an invalid ≈øoldier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him preferable to that of a de≈øpi≈øed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033741_0006_0FF8F6AED19EAE60"/>
poet, he went and enrolled him≈øelf anew in the garri≈øon of Naples, in which city he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained three years. As he was repa≈ø≈øing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spain on board a galley of Philip the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's, he was taken and brought into Algiers, by Arnaut Mami, the mo≈øt renowned of all the cor≈øairs.</p>
                  <p>Fortune, who exhau≈øted her rigours upon the unfortunate Cervantes, could not wear out his courage;‚Äî≈ølave to a cruel ma≈øter, ≈øure of dying in torments if he dur≈øt make the lea≈øt attempt to recover his liberty, he concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his e≈øcape with fourteen Spani≈øh captives. They agreed to redeem one from among them≈øelves who ≈øhould go to his own country, and return with a bark to carry the others dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night; the execution of his project was not very ea≈øy: it was nece≈ø≈øary at fir≈øt to get as much money as ≈øhould pay for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom of one of the pri≈øoners, afterwards to e≈øcape from the hou≈øes of their different ma≈øters, and be able to remain all together, without being di≈øcovered, till the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the bark ≈øhould arrive to carry them
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033741_0007_0FF8F6B1ED305048"/>
away. So many difficulties appeared in≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable; the love of liberty brought it all about. A captive, a native of Navarre, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by his ma≈øter in cultivating a large gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the borders of the ≈øea, took on him≈øelf the ta≈øk of hollowing out a cave in the mo≈øt retired part of the garden, capable of containing the fifteen Spaniards; he ≈øpent two years in this work, during which time they gained, what with alms and hard work, the ran≈øom of a Majorcan, named Viane, who≈øe fidelity they were ≈øure of, and who knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well all the coa≈øt of Barbary. The money being ready, and the cave being fini≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was nece≈ø≈øary to wait yet ≈øix months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one was prepared to go there; then Viane ran≈øomed him≈øelf, and parted from them, having ≈øworn to return in a little time.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes had been the ≈øoul of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; it was he who expo≈øed him≈øelf every night in ≈øeeking food for his companions; as ≈øoon as day appeared, he retired into the cave
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033741_0008_0FF8F6B66DBD0F88"/>
with provi≈øions enough for the day. The gardener, who was not obliged to conceal him≈øelf, had his eyes continually on the ≈øea, to di≈øcover if the bark was yet come.</p>
                  <p>Viane kept his word; arrived at Majorea, he went to the viceroy, laid his commi≈ø≈øion before him, and demanded his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in favour of the enterpri≈øe; the viceroy gave him a brigatine. Viane, with his heart full of hope, flew to the deliverance of his brothers; he arrived on the coa≈øt of Algiers, the 28th day of September, of that ≈øame year 1577, one month from the day he had left it. Viane had ob≈øerved every place ≈øo well, that he knew them again altho' it was night, he directs his little ve≈ø≈øel towards the garden, where he was expected with ≈øo much impatience. The gardener, who was on the watch, perceived him, and ran to acquaint the captive Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards of it. All their misfortunes are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at this happy news, they embrace each other, they pre≈øs to get out of the cave, they view with tears of joy the bark of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033741_0009_0FF8C175A39661D0"/>
‚Äîbut alas! as the prow touched the ≈øhore, ≈øome Moors were pa≈ø≈øing that way, and knowing the Chri≈øtians, cried out to arms! Viane trembling ≈øpreads his ≈øails, gains the open ≈øea and di≈øappears; the unhappy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, fallen again into their chains, went to weep at the bottom of their cave.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes re-animates them, he made them hope, and flattered him≈øelf that Viane would return again; but Viane returned no more. Grief, and the dampne≈øs of their narrow and unhealthy abode, brought di≈øorders on the≈øe unhappy people. Cervantes was no longer able to procure nece≈ø≈øaries for ≈øome, to take care of others, and to encourage all: he got one of his companions to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, and gave him the charge of providing victuals in his place. The per≈øon he made choice of was a traitor, he went to the King of Algiers, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mu≈ø≈øulman, and led him≈øelf to the cave, a troop of ≈øoldiers, who put the thirteen Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards in irons, and dragged them before the King; that Prince promi≈øed them their lives,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033741_0010_0FF8F6B8E55E19E0"/>
if they would declare who was the author of the enterpri≈øe;‚ÄîIt is I, ≈øaid Cervantes to him, ≈øave my brothers, and put me to death. The King re≈øpects his intrepidity, he gave him back to his ma≈øter Arnaut Mami, who would not put ≈øo brave a man to death.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy gardener, who had made the cave, was hung up by one leg, till his blood ≈ømothered him. Cervantes, deceived by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, betrayed by his friend, and returned to his fir≈øt chains, only became more ardent to break them; four times he failed in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and was on the point of being impaled. His la≈øt effort was to cau≈øe a revolt among all the ≈ølaves in Algiers, and to make him≈øelf ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; they di≈øcovered this con≈øpiracy, yet Cervantes was not put to death;‚Äî≈øo certain it is, that true courage will make it≈øelf re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected even among barbarians.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that Cervantes being willing to ≈øpeak of him≈øelf, in the novel of the Captive, one of the mo≈øt intere≈øting in Don Quixotte, ≈øays,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:033741_0011_0FF8F6BB489FEE78"/>
                     <q>That the cruel Azan, King of Algiers was never merciful only to a Spani≈øh ≈øoldier, named Saavedra; who expo≈øed him≈øelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the mo≈øt frightful puni≈øhments, which will not for a long time be forgotten by the infidels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the King of Algiers, willing to be the ma≈øter of ≈øo famous a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, purcha≈øed him from Arnaut Mami, and had him clo≈øely confined. A ≈øhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this Prince being obliged to go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople, demanded from Spain the ran≈øom of his pri≈øoner. The mother of Cervantes, Leonora de Cortinas, a widow and poor, ≈øold all that ≈øhe had, and ran to Madrid, carrying with her three hundred ducats to the fathers of the Trinity, who were charged with the redemption of captives. This money, which was the intire and only fortune of the widow, was far from being ≈øufficient. The King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan would have five hundred crowns of gold; the Trinitarians, touched with compa≈ø≈øion, completed the ≈øum, and Cervantes was ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033741_0012_0FF8F6BFC9869170"/>
the 19th of September 1580, after a ≈ølavery of five years.</p>
                  <p>On his return to Spain, di≈øgu≈øted with a military life, and re≈øolving to deliver him≈øelf up entirely to letters, he retired near his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the fond hope of ≈øupporting her by his works. Cervantes was then thirty three years old, he began with GALATEA, of which he gave but the fir≈øt ≈øix books, and which he never completed. This work ≈øucceeded pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well; the ≈øame year he married Donna Catherine de Palacios, ≈øhe was de≈øcended from a good family, but ≈øhe was poor, and this marriage did not enrich him. To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his family, Cervantes wrote comedies; he a≈ø≈øures us, that they were well received, but very ≈øoon after this, he quitted the theatre for a ≈ømall employment which he obtained at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, where he went to ≈øettle. It was there he wrote tho≈øe novels where he paints ≈øo well the vices of that great city.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes was near fifty years old, when he was obliged to take a journey into La Mancha.

The inhabitants of a little village named Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamazilla, picked a quarrel with him, threw him into pri≈øon, and left him in it a long time; it was there that he began Don Quixotte, he believed that he ≈øhould revenge him≈øelf on tho≈øe who had in≈øulted him, by making their country the country of his hero. He affected in the mean time not to mention once in his romance, the town where he had been ≈øo bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated. He began by giving to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic no more than the fir≈øt part of Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otte, which did not ≈øucceed. Cervantes knew mankind; he publi≈øhed a pamphlet called "The Squib,"‚Äîthis work, which it would be impo≈ø≈øible to find now, even in Spain, ≈øeems to be a critici≈øm on Don Quixotte that covered his ≈ølanderers with ridicule;‚Äîevery one read the ≈øatire, and Don Quixotte obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this bagatelle, the reputation which ≈øince has been due only to it≈øelf.‚ÄîThen all the enemies of good ta≈øte let them≈øelves loo≈øe again≈øt Cervantes.

by his ≈øucce≈øs, than ever he had been by his di≈øgraces, he dur≈øt not venture to give any thing to the public for ≈øeveral years, his ≈øilence added to his mi≈øery without appea≈øing envy. ‚ÄîHappily the Count de Lemos and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Toledo lent him ≈øome ≈øuccours; this protection, which Cervantes con≈øidered as ≈øo valuable, was continued to him almo≈øt to his death, but was never proportioned either to the merit of the protected, nor to the wealth of the protector. Cervantes, to ≈øhow his gratitude to the Count de Lemos, dedicated his novels to him, which appeared eight years after the fir≈øt part of Don Quixotte; the year following he gave his "Voyage to Parna≈ø≈øus," but the≈øe works brought him but little money, and the ≈øuccours of the Count de Lemos were always very weak, ≈øince Cervantes to procure bread was obliged to print eight comedies, which the players had refu≈øed to perform; he ≈øeemed de≈øtined to misfortunes and humiliations of every kind<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

                  <p>This ≈øame year, an Arragonian, who took

the name of d'Avellaneda, wrote a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Don Quixotte; a wretched continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without ta≈øte, without wit, and without gaiety, but in which he ≈øaid many things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to Cervantes;‚Äîthis ≈øort of merit made the book be read. Cervantes replied to it as all the ≈øatires ought to have been replied to: ‚Äîhe publi≈øhed the ≈øecond part of Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otte, ≈øuperior ≈øtill to the fir≈øt, every one was convinced of his merit, but the more they were obliged to render him ju≈øtice, the le≈øs ≈øorry were they that a rival, even de≈øpicable, ≈øhould in≈øult him whom they were forced to admire.‚ÄîSpain is not, perhaps, the only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the world, where malignity ≈øo ≈øevere on good works is always indulgent to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors.

                  <p>The ≈øecond part of Don Quixotte was the la≈øt work printed during his life;‚Äîhe worked ≈øtill at the romance of "Perfiles and Sigi≈ømun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da," when he was attacked by a complaint of

                  <head>OF THE WORKS OF CERVANTES.</head>
                  <p>THE fir≈øt poetical works of Cervantes are not much known, nor do they de≈øerve it;‚Äî his ≈øonnets and elegies are written too much in the ta≈øte of his age‚Äîhis be≈øt work, that which has immortalized his name, is the "Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Don Quixotte;"‚Äîthe judgment, the gaiety, the fine irony diffu≈øed through this work, the great truth of the portraits, the purity, the ≈øimplicity of the ≈øtyle, have rendered this work immortal: I know that it is not equally plea≈øing to all French readers who do not under≈øtand Spani≈øh; this ari≈øes
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033741_0020_0FF8C179EDC8E2E0"/>
from the faults of the only tran≈ølation which we have of it, it is very far from the elegance and the delicacy of the original. The tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator ≈øeems to have con≈øidered Don Quixotte as a common romance, who≈øe ≈øole merit was to be entertaining. He has tran≈ølated the Spani≈øh word by the French one, which he found in the dictionary, without comparing or without chu≈øing; he forgot that in works of humour no word is ≈øynonimous to another; that one word alone is apt, and all others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which he has tran≈ølated the pieces of poetry, of which there are many in Don Quixotte, would per≈øuade us that the Spani≈øh ver≈øes are ridiculous; when, in fact, they are all agreeable‚Äîperhaps too ab≈øtru≈øe.</p>
                  <p>But Cervantes wrote for his nation, who≈øe ta≈øte is different from ours; and the tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who wrote for us, ought, whil≈øt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved the thoughts of Cervantes, to have weakened ≈øome compari≈øons, ≈øoftened ≈øome of the images, and have, above all, given
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033741_0021_0FF8F6D4B77B23E8"/>
≈øweetne≈øs and harmony to the ver≈øes. He appears to have thought of nothing but being literal, and this among the French, is con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a fault. To us almo≈øt all foreign books ≈øeem too long; even Don Quixotte has prolixities and ≈øtrokes of bad ta≈øte, which might be retrenched without the tran≈ølator's meriting the reproach of not being exact; when a work of entertainment is to be tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the tran≈ølation mo≈øt agreeable, is, without doubt, the mo≈øt faithful.</p>
                  <p>Notwith≈øtanding the≈øe faults, the work is ≈øo excellent in it≈øelf, the epi≈øodes ≈øo intere≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the adventures ≈øo comic, that all the world knows it, all the world read it again and again;‚Äîour tape≈øtry, our pictures and our prints, all repre≈øent Don Quixotte to us; and even the children laugh when they ≈øee Sancho Panza.</p>
                  <p>Cervantes's novels fall far ≈øhort of Don Quixotte; he wrote twelve, and four alone are worthy of him,‚Äî"The Curious Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,"
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033741_0022_0FF8F6D71CA494A0"/>
which is in≈øerted in Don Quixotte; "Riconnet and Cortadille," a whim≈øical but true picture of the rogues of Seville:‚Äî"The Force of Blood," the mo≈øt intere≈øting and be≈øt conducted of the whole;‚Äîand "The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Dog?." This la≈øt is a charming piece of critici≈øm, abounding with philo≈øophy and gaiety; the Spani≈øh manners are there drawn with all the accuracy, ≈øimplicity, and ≈øpirit of Cervantes. We have had within tho≈øe few years a French tran≈ølation of the≈øe twelve novels, but they ought to be read in the original.</p>
                  <p>The "Journey to Parna≈ø≈øus," is a poetical work, divided into chapters. Cervantes feigns that Apollo threatened by legions of bad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, ≈øends Mercury into Spain, to a≈ø≈øemble all his favourites, and conduct them to defend Parna≈ø≈øus. Mercury finds Cervantes, and ≈øhows him the li≈øt of tho≈øe whom Apollo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, and of their adver≈øaries. It is evident what a fine opportunity this fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave a man of wit to be revenged on the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033741_0023_0FF8F6DBA28A6458"/>
dunces who had in≈øulted him. This work is not very agreeable, nor can we reli≈øh it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I know not any tran≈ølation of this, nor of his comedies; they are eight in number, and Cervantes ≈øays in his prologue, that he had written twenty or thirty; this uncertainty mu≈øt appear wonderful to tho≈øe who know how difficult it is to write even one comedy;‚Äîbe that as it may, tho≈øe which are pre≈øerved, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øh our regret for tho≈øe that are lo≈øt. I have read them all with attention, none of them are tolerable; unintere≈øting, badly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, often witty, always improbable; ≈øuch is the characteri≈øtic of all his plays. In that called "The Happy Ruffian," the hero, who in the fir≈øt act is the greate≈øt villain in Seville, becomes a Jacobin at Mexico in the ≈øecond: he is the pattern of the convent; he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent encounters with the devil, upon the ≈øtage, and always remains conqueror. Being called to attend a lady of the place, then on her death-bed, who≈øe life had been very irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular, Father Crux, for ≈øo he is called, pre≈ø≈øes her in vain, to confe≈øs her ≈øins; the dying la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033741_0024_0FF8F6DD6128CCD0"/>
believes her≈øelf too culpable to hope for pardon:‚ÄîAt la≈øt Father Crux, anxious to prevent her reprobation, offers to take her ≈øins on him, and give her his merits; the exchange is made, the bargain ≈øigned, the dying lady confe≈ø≈øes, angels receive her ≈øoul, and devils ≈øeize upon the Jacobin; who ≈øees his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy covered with frightful ulcers. In the third act he dies, and works miracles. This is one of the comedies of the author of Don Quixotte, and perhaps, his be≈øt.</p>
                  <p>There are, be≈øides, eight little pieces of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes, which the Spaniards call Entreme≈øes; the≈øe are better than his comedies; they are comic and natural, ≈øome of them rather too free, but two of them are charming above the re≈øt; one called "The Cave of Salamanca," is exactly our Soldier Magician; the French comic opera is formed after the model of the Spani≈øh; the other, called "The Miraculous Picture," has furni≈øhed Piron with the idea of an opera ballad, The Fal≈øe Prodigy, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Cervantes's work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:033741_0025_0FF8F6E074D4F2B8"/>"Per≈øiles and Sigi≈ømunda," of which we have two unfaithful tran≈ølations, is a long ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, loaded with epi≈øodes and adventures, almo≈øt always incredible. It ≈øeems as if Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes wi≈øhed to imitate the old Greek ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances ≈øtill e≈øteemed and formerly admired. But all his imagination, which, perhaps, never was more brilliant than in Per≈øiles, is in≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to render his heroes intere≈øting; their u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs adventures, their improbable dangers, and the con≈øtant medley of love and devotion, have hindered this work from attaining the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of its author; but the elegance of the ≈øtyle, the great truth of ≈øome of the portraits, and the epi≈øode of "Ruperte" are ≈øufficient to render it of great value.</p>
                  <p>It remains that I ≈øhould ≈øpeak of "GALA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEA," his fir≈øt performance. At the time he wrote it, Spain was the mo≈øt gallant nation in the world, love was the ≈øole occupation of the Spaniards, and the ≈øubject of all their books.</p>
                  <p>Montemayor, a celebrated poet, publi≈øhed the romance of "Diana," which has been
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033741_0026_0FF8F6E4F351C588"/>
tran≈ølated into French. This work met with the greate≈øt ≈øucce≈øs, and merited it in ≈øome re≈øpects; a pure ≈øtyle, great wit, ≈øweetne≈øs and ≈øentiment, often an enchanting ≈øtrain of poetry, and the affecting elegant ≈øimplicity which predominates in the novel of the moor Abindarraes, redeems in the eyes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noi≈ø≈øeurs, the improbability of the ≈øtory, the intervention of magic, and the want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which have been the reproach of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana of Montemayor. Cervantes, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the≈øe defects, as may be ≈øeen from his ≈øcrutiny of Don Quixotte's library, has, in Galatea, avoided ≈øome of the≈øe faults; but not all. His adventures are more natural, his characters more intere≈øting, but his ≈øtyle, and above all his poetry, place him below Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temayor.‚ÄîInfected with the mi≈øerable ≈øchola≈øtic ta≈øte which then prevailed, Cervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes has made his ≈øhepherds declaim as if in the ≈øchool, they pronounce long di≈ø≈øertations for and again≈øt Love; they cite Minos, Ixion, Antony, Rodriguez and all the heroes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hi≈øtory: if Tircis wi≈øhes to con≈øole
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033741_0027_0FF8F6E737570DA0"/>
his friend who can obtain no mark of favour from his ≈øhepherde≈øs, his ≈øpeech is to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is allowed by all, that Galatea is ≈øtill more beautiful than cruel; but they add, that above all, ≈øhe is di≈øcreet. Now if this be true, as it ought to be, it follows that by her good ≈øen≈øe ≈øhe ≈øhould know her≈øelf, and from this knowledge that ≈øhe ≈øhould e≈øteem her≈øelf; from this e≈øteem that ≈øhe ≈øhould wi≈øh not to be lo≈øt, and from this wi≈øh, that ≈øhe will not yield to your de≈øires.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another place, a lover ≈øeparated from his mi≈øtre≈øs, ≈øays in ver≈øe,
<q>Although I ≈øeem to ≈øee, to under≈øtand, and to feel, yet I am only a phantom formed by Love, and ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Hope.</q>
Through the whole work the ≈øun only illuminates the world by the light which he receives from the eyes of Galatea. The≈øe ≈øpecimens enable us to form an idea of the bad ta≈øte which formely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and from which even Cervantes was not free. But in the mid≈øt of the≈øe follies,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033741_0028_0FF8F6E8DB920F48"/>
we find beautiful ideas, true ≈øentiment, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expre≈ø≈øed, intere≈øting ≈øituations, the emotions and agitations of the heart. The≈øe were what induced me to give an imitation of his Galatea; it has never been tran≈ølated, this romance is utterly unknown to the French.</p>
                  <p>As it is very po≈ø≈øible my labours will be un≈øucce≈øsful, I mu≈øt, for the honour of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes, enumerate here all the changes which I have made in his work. Galatea, in the original, con≈øi≈øts of ≈øix books, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: the≈øe I have compri≈øed in three, and have fini≈øhed it in a fourth. I have tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hardly any part, the ver≈øes in particular, only re≈øemble the Spani≈øh ones in the places quoted. I have only taken the heads of the adventures, I have even changed circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where it has appeared nece≈ø≈øary; I have added entire ≈øcenes, as the exchange of crooks in the fir≈øt book; the country fea≈øt and the ≈øtory of the doves in the ≈øecond; and the farewell to Elicio's dog in the third; the fourth is entirely my own invention. I ≈øhall
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033741_0029_0FF8F6EDF6ACBFF8"/>
no doubt, be reproached with the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of epi≈øodes, and the few events in which Galatea is concerned. In Cervantes, there are twice as many epi≈øodes, and Galatea does ≈øtill le≈øs. Montemayor has committed the ≈øame fault in Diana, which is in fact, nothing but a recital of different hi≈øtories; ≈øuch was the ta≈øte of the times. Such are our great French romances, ≈øo long the fa≈øhion, where the authors took the Spaniards for their models, as to battles and duels, which one will be perhaps a≈øtoni≈øhed to find in a pa≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral work; it is a tribute which Cervantes paid to his nation. I know no Spani≈øh ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or comedy without combats; this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, one of the mo≈øt valiant in Europe, and without di≈øpute, the mo≈øt amorous, required in a book to plea≈øe them, recitals of Love and War. Finally, we ought to pardon Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes, who him≈øelf met with adventures, the mo≈øt extraordinary, for ≈øuppo≈øing that what had happened to him≈øelf would appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in a romance.</p>
                  <p>I have but one word more to ≈øay on the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033741_0030_0FF8F6EFB3F57BB0"/>
judgement which I have pre≈øumed to pa≈øs on the works of Cervantes. Notwith≈øtanding the particular ≈øtudy I made of his language, I re≈øted not entirely on my own knowledge; but I have been guided by the information of a Spaniard, who is as much devoted to literature, as to his country, and who has this in common with Cervantes, that he is ≈øtill more celebrated for his talents than for his misfortunes<note n="*" place="bottom">The Count De Pilos.</note>.</p>

                  <p>Such were the complaints of Elicio, a ≈øhepherd on the banks of the Tagus. Nature had enriched him with her gifts, but Fortune and Love had not treated him with equal kindne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Long had he loved Galatea, without being able as yet to flatter him≈øelf that he was beloved of her. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latea was a ≈øimple ≈øhepherde≈øs of the ≈øame village as Elicio; but ≈øhe had been queen of the world, if the world had been given to the mo≈øt beautiful, and mo≈øt de≈øerving.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Galatea and Elicio, who≈øe adventures I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relate. I ≈øhall join to the≈øe ≈øome others, of who≈øe con≈øtancy love was willing to make trial; and I ≈øhall al≈øo de≈øcribe the manners of a village. Oh! ye who≈øe chief plea≈øures are centered in a country life; ≈øouls of ≈øen≈øibility! to whom the a≈øpect of laughing fields, and the noi≈øe of falling waters afford delights equal almo≈øt to what are felt in doing of good actions; may you be able to find ≈øome plea≈øure in peru≈øing me!</p>
                  <p>Of all the ≈øhepherds who were in love with Galatea, Elicio was the mo≈øt tender, and lea≈øt confident. Nor was his re≈øpect alone the ≈øole cau≈øe of his timidity; Meoris the father of Galatea was the riche≈øt hu≈øband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033741_0034_0FF8F6F9831C3808"/>
in the canton; while all the wealth of Elicio was his cottage, and a few goats.</p>
                  <p>Era≈øtres his rival was le≈øs poor, without being more happy. Era≈øtres, ever the mo≈øt in≈øen≈øible of ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, had not been able however to re≈øi≈øt the charms of Galatea; but he did not flatter him≈øelf that he could be plea≈øing to her. Too ≈øimple to be amiable, he could feel, but he knew not how to expre≈øs him≈øelf. Nature in forming him had been content with giving him a good heart.</p>
                  <p>One day as Elicio in a ≈øolitary dale was thinking of her whom he loved, he ≈øaw Era≈øtres appear, preceded by his flock, which he left the conducting of to his dogs. The≈øe faithful animals ≈øeemed as if they gue≈ø≈øed that their ma≈øter was too much in love to mind his ≈øheep. Their attention ≈øeemed to be doubled. They ran round them, pre≈ø≈øed on the lazy ones, led back tho≈øe that were rambling from their fellows; thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ≈øame time their own duty and that of the ≈øhepherd.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as Era≈øtres was near Elicio, I hope, ≈øaid he to him, that you are not ≈øad, becau≈øe I am in love with Galatea. You know that it is impo≈ø≈øible not to love her. May my lambs in the moment that I wean them find nothing in their pa≈øtures but poi≈øonous herbs, if it be not true that a thou≈øand times I have been tempted to forget my love. I have con≈øulted all the doctors in the country, yet none of them have been able to cure me; and I come to a≈øk your leave to retain my malady to my death. You will ri≈øque nothing in granting me this favour, ≈øince you who are the mo≈øt engaging of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033741_0035_0FF8F6FD965A1F48"/>
all our ≈øhepherds, have not been able to move Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea to pity, what have you to fear from a clown like me?</p>
                  <p>Elicio ≈ømiled at this di≈øcour≈øe. My friend, ≈øaid he, I have no right to be jealous. Our ≈øorrows are the ≈øame, and they ought to endear us to each other. From this moment we will ≈øeparate no more; we will talk uncea≈øingly of Galatea, and friend≈øhip, without doubt, will help to a≈ø≈øuage the pains that love cau≈øes us to ≈øuffer.</p>
                  <p>The two rivals now become friends, were preparing their pipes to play, when Galatea with her flock ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon the hill. A ≈øimple bodice, and a petticoat of plain ≈øtuff, compo≈øed the whole of her attire. Her ≈øhape alone rendered this habit charming. Her long light hair floated on her ≈øhoulders, and a ≈øtraw hat guarded her face from the ardour of the ≈øun. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adorned as the ≈øimple flowers of the field, ≈øhe was beautiful and ≈øhe knew it not.</p>
                  <p>Elicio advanced to ≈øpeak to her, but the dogs of Galatea, who let no per≈øon approach the flock, ran growling towards the ≈øhepherd. Scarcely had they recollected him, when a≈øhamed of their ill behaviour, they ≈øtooped down their necks, dropt their tails, and went to hide their heads under his care≈ø≈øing hands. The conducting ram with whom Elicio had often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his bread, perceived him, and came up to him with his head erect, and bell ringing, all the ≈øheep fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. Elicio opened for them his ≈øcrip, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtributed to the dogs, and to the flock all that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, while tears of joy ran from his eyes. The ≈øhepherde≈øs embarra≈ø≈øed thus, at ≈øeeing the ≈øheep know
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033741_0036_0FF8F702C7633470"/>
her lover ≈øo well, blu≈øhed, and ha≈øting to the ram, ≈øtruck him with her crook, and obliged him to remove from Elicio.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øhepherd reproached her for this movement of anger; why, ≈øaid he, puni≈øh your ≈øheep when it is me that you wi≈øh to puni≈øh. The≈øe pa≈øtures are the be≈øt in the canton; you have power to fly me; but leave here your lambs, and I will neglect my goats to take care of them;‚Äîif this favour ≈øeems too great, choo≈øe the place where you would wi≈øh to pa≈øs the day, and I will remove my≈øelf, becau≈øe it will be more agreeable to you: Elicio, ≈øaid Galatea, it is not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void you that I turn my ≈øheep another way I am lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the brook of palm-trees, where I expect to meet my dear Flori≈øe;‚ÄîI am grateful to you for your offers; and I prove it to you by di≈ø≈øipating your ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions. While ≈øhe was ≈øtill ≈øpeaking, ≈øhe pur≈øued her way. Era≈øtres cried out to her from far, May you yet fall in love with ≈øome one who will treat you with as little pity as you treat us; May you. . . . he would have ≈øaid more if Galatea had not began to ≈øing, as her cu≈øtom was, whenever ≈øhe moved with her flock. The mo≈øt angry lover would rather li≈øten to the voice of his mi≈øtre≈øs, than ≈øay injurious things to her; Era≈øtres was ≈øilent, and Galatea ≈øung the≈øe words:‚Äî</p>

                  <p>Galatea and Flori≈øe ran towards the ≈øtranger; If Heaven, ≈øaid they to her, is as much touched with your tears as we are, you would very ≈øoon have no cau≈øe to ≈øhed them; we pity your misfortunes, even though

we do not know them; how often are they a≈ø≈øuaged by recounting them! a ≈øatisfaction of that ≈øort you might feel, by pouring them into our bo≈øoms; yet it would be cruel to demand a recital of what might be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your heart. This recital, replied the ≈øtranger, will perhaps deprive me of the friend≈øhip which you ≈øeem to promi≈øe me; when you are informed that all my ≈øorrows ≈øpring from love; may I hope that you will ≈øtill pity me? The ≈øhepherde≈ø≈øes, after having a≈ø≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in the tendere≈øt manner of their freind≈øhip, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her into a neighbouring grove‚Äîthey ≈øat down in the ≈øhade, and after a pau≈øe of a few moments, the ≈øtranger began her hi≈øtory:</p>
                  <p>"I was born in a village, ≈øituated on the banks of the Henares, celebrated for the fre≈øhne≈øs, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of its waters; my father is a farmer, and my life was occupied ≈øolely in country employments; every morning I led my ≈øheep to their pa≈øtures, frequently alone, yet ≈øolitude never weared me.

Galatea and her friend did all in their power to con≈øole her;‚ÄîRe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here, ≈øaid Galatea to her, we will a≈ø≈øi≈øt you in finding Artidore; and, in the mean time we will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your di≈øtre≈øs, and mingle our tears with yours. Teolinda, moved by the≈øe kind offers, embraced Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atea, and promi≈øed not to quit her for ≈øome days.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øun was now ≈øet, and the ≈øhepherde≈ø≈øes collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ≈øcattered flocks, to lead them to the village; but ≈øcarcely had they got half way, when Galatea perceived that ≈øhe had left her crook behind her, ≈øhe begged of Flori≈øe and the ≈øtranger to take care of her ≈øheep, while ≈øhe returned alone to ≈øeek it; ≈øhe ≈øoon ≈øaw through the trees an old ≈øhepherd, named Lenio, ≈øitting in the place where ≈øhe had been, and holding in his hands, the crook that ≈øhe had come to look for.</p>
                  <p>At the ≈øame in≈øtant, Elicio returning to his cottage with his little flock of goats, pa≈ø≈øed that way, and knowing the crook of Galatea, he ≈øtopped and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Lenio, with an a≈øtoni≈øh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I found it here, by chance, ≈øaid the old ≈øhepherd, and I intend it for Beli≈øe, who will hardly refu≈øe ≈øo hand≈øome a pre≈øent; I wi≈øh, ≈øaid Elicio, that the heart of Beli≈øe may be ≈øoftened to tenderne≈øs by the gift of that crook; but mine is ≈øtill more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; ≈øee how the bark, neatly rai≈øed, ≈øeems to form a branch of ivy that curls round it, I would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, however, to change it for the one you hold; ‚Äîyou mu≈øt then, ≈øaid Lenio, give me al≈øo the be≈øt of your goats in exchange.‚ÄîAh! I agree, I have but ≈øix, you ≈øee them here, choo≈øe which of them that plea≈øes you mo≈øt. The old ≈øhepherd, had no great trouble in deciding of the ≈øix goats of Elicio; one only was near yeaning, and it was that which he cho≈øe. Elicio, tran≈øported with joy, gave him the goat, changed the crook, and embraced him with all his heart. The two ≈øhepherds, equally ≈øatisfied, ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and Galatea, pen≈øive and mu≈øing, flowly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Flori≈øe and the ≈øtranger; they a≈øked her, what news of her crook? ≈øome one has taken it, replied the ≈øhepherde≈øs, but I do not regret it.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, the ≈øhades of Night began to darken the mountains; the birds a≈ø≈øembled together, under the thick foliage, di≈øputed with a confu≈øed murmur, the branch where they were to ≈øpend the night.

A happy marriage generally crowned a virtuous attachment. Daranio, the beloved of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veria, was now to become her hu≈øband. At the fir≈øt dawn of the morning, all the inhabitants of the village, and of the neighbouring hamlets, were already a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the public green. Some had made garlands to ornament the doors of the bride and bridegroom; others with flutes and tamborines u≈øhered in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, with joyful melody; here was heard the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pipe; there the harmonious violin; and farther off, the antique p≈øaltery. One was employed in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ribbands to his ca≈øtanets; another ornamenting his hat with bunches of flowers.‚ÄîEvery one was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to plea≈øe his mi≈øtre≈øs; all were animated with Love and Joy.</p>
                  <p>The bride and bridegroom did not wait long. They were ≈øoon di≈øcovered, coming decked out in their gaye≈øt apparel; Galatea and the young girls conducted Sylveria;‚Äîand Elicio and the ≈øhepherds ≈øurrounded Daranio. The happy troop took their way to the church, amid≈øt the ≈øound of all the in≈øtruments.</p>
                  <p>After they had vowed an eternal fidelity, the new married couple returned to the village green, and all the young women ran to ≈øeek for the pre≈øents which they had de≈øtined for the bride;‚ÄîOne came and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sylveria, a ba≈øket of fruits; another carried in her hat, eggs that her pullets had newly laid‚Äîhere one pre≈øented a pullet, another a young cock; every one without regret, and without vanity, made an offering proportionable to their riches.</p>

In ≈øaying the≈øe words, ≈øhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented her turtles, Sylveria ≈øtretched out her hands to receive them, Galatea opened hers. The birds profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moment, e≈øcaped, and as they ≈øhot ≈øudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the air, bru≈øhed lightly with their wings, the faces of the ≈øhepherde≈ø≈øes. Sylveria was ≈øurpri≈øed and Galatea almo≈øt ≈øorrowful; they followed them with their eyes till they had lo≈øt ≈øight of them; they then looked at each other without ≈øaying a word, while ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one laughed, except Galatea.</p>
                  <p>Elicio approached her, and ≈øaid with a low voice, the≈øe birds have puni≈øhed you for the little care you took in not keeping them; but they will ≈øoon wi≈øh to come back to you again; and I dare an≈øwer for it, that they will ≈øoon return to you.

                  <p>They had not proceeded far on their way, when in pa≈ø≈øing by the foot of an ancient hermitage, ≈øituated on the top of a little hill, they heard the ≈øound of an harp, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

voice of a young man, that came here about fifteen days ago in order to turn hermit.

                  <p>The≈øe words of Era≈øtres in≈øpired the ≈øhepherds with a de≈øire of knowing the hermit; they a≈øcended the hill, without making the lea≈øt noi≈øe, and ≈øoon di≈øcovered a young man of about twenty-two years of age, ≈øitting upon the fragment of a rock; he was clothed in dark coloured coar≈øe cloth, a cord ≈øerved him for a girdle, his legs and feet were bare; and he held between his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She prai≈øed my voice to a great degree, I thanked her, with my eyes fixt upon her ≈øi≈øter.</p>
                  <p>"Their father entreated me to come again; I he≈øita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a long time; I debated with my≈øelf often, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ≈øhould avail my≈øelf of this permi≈ø≈øion. I was certain of adding ≈øtrength to a di≈øorder, that tore my heart in pieces; but anxious for my friend, and drawn on by my love, I returned to the hou≈øe of Ni≈øida; I ≈øaw her again, and all hope of a cure was removed from me for ever.</p>
                  <p>"Judge of the conflicts, that agonized my heart. I loved Timbrio more than my life, and I loved Ni≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, perhaps, more than Timbrio; I ≈øaw her every day, and was incapable of flying from her, even for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts of my friend.

my ≈øoul, I recalled to my mind, all that I owed to my friend, and re≈øolved to expire, rather than betray him, and I ≈øummoned up all my re≈øolution to ≈øay the≈øe words:</p>
                  <p>"You will pity my ≈øorrows ≈øtill more, when I tell you, that they are cau≈øed by Friend≈øhip;‚ÄîA young cavalier, my countryman, and bo≈øom friend, is in love with the mo≈øt beautiful, and mo≈øt amiable of women; he re≈øpects her ≈øo much, that he fears ever to mention his pa≈ø≈øion to her, and this re≈øpect is, in fact, cutting ≈øhort his life. It is him that I weep.‚ÄîIt is the mo≈øt generous and the mo≈øt accompli≈øhed of men, that Love is bringing to an early grave.</p>
                  <p>"At this place, Ni≈øida interrupted me. Fabian, ≈øaid ≈øhe, I have never known Love, but it appears to me to be ≈øimplicity to die, rather than tell a woman, that one loves her; the fir≈øt avowal of it would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ≈øhould think, to offend her; but even ≈øuppo≈øing that it wras badly received, there are always opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities enough found for dying. Beautiful Ni≈øida, ≈øaid I, when one looks on love with the eyes of indifference, they ≈øee nothing in it, but the playfulne≈øs of children, which they laugh at, or at be≈øt but pity: but when the heart is wounded, the under≈øtanding, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of u≈øe to us, is the fir≈øt to lead us a≈øtray.‚ÄîSuch is the ≈øtate of my friend; by dint of intreaties and prayers, I got him to write to the object of his affection; I am charged with this letter, and I carry it always about me, in hopes of being able to deliver it. Could not one ≈øee this letter, ≈øaid Ni≈øida, for I am, I confe≈øs, curious to know the ≈øtyle of a lover, who is truly ≈ømitten?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033741_0069_0FF8F760CE1B82E0"/>"I did not let ≈øo good an occa≈øion as this e≈øcape me. I drew from my bo≈øom the billet that Timbrio had given me, a few days before; it was conceived in the≈øe terms:‚Äî</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I had determined, madam, never to have broken ≈øilence, happier in the thought of having in death de≈øerved your pity, rather than live under your di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure: but it was too terrible to live, and not let you know that I adore you. If this avowal ≈øhould not offend you, I feel that I ≈øhall ≈øtill che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh life, to con≈øecrate it to you; but ≈øhould my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity appear to you worthy of puni≈øhment, my death ≈øhall ≈øoon expiate my offence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Ni≈øida read this letter with great attention. I do not think, ≈øaid ≈øhe, that a declaration ≈øo re≈øpectful as this, can di≈øplea≈øe; and I advi≈øe you to deliver the billet, without being apprehen≈øive that it will be badly received.‚ÄîAs yet I have had no opportunity, ≈øaid I<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but my friend, in the mean time, is dying, and I think, that you have it in your power to ≈øave his life;‚ÄîHow is it po≈ø≈øible?‚ÄîDo you reply to this bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, as if it was addre≈ø≈øed to you; this innocent device will re≈øtore him to new life, and will give me time to find the occa≈øion that I ≈øo ardently wi≈øh for. No, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Ni≈øida, I have never as yet returned an≈øwers to love-letters; and I would not wi≈øh to begin now by a deceit.‚ÄîBut ≈øaid ≈øhe, after a moment's pau≈øe, what is to hinder you from letting your friend know all that has now happened; ≈øub≈øtituting the name of her whom he loves, in the place of mine? You may tell him that ≈øhe has read his letter, that ≈øhe had pre≈ø≈øed you to give it to her: that in fact you dur≈øt not tell

her that the billet was for her≈øelf; but that you had, neverthele≈øs, room to hope that ≈øhe will yet hear of it, without anger. This ≈øtratagem will be of u≈øe to the health of your friend, and cannot be contradicted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you have ≈øpoken to his real mi≈øtre≈øs.</p>
                  <p>"Surpri≈øed at this invention, I ≈øtammered out ≈øome expre≈ø≈øions of thanks, and I ran to report every thing to Timbrio; the hopes which he conceived, his tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and his gratitude, were ≈øo many links, that chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ≈øtill more to my duty.</p>
                  <p>"I redoubled my attentions towards Ni≈øida, and tho' the prey of a pa≈ø≈øion, which her ≈øight could not fail but to encrea≈øe; I never ≈øpoke to her but of my friend. I employed for him the expre≈ø≈øions which my heart furni≈øhed me with for my≈øelf; and thus I made ≈øub≈øervient to the cau≈øe of Friend≈øhip, that very feeling, which might have de≈øtroyed it.</p>
                  <p>"At length, I took the re≈øolution to acquaint her of every thing. I told her that the per≈øon who was ≈øo near dying for her, was Timbrio. I extolled his birth, dwelt on his good qualities, and his virtues; and in a word, I painted him as I ≈øaw him. Ni≈øida had not forgotten him, ≈øhe expre≈ø≈øed a ≈øurpri≈øe, true or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reproached me with my pre≈øumption, menacing me, to tell all to her father;‚Äîbut acro≈øs the anger that ≈øhe forced her≈øelf to a≈ø≈øume, I ≈øaw clearly that Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio was beloved.</p>
                  <p>"This was the la≈øt ≈øtroke for me; a long time I had waited for it, yet it was not ≈øen≈øibly felt when it came. I re≈øolved to let Timbrio know his good fortune, and then to fly immediately afterwards, and die in a de≈øert.</p>
                  <p>"I reckoned, however, too much on my courage;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033741_0071_0FF8F76A27D3A5F0"/>
the moment that I undertook to ≈øay to my rival that he was beloved, I lo≈øt the power of ≈øpeech, my eyes filled with tears, vainly would I have hid my trouble; my ≈øighs betrayed me, my ≈øtrength failed, and I fell upon the bo≈øom of my friend, and bathed him with my tears.</p>
                  <p>"Timbrio, ≈øurpri≈øed and terrified, ≈øupported me in his arms, embraced me with tenderne≈øs, nor would he be ≈øatisfied without knowing the cau≈øe of ≈øo keen an affliction. I was ≈øilent, he pre≈ø≈øed me, unable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, I threw my eyes down on the ground. Ah! I under≈øtand you, ≈øaid he, you love her! you love her! 'twas not po≈ø≈øible but that you mu≈øt have loved her; thy faithful heart groans under the ≈øacrifice it would make to thy friend≈øhip. O my Fabian, I ≈øhould be indeed unworthy, if I accepted of her. Continue to love Ni≈øida, for I will never ≈øee her more; I ≈øhall, perhaps, be able to live without her, but I ≈øhould be certain of dying, were I the cau≈øe of thy unhappine≈øs. In ≈øaying the≈øe words, he turned away his face to hide his tears, while he pre≈ø≈øed me again≈øt his bo≈øom.</p>
                  <p>"Friend≈øhip in≈øpired me in this moment, I felt as it were lift above my≈øelf. You are mi≈øtaken, replied I, it is not Ni≈øida that I love, it is her ≈øi≈øter, who≈øe heart I have not been able to touch, and the violence of an unrequited love, is the ≈øole cau≈øe of my de≈øpair. You deceive me, Fabian, ≈øaid he, looking ≈øtedfa≈øtly in my face. No, my dear Timbrio, I adore Blanche, but ≈øhe de≈øpi≈øes my vows, pardon me then, if the compari≈øon of thy happy ≈øtate with mine, draw ≈øome tears from me. I promi≈øe you, however, that I ≈øhall weep no

more. Go, my friend, I feel, that while near you, my happine≈øs does not depend upon Love.</p>
                  <p>"Timbrio, either did, or feigned to believe me; he was re≈øolved, however, to a≈ø≈øure him≈øelf of the truth of what I ≈øaid, the fir≈øt opportunity that he had, but I had determined my≈øelf, to make every ≈øacrifice nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to his quiet. It was not enough, that I ≈øhould immolate my real pa≈ø≈øion; it was nece≈ø≈øary that I ≈øhould feign to feel another. The very next day I di≈øcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Blanche who I was, and ≈øpoke to her of Love.</p>
                  <p>"Blanche had loved me for a long time, without dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avow it, even to her≈øelf; but no ≈øooner did ≈øhe believe her≈øelf beloved, than ≈øhe told it to her ≈øi≈øter; this confidence became u≈øeful to Timbrio. Ni≈øida had ≈øtill oppo≈øed a ≈øentiment that ≈øhe dreaded, le≈øs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid in finding a companion, ≈øhe ventured to give way to it, ≈øhe ≈øpoke of her love, and was penetrated the more with it. The two ≈øi≈øters, in expre≈ø≈øing their fears, mutually ≈øtrengthened each other; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure that diffu≈øed it≈øelf over their ≈øouls, made them feel more ≈øen≈øibly the happine≈øs of being beloved.</p>
                  <p>"By favour of my di≈øgui≈øe, I pre≈øerved a free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs into the hou≈øe. I con≈øtantly carried the letters of my friend; and I procured him the plea≈øure of ≈øeeing his mi≈øtre≈øs. While thus I continued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double all my attentions to Blanche, Timbrio remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with joy, how well I was beloved, felicitated me, holding me in his arms, ≈øwore never to e≈øpou≈øe Ni≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, until that day that I ≈øhould become the hu≈øband of her ≈øi≈øter; I bowed my head, re≈øigned to every thing that Friend≈øhip ≈øhould ordain for me.</p>
                  <p>"We waited now for nothing but news from Spain,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033741_0073_0FF8F76F5DED8F60"/>
to demand the hands of Blanche and Ni≈øida in form; when Pran≈øil, the cavalier, who had the quarrel with Timbrio at Xeres, arrived at Naples, to fight with him.</p>
                  <p>"The nature of the quarrel was ≈øuch, as to render a public reparation nece≈ø≈øary. The Viceroy's permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion was to be obtained, and Judges appointed; in fine, all things were fixed, and this terrible combat was to take place in eight days from that time, in a large plain, at a little di≈øtance from the city.</p>
                  <p>"The news of this made a great noi≈øe, and ≈øpread it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf far and near; in ≈øpite of our utmo≈øt precautions, it reached the ear of Ni≈øida. Her inquietude and grief was as keen as her love was ardent, a prey to ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ≈øorrow, ≈øhe pa≈ø≈øed in tears, and without nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the eight days of delay, which ≈øeemed to her ≈øo long, and yet‚Äî≈øo ≈øhort; a frightful incertitude, more cruel even than the misfortune ≈øhe ≈øo much dreaded, ≈øoon exhau≈øted her ≈øtrength, ≈øhe fell ill; and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ignorant of the cau≈øe, re≈øolved, in order to re-e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabli≈øh her health, to bring her to his hou≈øe in the country.</p>
                  <p>"The day of their departure, which was the eve of the combat, Ni≈øida had me called to her; when I came near her bed, ≈øcarcely could I recollect her, I was ≈øhocked beyond the power of telling it; I ≈øaw her that my ≈øoul doated on, pale and worn away, her long dark eye-la≈øhes moi≈øt with tears. Fabian! ≈øaid ≈øhe to me, with a weak and feeble voice, you mu≈øt carry my la≈øt adieus to Timbrio, tell him, that my life is joined to his; and that to-morrow, he has my life to defend. As for you, next to me, his be≈øt

friend, ≈øure I am, that you will not quit him; ≈øhould any mi≈øchance happen, you will be there to ≈øuccour him. Ah! would to Heaven, that I had the power to be with you al≈øo‚Äîhold, added ≈øhe, untying from her neck, a precious relique, which ≈øhe wet with her tears, carry this to him, and tell him that it has ever pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me from dangers of every kind; it is to-morrow, . . . that I expect it to pre≈øerve me indeed. I have ≈øtill one ≈øervice more from you. I am going to my father's country-hou≈øe, which is but half a league from the fatal field;‚Äîpromi≈øe me, to come there in≈øtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let me know the event of the combat; if my Timbrio be the vanqui≈øher, fa≈øten this white ≈øcarf upon thy arm, I ≈øhall ≈øee it from far, it will ≈øave me ≈øome moments of torment.‚ÄîShould he be overcome ‚ÄîI ≈øhall want thee no more!‚Äî</p>
                  <p>"You may ea≈øily conceive, my good friends, what I mu≈øt have ≈øuffered during this interview, I promi≈øed her every thing ≈øhe a≈øked. I ran to Timbrio, it elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hopes; it redoubled his ardor; he ki≈ø≈øed it, laid it next to his heart, it rai≈øed him out of him≈øelf; ≈øure of being invincible, he would have defied the univer≈øe.</p>
                  <p>"At length the moment arrived, the whole city of Naples were already upon the field of battle. Pran≈øil and Timbrio pre≈øented them≈øelves, they cho≈øe for weapons, the ≈øword and poiguard. The barrier is opened, the trumpets ≈øound, and the two enemies ru≈øh upon each other!</p>
                  <p>"The combat was furious, and for a long time equal. Pran≈øil was active, ≈økilful and valiant; he wounded Timbrio, and Victory hung wavering; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033741_0075_0FF8F77588D006F8"/>
heart beat with anxiety. At length, Love had the advantage. Timbrio ≈øtruck Pran≈øil to the ground, no ≈øooner was he down, than my generous friend flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ≈øword, and ran to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him; Pran≈øil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him≈øelf vanqui≈øhed, and the ≈øpectators rent the air with their applau≈øes.</p>
                  <p>"The frightful uncertainty that I had been in for ≈øo long a time, the grief that I felt, when I ≈øaw Timbrio wounded, and the ≈øudden joy that ru≈øhed upon my heart for his victory, di≈øturbed my mind ≈øo much, that I forgot the white ≈øcarf, and I ran without it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our good fortune to Ni≈øida. Oh! haple≈øs maiden, O beauteous Ni≈øida, thy ble≈øt ≈øhade, has long ere this, pardoned my cruel inadvertency, and looks with divine compa≈ø≈øion on the ≈øorrows of an heart, that never more can feel the ble≈ø≈øing of a moment's peace. As the moment of the combat approached, the fever burned with double violence in her veins; notwith≈øtanding her weakne≈øs, ≈øhe had her≈øelf carried up to the highe≈øt windows of the hou≈øe; there, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by her women, her eyes fixt upon the road, ≈øhe waited her life or her death; ≈øhe perceived me; ≈øaw no white ≈øcarf, and fell motionle≈øs into the arms of her ≈øi≈øter. At this moment, I arrived, all the hou≈øe were in tears; I pre≈ø≈øed thro' to Ni≈øida, we were prodigal of u≈øele≈øs ≈øuccours, nothing could re≈øtore her! I ≈øaw her eyes fa≈øt ≈øhut, her mouth open, her lips pale;‚Äî then it was, I began to recollect that I was the cau≈øe of all this ruin, wild with de≈øpair, I ru≈øhed out of the hou≈øe, I dur≈øt no more ≈øee my friend, to whom I was certain of giving his death. De≈øolate in mind, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and di≈øtracted, I took the fir≈øt road that I found;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033741_0076_0FF8F777C9AE7078"/>
I had not gone far, when I heard a loud voice calling after me to ≈øtop.‚ÄîI turned round, it was Felix, the page of Timbrio, who told me to come quickly to his ma≈øter; Felix, ≈øaid I, thy ma≈øter I ≈øhall never ≈øee again; Ni≈øida is dead, and it is I who have killed her. In pronouncing the≈øe words, I redoubled my ≈øpeed. I arrive at Gaietta, a ve≈ø≈øel is pulling before the wind, for Spain; I embark, I arrive once more in my native country, where I have taken this habit, which I ≈øhall now never quit.</p>
                  <p>"You have had, my friends, a faithful recital of my misfortunes. I had hoped to find peace in this hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, alas! I have found nothing but ≈øolitude. In vain I force my≈øelf to turn my thoughts to that Great Being, that ought to occupy them intirely. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what I have lo≈øt, pur≈øues me uncea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. I ≈øay to my≈øelf every day, that I ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Ni≈øida and Timbrio, and every day I weep their lo≈øs."</p>
                  <p>The ≈øhepherds were unable to con≈øole the hermit; but they joined in his ≈øorrows. And now the night being far advanced, and the moon at the height of her cour≈øe, the ≈øhepherds took their leaves of Fabian, and quitting the hermitage, ≈øoon arrived at the cottage of Elicio; where, after a frugal meal, they ≈øtretched them≈øelves upon the ≈øoft ≈økins of goats, to enjoy that re≈øt which temperance and exerci≈øe never fail to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow.</p>
                  <p>When Elicio perceived that his companions were fa≈øt a≈øleep, he ro≈øe up, and went ≈øoftly out to execute a project which he had meditated all day.</p>
                  <p>Ju≈øt before his door there was a beautiful cherry-tree,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033741_0077_0FF8F77AB2CB3838"/>
which he had him≈øelf reared, and which was covered with the fine≈øt fruit in the country, though yet very young, and the ≈øtem ≈ølender, it afforded delicacies to its po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor; two white doves had cho≈øen it to build in, they had placed their ne≈øt near the top, in a forked part of the tree formed by four branches;‚Äîfar from di≈øturbing them, Elicio looked upon it as an happy omen, their coming to build ≈øo near his cottage; he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carried under the cherry-tree, ears of corn and hemp-≈øeed, and even wool for the doves to line the in≈øide of their ne≈øts with, and that their little ones might lie more ≈øoft.</p>
                  <p>While Elicio was at the nuptials of Sylveria, a ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Meoris, came and ≈øpread his nets over the cherry-tree, took the turtles and carried them in≈øtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his ma≈øter's daughter. They were the ≈øame that Galatea had let e≈øcape, and Elicio who knew them, had promi≈øed his ≈øhepherde≈øs that they ≈øhould return to her again.</p>
                  <p>He was willing to keep his word, he went out of his cottage to ≈øeize on the father and mother while they were a≈øleep, and to put them into a cage with their young ones; by the help of a ladder which he laid again≈øt the chimney of his cottage, he mounted to the highe≈øt branch, ≈øtooped his body forward, removed ≈øoftly the leaves, and ≈øaw by the light of the moon, the two turtles in the ne≈øt, the head under one wing, and the other wing ≈øpread out, the better to cover their little ones. They did not waken, and Elicio had no more to do than to take them, but he had not the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; no, ≈øaid he, dear charming birds, ye ≈øhall not be deprived of your liberty, you ≈øhall belong to Galatea
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033741_0078_0FF8F77F93753B50"/>
without being ≈ølaves; you ≈øhall live near her, though free to live el≈øewhere. He de≈øcended quickly from the ladder, ran to ≈øeek a ≈øpade, and coming back to the cherry-tree, he dug a trench round about it, and when it was held only by its bottom roots, he cautiou≈øly and without the lea≈øt violence, placed his ≈øpade horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and cutting the roots, loo≈øened it entirely from the ground; then, he took it in his arms, lifted it ≈øoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the trench, and with a ≈ølow, but firm ≈øtep, which ≈øcarcely agitated the branches, he gained the cottage of Galatea.</p>
                  <p>The chamber where ≈øhe ≈ølept had a window, that looked into the fields, before this window he laid down his burden, with the utmo≈øt precaution; the tree ≈øtood firm and upright, ≈øupported by the ball of clay which was attached to its roots. Elicio, who had taken care to carry his ≈øpade with him, dug a hole, ≈øet his beloved cherry-tree in it, and placed it in ≈øuch a manner as to have the ne≈øt oppo≈øite the window, and ≈øo near, that Galatea by ≈øtretching out her hand, might be able to care≈øs the little turtles.

at this window, Oh! fly away, con≈øtant birds, come and find me again; when I hear thy melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murmurs on my cottage, I will ≈øoon join my ≈øad complaints to thine.</p>
                  <p>The dawn now began to appear, and the ≈øwallows were already twittering upon the chimney of Galatea when Elicio, with his ≈øpade on his ≈øhoulder, took the way to his cottage. He had not gone far, when he heard ≈øome one walking after him, he looked back, it was Meoris, the father of Galatea. Elicio trembled when he ≈øaw him, as if had been con≈øcious of doing a bad action; but Meoris ≈øoon ≈øet him at re≈øt, for he did not even que≈øtion him as to the rea≈øon of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ≈øo early in the village.‚ÄîElicio, ≈øaid he to him, I was going to you; I have a ≈øecret to entru≈øt you with, and I have a piece of ≈øervice to demand from you, in which my daughter is nearly concered.‚ÄîThe ≈øhepherd, full of joy, ki≈ø≈øed the old man's hands with tran≈øport.</p>
                  <p>They then retired into a little wood of myrtles, at ≈øome di≈øtance from the road.</p>

                  </lg>
                  <p>The ≈øhepherds, alarmed by the≈øe tender plaints, ran towards Elicio, they found him ≈øitting beneath a beech, his face bathed in tears. Scarce had he perceived them, when ri≈øing up ha≈øtily, he ran and threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf on the neck of Era≈øtres. My friend, ≈øaid he, we are going to lo≈øe Galatea; alas! ≈øhe quits us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever! li≈øten, added he, looking on Tircis and Damon, to the ≈øad ≈øecret that Meoris has this morning made me the confidant of; I am going to repeat it to you, in his own words.</p>
                  <p>"Elicio, ≈øaid he to me, I owe you the utmo≈øt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the attachment you have ever ≈øhowed me, and you are the fir≈øt to whom I confide the intended mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of my daughter; I concluded all la≈øt night, ≈øhe is to wed a rich Portugue≈øe, who≈øe numerous flocks cover the banks of the Lima; four ≈øhepherds ≈øent by the future ≈øpou≈øe, are now at my hou≈øe, and to-morrow they depart with Galatea; I know you ever had the affection of a brother for her, and I have therefore made choice of thee, my dear Elicio, and do be≈øeech you to accompany her to Portugal, to be pre≈øent at her

marriage, and to bring me back the certain intelligence of her happine≈øs."</p>
                  <p>In ≈øpight of the ≈øorrow that his di≈øcour≈øe overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with, I recovered my voice ≈øufficiently to reply to him. How! ≈øaid I, have you been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to ≈øeparate your≈øelf now in your old age, from your only child? Have you had the heart to condemn her to live far from her father and her friends? Are you very certain that you will not be the cau≈øe of mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery to her, by thus exiling her into a ≈øtrange land? Do you not think but ≈øhe will regret . . . . ?‚ÄîI have founded the heart of my daughter, ≈øaid Meoris, interrupting me, I have made her acquainted with my intentions: ≈øhe replied to me with her u≈øual gentlene≈øs that ≈øhe would be always ready to obey me. I di≈øcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, even in her countenance a ≈ølight emotion, the certain mark of that joy, which the mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible and mode≈øt girl feels when ≈øhe is going to be married. Do not therefore be unea≈øy about her unhappine≈øs, but go and prepare your≈øelf for the journey; I expect it from your friend≈øhip.‚ÄîBehold, my friends, what Meoris ≈øaid to me, behold that event, which I dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than death.</p>
                  <p>Tircis, Damon, and above all, Era≈øtres, afflicted them≈øelves with Elicio.‚ÄîBut, ≈øaid Damon to him, ≈øince Meoris e≈øteems and loves you, how comes it that you have never been tempted to make an avowal of your pa≈ø≈øion, and demand Galatea in marriage of him? You do not, ≈øaid Elicio, know him as well as I do, he has repeatedly declared that his ≈øon-in-law mu≈øt have wealth equal to what he can give his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If I dur≈øt have ≈øpoken to him, he would have
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033741_0085_0FF8F78FA62B87B8"/>
believed that it was her fortune I loved, and his friend≈øhip for me would have been changed into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Meoris is too rich not to be mi≈øtru≈øtful, and I am too poor to be confident.</p>
                  <p>My friend, ≈øaid Tircis, do not lo≈øe all hope, let us go and find Galatea, let us know from her≈øelf if it be true ≈øhe con≈øents to marry this Portugue≈øe, and if, as I ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that it will wound her deeply to obey her father, we will endeavour to break this unfortunate marriage. Love and Friend≈øhip will in≈øpire us, ≈øingly they have worked miracles; what will they not do when united?</p>
                  <p>Elicio followed the coun≈øel of Tircis; the four ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds took the road to the fountain of Ardoi≈øes, where Galatea retired in the extreme heat of the day; they hoped to find her there, nor was their expectation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; the ≈øhepherde≈øs was ≈øitting near the edge of the water, and in ≈øo profound a reverie, that ≈øhe did not perceive the ≈øhepherds when they approached; her eyes, moi≈øt with tears, were fixed upon the fountain, her head reclined on one of her hands, with the other the care≈ø≈øed the dog of Elicio; this dog, that for a long time had been oftener with her than with his ma≈øter. The faithful animal ≈øat at the feet of Galatea, his head was laid upon her knees, his eyes fixed on hers, and his air ≈øeemed wi≈øtfully to demand of her, why he was this day care≈ø≈øed more than u≈øual.</p>
                  <p>Elicio made his companions ≈øtop, that he might enjoy this plea≈øing ≈øight; a ≈øoft ≈øatisfaction replaced already the grief that was painted upon his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

                  <p>The tears that Galatea ≈øhed, prevented farther ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; Elicio wept al≈øo, but his were tears of joy; he was no longer ma≈øter of his tran≈øports, he ran to the ≈øhepherde≈øs, fell upon his knees before her, and ≈øeizing one of her hands, pre≈ø≈øed it to his lips; Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea thus ≈øurpri≈øed, made ineffectual efforts to get away, ≈øhe perceived that the other ≈øhepherds were

looking at her, ≈øhe would have appeared angry, but ≈øhe could not, ≈øhe would have fled, but the dog hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her, jumping and running round her, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately care≈ø≈øing them both‚Äîone would have ≈øaid, that he enjoyed the happine≈øs which he was procuring to his ma≈øter.</p>
                  <p>Tircis, Damon, and even Era≈øtres, beheld this ≈øcene with tenderne≈øs, and dur≈øt not approach the two lovers.‚ÄîGalatea called them to her, made Elicio ri≈øe, and endeavouring to dry up her tears; I can no longer pretend, ≈øaid ≈øhe to them, to hide a ≈øecret my imprudence has betrayed; yes, I regret my country, and I leave, perhaps, my heart in it, but I am not the le≈øs re≈øolved to obey my father; the ≈øacred duty that I owe him will ≈øupport me in every trial. I conjure you not to double, by your ≈øorrows, a grief that would be u≈øele≈øs, and above all, not to di≈øturb a ≈øolitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nece≈ø≈øary to me, after the avowal I have ju≈øt made.‚ÄîAt the≈øe words, ≈øhe bent her ≈øteps towards the village, leaving the four ≈øhepherds immoveable with ≈øurpri≈øe; the dog of Elicio alone dur≈øt follow her, ≈øhe perceived him, and would have hindered him by threatening him with her crook, but the dog ≈øtill fawned at her feet, and the poor Galatea could not bring her≈øelf either to beat him or drive him away.</p>
                  <p>The four friends ≈øtaid together, holding council upon the mo≈øt likely manner of breaking this fatal marriage;‚ÄîTircis advi≈øed to have all the ≈øhepherds of the country a≈ø≈øembled together, to go in a body, and ≈øupplicate Meoris not to part with that trea≈øure which was the pride of them all.

terrify him, ≈øo that he ≈øhould of him≈øelf, renounce Galatea. Elicio inclined to this part; No, no, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the good Era≈øtres, who had been as yet ≈øilent, none of the≈øe expedients will ≈øerve any purpo≈øe but to irritate Meoris; I have a project which will not fail to render every one happy‚Äîexcept my≈øelf, I have re≈øolved on it, and will go and in≈øtantly put it in practice. In ≈øaying the≈øe words, he embraced Elicio, and departed.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øhepherds, who did not reckon much on the invention of ≈øo ≈øimple a man as Era≈øtres, propo≈øed to go and con≈øult the hermit Fabian.‚ÄîThey had already proceeded on their way, when they were met by a cavalier ≈øuperbly clothed, and mounted on a noble hor≈øe; two ladies on jennets, were by his ≈øide, and the numerous troop of ≈øervants which followed, ≈øhowed them to be per≈øons of di≈øtinction;‚ÄîThe ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ≈øaluted them as they pa≈ø≈øed, the cavalier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned their civility, and ≈øtopping Elicio‚ÄîHave the goodne≈øs, ≈øhepherd, ≈øaid he to him, to direct us to ≈øome convenient place in the≈øe fore≈øts, where we may pa≈øs a few hours; the ladies whom you ≈øee, are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with the heat and the length of the journey, and would be willing to re≈øt them≈øelves here.

Freedom, Mirth, Content and Sincerity mark your happy lives;‚Äîthis day I would turn a ≈øhepherd, if Ni≈øida would become a ≈øhepherde≈øs.</p>
                  <p>At the name of Ni≈øida, Elicio looked at the two women with a countenance expre≈ø≈øive of ≈øo much a≈øtoni≈øhment, that it was remarked by the cavalier. Pardon me, ≈øaid Elicio, if the name of Ni≈øida has made ≈øo vi≈øible an impre≈ø≈øion on me;‚Äîit is not long ≈øince one of our friends ≈øhed many tears, in talking to us of Ni≈øida. Have you then, ≈øaid the cavalier, any ≈øhepherde≈øs who is thus called? No, replied Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, ≈øhe that I mean is no ≈øhepherde≈øs; ≈øhe is not even of the≈øe parts, Naples is her country. How! do you then know? I will explain it to you ≈øaid Elicio, but fir≈øt tell me if your name be not Timbrio;‚Äîand if this young per≈øon be not Blanche, the ≈øi≈øter of Ni≈øida. You have indeed, ≈øaid the cavalier, mentioned their names. Ah! Fabian, Fabian, what an happy day for you!‚ÄîIs he then here, cried Blanche, and as ≈øhe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033741_0090_0FF8F79BB2996268"/>
≈øpoke, the palene≈øs of her face was in≈øtantly effaced by a deep and brilliant red.</p>
                  <p>Yes, replied Elicio, he is here, and the mi≈øery of having lo≈øt you, was near putting an end to a life that he has now con≈øecrated to penitence. Fabian is an hermit, and his hermitage is near this. Let us fly and embrace him, ≈øaid Timbrio; Blanche, ≈øtarted up, and in≈øtantly ≈øet off without knowing the road ≈øhe was to take. Ni≈øida leaned on the arm of her lover; and Tircis, Damon and Elicio, guided them towards the hermitage.</p>
                  <p>It was almo≈øt night when they arrived at the foot of the hill. Timbrio, Ni≈øida, and above all, young Blanche, mounted the hill by the winding path, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever taking breath. When they came to the door of the hermitage, they found it open, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, but could ≈øee no one in the cell; unea≈øy at not finding him there, they were going to call and to run and ≈øeek him over the hill. The prudent Tircis ≈øtopped them. Fabian, ≈øaid he, is without doubt, near this place; but this unhappy friend, who has not even an hope of ever ≈øeeing you more;‚Äîwho laments you without cea≈øing, would die with joy, ≈øhould you ≈øuddenly pre≈øent your≈øelves to his view, manage it ≈øo as to re≈øtrain your tran≈øports, and we will find the means to prepare his ≈øoul to receive a plea≈øure which it could not otherwi≈øe ≈øu≈øtain.</p>
                  <p>Every one approved the advice of Tircis, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it was nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend forward the ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, that they might announce to Fabian with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, the arrival of tho≈øe tender friends, that he was once more going to behold again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:033741_0091_0FF8F79D538DBCC0"/>Whil≈øt they were thus con≈øulting, Blanche was con≈øidering, by the light of the moon, the in≈øide of the cell; a mat of ru≈øhes, a ≈øtool and a crucifix of box-wood, was all the furniture that Fabian had. Blanche examined them a long while, ≈øhe then drew near the crucifix, and throwing her≈øelf on her knees before it, in a low voice, poured out her thanks to Heaven, for having conducted her to the hermitage.</p>
                  <p>Timbrio and the ≈øhepherds were regarding with looks of tenderne≈øs, this affecting ≈øight; when deep ≈øighs and the plaintive voice of ≈øorrow gave them to under≈øtand that Fabian was not far off: they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the hermit under a wild olive, on his knees, upon the fragment of a rock, his arms ≈øpread to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. At this ≈øight, the two ≈øi≈øters and Timbrio would have thrown-them≈øelves upon his neck; Tircis was unable to re≈øtrain them: but Fabian beginning to pray, they all ≈øtopped to li≈øten. Ni≈øida and Timbrio remained with their arms extended forward; Blanche ≈øcarcely re≈øpiring, rai≈øed her head over their ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and endeavoured every in≈øtant to wipe away the tears which prevented her almo≈øt from ≈øeeing her lover.</p>
                  <p>God of all mercy, ≈øaid Fabian, Being Supreme, whom only I ought to love, Thou who fille≈øt this world, and ≈øhould fill my heart, be not offended at my tears.‚ÄîI have lo≈øt all‚ÄîI do not murmur‚ÄîOh! my God, calm the agonies that I ≈øuffer, but do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from me entirely the remembrance of my misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>When Fabian began his prayer, Blanche wept in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033741_0092_0FF8F6A1169E4880"/>
≈øilence; but at the la≈øt words, ≈øhe cried aloud. Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, fearing that ≈øhe would be heard, de≈øired Damon to go with Elicio, and interrupt the hermit,‚Äîwhile he remained with Timbrio and the two ≈øi≈øters, to hinder them from ≈øhowing them≈øelves too ≈øuddenly.</p>
                  <p>The two ≈øhepherds obeyed, Fabian received them with kindne≈øs: you complain always, ≈øaid Elicio, and your misfortunes perhaps draw to a conclu≈øion. You are acquainted with them, replied the hermit, judge then if they can ever end; without doubt they might, ≈øaid Elicio; you ≈øaw Ni≈øida under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of death, but you are not ≈øure that ≈øhe was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead.‚ÄîWhat if ≈øhe were alive? Ah! impo≈ø≈øible. On the contrary, replied Elicio, I heard this day, that ≈øhe and her ≈øi≈øter, together with Timbrio, have been uncea≈øingly occupied in ≈øearching all Spain, in hopes of finding you. What ≈øay you? are you very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this is my friend? that the≈øe are the two ≈øi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!‚ÄîAh! do not ≈øport with an unfortunate, have pity on my ≈øorrows, and do not come to agitate me, by abu≈øing me with a fal≈øe hope.</p>
                  <p>As he ≈øaid the≈øe words, Tircis ≈øpoke to Ni≈øida, and advi≈øed her if ≈øhe could recollect any ≈øong, to ≈øing it in the place where ≈øhe then ≈øtood, without as yet, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her≈øelf to the eyes of the hermit.</p>
                  <p>Ni≈øida followed his coun≈øel, and began the fir≈øt couplet of a ≈øong that Fabian had formerly made.</p>

                     <l>He is the ≈øoul's delicious plea≈øure,</l>
                     <l>But thou its be≈øt, its ≈øure≈øt trea≈øure.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Fabian was yet ≈øpeaking, when the voice of Ni≈øida ≈øtruck his ears; he ≈øtopped, he li≈øtened, he remains immoveable! his eyes are fixed and his mouth open, pre≈øently looking with a wild air, his rea≈øon abandons him; terror is painted on his face, he takes the ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds for phantoms, and views them with affright! In the mean time, the voice continued, it penetrated to the bottom of his ≈øoul. By little and little his fears are di≈ø≈øipated, his features regain their ≈øweetne≈øs, his eyes recover their ≈øoftne≈øs; he comes to him≈øelf, darts like an arrow to the place from whence the voice came, and fell motionle≈øs into the arms of his friend.</p>
                  <p>Ni≈øida and Timbrio call out, the ≈øhepherds ran to them, they are all anxiou≈øly employed in endeavouring to bring him to life; Blanche had already flown to ≈øeek for water in his cell, ≈øhe threw it on his face, ≈øhe held his hands in hers, <q>And viewed him with all the mingled agonies of hopes and fears.</q>
At length he recovers his ≈øen≈øes, he opens his eyes, but is ≈øtill doubtful of his good fortune. Is it you then indeed? ≈øaid he to Timbrio, is it you whom I have wept and ≈øorrowed for ≈øo long? Yes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it is me, it is thy friend, who owes his life to thee. They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each other, they mingle their tears together, and

remain a long time locked in each other's arms. No more of grief, ≈øaid Timbrio to him, we are all re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: behold Ni≈øida thy good friend, and Blanche, who would have died if we had not found thee.‚ÄîWhat more could you de≈øire? Ah! nothing, replied the hermit ≈ømiling, and weeping at the ≈øame time. Blanche and Ni≈øida held out their arms to him; Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would have ≈øpoken, but he made vain efforts; he took the hands of the two ≈øi≈øters, and joining them both together on his brea≈øt, fell on his knees, and bathed their hands with his tears.</p>
                  <p>After this tender ≈øcene, Fabian led his friends into his cell, and there gave them a detail of all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him ≈øince their ≈øeparation; the recital was ≈øhort. The prudent Fabian, always the victim of friend≈øhip, ≈øpoke of his love for Blanche, as the ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent that had mo≈øt occupied him during his ≈øolitude; the happy Blanche was unable to ≈øpeak, but ≈øhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her ≈øi≈øter, and dropped the tears of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs upon her bo≈øom.</p>
                  <p>The hermit now entreated his friend to relate to them in his turn, all his adventures from the moment that he left him on the field of battle, to go and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the news of his victory to Ni≈øida. The ≈øhepherds all joined with him in the ≈øame reque≈øt; and Timbrio willing to oblige, began thus:‚Äî</p>
                  <p>"After my combat with Pran≈øil, impatient to ≈øee Fabian again, I ≈øent my page to the country-hou≈øe of Ni≈øida; he came back with terror in his looks, and announced to me, the death of my mi≈øtre≈øs, and the flight of my friend, ≈øtunned as if by a ≈øtroke of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033741_0095_0FF8F7A5DB67F9D8"/>
I in≈øtantly departed to inform my≈øelf of the full extent of my misfortunes. I arrived at the country, hou≈øe, but neither intreaties, pre≈øents, nor ≈øupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could gain me an entrance; while the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe and tears of the dome≈øtics, confirmed me in the belief of Ni≈øida's being no more.</p>
                  <p>"It would be impo≈ø≈øible for me to tell you what my thoughts were at that moment; ≈øurely one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die of grief, or I ≈øhould have expired on the ≈øpot. ‚ÄîIn the mid≈øt of my de≈øpair, I remembered that there ≈øtill remained to me a friend, and all wounded as I was, I followed his tracks to Gaietta; when I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in that city, I was forced to wait the departure of a Catalonian ve≈ø≈øel that was to return in a few days to Barcelona, the captain received me on board, and my affliction redoubled as we quit the ≈øhores of Italy, where I had lo≈øt the deare≈øt object of my heart.</p>
                  <p>"The wind, which was at fir≈øt favourable to us, fell all of a ≈øudden, and our ve≈ø≈øel but little removed from the ≈øhore, was almo≈øt motionle≈øs with the calm; I ≈øhould have ≈øeen a tempe≈øt with more plea≈øure. Uncea≈øingly occupied with my mi≈øeries, always weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my lo≈øt Ni≈øida, I be≈øought Heaven that I might die or find my friend.

                  <p>"The ≈øecond day of our departure, in the moment when the morn began to glow in the horizon, I was ≈øitting upon the poop, viewing the va≈øt ≈øea, who≈øe tranquil waves reflected the ≈øtars, now ready to di≈øap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; all was hu≈øhed around me, the officers and ≈øai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors

                  <p>"After an happy voyage we arrived at Barcelona, we had hopes of learning ≈øomething of you there, but our re≈øearches were vain.

Elicio placed him≈øelf as far off from the Portugue≈øe as he could, he viewed them with rage;‚Äîand ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his eyes met tho≈øe of Galatea. The repa≈øt being ended, they all ro≈øe from table, and went to enjoy the cooling fre≈øhne≈øs of the air, upon the ≈øtone benches which were at the door of the hou≈øe. Old Meoris was willing to recount to his gue≈øts the brilliant marriage which he was making for his daughter; he dwelt upon the riches of his intended ≈øon-in-law, riches which the Portugue≈øe did not fail to exaggerate. The two friends, and the two ≈øi≈øters, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves bound to felicitate Galatea, ≈øhe made no reply; and the unhappy Elicio devoured his tears. Suddenly they were alarmed with the di≈ømal ≈øound of a trumpet, which was heard in the village.</p>
                  <p>Meoris, his gue≈øts, and all the inhabitants ran to the public green, from whence the ≈øad ≈øounds ≈øeemed

to proceed, they perceived four men cloathed in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and crowned with cypre≈øs, two of them carried lighted flambeaus in their hands, the two others ≈øounded the trumpets, in the mid≈øt of the four was a mini≈øter of the Eternal, cloathed in his ≈øacerdotal robes.</p>
                  <p>This was the venerable Salvadore, the pa≈øtor of the ≈øhepherds, who con≈øoled them under their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and who returned thanks to Heaven for their happine≈øs; all the village was his family, all the orphans his children; for forty years he had filled the ≈øublime employment of prai≈øing God, and being ≈øerviceable to man.</p>
                  <p>Shepherds, ≈øaid he to them, to-morrow is the day that I have cho≈øen in this year, to honor the a≈øhes of our brothers in the valley of tombs; think on this ≈øacred duty, and at the earlie≈øt dawn a≈ø≈øemble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves at this place, in the ≈øad apparel ≈øuitable to this intere≈øting occa≈øion.</p>
                  <p>After having with a ≈øtrong voice pronounced the≈øe words, Salvadore took the road to his own hou≈øe. Every one agreed to meet there at the point of day, to fulfil ≈øo holy a duty; Meoris was not willing that his daughter ≈øhould be ab≈øent. He prayed the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue≈øe that they would defer their departure. Elicio bounded with joy, and Galatea conceived ≈øomething like Hope, to flutter in the bottom of her heart.</p>
                  <p>Ni≈øida, Blanche, Teolinda, and the two friends, reque≈øted of the inhabitants of the village permi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to accompany them to the valley of tombs. They were flattered with their demand. The four Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue≈øe then ≈øolicited the ≈øame favour; but they were

refu≈øed with an unanimous voice, they were odious from the time it was known that they came to ≈øeek Galatea. They retired full of de≈øpight; and the night being far advanced, every one now went to deliver them≈øelves up to ≈øteep.</p>

How delicious are tho≈øe moments in which, ≈øeparated from the world, alone with our hearts and remembrance only, we retire into our≈øelves, or rather fill our mind with the dear idea of the object of our affections; what a plea≈øure to recall the various aeras of progre≈ø≈øive love; the fir≈øt hour we have felt that pa≈ø≈øion, the fir≈øt avowal we have made of it, the air with which that avowal was heard, the fears, the ≈øu≈øpicions, and even

the quarrels all are pre≈øent, all are traced with delight, we enjoy anew the plea≈øures we have experienced, we enjoy even the di≈øquietudes we have ≈øuffered. If every hope be torn from the heart, if unpitying death has cut off in the hour of youth and beauty, the object of our love; the tears which we give to her memory have charms, the recollection of her ≈øtill leaves upon our hearts an impre≈ø≈øion of happine≈øs; we would perhaps be more de≈øerving of pity if it were po≈ø≈øible we could be con≈øoled.</p>
                  <p>Thus thought the wi≈øe Salvadore; he con≈øecrated one day in the year to tears of tender recollections of Friend≈øhip and of Love. This day was now come, Salvadore, cloathed in his ≈øable ve≈øtment, appeared on the green; ≈øoon after him came the inhabitants of the village covered with crapes, crowned with cypre≈øs and carrying their crooks bound round with black ribbands. Salvadore regulated the order of the march, he ≈øeparated the ≈øhepherds from the ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde≈ø≈øes, and ranged them in two files.</p>
                  <p>On the right moved Ni≈øida, Blanche, Teolinda, Flori≈øe; and the young maidens moved under the conduct of Galatea. On the left ≈øide oppo≈øite the≈øe marched Timbrio, Fabian, Damon, Tircis, and all the young lads, having Elicio at their head, Era≈øtres alone was ab≈øent. After the≈øe came the married women conducted by Sylveria, and their hu≈øbands led by Daranio; this happy troop were almo≈øt as hand≈øome as the fir≈øt, they were followed by a third, le≈øs brilliant indeed, but more re≈øpectable, the≈øe were the widows and the old men, they were guided by Meoris and the mother of Era≈øtres; they wore no

crowns, but their white hair gave them an intere≈øting and affecting appearance, their trembling hands carried ebony ≈øticks, with which they ≈øupported them≈øelves. Alas! it was to the≈øe above all, that the ceremony was affecting; they went to weep upon the tomb of a child, a ≈øi≈øter, a wife, or an hu≈øband.</p>
                  <p>Salvadore clo≈øed the march, he had cho≈øen this place, to be near the mo≈øt unhappy; at each ≈øide of him four beautiful children, clothed in linen robes and crowned with flowers, carried with re≈øpectful awe, the holy water, the incen≈øe and the fire: proud of this employment, which was the reward of a year's good behaviour, they advanced more gravely than the old people.</p>
                  <p>To arrive at the valley of tombs, it was nece≈ø≈øary to go near a league upon the banks of the Tagus, and under a green canopy formed by a double row of poplars. The ≈øhepherds marched in ≈øilence through fields, upon the verdant turf, thick ≈øown with flowers which were ≈øtill moi≈øt with dew. The ≈øun began to gild the tops of the mountains, and announced one of the fine≈øt days of ≈øummer, all the expan≈øe of heaven was a deep azure, a ≈øoft breeze gently agitated the leaves, and lulled the little birds in their ne≈øts; the lark, already lo≈øt in the air, made him≈øelf be heard though he could not be perceived; the nightingale, fatigued with having warbled through the night, reanimated him≈øelf to hail the return of day; the turtle and her mate joined their re≈øpon≈øive plaints to the melody of the linnet's voice; the flowers exhaled their ≈øweets; the fi≈øhes ≈øported upon the ≈ømooth waters of the river; all nature at the moment of its revival, ≈øeemed to thank

the bountiful Creator for the new benefits which he be≈øtowed.</p>
                  <p>Timbrio, Blanche and Ni≈øida, little accu≈øtomed to this ≈øpectacle, contemplated it with ≈øurpri≈øe; the entering into the valley of tombs filled them with fre≈øh admiration.</p>
                  <p>Upon the bank of that beautiful river, who≈øe waters roll over golden ≈øands, is a ≈øpace of a mile ≈øquare, girt on all ≈øides by a chain of hills, but one pa≈ø≈øage leads into it through a long defile, the ≈øides of which are lined with rows of cypre≈øs that ri≈øe above each other like an amphitheatre, and ≈øo clo≈øely locked together, that their interlacing branches form a thick wall and high as the tops of the hills; ro≈øes and wild <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The honour of being interred in this valley was not granted to all the dead; it was the recompence of an irreproachable life. The village, in a≈ø≈øembly adjudged it; alas! the tombs were but few!</p>
                  <p>The ≈øhepherds being arrived at the fountain, ≈øtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there; and Salvadore rai≈øing his voice, ≈øeparate your≈øelves ≈øaid he, you will a≈ø≈øemble near me, when the trumpet ≈øounds again. At the≈øe words every one di≈øper≈øes; each widow, each orphan, ran to the ≈øtone that covered the object of their tears.</p>
                  <p>Timbrio, Fabian and the two ≈øi≈øters lo≈øt ≈øight of Elicio, they looked around the valley for him; they ≈øoon di≈øcovered him on his knees before the tomb of his mother, his hands were joined together, and his eyes, full of tears rai≈øed up to heaven‚ÄîOh! my mother, ≈øaid he, you are ≈øurely happy, ≈øince you were always good; look down upon me from your dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above, watch over me, and ≈øo in≈øpire my heart that I may love virtue as well as I have loved you.

                  <p>The four lovers li≈øtened to him in ≈øilence, they approached him, and Timbrio taking the hand of the ≈øhepherd, worthy ≈øon, ≈øaid he to him, you fill my heart with tenderne≈øs and re≈øpect; promi≈øe to be my friend, and from this moment, I will renounce the world, become a ≈øhepherd, with Ni≈øida, Blanche,

                  <p>To reach the fountain of Ardoi≈øes, it was nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to quit the banks of the Tagus and cro≈øs ≈øome hills covered with wood.

                  <p>After having fri≈øked from one party to another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately care≈ø≈øing Elicio and Galatea, he ran about the mountain and ≈øtarted a wild kid, which he clo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pur≈øued; the kid fled and pa≈ø≈øed near to the ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde≈ø≈øes.

                  <p>The dog of Elicio had not quit his ma≈øter, and would have made efforts to ≈øuccour him, but a wild goat gave him enough to do to defend him≈øelf; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that he ≈øhould not get to her ≈øide, ≈øhe pu≈øhed him before her, ≈øtill menacing him with her horns, whil≈øt the young kid now lo≈øing all fear, jumped round its mother, and ≈øeemed to brave him that he ≈øo lately dreaded.</p>

                  <p>Teolinda ≈øaw by his di≈øcour≈øe, that grief had un≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the rea≈øon of the unfortunate Artidore.

Artidore li≈øtens to her like a man come out of a long ≈øleep; he replies properly to ≈øome que≈øtions, makes her repeat others; by little and little, his memory and his ideas come to him; Love bereft him of rea≈øon, Love ought to give it back to him again; he ≈øtops, he con≈øiders Teolinda, recollects her, falls at her feet, holds her in his arms, and his tears proved to the ≈øhepherde≈øs, that her lover was no longer in≈øen≈øible.</p>
                  <p>They arrived at the fountain, where every one joined them; Flori≈øe and Galatea had related as they went along, all that they knew of the loves of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and Teolinda.

the third ≈øhall be put into the hands of Salvadore to be di≈øtributed among the poor of the village; and the fourth part ≈øhall be di≈øpo≈øed of in purcha≈øing an hou≈øe, lands, and a flock for Ni≈øida and me. Yes, my good friends, I will become a ≈øhepherd, I will end my days with you and Fabian; our cottages ≈øhall be near each other, our families ≈øhall be united, we will live an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the village, and we will grow old together in peace, in happine≈øs, and in love.</p>
                  <p>Every one admired the genero≈øity of Timbrio; Artidore and Teolinda held him in a long and ≈øilent embrace. Meoris was willing that the contracts ≈øhould be all ≈øettled that evening; he ran to ≈øpread in the village the news of ≈øo many happy events, and brought back with him the notary and the venerable Salvadore.</p>
                  <p>The contracts were ≈øoon fini≈øhed, and it was agreed that Timbrio, the very next day, ≈øhould ≈øend back all his ≈øuite to Toledo; with a confidential ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who ≈øhould carry the news to the relations of Ni≈øida, and bring back in ready money, the fortune of his ma≈øter. In the mean time, Meoris was to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe the flocks and farms for the new ≈øhepherds: and till all was got ready, Timbrio and Fabian, with their wives, were to remain at the hou≈øe of Meoris; and Teolinda and Artidore at that of Era≈øtres.</p>
                  <p>Nothing was now wanting but to fix the day of their four marriages; Elicio, notwith≈øtanding his wounds, was decided that it ≈øhould be the next day, nor could the wi≈øe Salvadore prevail on him to defer it. The re≈øt, without ≈øaying any thing, were of opinion with Elicio.</p>

                  <head>AMELIA: OR THE FAITHLESS BRITON.</head>
                  <p>THE revolutions of government, and the ≈øubver≈øions of empire, which have ≈øwelled the theme of national hi≈øtorians, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, in every age, furni≈øhed anecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveli≈øt. The objects of policy or ambition are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, indeed, accompli≈øhed at the expence of private ea≈øe and pro≈øperity; while the triumph of arms, like the funeral fe≈øtivity of a ≈øavage tribe, ≈øerves to announce ≈øome recent calamity‚Äîthe wa≈øte of property, or the fall of families.</p>
                  <p>Thus, the great events of the late war, which produced the ≈øeparation of the Briti≈øh empire, and e≈øtabli≈øhed the ≈øovereignty of America, were chequered with ≈øcenes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ≈øorrow, and the ≈øucce≈øs of the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of dome≈øtic life. The lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the widow and the orphan, mingled
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033741_0133_0FF8FB611EB10288"/>
with the ≈øong of victory; and the ≈øable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with which the hand of friend≈øhip cloathed the bier of the gallant MONTGOMERY, ca≈øt a momentary gloom upon the trophies his valour had atchieved.</p>
                  <p>Though the following tale then, does not exhibit the terrible magnificence of warlike operations, or ≈øcrutinize the principles of national politics, it recites an epi≈øode that too frequently occurs in the military drama, and contains a hi≈øtory of female affliction, that claims, from its authenticity, at lea≈øt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in the feeling heart. It is the fir≈øt of a ≈øeries of novels, drawn from the ≈øame ≈øource, and intended for public communication, but as the author's object is merely to glean tho≈øe circum≈øtances in the progre≈øs of the revolution, which the hi≈øtorian has neither lei≈øure nor di≈øpo≈øition to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and to produce, from the annals of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, ≈øomething to entertain, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to improve his readers, the occa≈øion will yield little to hope from the applau≈øe of the public, and nothing to dread from its candor.</p>
                  <p>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a re≈øpectable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the ≈øtate of New-York. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs had rewarded his indu≈øtry in trade with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033741_0134_0FF8FB65A768E9B8"/>
an ample fortune; and his mind, unconta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by envy and ambition, freely indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it≈øelf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the former character he ≈øuperintended the education of a ≈øon and a daughter, left to his ≈øole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and council were uniformly exerci≈øed for the relief of the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, and the information of the illiterate.</p>
                  <p>His mercantile intercour≈øe with Great Britain afforded an early opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving the di≈øpo≈øition of that kingdom with re≈øpect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furni≈øhed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war. The texture of his mind, indeed, was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calm and pa≈ø≈øive, and the ordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a life of ≈øixty years duration, had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eradicated all tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øions which rou≈øe men to oppo≈øition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the gauntlet was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the ≈øpirit of di≈øcord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from public clamour, to a ≈øeque≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered cottage, in the interior di≈øtrict of Long-I≈øland; and con≈øecrating the youthful
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033741_0135_0FF8C207A17F8BD8"/>
ardour of his ≈øon, Honorius, to the ≈øervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</p>
                  <p>Amelia had then attained her ≈øeventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uni≈øon with the mildne≈øs of her a≈øpect, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite harmony of her ≈øoul, was re≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive to the ≈øymmetry of her per≈øon. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompli≈øhment that depends upon tuition; and it was the ≈øingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our ≈øex, and the favourite of her own. From ≈øuch a daughter, Horatio could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every ≈øolace of which his generous feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ≈øu≈øceptible in a ≈øea≈øon of national calamity; but the din of arms that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted the ≈øilence of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fore≈øts, and the di≈øa≈øtrous intelligence which his ≈øon occa≈øionally tran≈ømitted from the ≈øtandard of the union, ≈øuperceded the cheerful avocations of the day, and di≈øpelled the peaceful ≈ølumbers of the night.</p>
                  <p>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happine≈øs of Horatio's family, the ≈øound of artillery announced a battle, and the hor≈øemen who were ob≈øerved gallopping acro≈øs the grounds, proved that the ≈øcene of action could not be remote. As ≈øoon, therefore, as the tumult of ho≈øtility
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033741_0136_0FF8FB68219AEF90"/>
had ≈øub≈øided, Horatio advanced with his dome≈øtics, to admini≈øter comfort and a≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the wounded, and to provide a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traver≈øing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, who≈øe exhau≈øted ≈øtrength ju≈øt ≈øerved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the pre≈øervation of this intere≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øionate exertions might be crowned with ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs. Having bathed, and bound up his wounds, the youthful ≈øoldier was borne to the cottage; where, in a ≈øhort time, a ≈øtronger pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Amelia, who had anxiou≈øly waited the arrival of her father, beheld, with a mixed ≈øen≈øation of horror and pity, the ≈øpectacle which now accompanied him. She had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ≈øeen the ≈øemblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwith≈øtanding the pallid countenance of the wounded gue≈øt, he po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed an elegance of per≈øon, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural operations of female ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibility, added ≈øomething perhaps, to her commi≈øeration for his misfortunes. When,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033741_0137_0FF8FB6AA26ACA80"/>
however, the≈øe fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øions had pa≈ø≈øed away, the tenderne≈øs of her nature expre≈ø≈øed it≈øelf in the mo≈øt a≈ø≈øiduous actions for his ea≈øe and accommodation, and the increa≈øing ≈øymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</p>
                  <p>The day ≈øucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who had made an ineffectual ≈øearch for his body among the ≈ølain, arrived at the cottage, and di≈øcovered him to be <hi>Doli≈øcus,</hi> the only ≈øon and heir of a noble family in England.</p>
                  <p>When Doli≈øcus had recovered from the ≈øen≈øele≈øs ≈øtate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effu≈øion of blood) the fir≈øt exerci≈øe of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profe≈ø≈øion of gratitude. To Horatio he ≈øpoke in terms of reverence and re≈øpect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But Doli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus had been reared in the ≈øchool of di≈ø≈øipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to con≈øider virtue only as an ob≈øtacle to plea≈øure, and beauty merely as an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the gratification of pa≈ø≈øion. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033741_0138_0FF8FB6C40E8B638"/>
≈øoon enabled him to di≈øcover ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ≈øolicitude of the artle≈øs Amelia beyond the dictates of compa≈ø≈øion and ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality; and even before his wounds were clo≈øed, he conceived the infamous project of violating the purity and tranquility of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exi≈øtence, and the re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of his health. From that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, however, which betrayed her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, while ≈øhe was her≈øelf ignorant of their ≈øource, he anticipated the extreme≈øt difficulty and danger. To improve the evident predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, required not, indeed, a very ≈øtrenuous di≈øplay of his talents and addre≈øs; but the ≈øacrifice of her honour (which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurmountable antipathy to the matrimonial engagements made nece≈ø≈øary to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhment of his purpo≈øe) was a ta≈øk that he ju≈øtly fore≈øaw, could be only executed by the dete≈øtable agency of perfidy and fraud. With the≈øe views then he readily accepted the ≈øolicitations of his un≈øu≈øpecting ho≈øt, and even contrived to protract his cure, in order to furni≈øh a plea for his continuance at the cottage.</p>
                  <p>Amelia, when, at length, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions for his ≈øafety were removed, employed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033741_0139_0FF8FB6F2F079CA0"/>
all the charms of mu≈øic and conver≈øation to di≈ø≈øipate the languor, which his indi≈øpo≈øition had produced, and to prevent the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, with which retirement is apt to affect a di≈øpo≈øition accu≈øtomed to the gay and bu≈øy tran≈øactions of the world. She experienced an unu≈øual plea≈øure, indeed, in the di≈øcharge of the≈øe benevolent offices; for in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Doli≈øcus ≈øhe in≈øen≈øibly forgot the anxiety ≈øhe was wont to feel for the fate of her ab≈øent brother; and the ≈øympathy which ≈øhe had hitherto extended to all the ≈øufferers of the war, was now monopolized by a ≈øingle object. Horatio's attachment to the ≈øolitude of his library, afforded frequent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for this infatuating intercour≈øe, which the de≈øigning Doli≈øcus gradually diverted from general to particular topics‚Äîfrom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations upon public manners and events, to in≈øinuations of per≈øonal e≈øteem and partiality. Amelia was incapable of deceit, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ≈øu≈øpicion. The energy, but, at the ≈øame time, the re≈øpect, with which Doli≈øcus addre≈ø≈øed her, was grateful to her feelings; his rank and fortune entitled him to con≈øideration, and the ine≈øtimable favours that had been conferred upon him, offered a ≈øpecious ≈øecurity for his truth and fidelity. The acknowledgment of reciprocal regard
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033741_0140_0FF8FB731806BDD8"/>
was, therefore, an ea≈øy acqui≈øition, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øcus triumphed in the mode≈øt, but expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit avowal, before Amelia was apprized of its importance and extent. From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however, he a≈ø≈øumed a pen≈øive and dejected carriage. He occa≈øionally affected to ≈øtart from the terrors of a deep reverie<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and the vivacity of his temper, which had never yielded to the angui≈øh of his wounds, ≈øeemed ≈øuddenly to have expired under the weight of ≈øecret and intolerable affliction. Amelia, di≈øtre≈ø≈øed and a≈øtoni≈øhed, implored an explanation of ≈øo my≈øterious a change in his deportment; but his reiterated ≈øighs, which were for a while, the only an≈øwers ≈øhe received, tended equally to encrea≈øe her curio≈øity and her ≈øorrow.</p>
                  <p>At length he undertook to di≈øclo≈øe the ≈øource of his pretended wretchedne≈øs; and, having prefaced the hypocritical tale with the mo≈øt ≈øolemn prote≈øtions of his love and con≈øtancy, he told the trembling Amelia that, were it even po≈ø≈øible to di≈øengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf from an alliance which had been early contracted for him with a noble heire≈øs of London, ≈øtill the pride of family, and the ≈øpirit of loyalty, which governed his father's actions, would oppo≈øe a union unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the acclamations of dignity, and formed with one who≈øe connections were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033741_0141_0FF8FB755FB19238"/>
zealous in the arduous re≈øi≈øtence to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Britain. "While he lives," added Doli≈øcus, " it is not in my power to choo≈øe the means of happine≈øs‚Äîand yet, as the time approaches when it will be incon≈øi≈øtent with the duty and honour of a ≈øoldier to enjoy any longer the ≈øociety of Amelia, how can I reflect upon my ≈øituation without angui≈øh and de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair!" The delicate frame of Amelia was agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ≈øen≈øations which this picture had excited; and, for the fir≈øt time, ≈øhe became acquainted with the force of love, and the dread of ≈øeparation from its object. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øcus traced the ≈øentiments of her heart in the ≈øilent, but certain indications of her countenance, and when tears had melted the violence of her fir≈øt emotion into a ≈øoft and ≈øympathetic grief, the treacherous ≈øuitor thus pro≈øecuted his ≈øcheme again≈øt her peace and innocence.</p>
                  <p>"But it is impo≈ø≈øible to re≈øolve upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual mi≈øery! One thing may yet be done to change the ≈øcene without incurring a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's re≈øentment and reproach:‚Äîcan my Amelia con≈øent to ≈øacrifice a ≈øentiment of delicacy, to en≈øure a life of happine≈øs?" Her complexion brightened and her eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øitively turned towards him. " The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of public marriage" he continued,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033741_0142_0FF8FB7847CE3EC8"/>
"neither adds ≈øtrength or energy to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: for, form is the ≈øuperfluous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpring of fa≈øhion, not the re≈øult of rea≈øon. The poor pea≈øant who≈øe nuptial contract is only witne≈ø≈øed by the hallowed mini≈øter that pronounces it, is as ble≈øt as the prince who weds in all the o≈øtentation of a court, and furni≈øhes an additional fe≈øtival to a giddy nation. My Amelia has ≈øurely no vanity to gratify with idle pageantry; and as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy of the marriage does not take from its ≈øanctity, I will venture to propo≈øe‚Äînay, look not with ≈øeverity‚Äîat the neighbouring farm we may be met by the chaplain of my regiment, and love and honour ≈øhall record a union, which prudence fetters with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ≈øecrecy."</p>
                  <p>Hope, fear, the ≈øen≈øe of decorum, and the incitements of a pa≈ø≈øion pure, but fervent, compleated the painful perturbation of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's heart, and, in this critical moment of her fate, deprived her of ≈øpeech and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>An anxious interval of ≈øilence took place; but when, at length, the power of expre≈ø≈øion returned, Amelia urged the duty which ≈øhe owed to a parent, the ≈øcandal which the world imputed to clande≈øtine marriages, and the fatal con≈øequences that might ari≈øe from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033741_0143_0FF8FB7A8AADB038"/>
the ob≈øcurity of the tran≈øaction. But Doli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, ≈øteady to his purpo≈øe, again deprecated the folly of pur≈øuing the ≈øhadow in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ≈øub≈øtance, of pre≈øerving fame at the expence of happine≈øs, and of relinqui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ble≈ø≈øings of connubial life, for the ≈øake of its formalities. He ≈øpoke of Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's inflexible integrity, which could not brook even the appearance of deception, and of his punctilious honour, which could not ≈øubmit even to the appearance of intru≈øion upon the dome≈øtic arrangements of another, as in≈øurmountable arguments for denying him the knowledge of their union. Finally, he de≈øcribed, in the warme≈øt colouring of pa≈ø≈øion and fancy, the effects of Amelia's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal upon the future tenor of his life, and bathing her hand with his obedient tears, practi≈øed all the arts of flattery and frenzy. The influence of love ≈øupercedes every other obligation: Amelia acknowledged its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and yielded to the per≈øua≈øion of the exulting Doli≈øcus. The marriage ceremony was privately repeated‚Äîbut how will it excite the indignation of the virtuous read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when he under≈øtands, that the ≈øacred character of the prie≈øt was per≈øonated by a ≈øoldier whom Doli≈øcus had ≈øuborned for this iniquitous occa≈øion! Ye ≈øpirits of ≈øeduction!
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033741_0144_0FF8FB7C4A6CDE78"/>
who≈øe means are the pro≈øtitution of faith, and who≈øe end is the de≈øtruction of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ‚Äîtremble at impending judgment, for "there is no mercy in heaven for ≈øuch unheard of crimes as the≈øe!"</p>
                  <p>But a ≈øhort time had elap≈øed after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ≈øtep, when the mandate of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer obliged Doli≈øcus to prepare for joining his corps. A ≈øilent, but pungent ≈øen≈øe of indi≈øcretion, added to the angui≈øh which Amelia felt in the hour of ≈øeparation; and not all his ≈øtrong a≈ø≈øurances of inviolable truth and attachment, with the ≈øoothing pro≈øpect of an honourable avowal of their union, could efface the melancholy impre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her mind The farmer at who≈øe hou≈øe the fictitious marriage had been rehear≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was employed to manage their future corre≈øpondence; and Doli≈øcus, finally, left the cottage with vows of love and gratitude at his lips; but ≈øchemes of fraud and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in his heart. The ≈ømall di≈øtance from New-York, where he was quartered, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it ea≈øy to maintain an epi≈øtolary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe; which became, during its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the only employment, and the only gratification of Amelia's exi≈øtence. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, however, exceeded not a few weeks. Doli≈øcus ≈øoon a≈ø≈øumed a formal and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033741_0145_0FF8C2095F8C4758"/>
di≈øpa≈ø≈øionate ≈øtyle, and the number of his letters gradually dimini≈øhed, and every allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to that marriage, which was the la≈øt hope and con≈øolation of Amelia, he cautiou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided.</p>
                  <p>But an event, that demanded the exerci≈øe of all her fortitude, now forced it≈øelf upon Amelia's thoughts. She was pregnant; yet could neither re≈øort for council and comfort to the father whom ≈øhe had deceived, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from the lover by whom ≈øhe had been ≈øeduced. In the tendere≈øt and mo≈øt delicate terms ≈øhe communicated her ≈øituation to Doli≈øcus, emphatically called upon him to re≈øcue her reputation from obloquy, and ≈øolicitou≈øly courted his return to the cottage, or, at lea≈øt, that he would di≈øclo≈øe to Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio the ≈øecret of their union. To prevent any accident, the farmer was prevailed upon to be the bearer of the paper which contained the≈øe ≈øentiments, and, on his return pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the following epi≈øtle.</p>

                  <p>"Gracious God!" exclaimed Amelia, and fell ≈øen≈øele≈øs to the ground. For a while, a convul≈øive motion ≈øhook her frame, but gradually ≈øub≈øiding, the flame of life ≈øeemed to be extinct, and all her terrors at an end. The poor farmer, petrified with horror and

amazement, ≈øtood gazing on the ≈øcene: but the exertions of his homely ≈øpou≈øe, at length, re≈øtored Amelia to exi≈øtence and de≈øpair.</p>
                  <p>It has often been ob≈øerved, that de≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency begets boldne≈øs and enterprize; and the female heart, which is ≈øu≈øceptible of the gentle≈øt ≈øentiment, is, likewi≈øe, capable of the noble≈øt fortitude. Amelia perceived all the ba≈øene≈øs of the de≈øertion meditated by Doli≈øcus; ≈øhe fore≈øaw all its ruinous con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ≈øhe bore; and wiping the u≈øele≈øs tears from her cheek, ≈øhe re≈øolved publicly to vindicate her honour, and a≈ø≈øert her rights. Animated then, with the important purpo≈øe, ≈øupported by the pre≈øumption of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus in New-York, ≈øhe immediately repaired to that city‚Äîbut alas! he was gone! This di≈øappointment, however, did not defeat, nor could any ob≈øtacle retard the pro≈øecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her de≈øign: a ≈øhip that ≈øailed the ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding day wa≈øted her to Britain, friendle≈øs and forlorn.</p>
                  <p>Innumerable difficulties and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were encountered by the inexperienced traveller, but they vani≈øhed before the object of her pur≈øuit; and even her entrance into
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033741_0148_0FF8FB85DD801BD8"/>
London, that chaos of clamour and di≈ø≈øipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, produced no other ≈øen≈øations than tho≈øe which naturally aro≈øe from her approach to the dwelling of Doli≈øcus.</p>
                  <p>Amelia recollected that Doli≈øcus had often de≈øcribed the family re≈øidence to be ≈øituated in Gro≈øvenor-place; and the ≈øtage, in which ≈øhe journeyed, ≈øtopping in the evening at a public hou≈øe in Picadilly, ≈øhe determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome vi≈øit. The embarra≈ø≈øed and anxious manner with which ≈øhe inquired for his hou≈øe, expo≈øed her to unju≈øt ≈øurmi≈øe and ≈øen≈øele≈øs ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of ob≈øervation, and her purity was ≈øuperior to in≈øult.</p>
                  <p>Doli≈øcus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence, and fortune, which devolved upon him in con≈øequence of his father's death, had ≈øwelled his youthful vanity to exce≈øs, and ≈øupplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was li≈øtening in extacy to that ≈øervile crew, the victim of his arts, the deluded daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the pre≈øervation of his life, ≈øtood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pau≈øe of ≈øome minutes, procured her admi≈ø≈øion. Her memory recognized the features of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033741_0149_0FF8FB88CB5CCC58"/>
≈øervant that opened the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doli≈øcus at the cottage ‚Äî ≈øhe remembered not where or when ≈øhe had ≈øeen him.</p>
                  <p>After con≈øiderable ≈øolicitation, the porter con≈øented to call Doli≈øcus from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conducted Amelia into an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter ≈øucceeded the delivery of her me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage, and the word <hi>a≈ø≈øignation,</hi> which was repeated on all ≈øides, ≈øeemed to renovate the wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant ho≈øt, inflamed with champagne, was not di≈øplea≈øed at the imputation; but ob≈øerved, that as a lady was in the ca≈øe, it was unnece≈ø≈øary to apologize for a ≈øhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertion of his friends and wine.</p>
                  <p>At the ≈øight of that lady, however, Doli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ≈øtarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and haggard with fatigue and ≈øorrow; her per≈øon was oppre≈ø≈øed with the burthen which ≈øhe now bore in its la≈øt ≈øtage, and her eye, fixed ≈øteadfa≈øtly upon him, as he entered the room, be≈øpoke the complicated angui≈øh and indignation of her feelings. Her a≈øpect ≈øo changed, and her appearance ≈øo unexpected, added to the terrors of a guilty con≈øcience, for a moment, Doli≈øcus thought the vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ≈øupernatural. But Amelia's wrongs having in≈øpired her with courage, ≈øhe boldly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033741_0150_0FF8FB8B0E8E5D38"/>
reproached him with his ba≈øene≈øs and per≈øidy, and demanded a public and unequivocal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to ≈øooth and divert her from her purpo≈øe, in vain to per≈øuade her to ≈øilence and delay,‚Äîhis arts had lo≈øt their wonted influence, while the re≈øtoration of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured fame and honour ab≈øorbed every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her mind.</p>
                  <p>At length he a≈ø≈øumed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he, "I am not to be thus duped or controuled. I have a ≈øen≈øe of pity, indeed, for your indi≈øcretion, but none for your pa≈ø≈øion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not ≈øubmit to your frenzy." "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe ≈øomething to a father's peace, I ≈øhould de≈øpi≈øe to call thee hu≈øband."‚Äî"<hi>Hu≈øband</hi>" cried Doli≈øcus, with a ≈øneer, "Hu≈øband! why truly, I remember a rural ma≈øquerade, at which an hone≈øt ≈øoldier, now my humble porter, played the par≈øon, and you the blu≈øhing bride‚Äîbut, pr'ythee, do not talk of hu≈øband."‚Äî</p>
                  <p>This di≈øcovery only was wanting for the con≈øummation of Amelia's mi≈øery. It was ≈øudden and fatal as the lightning's bla≈øt‚Äî≈øhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

≈øeized upon her ≈øen≈øes, which was ≈øometimes interrupted with a boi≈øterous laugh, and ≈øometimes with a nervous ejaculation.</p>
                  <p>Doli≈øcus, unaffected by compa≈ø≈øion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor≈øe, was ≈øolicitous only to employ this opportunity for Amelia's removal, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed her into a coach, a ≈øervant was directed to procure lodgings for her, in ≈øome ob≈øcure quarter of the city. She ≈øpoke not a word during the tran≈øaction, but gazing with apparent indifference upon the objects that ≈øurrounded her, ≈øhe ≈øubmitted to be tran≈øported whither ≈øoever they plea≈øed to conduct her. After winding through a dreary and dirty pa≈ø≈øage in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's, the carriage ≈øtopped at a hovel which belonged to a relation of the ≈øervant that accompanied her, and, he having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in a ≈øhort whi≈øper the object of his vi≈øit, an old and decrepid beldame led Amelia into a damp and narrow room, who≈øe ≈øcant and tattered furniture proved the wretchedne≈øs of its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>A premature birth was the natural con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the conflict which had raged in Amelia's mind. She had entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but a few moments, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that event gave a turn to her pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, and called her drooping faculties once more into action.

a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, in the hour of extreme di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈øs (≈øave the officious ≈øervices of her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated ho≈øt) ≈øhe was delivered of a ≈øon; but the fond ≈øen≈øibility of the mother obtained an in≈øtantaneous ≈øuperiority over every other con≈øideration. Though, alas! this ≈øolitary gratification too, continued not long;‚Äîher infant expired after a languid exi≈øtence of three days, ≈øerving only to increa≈øe the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne≈øs of Amelia's portion.</p>
                  <p>Amelia ca≈øt her eye towards heaven as the breath de≈øerted the body of her babe:‚Äîit was not a look of ≈øupplication, for what had ≈øhe to hope, or what to dread?‚Äîneither did it indicate di≈ø≈øatisfaction or reproach, for ≈øhe had early learned the duty of reverence and re≈øignation‚Äîbut it was an awful appeal to the throne of grace, for the vindication of the act by which ≈øhe had re≈øolved to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate her woes. A phial of laudanum, left by a charitable apothecary, who had vi≈øited her in her ≈øickne≈øs, pre≈øented the means, and ≈øhe wanted not the fortitude to employ them. Deliberately, then, pouring the baneful draught into a gla≈øs, ≈øhe looked wi≈øtfully for a while upon the infant corp≈øe that lay extended on its bed, then bending on her knee, uttered, in a firm and ≈øolemn voice the melancholy effu≈øions of her ≈øoul,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033741_0153_0FF8FB942068FB58"/>
‚Äî"Gracious Father! when thy ju≈øtice ≈øhall pronounce upon the deed which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricates me from the calamities of the world, let thy mercy contemplate the cau≈øe that urged me to the perpetration.

The treachery of him to whom I entru≈øted my fate, has reduced me to de≈øpair‚Äîthe declining day of him from whom I received my being, has been cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my indi≈øcretions, and there is no cure left for the ≈øorrows that con≈øume me, but the dark and ≈øilent grave. Vi≈øit me not then, in thy wrath, oh! Father, but let the exce≈øs of my ≈øufferings in this world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the crime which wafts me into the world to come‚Äîmay thy mercy yield com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Horatio's heart, and teach Doli≈øcus the virtue of repentance!"</p>
                  <p>She ro≈øe and lifted the gla≈øs. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, a noi≈øe on the ≈øtairs attracted her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and a voice anxiou≈øly pronouncing ‚Äî"It mu≈øt be ≈øo! ‚Äînay, I will ≈øee her‚Äî" arre≈øted the dreadful potion in its pa≈ø≈øage to her lips. "It is my Amelia!" exclaimed Horatio, as he ha≈øtily entered the room.</p>
                  <p>Amelia ≈øtarted, and looked for ≈øome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033741_0154_0FF8FB96996ADDD0"/>
intently on her father, then ru≈øhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arms, and anxiou≈øly concealed the ≈øhame and agony of her countenance, in that bo≈øom, from which alone ≈øhe now dreaded reproach, or hoped for con≈øolation. He, too, beheld with horror the ≈øcene that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to his view: he pre≈ø≈øed his deluded, mi≈øerable daughter, to his heart, while a ≈øtream of tears ran freely down his cheeks; till, at length, his imagination, infected with the objects that ≈øurrounded him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the dreadful purpo≈øe of the draught, which had fallen from Amelia's hand, and anticipated a ≈øorrow, even beyond the extremity of his pre≈øent feelings. When, however, he collected ≈øufficient courage to re≈øolve his fears, and it was a≈øcertained, that the meditated act had not been perpetrated, a momentary ≈øen≈øation of joy illuminated his mind, like the tran≈øient appearance of the moon, amid≈øt the gloomy horrors of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ≈øtorm.</p>
                  <p>When the fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øions of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interview had pa≈ø≈øed away, Horatio ≈øpoke comfort to his daughter. "Come my child, the hand of Heaven, that afflicted us with worldly cares, has been ≈øtretched out to guard you from everla≈øting wretchedne≈øs: ‚Äîthat Providence which proves how vain

are the pur≈øuits of this life, has be≈øtowed upon us the means of ≈øeeking the permanent happine≈øs of that which is to come. Cheer up, my Amelia! The errors of our conduct may expo≈øe us to the ≈øcandal of the world, but it is guilt alone which can violate the inward tranquility of the mind." He then took her hand, and attempted to lead her to the door. "Let us withdraw from this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ≈øcene, my love!"‚Äî"Look there!" ≈øaid Amelia, pointing to the corp≈øe. "Look there!" "Ah!" ≈øaid Horatio, in a faultering accent-"but it is the will of Heaven!" "Then it is right," cried Amelia‚Äî"give the poor victim a little earth‚Äî≈øir! is it not ≈øad to think of?‚Äîbut I am reconciled." She now con≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit the room, and was conveyed in a carriage to the inn, at which Horatio (who immediately returned to ≈øuperintend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment of the child) had ≈øtopped on his arrival.</p>
                  <p>It is now proper to inform the reader, that after Amelia had left the Cottage, and the alarm of her elopement had ≈øpread around the neighbourhood, the Farmer ha≈øtened to communicate to Horatio the tran≈øactions which he had witne≈ø≈øed, and the ≈øu≈øpicions which his wife had conceived of Amelia's ≈øituation. The wretched father ≈øickened at the tale. But it was the ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033741_0156_0FF8FB9A9F9E1DC0"/>
of compa≈ø≈øion, and not of re≈øentment, that oppre≈ø≈øed his ≈øoul. There are men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ≈øo abject in their ≈øubjection to the opinion of the world, that they can ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice natural affection to artificial pride, and doom to perpetual infamy and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, a child, who might be reclaimed from error by parental admonition, or rai≈øed from de≈øpair by the fo≈øtering hand of friend≈øhip. Horatio, however, entertained a different ≈øen≈øe: he regarded not the weakne≈øs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue as an object of accu≈øation, but liberally di≈øtingui≈øhed between the crimes and the errors of mankind; and, when he could not alleviate the afflicted, or correct the vicious, he continued to lament, but he forebore to reprobate, "My poor Amelia! how ba≈øely has her innocence been betrayed! ‚ÄîBut I mu≈øt follow her:‚Äîit may be her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries have di≈øtracted her, and ≈øhe has fled, ≈øhe knows not whither! Come! not a moment ≈øhall be lo≈øt: I will overtake my child, wherever her ≈øorrows may lead her: for, if I cannot procure redre≈øs for her wrongs, I will, at lea≈øt, admini≈øter comfort to her mi≈øeries." Such was the language of Horatio, as ≈øoon as he could exerci≈øe the power of utterance. A few days enabled him to arrange his affairs, and having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033741_0157_0FF8FB9D8D016050"/>
the route which Amelia had taken, he embarked in the fir≈øt ve≈ø≈øel for England. The peculiar object of his voyage, and the nature of his misfortunes, determined him to conceal him≈øelf from the knowledge of his friends and corre≈øpondents; and a lucky chance di≈øcovered the wretched abode of his Amelia, the very in≈øtant of his arrival in London.</p>
                  <p>"Can you tell me, ny good ho≈øt, where Doli≈øcus the lord‚Äî, re≈øides?" ≈øaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio as he entered the inn. "Marry, that I can," replied the landlord:" his ≈øervant is ju≈øt now talking with my wife; and if you will ≈øtep into the next room, perhaps he will ≈øhow you the way to the hou≈øe." Horatio ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the room door, and, upon looking through a gla≈øs pannel in the door, he beheld the identical ≈øervant that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Doli≈øcus at the Cottage, in eager conver≈øation with the ho≈øte≈øs. He pau≈øed. "She is delivered; but the child is dead:" ‚Äî≈øaid the ≈øervant. Horatio ≈øtarted; his imagination eagerly interpreted the≈øe words to have been ≈øpoken of Amelia, and he could ≈øcarcely re≈øtrain the angui≈øh of his feelings from loud exclamation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.‚Äî"My lord's con≈øcience grows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øually trouble≈øome" continued the ≈øervant;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033741_0158_0FF8FBA00EDC13C0"/>
"he has ordered me again to inquire after her health, and to provide for the funeral of the child‚Äîwould ≈øhe were ≈øafe in America! for, to be ≈øure, her father is the be≈øt old man that ever lived!" "It's well!" cried Horatio. "Did you call, ≈øir?" ≈øaid the ho≈øte≈øs, opening the door. The ≈øervant took this opportunity of withdrawing, and Horatio ≈øilently followed him, at a di≈øtance, till he arrived at the habitation of Amelia, in the critical moment which enabled him to ≈øave the life he had given, and to re≈øcue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded daughter from the de≈øperate ≈øin of ≈øuicide.</p>
                  <p>When Horatio returned to the inn, after di≈øcharging the la≈øt ≈øolemn duties to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted infant, the landlord pre≈øented a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, which a ≈øervant had ju≈øt left at the bar, and a≈øked if he was the per≈øon to whom it was addre≈ø≈øed. As ≈øoon as Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio had ca≈øt his eye upon the ≈øuper≈øcription, he exclaimed, "What my≈øtery is this?‚ÄîA letter left for my ≈øon Honorius at an inn in London." He eagerly ≈øeized the paper, and retiring into an adjoining chamber, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øed its contents with increa≈øed amazement and agitation.</p>

                  <p>The voice of Honorius, inquiring for the letter, rou≈øed Horatio from the reverie into which its contents had plunged him. The honour of his ≈øon, the villainy of his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goni≈øt, and Amelia's ≈øufferings, contending with the feelings of the father, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the chri≈øtian, at la≈øt prevailed with him to ≈øuffer the ho≈øtile interview to which Doli≈øcus had thus con≈øented. When therefore Honorius entered the room, and the natural expre≈ø≈øions of tenderne≈øs and ≈øurprize were mutually exchanged, they freely di≈øcour≈øed of the lamentable hi≈øtory of Amelia, and warmly execrated that treachery which had accompli≈øhed the ruin of her peace and fame. Nor had Doli≈øcus confined his ba≈øene≈øs to this object. The chance of war had thrown Honorius into his power ≈øhortly after his departure from the cottage, and di≈øcovering his affinity to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033741_0160_0FF8FBA25697EB98"/>
the per≈øevering hypocrite artfully in≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated to the commander in chief, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius meditated an e≈øcape, and obtained an order for his impri≈øonment on board a frigate, which ≈øailing ≈øuddenly for England, he was lodged upon his arrival, in the common gaol, appropriated for the confinement of American pri≈øoners. Here it was, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he acquired the information of Amelia's elopement, and heard the cau≈øe to which it was imputed from the captured ma≈øter of an American ve≈ø≈øel, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been employed in the ≈øervice of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, and had received the communication from the lips of his ancient patron, in the fir≈øt moments of his grief. The fate which had unexpectedly led him to Britain, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius now regarded as the mini≈øter of his revenge. He frowned away the tear which ≈øtarted at the recital of his ≈øi≈øter's wrongs, as if a≈øhamed to pity 'till he had redre≈ø≈øed them; and feeling, upon this occa≈øion, an additional motive for ≈øoliciting his freedom, he employed the intere≈øt of Horatio's name, which notwith≈øtanding the political feuds that prevailed, was ≈øufficient, at length, to procure his di≈øcharge upon parol. Having ea≈øily learned the abode of Doli≈øcus, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addre≈ø≈øed that note to him which
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033741_0161_0FF8FBA499C09720"/>
produced the an≈øwer delivered to Horatio.</p>
                  <p>When Honorius was informed that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia was, at that time, beneath the ≈øame roof, he expre≈ø≈øed an eager de≈øire immediately to embrace his afflicted ≈øi≈øter; but Horatio ≈øtrongly repre≈øented the impropriety of an interview 'till the event of the a≈ø≈øignation with Doli≈øcus was a≈øcertained, and it was, therefore, agreed for the pre≈øent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his arrival from her knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Ab≈øorbed in the melancholy of her thoughts, Amelia had not uttered a ≈øyllable ≈øince the removal from her dreary habitation, but ≈øuffered the bu≈øy attention of the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the inn, with a li≈øtle≈øs indifference. The agitation of her mind, indeed, had hitherto rendered her in≈øen≈øible to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of her frame; but exhau≈øted nature, at length produced the ≈øymptoms of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching fever, and compelled her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, to retire to her bed. When Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio entered the room, the fever had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderably increa≈øed, he therefore reque≈øted the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of a neighbouring phy≈øician, who pronounced her ≈øituation to be criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dangerous. In the evening, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øual vivacity of her eyes, the incoherence of her ≈øpeech, and repeated peals of loud and vacant laughter, proved the di≈øordered
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033741_0162_0FF8FBA6DE55EE20"/>
≈øtate of her under≈øtanding, and increa≈øed the apprehen≈øions of her attendants. "A few hours will decide her fate," ≈øaid the Doctor, as he left the room. "My poor Amelia!" cried Horatio, rai≈øing her hand to his lips‚Äî≈øhe looked ≈øternly at him for a moment, then relaxing the ≈øeverity of her features, ≈øhe again bur≈øt into a boi≈øterous laugh, which terminated in a long and heavy ≈øigh, as if her ≈øpirits were exhau≈øted with the violence of her exertions.</p>
                  <p>The ta≈øk which Horatio had now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, was difficult indeed! The virtue and fortitude of his ≈øoul could hardly ≈øu≈øtain a conflict again≈øt the grief and pa≈ø≈øion that con≈øumed him; whil≈øt on the one hand, he beheld the di≈øtraction of his daughter, and, on the other, anticipated the danger of his ≈øon. He re≈øolved, however, to keep Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's indi≈øpo≈øition a ≈øecret from Honorius, with whom he arranged the dreadful bu≈øine≈øs of the morning, and, having fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed his ble≈ø≈øing there, he returned to pa≈øs the night in prayer and watching by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's ≈øide.</p>
                  <p>Honorius retired to his chamber, but not to re≈øt. It was not, however, the danger of the approaching combat, which occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a moment's anxiety or reflection; for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033741_0163_0FF8FBA95734EEE8"/>
his courage was ≈øuperior to every con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of per≈øonal ≈øafety. But that courage had hitherto been regulated by a ≈øen≈øe of obligation con≈øi≈øtent with the precepts of religion‚Äîhe had often exerted it to de≈øerve the glorious meed of a ≈øoldier, but he ≈øcorned to employ it for the contemptible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a duelli≈øt; it had taught him to ≈øerve his country, but not to offend his God. "If there is a cau≈øe which can ju≈øtify the act, is it not mine? 'Tis not a punctilious honour, a vi≈øionary in≈øult, or a petulant di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition that influences my conduct:" ≈øaid Honorius, as he mu≈øed upon the ≈øubject. "A ≈øi≈øter ba≈øely tricked of her innocence and fame, a father ungratefully plundered of his peace and hopes, in the la≈øt ≈øtage of an honourable life, and my≈øelf (but that is little) treacherou≈øly tran≈øported to a remote and inho≈øpitable land‚Äîthe≈øe are my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and Heaven, Doli≈øcus, be the judge between us!"</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as the dawn appeared, Honorius repaired to the place of appointment, where a few minutes before the hour, Doli≈øcus had likewi≈øe arrived. He was attended by a friend, but perceiving his antagoni≈øt alone, he reque≈øted his companion to withdraw to a di≈øtant ≈øpot, from which he might ob≈øerve
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033741_0164_0FF8FBABA0961E08"/>
the event, and afford a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øhed party.</p>
                  <p>"Once more we meet, Sir," ≈øaid Doli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, "upon the bu≈øine≈øs of death; but that fortune which failed you in your country's cau≈øe, maybe more propitious in your own." "What pity it is," exclaimed Honorius,
<q>that thou ≈øhould'≈øt be a villain, for thou art brave!</q>
"Nay, I come to offer a more ≈øub≈øtantial revenge for the wrongs I have committed, than merely ≈øubmitting to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ≈øo gro≈øs an epithet‚Äîtake it, Sir,‚Äî it is my life." They in≈øtantly engaged. Doli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus for awhile defended him≈øelf with ≈øuperior addre≈øs, but laying, him≈øelf ≈øuddenly open to the pa≈øs of his antagoni≈øt, he received his ≈øword in the left brea≈øt, a little below the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>eat of the heart!</p>
                  <p>"Nobly done," cried Doli≈øcus as he fell, "it is the vengeance of Amelia; and oh! may it ≈øerve to expiate the crime of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer." His friend who had attentively viewed the ≈øcene, advanced, when he ≈øaw him on the ground: and a≈ø≈øi≈øted by Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, bore him to a carriage which had been directed to attend within call. He was then conveyed to the hou≈øe of an eminent ≈øurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who having ordered the nece≈ø≈øary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, examined the wound, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033741_0165_0FF8FBADE3FC5378"/>
pronounced it to be mortal." "Fly, ≈øir," ≈øaid Doli≈øcus, turning to Honorius, at this intelligence‚Äî"your country will afford you an a≈øylum, and protect you from the con≈øequences of my fate. I be≈øeech you embitter not my la≈øt moments with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of your danger‚Äîbut bear with you to the injured Amelia, the ≈øtory of my repentance, and, if you dare, a≈øk her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me." The re≈øentments of Honorius were ≈øubdued; he pre≈øented his hand to the dying Doli≈øcus, in who≈øe eye a gleam of joy was kindled at the thought, but it was quickly ≈øuperceded by a cold and ≈øudden tremour; he attempted, but in vain, to ≈øpeak; he ≈øeized the offered hand; he pre≈ø≈øed it eagerly to his lips, and in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that expre≈ø≈øive action, he expired.</p>
                  <p>Honorius now ha≈øtened to inform Horatio of this fatal event, and to contrive the means of e≈øcape. But when he returned to the inn, confu≈øion and di≈øtre≈øs were pictured on every face; a wild, but harmonious, voice, occa≈øionally broke forth into melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ≈øtrains, and the name of Doli≈øcus was repeatedly pronounced in accents of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and compa≈ø≈øion.‚Äî"How is it my ≈øon?" cried Horatio eagerly. "Doli≈øcus is no more!" replied Honorius. "Would he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033741_0166_0FF8FBB0266A7518"/>
had lived another day! I wi≈øhed not the ruin of his ≈øoul." "But he repented, ≈øir." "Then heaven be merciful!" exclaimed Horatio.</p>
                  <p>Here their conver≈øation was interrupted, by the melodious chauntings of Amelia.</p>
                  <l>I'll have none of your flow'rs tho' ≈øo blooming and ≈øweet;</l>
                  <l>Their ≈øcent, it may poi≈øon, and fal≈øe is their hue;</l>
                  <l>I tell you begone! for I ne'er ≈øhall forget,</l>
                  <l>That Doli≈øcus was lovely and treacherous too.</l>
                  <p>Honorius li≈øtened attentively to the ≈øong; it vibrated in his ear, and ≈øwelled the aching artery of his heart. "Come on!" ≈øaid Horatio leading him to Amelia's chamber. They found her ≈øitting on the bed, with a pillow before her, over which ≈øhe moved her fingers, as if playing on a harp≈øichord. Their entrance di≈øturbed her for a moment, but ≈øhe ≈øoon re≈øumed her employment.</p>
                  <l>He ≈øaid and he ≈øwore he lov'd me true:‚Äîwas it a lover's part,</l>
                  <l>To ruin good Horatio's peace and break Amelia's heart?</l>
                  <p>A heavy ≈øigh followed the≈øe lines, which were articulated in a wi≈øtful and ≈øympathetic tone, and ≈øhe ≈øunk exhau≈øted on her bed. ‚ÄîIn a few minutes, however, ≈øhe ≈øtarted
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033741_0167_0FF8C210822BF050"/>
from this ≈øtill and ≈øilent ≈øtate, and having gazed with a wild and aching eye around the room, ≈øhe uttered a loud and piercing cry ‚Äîit was the awful ≈øignal of her di≈ø≈øolution ‚Äîand her injured ≈øpirit took its everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flight.</p>

                  <head>HISTORY OF AMELIA, OR MALEVOLENCE DEFEATED.</head>
                  <p>MRS. Winifrid Wormwood was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ru≈øtic merchant, who, by the happy union of many lucrative trades, ama≈ø≈øed an enormous fortune. His family con≈øi≈øted of three girls, and Winifrid was the elde≈øt: Long before ≈øhe was twenty, ≈øhe was ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with lovers, ≈øome probably attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ≈øplendid pro≈øpect of her expected portion, and others truly captivated by her per≈øonal graces; for her per≈øon was elegant, and her elegance was enlivened with peculiar vivacity. Mr. Wormwood was commonly called a kind parent, and an hone≈øt man; and he might de≈øerve, indeed, tho≈øe honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appellations, if it were not a profanation of language to apply them to a narrow and a ≈øelfi≈øh ≈øpirit. He indulged his daughters in many expen≈øive amu≈øements, becau≈øe it flattered his pride; but his heart was engro≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033741_0169_0FF8FBB269F02138"/>
by the proffits of his exten≈øive traffic: He turned, with the mo≈øt repul≈øive a≈øperity, from every propo≈øal that could lead him to dimini≈øh his capital, and thought his daughters unrea≈øonable, if they wi≈øhed for any permanent ≈øatisfaction above that of ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their father increa≈øe in opulence and ≈øplendor. His two younger children, who inherited from their di≈øea≈øed mother a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der delicacy of frame, langui≈øhed and died at an early period of life, and the death of one of them was imputed, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to a ≈øevere di≈øappointment in her fir≈øt affection. The more ≈øprightly Wini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid, who≈øe heart was a perfect ≈øtranger to genuine love, ≈øurmounted the mortification of ≈øeeing many ≈øuitors di≈øcarded; and by the in≈øen≈øate avarice of her father, ≈øhe was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally led into habits of artifice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue. Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing an uncommon ≈øhare of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øhrewd and piercing wit, with the mo≈øt profound hypocri≈øy, ≈øhe contrived to plea≈øe, and to blind, her plodding old parent; who perpetually harangued on the di≈øcretion of his daughter, and believed her a miracle of re≈øerve and prudence, at the very time when ≈øhe was ≈øu≈øpected of ≈øuch conduct as would have di≈øqualified her, had it ever been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the rank ≈øhe now holds in this e≈ø≈øay.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033741_0170_0FF8FBB72EE6E988"/>
She was ≈øaid to have amu≈øed her≈øelf with a great variety of amorous adventures, which eluded the ob≈øervation of her father; but of the many lovers who ≈øighed to her in ≈øecret, not one could tempt her into marriage, and, to the ≈øurpri≈øe of the public, the rich heire≈øs of Mr. Wormwood reached the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-≈øeven, without changing her name. Ju≈øt as ≈øhe arrived at this mature ≈øea≈øon of life, the opulent old gentleman took his leave of a world, in which he had acted a bu≈øy part, plea≈øed with the idea of leaving a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as a monument of his indu≈øtry, but wanting the ≈øuperior ≈øatisfation, which a more generous parent would probably have derived from the happy e≈øtabli≈øhment of a daughter. He gained, however, from the hypocri≈øy of Winifrid, what he could not claim from her affection, the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamented with a profu≈øion of tears.

≈øupport the utmo≈øt efforts of provincial ≈øplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Mi≈øs Wormwood now expected to ≈øee every batchelor of figure and con≈øequence a ≈øuppliant at her feet; ≈øhe promi≈øed to her≈øelf no little entertainment in ≈øporting with their addre≈ø≈øes, without the fear of ≈øuffering from a tyrannical hu≈øband, as ≈øhe had learned cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her father, and had privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved not to tru≈øt any man with her money; a re≈øolution the more di≈øcreet, as ≈øhe had much to apprehend, and very little to learn, from ≈øo dangerous a ma≈øter! The good-natured town, in who≈øe environs the rich Winifrid re≈øided, very kindly pointed out to her no le≈øs than twenry lively beaux for her choice; but, to the ≈øhame or the honour of tho≈øe gentlemen, they were too timid, or, too hone≈øt, to make any advances. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her youthful frolics, and the dread of her ≈øarca≈øtic wit, had more power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than her per≈øon and her wealth had to attract. Pa≈ø≈øing her fiftieth year, ≈øhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ≈øerious name of mi≈øtre≈øs, without the dignity of a wife, and without receiving a ≈øingle offer of marriage from the period in which ≈øhe became the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of ≈øo opulent a fortune.</p>

or whether malevolence was the earlier cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteri≈øtic of her mind, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that from this autumnal or rather wintry ≈øea≈øon of her life, Mrs. Wormwood made it her chief occup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She ≈øeemed to be tormented with an ince≈ø≈øant dread, that youth and beauty might ≈øecure to them≈øelves that happine≈øs, which ≈øhe found wit and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were unable to be≈øtow; hence ≈øhe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the mo≈øt piercing eye, all the lovely young women of her neighbourhood, and often in≈øinuated her≈øelf into the confidence of many, that ≈øhe might penetrate all the ≈øecrets of their love, and privately bla≈øt its ≈øucce≈øs. She was enabled to render her≈øelf intimate with the young and the lovely, by the opulent ≈øplendor in which ≈øhe lived, and by the bewitching vivacity of her conver≈øati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her talents of this kind were, indeed, extraordinary; her mind was never poli≈øhed or enriched by literature, as Mr. Wormwood ≈øet little value on any books, excepting tho≈øe of his counting-hou≈øe; and the earlier years of his daughter were too much engaged by

duplicity and intrigue, to leave her either lei≈øure or inclination for a voluntary attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to more improving ≈øtudies. She read very little, and was acquainted with no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but her own; yet a brilliant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, and an uncommon portion of ready wit, ≈øupplied her with a more alluring fund of conver≈øation, than learning could be≈øtow. She chiefly recommended her≈øelf to the young and inexperienced, by the in≈øinuating charm of the mo≈øt lively ridicule, and by the art of ≈øea≈øoning her di≈øcour≈øe with want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton inuendos of ≈øo ≈øubtle a nature, that gravity knew not how to object to them: She had the ≈øingular faculty of throwing ≈øuch a ≈øoft and dubious twilight over the mo≈øt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious images, that they captivated curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity and attention, without exciting either fear or di≈øgu≈øt.

This amiable woman, after having acted the part of a mo≈øt affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died before Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now apparently de≈øtitute of every re≈øource; and expo≈øed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the lo≈øs of a mo≈øt indulgent protector. A widow lady of her acquaintance very kindly afforded her a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the fir≈øt moments of her di≈øtre≈øs, and propo≈øed to two of her opulent friends, that Amelia ≈øhould re≈øide with them by turns, dividing the year between them, and pa≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four months with each. As ≈øoon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as ≈øhe delighted in tho≈øe o≈øtentatious acts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent beneficence, which are fal≈øely called charity, ≈øhe de≈øired to be admitted among the voluntary guardians of the poor Amelia.

but which made her ≈øeverely feel all the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of dependance. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, pre≈øuming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wounded her ingenuous pride. Her per≈øon, her mind, her manners were univer≈øally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife, "Amelia (they cried) is an enchanting creature; but who, in the≈øe times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, ≈øupported by charity?" Though this prudential que≈øtion was never uttered in the pre≈øence of Amelia, ≈øhe began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its influence, and ≈øuffered a painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to tho≈øe friends, by who≈øe genero≈øity ≈øhe ≈øub≈øi≈øted; ≈øhe wi≈øhed, a thou≈øand times, that her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate aunt, in≈øtead of cultivating her mind with ≈øuch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any ≈øtation of life, where ≈øhe might have maintained her≈øelf by her own manual labour: ≈øhe ≈øometimes entertained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of making ≈øome attempt for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe; and ≈øhe once thought of changing her name, and of trying to ≈øupport her≈øelf as an actre≈øs on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her hone≈øt pride had ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted,

was effectually ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by her mode≈øty; and ≈øhe continued to wa≈øte the mo≈øt precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetualy wi≈øhing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almo≈øt two years had now elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed ≈øince the death of her aunt, and without any pro≈øpect of marriage, ≈øhe was now in her ≈øecond period of re≈øidence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's under≈øtanding was by no means inferior to her other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ≈øhe began to penetrate all the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful di≈øgui≈øe, and to gain a perfect and very painful in≈øight into the real character of her pre≈øent ho≈øte≈øs. This lady had remarked, that when Mi≈øs Nevil re≈øided with her, her hou≈øe was much more frequented by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, than at any other ≈øea≈øon. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was true; and it unluckily happened, that the≈øe vi≈øitors often forgot to applaud the ≈ømart ≈øayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the ≈øweet countenance of Amelia; a circum≈øtance full ≈øufficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the mo≈øt bitter envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood dete≈øted her lovely gue≈øt with the mo≈øt implacable virulence; but ≈øhe had the ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular art of di≈øgui≈øing her dete≈øtation in the

language of flattery: ≈øhe under≈øtood the truth of Pope's maxim,</p>
                  <p>"<hi>He hurts me mo≈øt who lavi≈øhly commends.</hi>" and ≈øhe therefore made u≈øe of lavi≈øh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, as an in≈øtrument of malevolence towards Amelia; ≈øhe in≈øulted the ta≈øte, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared her≈øelf convinced, that he was a fool, becau≈øe he had not cho≈øen that mo≈øt lovely young woman. To more than one gentleman ≈øhe ≈øaid, you mu≈øt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Amelia; and, as few men chu≈øe to be driven into wedlock, ≈øome offers were po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevented, by the treacherous vehem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her prai≈øe. Her malice, however, was not ≈øufficiently gratified by ob≈øerving that Amelia had no pro≈øpect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, ≈øhe re≈øolved to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu≈øe this unhappy girl with the hopes of ≈øuch a joyous event, and then to turn, on a ≈øudden, all the≈øe ≈øplendid hopes into mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and delu≈øion.

events, had contracted a great, but very amiable ≈øingularity of character:‚Äîhe was placed early in life, in a very lucrative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ≈øituation, and was on the point of ≈øettling happily in marriage with a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young lady, when the hou≈øe, in which ≈øhe re≈øided, was con≈øumed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the de≈øtined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, in loo≈øing the object of his ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by ≈øo ≈øudden a calamity, lo≈øt for ≈øome time the u≈øe of his rea≈øon; and when his health and ≈øen≈øes returned, he ≈øtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the oppre≈ø≈øion of the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had lo≈øt in ≈øo ≈øevere a manner, ≈øugge≈øted to his fancy a ≈øingular plan of benevolence, in the pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which he recovered a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his former ≈øpirits. This plan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted in ≈øearching for female objects of charity, who≈øe di≈øtre≈ø≈øes had been occa≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private expences very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he was able to relieve many unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate per≈øons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted it≈øelf with the idea, that in the≈øe uncommon acts of beneficence he was guided by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033741_0181_0FF8FBCE8A4AFE98"/>
of that lovely angel, who≈øe mortal beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had peri≈øhed in the flames. Mr. Nel≈øon frequently vi≈øited a married ≈øi≈øter, who was ≈øettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood re≈øided. There was al≈øo, in the ≈øame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular e≈øteem. This lady, who≈øe name was Melford, had been left in very ≈øcanty circum≈øtances on the death of her hu≈øband, and re≈øided at that time in London, where ≈øhe had been involved in additional di≈øtre≈øs by that calamity, to which the attentive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mr. Nel≈øon was forever directed: he more than repaired the lo≈øs which ≈øhe ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by fire, and a≈ø≈øi≈øted in ≈øettling her in the neighbourhood of his ≈øi≈øter. Mrs. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was ≈øtill the mo≈øt valuable friend of that lovely orphan, who paid her frequent vi≈øits, though ≈øhe never re≈øided under her roof. Mr. Nel≈øon had often ≈øeen Amelia at the hou≈øe of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politene≈øs, whenever he vi≈øited Mrs. Wormwood; a circum≈øtance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> She perfectly knew all the ≈øingular private hi≈øtory of Mr. Nel≈øon, and firmly believed, like all the re≈øt of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but ≈øhe thought
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033741_0182_0FF8FBD10B03AFD8"/>
it po≈ø≈øible to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his re≈øolution; and nothing ≈øhe ≈øuppo≈øed, could more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually mortify her gue≈øt, than to find her≈øelf derided for ≈øo vain an expectation.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to in≈øinuate, in the mo≈øt artful manner, that Mr. Nel≈øon was very particular in his civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities to Amelia, magnified all his amiable qualities, and expre≈ø≈øed the greate≈øt plea≈øure in the pro≈øpect of ≈øo delightful a match. The≈øe petty artifices, however, had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the natural mode≈øty and diffidence of Amelia; ≈øhe ≈øaw nothing that authori≈øed ≈øuch an idea in the u≈øual politene≈øs of a well-bred man of thirty-≈øeven; ≈øhe pitied the misfortune, ≈øhe admired the elegant and engaging, though ≈øerious manners, and ≈øhe revered the virtues of Mr. Nel≈øon; but, ≈øuppo≈øed his mind to be entirely engro≈ø≈øed, as it really was, by his ≈øingularly charitable pur≈øuits; ≈øhe entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired, in her youth, the very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous talent of forging any hand that ≈øhe plea≈øed; and her pa≈ø≈øion for mi≈øchief had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her much practice in this treacherous
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033741_0183_0FF8FBD2A66AE278"/>
art. Having previou≈øly and ≈øecretly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Mr. Nel≈øon to drink tea with her, ≈øhe wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the mo≈øt perfect imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hand. The billet ≈øaid, that he de≈øigned him≈øelf the plea≈øure of pa≈ø≈øing that afternoon at the hou≈øe of Mrs. Wormwood, and reque≈øted the favour of a private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Mi≈øs Nevil in the cour≈øe of the evening, intimating, in the mo≈øt delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent de≈øire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her hu≈øband. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia ≈øhould not receive this billet till ju≈øt before dinner-time, that ≈øhe might not ≈øhow it to her friend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect its fallacy before the hour of her intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humiliation arrived.</p>
                  <p>Amelia blu≈øhed in reading the note, and, in the fir≈øt ≈øurpri≈øe of un≈øu≈øpecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood; who bur≈øt into vehement expre≈ø≈øions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; congratulated her blu≈øhing gue≈øt on the full ≈øucce≈øs of her charms, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her own prophetic di≈øcernment. They ≈øat down to dinner, but poor Amelia could hardly ≈øwallow a mor≈øel; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of plea≈øure and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. The malicious impo≈øter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying her confu≈øion, allowed her no time
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033741_0184_0FF8FBD598231B90"/>
to compo≈øe her hurried ≈øpirits in the ≈øolitude of her chamber. Some female vi≈øitors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to tea; and, at length, Mr. Nel≈øon entered the room. Amelia trembled and blu≈øhed as he approached her; but ≈øhe was a little relieved from her embarra≈ø≈øment by the bu≈øine≈øs of the tea-table, over which ≈øhe pre≈øided. Amelia was naturally graceful in every thing ≈øhe did, but the pre≈øent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her mind gave a temporary awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈øs to all her motions: ≈øhe committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politene≈øs of Mr. Nel≈øon led him to ≈øay ≈øo many kind and graceful things to her on the≈øe petty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that, in≈øtead of encrea≈øing her di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈øs, they produced an oppo≈øite effect, and the tumult of her bo≈øom gradually ≈øub≈øided into a calm and compo≈øed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nel≈øon, and thought them expre≈ø≈øive of that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs which promi≈øed a happy end to all her misfortunes. At the idea of exchanging mi≈øery and dependance for comfort and honor, as the wife of ≈øo amiable a man, her heart expanded with the mo≈øt innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and gave ≈øuch an exqui≈øite radiance to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033741_0185_0FF8C2159BB05D18"/>
all her features, that ≈øhe looked a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Wormwood ≈øaw this improvement of her charms, and, ≈øickening at the ≈øight, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reduce the ≈øplendor of ≈øuch in≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable beauty, and ha≈øtily terminate the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of her deluded gue≈øt. She began with a few malicious and ≈øarca≈øtic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes, which they frequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of an imaginary lover; but finding the≈øe remarks produced not the effect ≈øhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ≈øhe took an opportunity of whi≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations, for the billet ≈øhe had received was a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and a mere piece of plea≈øantry. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia ≈øhuddered, and turned pale: ≈øurpri≈øe, di≈øappointment, and indignation, con≈øpired to overwhelm her. She exerted her utmo≈øt power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her bo≈øom was too violent to be di≈øgui≈øed. The tears, which ≈øhe vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ≈øuppre≈øs, bur≈øt forth, and ≈øhe was obliged to quit the room in very vi≈øible di≈øorder. Mr. Nel≈øon expre≈ø≈øed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; but he was checked in his benevolent inquiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who ≈øaid; on the occa≈øion, that Mi≈øs Nevil
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033741_0186_0FF8FBD7DB81EE60"/>
was a very amiable girl, but ≈øhe had ≈øome peculiarities of temper and was apt to put a wrong con≈øtruction on the innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øantry of her friends. Mr. Nel≈øon ob≈øerving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might contribute to re≈øtore the interrupted harmony of the hou≈øe, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult, like a fiend, over that lovely vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of her ≈øucce≈øsful malignity. She found not the per≈øon whom ≈øhe was ≈øo eager to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult. Amelia had, indeed, retired to her chamber, and pa≈ø≈øed there a very mi≈øerable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and ≈øtill more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which ≈øhe condemned with that exce≈øs of ≈øeverity ≈øo natural to a delicate mind in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning it≈øelf. She would have flown for immediate con≈øolation to her friend, Mrs. Melford, but ≈øhe had rea≈øon to believe that lady engaged on a vi≈øit, and ≈øhe therefore re≈øolved to take a ≈øolitary walk for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe of compo≈øing her ≈øpirits; but neither ≈øolitude nor exerci≈øe could re≈øtore her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; and, as it grew late in the evening, ≈øhe ha≈øtened to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her returned. Her worthy old
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033741_0187_0FF8FBDA592BAE08"/>
confidant was, indeed, in her little parlour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her di≈øtre≈øs; and the old lady, with her u≈øual tenderne≈øs, exclaimed, "Good heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becau≈øe," replied Amelia, in a broken voice, and bur≈øting into a fre≈øh ≈øhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of tears, "becau≈øe I am a fool?"‚ÄîMrs. Melford began to be mo≈øt ≈øeriou≈øly alarmed, and, expre≈ø≈øing her maternal ≈øolicitude in the kinde≈øt manner. Amelia produced the fatal paper‚Äî"There," ≈øays ≈øhe, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nel≈øon; it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been ≈øuch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who in her fir≈øt alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was her≈øelf greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in di≈øcovering the truth, and ≈øaid many kind things to con≈øole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Amelia, "that I am fooli≈øhly in love with Mr. Nel≈øon, though I think him the mo≈øt plea≈øing as well as the mo≈øt excellent, of men; and though I confe≈øs to you, that I ≈øhould certainly think it a ble≈ø≈øed lot to find a refuge from the mi≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a protector."‚Äî"Tho≈øe arms are now open to receive you," ≈øaid a voice that was heard before the ≈øpeaker appeared. Amelia ≈øtarted at the ≈øound, and her ≈øurpri≈øe was not a little encrea≈øed in ≈øeeing Mr. Nel≈øon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, who entering the room from an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tran≈øport of tenderne≈øs and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine mode≈øty, was for ≈øome minutes more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully di≈øtre≈ø≈øed by this ≈øurpri≈øe, than ≈øhe had been by her pa≈øt mortification: ≈øhe was ready to ≈øink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her ≈øecret to the man, from whom ≈øhe would have laboured mo≈øt to conceal it. In the fir≈øt tumult of this delicate confu≈øion, ≈øhe ≈øinks into a chair, and hides her face in her handkerchief. Nel≈øon with a mixture of re≈øpect and love, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of encrea≈øing her di≈øtre≈øs, ≈øeizes one of her hands, and continues to ki≈øs it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, almo≈øt as much a≈øtoni≈øhed, but le≈øs painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confu≈øed than Amelia, beholds this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ≈øcene with that kind of joy which is much more di≈øpo≈øed to weep than to ≈øpeak ‚ÄîAnd, while this little party is thus ab≈øorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ≈øilence, let me ha≈øten to relate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which produced their ≈øituation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:033741_0189_0FF8C1F76E374C80"/>Mr. Nel≈øon had ob≈øerved the ≈øarca≈øtic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, and, as ≈øoon as he had ended his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vi≈øit, he ha≈øtened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her ≈øome little account of what had pa≈ø≈øed, and to concert with her ≈øome happier plan for the ≈øupport of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, in≈øulted orphan. "I am acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," ≈øaid he, "with ≈øome brave and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy officers, who have ≈øerved with the father of Mi≈øs Nevil, and often ≈øpeak of him with re≈øpect; I am ≈øure I can rai≈øe among them a ≈øub≈øcription for the maintenance of this tender unfortunate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that ≈øhall enable her to e≈øcape from ≈øuch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a ≈øervant." Mrs. Melford was tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at this idea; and, recollecting all her obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his genero≈øity; and, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amelia at ≈øome di≈øtance, through a bow window, which commanded the ≈øtreet in which ≈øhe lived, "thank Heaven," ≈øhe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "here comes my poor child, to hear and ble≈øs you for the extent of your goodne≈øs." Nel≈øon, who delighted mo≈øt in doing good by ≈øtealth, immediately extorted from the good old lady a promi≈øe of ≈øecrecy: it was the be≈øt part of his plan, that Amelia ≈øhould
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033741_0190_0FF8FBE1556E05E0"/>
never know the per≈øons to whom ≈øhe was to owe her independence. "I am ≈øtill afraid of you, my worthy old friend," ≈øaid Nel≈øon "your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Mi≈øs Nevil ≈øees me here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night."‚Äî"Well," ≈øaid the delighted old la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, "I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will, probably, not ≈øtay with me ten min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes; you may amu≈øe your≈øelf, for that time, in my ≈øpacious garden; I will not ≈øay you are here; and, as ≈øoon as the good girl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."‚Äî "Admirably ≈øettled," cried Nel≈øon; and he immediately retreated into a little back room, which led into a long ≈ølip of ground, embelli≈øhed with the ≈øweete≈øt and lea≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amu≈øement to Mrs. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Nel≈øon, after taking a few turns in this diminutive garden, finding him≈øelf ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chilled by the air of the evening, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again into the little parlour he had pa≈ø≈øed, intending to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely ≈ølight, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the tender confe≈ø≈øions of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irre≈øi≈øtible impul≈øe, in the manner already de≈øcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:033741_0191_0FF8FBE3123B4450"/>Mrs. Melford was the fir≈øt who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by their general ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe; and ≈øhe enabled the tender pair, in the pro≈øpect of who≈øe union her warm heart exulted, to regain that ea≈øy and joyous po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion of their faculties, which they lo≈øt for ≈øome little time in their embarra≈ø≈øment. The applau≈øe of her friend, and the adoration of her lover, ≈øoon taught the diffident Amelia to think le≈øs ≈øeverely of her≈øelf. The warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Mrs. Melford declared that the≈øe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences were the work of Heaven. "That," replied the affectionate Nel≈øon, "I am mo≈øt willing to allow; but you mu≈øt grant, that Heaven has produced our happine≈øs by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a ≈øpirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the torment of its po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, I mu≈øt beg, that ≈øhe may not return, even for a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle night, to the hou≈øe of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her ≈øen≈øe of pa≈øt obligations, and wi≈øhed to take a peaceful leave of her patrone≈øs; but ≈øhe ≈øubmitted to the urgent entreaties of Nel≈øon, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when ≈øhe was united to the man of her heart. Nel≈øon had the double delight of rewarding
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033741_0192_0FF8FBE5FA4FB048"/>
the affection of an angel, and of puni≈øhing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in per≈øon to Mrs. Wormwood, his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when the treacherous Old Maid had amu≈øed her≈øelf with the hope of deriding her gue≈øt; who≈øe return ≈øhe was eagerly expecting, in the very moment Nel≈øon arrived to ≈øay, that Amelia would return no more.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øurpri≈øe and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aro≈øe almo≈øt to frenzy; ≈øhe racked her malicious and inventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated a report for that purpo≈øe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and de≈øpi≈øed. Amelia was not only married, but the mo≈øt admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the mo≈øt beloved, and the happie≈øt of human beings; an event which preyed ≈øo ince≈ø≈øantly on the ≈øpirit of Mrs- Wormwood, that ≈øhe fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her mi≈øchievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy life, a memorable example, that the mo≈øt artful malignity may ≈øometimes procure for the object of its envy, that very happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs which it labours to prevent!</p>
