            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE brave, but eccentric general Lee had ſo little regard to the rules of politeneſs and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, that he always ſpoke his opinions unreſervedly, without regarding the offence or pain they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite. Being one night at Albany, drinking with an old Scotch officer, when he began to mellow with the wine, he told his companion that he had one fault, which he begged him to overlook, which was to abuſe the Scotch when he was in liquor. In troth, replied the officer, I ſhall readily forgive your fault, if you will overlook mine; it is, when I hear any perſon impertinently abuſing Scotland or Scotchmen, when I am drunk or ſober, I cannot refrain from laying my cane ſoundly over his ſhoulders. Now I will readily pardon your fault, if you will pardon mine. This ſeaſonable hint made the general very polite the remainder of the night.</p>

Soon after the Maſſachuſetts inſurgents retreated from their attack on general Shepard, at Ordnance-hill, and when it was hourly expected they would renew it, Shays ſent a flag to general Shepard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting to have delivered to him the bodies of the killed, amounting to five. The officer, who had been ſent by general Shepard, to receive the flag, on the requeſt being made for five ſlain, with the utmoſt <hi>ſang froid</hi> imaginable replied, <q>Preſent general She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard's compliments to captain Shays: and inform him, that he cannot furniſh him with <hi>five</hi> dead, he having no more than <hi>four:</hi> but that if captain Shays will pleaſe to attack him again, he will then furniſh him with another, and as many more as he ſhall deſire.</q>

Dr. Franklin, as agent for the province of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, being in England at the time the parliament paſſed the ſtamp-act for America, was frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to by the miniſtry for his opinion reſpecting the operation of the ſame, and aſſured them that the people of America would never ſubmit to it. The act was nevertheleſs paſſed, and the event ſhewed he had been right. After the news of the deſtruction of the ſtamped paper had arrived in England, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry again ſent for the doctor, to conſult with him, and concluded with this propoſition, that if the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans would engage to pay for the damage done in the deſtruction of the ſtamped paper, &amp;c. the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would then repeal the act. To this the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor anſwered, that it put him in mind of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who having heated a poker red hot, ran into the ſtreet, and addreſſing an Engliſhman he met there, "hah, monſieur, voulez vous givé me de plaiſir et de ſatisfaction, and leté me runi dis poker only one foote up your backſide?" "What!" ſays the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:—

"Only to leté me runi dis poker one foote up your back ſide." "Damn your ſoul," replies the Engliſhman. "Welle, den, only ſo far," ſays the Frenchman, pointing to about ſix inches of the poker.—"No, no," replies the Engliſhman—"damn your ſoul; what do you mean?" "Well, den," ſays the Frenchman, will you havé de juſtice to payé me for de trouble and expence of heating de poker?"—"damn me, if I do," anſwered the Engliſhman, and walked off.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A member of the general court of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, who, from accuſtoming himſelf to take a nap after dinner, when at home, could not diſpenſe with the cuſtom, when attending to give laws to a mighty people, not long ſince occaſioned much ſport in the houſe, by the following incident. A day was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſecond reading of a lumber-act: as this intereſted our ſleeper, he requeſted a friend, who ſat next him, to awaken him, if the diſcuſſion of the bill ſhould be introduced, while he was aſleep This his friend promiſed him: but, happening to go out for a few minutes, the bill was called for; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort debate, was committed. Immediately after, the bill for preventing fornication, was brought on. This occaſioned ſome debate, during which the ſleeper's friend returned. Finding the lumber-bill was diſmiſſed, he thought he might indulge his friend in his nap. However, as ill-luck would have it, he trod upon the toe of this votary to Morpheus, who ſuppoſed it a ſignal for his waking: immediately rouſing himſelf, he rubbed his eyes, and looking about, perceived a pauſe in the debate—on which he aroſe and addreſſed the ſpeaker as follows: <q>Sir, I wiſh to ſpeak a few words on the bill now in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It affects, mr. Speaker, my conſtituents very much: for <hi>above half our town get their living by it.</hi>

At the commencement of the late revolution, when the French nation appeared inclined to take part in the conteſt in favour of America, ſir Joſeph Yorke, the ambaſſador from England to the United Netherlands, meeting the French ambaſſador at the Hague, cenſured his court for interfering in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and taking ſo ungenerous a part: "You have been guilty of a diſhonourable act (ſaid he) that is unpardonable—to leſs than that of debauching our daughter." "I am ſorry (replied the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador) that your excellency ſhould put ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere conſtruction, upon the matter: She made the firſt advances, and abſolutely threw herſelf into our arms; but, rather than forfeit your friendſhip, if matrimony will make any atonement, we are ready to act honourably, and marry her."</p>

For ſeveral months his manner of living accorded with his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed character. His lodgings, his attendants and his equipage, correſponded only with rank and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Faſhion received from him its laws, and taſte appealed to him as its genuine ſtandard.

Not liking Whitfield's principles, he took occaſion to preach a ſermon againſt him from the following text,—"Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thoſe that have turned the world upſide down, are come hither alſo."—In the afternoon of the ſame day, Whitfield, in his turn, retorted upon his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt to a very crowded audience, and with all the wit and ſatire for which he was ſo remarkable, from theſe words of St. Paul, "Alexander the copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith hath done me much evil, the Lord reward him according to his works."—Soon after, Garden, not to be outdone, took occaſion to declaim with ſome heat, againſt the light and trifling tunes uſed in Whitfield's church, as being too theatrical and gay for holy worſhip, and ſuch as had been long appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to prophane ſongs and airs—"Very true, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſaid Whitfield in his next lecture: but pray, ſir, can you aſſign any good reaſon why the devil ſhould always be in poſſeſſion of the beſt tunes?"</p>

The other then ſaid, though his brother's blood called for revenge, yet as the children were young, and not able to provide for their mother and themſelves, he would remain, deaf to theſe calls for a while; and ſo left them. Belonging to the ſame tribe, they continued to live ſociably together until the eldeſt ſon of the murderer killed a deer in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So ſoon as the brother of the deceaſed was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this, he again called on the murderer, and told him, that his brother's blood called ſo loud, that it muſt be obeyed, eſpecially as his ſon, having killed a deer, could ſupport the family. The murderer ſaid he was ready to die, and thanked the other for ſo long a delay: on which the wife and children broke into tears. The murderer reproved them for their weakneſs, and particularly his ſon—ſaying to him, did you ſhed tears when you killed the deer? and if you ſaw him die with dry eyes, why do you weep for me, who am willing to ſuffer what the cuſtom of our nation renders neceſſary? With an undaunted countenance he then called on the brother of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, to ſtrike; and died without a groan!</p>

About four years before the Shawano Indians were forced to remove from the late Savannah town, they took a Muſkohge warrior known by the name of old Scrany—They baſtinadoed him in the uſual manner, and condemned him to the fiery torture. He underwent a great deal, without ſhewing any concern: his countenance and behaviour were as if he ſuffered not the leaſt pain, and was formed beyond the common laws of nature.

The gentleman ſeized the reins, and drove away, leaving mr. Surlyboots behind, who humbly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the new waggoner to ſtop.

He added that he was on his way to Maſſachuſetts, where he had ſome friends, and aſked charity of the doctor.

The offer was accepted; and dr.

To obviate this difficulty, the doctor offered him a ſuit of clothes almoſt new. The objection being removed, the pretended clergyman agreed to aſſiſt his brother, and, in order to prepare himſelf, deſired to be left alone that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſtudy his diſcourſe. A fire was accordingly made in his bed-chamber, whither he repaired with his new garb, at the ſame time acquainting the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that he muſt ſtudy till late at night, and hoped no noiſe he might make would diſturb the repoſe of the family.

"Why," ſays the traveller, "I have got ſuch a habit of lying, ſince I have been abroad, that I really hardly know when I lie, and when I ſpeak truth; and ſhould be very much oblig'd to you, if you would tread upon my toe at any time, when I am likely to give myſelf too much liberty that way," His friend promis'd that he would; and accordingly not long after, being at a tavern with him and other company, when the traveller was, amongſt other ſtrange things, giving an account of a church he had ſeen in Italy, that was above two miles long, he trod on his toe, juſt as one of the company had aſk'd, How broad that ſame church might be?

Sheridan was ſo provoked, that he declared he would whip them all if the principal culprit was not pointed out to him; which was immediately done. The poor pupil of Momus was immediately hoiſted, and his poſteriors laid bare to the rod, when the witty ſchoolmaſter told him, if he ſaid any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable on the occaſion, as he looked on him as the greateſt dunce in his ſchool, he would forgive him.

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021643_0092_0FB4EA35E500FDF0"/>
years his family had poſſeſſed the mill from father to ſon, and he would not ſell it. The king was very preſſing to gain his point, and even offered to build another mill for him in a better ſituation, excluſive of the ſum that he might demand of him. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate miller perſiſted in keeping the inheritance of his anceſtors.

"Don't you know," ſaid the king, <q>that I could take it without giving you one penny?</q> "Yes," anſwered the miller, <q>if there were no chamber of juſtice at Berlin.</q> The king, who had himſelf inſtituted this court for the more ſpeedy relief of the injured, was extremely pleaſed with this anſwer, which intimated that he was thought incapable of an act of injuſtice. He ſuffered the man to enjoy his mill, and altered the plan of his gardens.</p>

The king, tired with his perſeverance, ordered that he ſhould be admitted no more. In the mean time a violent ſatire appeared againſt Frederic, who, contrary to his uſual cuſtom, promiſed a reward of fifty louis for the diſcovery of the author. The next day, the lieutenant colonel repaired to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and was refuſed admittance. He perſiſted, however, adding that he had ſomething of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to communicate to his majeſty. He is announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and enters.

He was going to wake him when he perceived the end of a billet ſticking out of his pocket. He had the curioſity to know the contents; he took and read it. It was a letter from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who thanked him for having ſent her a part of his wages, to aſſiſt her in diſtreſs; and beſought God to bleſs him for his filial goodneſs. The king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his room, took a roller of ducats, and ſlid them with the letter into the page's pocket. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his apartment, he rang ſo violently that the page awaked and entered. <q>You have ſlept

He drew it out, turned pale, and looking at the king, burſt into tears without being able to ſpeak a word. "What is the matter?" ſaid the king, "What ails you?" "Ah! fire," ſaid the young man, throwing himſelf at his feet, <q>ſome body would wiſh to ruin me. I know not how this money came into my pocket.</q>
