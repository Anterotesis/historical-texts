         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>'TIS with great reluctance that I am thus forced to enter the field of public controverſy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had I the leaſt deſire or expectation of it, when I at firſt propoſed the <hi>queſtion</hi> to our church, which is the ſubject of the following pages. It was far from being agreeable to me, that it had been ſo publick as it was before, when debated amongſt ourſelves, at our <hi>church-meetings.</hi> Eſpecially in the <hi>manner</hi> in which theſe meetings were conducted and protracted from time to time. For I could perceive no peaceful or good effects likely to be produced by them, but the contrary: Which the church in general perceiving, they finally voted to <hi>diſſolve</hi> the meeting. It was at theſe ſeveral meetings that <hi>Mr. Cotton</hi> (formerly a <hi>miniſter</hi> at <hi>Halifax</hi> in this county, but now a <hi>member</hi> of this church) delivered theſe <hi>Eſſays.</hi> I heard nothing of any deſign of publiſhing them, till immediately after the laſt church meeting was <hi>diſſolved.</hi> 'Twas then given out with ſome warmth, that "now all he had read ſhould be printed." And doubtleſs he had a right if he thought proper to print his <hi>arguments,</hi> or <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> on this or any other ſubject. But, what has been very ſurprizing to almoſt every one amongſt us, is his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing thoſe <hi>private letters</hi> with his eſſays. Which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it is not to be ſuppoſed, could ariſe from any friendly, benevolent ſpirit; or anſwer any <hi>good</hi> end. And it was
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012984_0004_0F903E4113424C40"/>thought, hardly to look well, that this matter was kept ſuch a profound ſecret, as that the <hi>ſubſcribers</hi> for his eſſays ſhould, in general, be ignorant of any ſuch deſign; who have ſince, ſome of them, ſaid, had they known theſe <hi>letters</hi> were to be printed, they never would have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed at all. It is certain that the publiſhing <hi>theſe,</hi> has been the occaſion of more trouble and uneaſineſs both to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as well as others (from ſome particular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy effects of them) than any thing that has taken place amongſt us, relative to this debate. And whatever Mr. Cotton has ſaid, or may ſay, to juſtify it, this muſt certainly be allowed to be a maxim of <hi>common ſenſe</hi> as well as civility and good manners, viz. That every man has a right to ſay, whether <hi>his letters</hi> ſhall be publiſhed to the world or not, let the <hi>occaſion</hi> or <hi>ſubject</hi> of them be what it will. I ſhould therefore have been exceeding glad to have excuſed both the reader and myſelf, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>laſt ſection</hi> in this reply—which, it muſt be acknowledged, contains matters, with which the <hi>publick</hi> have no immediate concern. I think it a great pity, that <hi>perſonal</hi> differences ſhould be intermixed with a ſubject of common and publick concernment. Nothing ſhould have induced me to it, had not Mr. Cotton publiſhed my <hi>letters,</hi> with his <hi>remarks</hi> upon them; whence it appeared to me neceſſary to ſay ſomething, in order to ſet ſome matters in a more juſt point of light, which, I think Mr. Cotton has not given a fair repreſentation of; and to vindicate myſelf, (as it was, by my people, judged needful I ſhould) from ſome very unkind aſperſions which he has caſt upon me; which otherwiſe, might have a tendency to hurt my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or uſefulneſs among thoſe who have only read Mr. Cotton's book, and are unacquainted with affairs in this place. I have ſhewn freely, wherein I think he has <hi>miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012984_0005_0F903E41CABDF060"/>me or my ſentiments; or thoſe of the <hi>brethren</hi> on the ſame ſide with me—and have taken notice of thoſe things wherein I think he has injured me: This was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. And I have alſo endeavoured to ſhew the weakneſs or fallacy of his arguments. But I have endeavoured, as much as poſſible to avoid that unchriſtian heat and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, which many have complained of, as too manifeſt in my antagoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> eſpecially in his remarks, &amp;c. If the reader ſhould diſcover any thing of this, in this <hi>reply,</hi> I don't aſk him to <hi>juſtify</hi> me in it, whatever provocation I have had.—I condemn it myſelf.—As to the grand <hi>point in debate,</hi> it muſt be owned to be a matter of great importance; and as ſuch no doubt juſtly demands the attention of every one. 'Tis a queſtion ſomewhat <hi>new</hi> perhaps, to many of the preſent generation in <hi>this province.</hi> But ſince it is now become public, tho' by means unexpected, I think it may be carefully attended to by every one, and thoroughly examined by the only unerring rule, the <hi>holy ſcriptures.</hi> The practice of <hi>owning the covenant,</hi> tho' it has prevailed as much perhaps in this government, as in any place, yet, we have reaſon to think, is by many, little underſtood, but received and gone into, as a tradition or <hi>cuſtomary thing.</hi> While ſome others, who have thought more ſeriouſly of the matter, are greatly ſtumbled and perplexed at it—eſpecially when they ſee perſons, whom they have no grounds to think, have had any ſaving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with religion and the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, ſtand up and make the moſt ſolemn <hi>vows</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of devoting themſelves to God, to walk in his ways and obey his commands—and yet after this, live in the habitual neglect of one of the moſt diſtinguiſhing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant commands of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>(Do this in remembrance of me)</hi> perhaps all their days. If this be right, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:012984_0006_0F903E428CD775D8"/>to the will of Chriſt—if it can be ſupported from ſcripture, let the practice be continued and prevail. But if not, why ſhould it live? And why ſhould not miniſters and churches join to aboliſh a practice, which has no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the word of God, and which has been the occaſion of ſo much grief and perplexity to many, and ('tis to be feared) a ſnare to multitudes of others, who have been led (agreeable to <hi>cuſtom</hi>) to vow and promiſe to the Lord, they know not what. The endeavour to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturalneſs and dangerous tendency of <hi>this practice,</hi> is the deſign of the following reply. How I have ſucceeded in this attempt, muſt be left to the judgment of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial reader. And may the God of truth and <hi>father of lights,</hi> lead and direct us in all our enquiries, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his glory, and our own ſpiritual knowledge and comfort, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake.</p>

               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>IN replying to Mr. Cotton's Eſſays, it may be proper in the firſt place, to give ſome brief account of the RISE of this Debate in the firſt church in <hi>Plymouth</hi>—Then of the arguments I have made uſe of, in the courſe of the debate, againſt the <hi>half way practice,</hi> or admitting perſons to <hi>own the covenant</hi> and have <hi>baptiſm</hi> for their children, without coming to the <hi>Lord's ſupper</hi>— In the next place, to anſwer ſome <hi>objections</hi> and <hi>enquiries</hi>—After which, to make ſome more <hi>particular Remarks</hi> on Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, his manner of reaſoning, in ſupport of the ſcheme which he is endeavouring to maintain, and the <hi>various methods</hi> he has taken from time to time, for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Of the Riſe of this Debate in this Church.</p>
               <p>THE practice that has prevailed in many churches in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of admitting perſons to <hi>own the covenant</hi> (as the uſual phraſe is) and have <hi>baptiſm</hi> for their children, without coming to the other ordinance, ſo contrary to the <hi>original plan</hi> of theſe churches, in the days of our anceſtors, has ever appeared to me at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome difficulties, which I could not eaſily get over. However, not attending ſo thoroughly to the arguments that were uſed in ſupport of this ſcheme, as I have endeavoured to do ſince, and being <hi>educated</hi> in the practice, I did ſubmit to it here for a number of years after I was ordained; tho' ſtill, not without ſome uneaſineſs in my mind, at times, on account of the impropriety which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me in it: which at length (being alſo under better advantages for it than before) bro't me to a determination to ſtudy the point more cloſely than I ever had done, and ſee what light and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could obtain. To this end, I procured what <hi>authors</hi> I could,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012984_0008_0F903E4485659780"/>on both ſides of the queſtion—endeavoured to underſtand and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their arguments with the ſcriptures, the only ſure, unerring ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of truth; not without earneſtly ſeeking for light and direction of the great fountain of truth, <hi>from whom cometh every good and perfect giſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſult of my moſt diligent enquiries, for many months, was a <hi>full conviction,</hi> in my own mind, that this practice has no foundation in ſcripture to ſupport it, but (as it had been carried on eſpecially in <hi>ſome</hi> places) it appeared to me, to be an unwarrantable proſtitution of a ſacred ordinance of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>In theſe circumſtances, I thought it my duty to deſiſt the practice.<note n="*" place="bottom">Tho' I never did reject or refuſe any perſon that came to me with a particular deſire to own the covenant; as is repeatedly ſuggeſted by Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi>
                  </note> For it had always appeared unaccountable to me, when I have heard <hi>miniſters</hi> declare their opinion <hi>againſt</hi> the practice, as not warranted by the word of God, that they could notwithſtanding perſiſt in it; or what ſort of <hi>prudence</hi> that is, which induces perſons to <hi>compliances,</hi> (in things of <hi>this</hi> importance) which are contrary to the ſcriptures? The caſe is very different, indeed, with thoſe who think there is <hi>ſcripture warrant</hi> for thus dividing the ſeals, or making ſuch a diſtinction between the two ordinances.</p>
               <p>As I could not conſcientiouſly, in my preſent view of things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue any longer in this practice, I attempted, in ſeveral diſcourſes in publick, to ſhew that it was not warrantable by the word of God, and offered ſome reaſons why I thought it of dangerous tendency.</p>
               <p>In the winter 1770, at a <hi>church-meeting,</hi> called by the deſire of many of the brethren, to conſider ſome things relative to <hi>church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> among other matters, I propoſed for their conſideration, this <hi>queſtion;</hi> whether <hi>the practice</hi> was ſcriptural; in the terms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the beginning of Mr. C.'s eſſays. What reaſon he had to ſay "I was <hi>ſtrenuous</hi>" in the affair, I can't imagine. I am ſure I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted nothing of this kind, at that time: I did but propoſe it for their deliberation. I never requeſted or expected the various <hi>meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> that followed; and which were attended with ſuch unhappy effects and brought ſo much difficulty, in the end. The queſtion was not much debated at that time, but it was deſired it might be referred, for further conſideration, to another opportunity. Afterwards, we had ſeveral church meetings; at which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> delivered his ſeveral eſſays, much in the form, in which they are publiſhed. Since therefore, this controverſy, "through the <hi>importunity</hi> of his friends," (he tells his readers) is become publick, though
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012984_0009_0F903E45022FE020"/>very contrary to my deſire or intention, it ſeems neceſſary that <hi>I alſo ſhould ſhew mine opinion,</hi> and give a brief ſketch of the arguments I have made uſe of, in ſupport of that ſide of the queſtion which I have eſpouſed; which I ſhall do, with ſome enlargements, in the following ſection.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Reaſons for not continuing the Practice.</head>
               <p n="1">I. Becauſe I can find no text in the whole word of GOD, to juſtify the practice; nor any example of a perſon's being allowed to <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God and make a ſolemn profeſſion of religion, and yet <hi>neglect</hi> to attend one of the ſpecial and moſt diſtinguiſhing commands and ordinances of God. His covenant people, both under the old and new Teſtament, not only were expreſsly <hi>commanded,</hi> but it is evident they always looked upon themſelves <hi>bound by covenant</hi> to obſerve <hi>all</hi> divine inſtitutions, and to "walk in <hi>all</hi> God's ordinances and commandments;" and that they had no warrant to make any <hi>exceptions</hi> or limitations, under <hi>any</hi> circumſtances, or upon <hi>any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> whatever.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, God's ancient covenant people, profeſs with one voice, in the moſt ſolemn manner, Exod. xxiv. 7. ALL <hi>that the Lord hath ſaid, will we do, and be obedient.</hi> This was the very import of the covenant, on their part; and 'tis plain they always underſtood it ſo by their frequent, ſolemn profeſſions of the ſame nature from time to time. See <hi>Joſh.</hi> xxiv. 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> xlii. 5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvi. 17, 18. <hi>Joſh.</hi> xxiv. 21. They never imagined they could, conſiſtent with their covenant relation and engagements to God, live in the neglect of any one divine ordinance. They were as much obliged hereby, to keep the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> as to circumciſe their children; and thus they practiſed univerſally. So under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> all that profeſſed love and diſcipleſhip to JESUS CHRIST, were conſtantly taught, "to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>all things</hi> whatſoever he had commanded." There is no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the goſpel, of any thing that looked like a <hi>double admiſſion</hi> into the Church of CHRIST; or of perſons, profeſſing faith in CHRIST, being admitted to <hi>one</hi> ordinance while ſomething further and higher was neceſſary for their enjoyment of the <hi>other;</hi> as ſeems to be the caſe, upon our preſent plan. When <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, thro' their preaching, brought any to Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; upon their <hi>profeſſion</hi> hereof, they were received into the viſible Church or communion of Saints; and were looked upon as diſciples;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012984_0010_0F903E4AA5645788"/>allowed to enjoy the priviledges of ſuch, and were commanded to live and walk anſwerable to their profeſſion, in a careful obſervance of <hi>all</hi> Chriſt's commands. See <hi>Matt.</hi> iii. 8. and xxviii. 20. <hi>John</hi> xv 14. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 46. 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 6. This was evidently the plan the Apoſtles and firſt miniſters of CHRIST went upon. Where do we hear of their <hi>dividing the ſeals,</hi> as the manner is in our preſent practice? Where do we find them inſiſting upon lower or "<hi>negative</hi> evidences" of Grace, as qualifying for <hi>one</hi> ordinance, and higher, <hi>poſitive</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, as neceſſary for the <hi>other?</hi> I could never find any ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, in the word of God, nor any precept or example on which ſuch a diſtinction can be founded. And if ſo, what good reaſon can be given for the practice pleaded for, or how can we be juſtifyed in perſiſting in it?<note n="*" place="bottom">It appears ſomewhat ſtrange, that Mr. C. ſhould charge me with acting "like the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>" becauſe I required a Text of Scripture, to ſupport the practice. I never did indeed demand "a <hi>direct</hi> ſcripture in the caſe." All I inſiſted, was, that he ſhould produce a Scripture that would <hi>juſtify</hi> the practice, or on which it might be fairly grounded. If this is thought unreaſonable or <hi>anabaptiſtical,</hi> all I can ſay in anſwer to it, is, that I had rather <hi>my faith,</hi> in this point, <hi>ſhould ſtand in the wiſdom of God</hi> than in the <hi>inventions</hi> of men. He has ſaid, indeed, the practice can be vindicated by <hi>ſcripture conſequence,</hi> but has no where proved it, as I have obſerved; and until he can do it, I think it is but reaſonable to expect ſome other evidence than his bare aſſertion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis objected by ſome, that the apoſtles did <hi>divide the ſeals,</hi> as they baptized, without ever ſo much as acquainting the diſciples of the other ordinance. I anſwer, if this be true, it is certainly a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon for their <hi>not attending</hi> the other ordinance, when they had heard nothing about it. Yet it don't prove that they would not be <hi>obliged,</hi> by their chriſtian profeſſion, to attend it whenever they <hi>ſhould</hi> be made acquainted with it, and had opportunity; nor that any other qualifications in <hi>kind,</hi> were neceſſary, than thoſe which they had exhibited in order to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another reaſon is, I apprehend this practice has a tendency to lead perſons to a <hi>direct breach of their moſt expreſs covenant engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Which, I think will appear, if we conſider the nature of thoſe engagements. What is the meaning of that ſolemn tranſaction? What do perſons promiſe and engage to do, when they <hi>own the covenant?</hi> Is it not "to behave as becometh a true diſciple of JESUS CHRIST," and to live and walk as ſuch an one? The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant imports nothing, if it does not imply a promiſe of ſubjection to CHRIST in all <hi>his ordinances and commandments.</hi> This certainly is implied in covenanting <hi>according to the Goſpel.</hi> Therefore if a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012984_0011_0F903E4BF15C8150"/>perſon does not engage this, (by the help of God) he does not own <hi>God's covenant,</hi> and therefore can have no right to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> either for himſelf or child; for Baptiſm is a ſeal of no other Covenant. Will it not then, from hence neceſſarily follow, that when perſons <hi>own the covenant</hi> with a view to enjoy Baptiſm for their children, and do not propoſe to go any further, but allowedly live, (as many do, all their days) in the neglect of that expreſs command of CHRIST, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> that ſuch, I ſay, do in a <hi>direct</hi> manner counteract their own covenant engagements? Does not ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct look like ſomething worſe than trifling? Has it not the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſolemn diſſimulation in a matter of the higheſt importance? Is not the plain language of it this—"I ſolemnly avouch the Lord to be my GOD, and JESUS CHRIST to be my Savior, and promiſe to walk in all his ordinances and commandments, <hi>except one,</hi> blameleſs; as to that <hi>one,</hi> I pray thee have me excuſed." How abſurd, how ſhocking is the thought! Yet, as it appears to me, ſomething like this, ſeems to be the import of this practice, however the perſon may be far from being aware of it when he owns his baptiſmal covenant, And this leads me to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="3">III. That this practice has a tendency to lead perſons to think there are <hi>two covenants,</hi> in ſome important reſpects, different from each other; viz. <hi>One,</hi> that a perſon may ſafely enter into, who don't look upon himſelf to be a <hi>real Chriſtian.</hi> The <hi>other,</hi> none muſt enter into, but thoſe who have good evidence that they are true Believers. I may appeal to hundreds for the truth of this, in thoſe places where it is practiſed. Many would not dare to make the profeſſion which thoſe perſons do who <hi>join to the Church;</hi> but yet think they may <hi>ſafely own the covenant.</hi> And why? Becauſe they think they are fit for the <hi>latter,</hi> but by no means for the <hi>former.</hi> And if you ſtill enquire the reaſon; the anſwer is, they don't think they are <hi>good</hi> enough. Thus they plainly make a diſtinction between theſe two profeſſions, as if, in their nature and deſign, they were different covenants.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, I know, that this is the fault of the <hi>miniſter:</hi> He ſhould inſtruct them otherwiſe, and let them know that there is but <hi>one</hi> covenant. — I anſwer, not all the inſtruction in the world. will remove the difficulty, in the minds of ſome. After the utmoſt pains taken by the miniſter, to correct their miſtake, and to ſhow them the nature of covenanting with GOD, yet there are ſome, who cannot be fully convinced, but will retain the <hi>diſtinction</hi> between the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012984_0012_0F903E4E2B3F8880"/>covenants, and think that one requires <hi>different kind</hi> of qualifications from the other. And it is not at all to be wondered at, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been, from their childhood nurſed up in this practice. It appears to me, it has a natural and neceſſary tendency to ſuch an effect.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. C. indeed has propoſed a method in order to get rid of this difficulty, i. e. to <hi>lay aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> the practice of owning the covenant, for thoſe that only would have their children baptized—that they ſhall make <hi>no explicit profeſſion,</hi> but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to bring their children, without; provided they have been baptized <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and are not ſcandalous.
<p>Upon which, I would obſerve, 1. This would be as much an <hi>innovation,</hi> as any Mr. C. complains of; and contrary to the plan propoſed by the <hi>Synod,</hi> which is ſo much inſiſted on. This might therefore, perhaps, be thought by ſome a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to ſet it aſide. Yet 2. It muſt be confeſſed this would ſeem more conſiſtent than the other method. Any one would think, that if perſons muſt have their children baptized, whether they themſelves are <hi>real</hi> chriſtians or no, it muſt be leſs ſinful to bring them without making any Covenant at all, than to make ſuch ſolemn promiſes, and break them immediately. But 3. It would not, at all help the matter, really; or in the leaſt remove the difficulty, it is intended for. For whether theſe perſons <hi>own the covenant verbally,</hi> or not, yet the very <hi>nature of the action</hi> of a parent, in offering up his child in Baptiſm, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a ſolemn covenanting with God; (as Mr. C. acknowledges, p. 8.) 'Tis as much as to ſay, "I acknowledge the Covenant of which Baptiſm is a Seal, to be God's covenant, and the terms of it wiſe and gracious, in token of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with which, I now ſeal the Covenant, by actively dedicating my child to to God, in this holy ordinance, thereby chooſing him for my God and the God of my child." So that if it be unlawful or inconſiſtent for a graceleſs perſon to own that ſolemn covenant <hi>in words,</hi> it muſt alſo be ſo to offer his child in Baptiſm, which neceſſarily implies a covenant tranfaction.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ſame eſſential qualifications, which the ſcriptures make neceſſary for <hi>one</hi> ordinance, are required for the <hi>other.</hi> Neither the Forerunner, nor the Apoſtles of CHRIST, have ſaid any thing, on which ſuch a diſtinction can be juſtly founded, as is now made. As they inſiſted on repentance and faith as neceſſary in order to accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God and remiſſion of ſins, ſo they inſiſted upon the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of them in order to their being admitted into the <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> kingdom or church of CHRIST. They baptized none, but upon this ground. Thoſe who appeared, to a judgment of charity, to have theſe qualifications, they admitted to Baptiſm, and thoſe only. See <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 14, 15. and viii. 37, 38. and xvi. 31—33. and xix. 4, 5. And no other, or <hi>higher</hi> qualifications did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for their admiſſion to the other ordinance of the <hi>Supper.</hi> Upon this profeſſion, they were admitted into the Church or viſible Family of Chriſt <hi>once for all;</hi> and entitled to all the Privileges of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012984_0013_0F903E4F71713DE8"/>viſible Believers, as long as they appeared to act agreeable to the character of ſuch. In a word, from the whole tenor of the New-Teſtament, it is plain, that nothing leſs or lower than a Profeſſion of Faith and true repentance, was required in order to a perſon's enjoying the privilege of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and nothing more, or of a higher kind, was neceſſary for admiſſion to the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower</hi> qualifications for the two ordinances, and the notion of <hi>negative evidences</hi> (which in this caſe is, in fact, no evidence at all; for as it is a negation of that which would merit <hi>cenſure,</hi> on the one hand, ſo it is a negation, or the abſence, or want of that which is a proper ground of charity in <hi>this caſe</hi>) being a ſufficient qualification for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> was never learnt from the New-Teſtament, but is, doubtleſs, of mere human invention.<note n="*" place="bottom">If this point were to be decided by human teſtimonies, as it is not, I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſcores of Divines, who have inſiſted as above. However, as it may give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſome, to know what Mr. <hi>Boſton</hi> ſays on this head; I will tranſcribe ſome of his words.—"None (ſays he) have a right to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> before the <hi>Lord,</hi> but ſuch as have actually a <hi>ſaving intereſt in Chriſt:</hi> this the Scripture plainly bolds forth. So alſo, none but ſuch as <hi>appear to have</hi> a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> right to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> before the <hi>Church.</hi> For (ſays he) Baptiſm is a <hi>ſeal of the righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>faith;</hi> but none have right to the <hi>Seal,</hi> but ſuch as have <hi>intereſt</hi> in the <hi>thing ſealed.</hi> Therefore where 'tis given to one that hath no ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, the ordinance to him is <hi>abuſed;</hi> for, as <hi>Witſius</hi> teacheth, God ſeals nothing to ſuch a one that is truly <hi>good.</hi>" Again he ſays, "None ought to be allowed Baptiſm, out <hi>viſible</hi> DISCIPLES of Chriſt. They muſt be <hi>ſervants</hi> of the <hi>great maſter,</hi> before they get on his <hi>badge</hi> and wear his <hi>livery.</hi> And none can be eſteemed Chriſt's DISCIPLES, but thoſe that appear to have <hi>learned of the Father</hi> and <hi>come to Chriſt.</hi> Nay, ſays he, Chriſt tells us plainly what it is that makes a man a <hi>Diſciple.</hi> "If any man <hi>hate not</hi> his father and mother—and whoſoever will not <hi>bear his croſs</hi> and follow me, <hi>cannot be</hi> my DISCIPLE." And whoever did this that was not truly regenerate? (and as a proof that <hi>baptiſm</hi> alone does not give right to that privilege for their children, without the parent be truly gracious, he produces that text <hi>Ezek.</hi> xliv. 7. <hi>No ſtranger uncircumciſed</hi> IN HEART, <hi>nor uncircumciſed in fleſh, ſhall enter into my ſanctuary;</hi> which was a Type of the Goſpel Church.)

V. I look upon this practice, not only to be unfounded in ſcripture, but of very bad and <hi>dangerous tendency;</hi> eſpecially on theſe two accounts. 1. That it tends to lead perſons to think they can cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and that he accepts of and is pleaſed with them, and will admit them to the ſpecial privileges of his children, even while they are really <hi>unbelievers.</hi> Than which doctrine, nothing can be more pernicious to the ſouls of men, or more directly ſubverſive of the ſcripture account of ſuch perſons; which teaches, that "<hi>they who are in the fleſh</hi> CANNOT PLEASE GOD;" and that, "<hi>the carnal mind is</hi> ENMITY <hi>againſt God.</hi>" Whereas, by the other doctrine, we confound all diſtinctions between the <hi>regenerate</hi> and <hi>unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> converted and unconverted. We uſed to be taught, that none but Believers could, in truth, call God <hi>their</hi> God—that none but ſuch were in favor with God. But if unregenerates may <hi>ſafely</hi> "avouch the Lord for their God"—where is the material difference between a believer and an unbeliever? And why do miniſters ever repreſent the ſtate of the <hi>latter</hi> to be ſo infinitely dangerous and dreadful? as being the daily objects of the wrath of God? But this is not all, for 2dly, There is reaſon to think, this practice tends to promote a <hi>careleſs, ſecure ſpirit</hi> in the perſons themſelves. If the truth could be known, I doubt not, it would appear that it has had this awful effect, in a great many inſtances, where perſons have, before, appeared to be under ſome ſerious impreſſions; yet, having <hi>own'd the covenant,</hi> their conſciences ſeem to have found ſomething to reſt upon, and they preſently grow ſecure. Neither will this appear at all ſtrange, when we conſider how natural it is for perſons, who have ſome convictions of their miſerable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate, to ſeek for ſomething to quiet their conſciences, ſhort of CHRIST. If they are allowed and encouraged, under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to come and covenant with God; and are told that they are thenceforward to be looked upon and treated as <hi>Saints,</hi> and have a right to all the viſible privileges of ſuch, how naturally will their concern leſſen, till their convictions are worn off; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the cautions they have had not to reſt there, but to preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and make ſure of an intereſt in CHRIST, yet all don't avail; through the temptation of Satan and the natural pride of their hearts, taking occaſion from their being called <hi>viſible chriſtians,</hi> they grow careleſs, and at length "return like the dog to his vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e." I can't but be afraid, this practice has had this ruinous effect upon multitudes of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012984_0015_0F903E50D8CB7D08"/>ſouls. And ſurely miniſters and churches have no need to add to the temptations that ſinners are under to carnal ſecurity, or do any thing that tends to ſoothe and lull them to ſleep, in their infinitely dangerous circumſtances. What can be the cauſe, that ſuch perſons ſtop here—many neglecting all their days to come to the other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Muſt it not be, either that they had no juſt ſenſe of what they were about, and of the promiſes they made at owning the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; or if they had then any religious impreſſions, that they are, by this means, worn off? And indeed it muſt be allowed that ſuch <hi>breaches</hi> of ſolemn vows, as many are guilty of, have a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to fear the conſcience and harden the heart to a great degree.</p>
               <p>For the foregoing reaſons, with many others that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I cannot think the practice warrantable, but unſcriptural and therefore of dangerous tendency.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is this all then, that is needful in order to his being admitted to the priviledges of the covenant; Baptiſm for his children, in particular?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, provided he is of a ſober, blameleſs life and converſation, and "does not carry the <hi>Devil's mark,</hi> i. e. a profane life."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why do you make this <hi>proviſo</hi> in the caſe? Then <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of itſelf, is not a ſufficient qualification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: a perſon may be a baptized member of the church, and yet be <hi>diſqualified</hi> on account of his immorality and <hi>open</hi> wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why is that a ſufficient reaſon to exclude him, if he be a "compleat member" of the church and in covenant, by his baptiſm?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God has made it a bar; he forbids ſuch, and only ſuch to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> On what account, can it be ſuppoſed, that God forbids <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> perſons to bring their Children to Baptiſm?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe <hi>ſuch</hi> ſins are an Evidence of their Hypocriſy—and that they can't come in ſincerity, to that ordinance; it would be a profanation of it for ſuch to bring their children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then it ſeems, that which God is diſpleaſed with, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allows, is, perſons coming to this ordinance merely in <hi>Pretence</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Certainly God diſallows and always forbids <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> in that, and every duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then can they come lawfully or ſafely, if they are in <hi>Heart,</hi> hypocrites, and have no true love to God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Church have nothing to do with their <hi>Hearts,</hi> in this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But I ſpeak of Lawfulneſs <hi>in the Sight of God</hi> and their own <hi>conſcience.</hi> If they are conſcious to themſelves that they are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and do not pretend to come under any notion of their being gracious perſons, but from "a principle of Love to their Children," how can they come (according to what you have ſaid) with ſafety or a good conſcience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They have a right, and may ſafely come, if they are members of the viſible Church of Chriſt, and free from hereſy and ſcandal: and their being baptized in Infancy makes them Members of Chriſt's viſible Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But you own that God forbids perſons coming in <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and pretence, that he requires ſincerity of heart, in thoſe that come to this ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They may come in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and yet have no ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What! be ſincere, and yet at the ſame time, not think they have any true love to God in their hearts, and don't come under any ſuch notion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, if they come in obedience to the <hi>command of God,</hi> and from "love to their children," they may be ſincere, and lawfully come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What kind of obedience, or ſincerity is that, which an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſinner exerciſes? If God requires <hi>ſincerity</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>hypocriſy,</hi> it muſt be ſuch a <hi>kind</hi> of ſincerity as God is pleaſed with and accepts; otherwiſe he may as well come in <hi>hypocriſy</hi> as in <hi>ſincerity.</hi> You ſay, ſcandalous ſinners are forbidden; that they cannot come to this ordinance in <hi>ſincerity</hi>—but that others may; tho' they be not <hi>gracious</hi> perſons. Which implies, that they can attend the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in a manner which God allows and accepts. Now what ſort of <hi>ſincerity</hi> is that which an unconverted man, one who is entirely
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012984_0017_0F903E524938A050"/>deſtitute of love to God and holineſs, exerciſes; and which qualifies him for a lawful attending on this ordinance?<note n="*" place="bottom">It alters not the caſe here at all, for a perſon to object, That this method of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will prove, that God is no more diſpleaſed with the moſt ſcandalous, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane wretch, than with one of a ſober, regular life and converſation. (Tho' this will by no means follow, from what I have ſaid) The argument is grounded on this, viz: That God diſallows of, and forbids perſons coming to ſpecial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> Now if it can be proved, that an unregenerate man, tho' baptized, and outwardly regular, can come to this ordinance <hi>without hypocriſy,</hi> then the argument is overthrown. But if not, it is nothing to the perſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſay, that a moral, ſober, impenitent Sinner, may come, becauſe he <hi>is not ſo bad</hi> a man, or ſo odious to God as an open, ſcandalous ſinner. I grant there are degrees in hypocriſy, and one may be more guilty or it than another. But ſtill, if <hi>reigning hypocriſy,</hi> diſqualifies a perſon, it diſqualifies the leſſer as well as the greater Hypocrite.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> 'Tis a common, moral ſincerity, as diſtingufſhed from gracious: If he is not a "willful hypocrite," or does not come with a deſign to mock God with a pretence, but from a ſenſe of duty, his ſin would not be ſo great, nor would he "offend God ſo much, by coming, as ſtaying away, though he be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But can there by any <hi>real ſincerity,</hi> ſuch as God will accept, where the <hi>heart</hi> is wanting? does he not require the Heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; he requires it in every duty. But a perſon may be <hi>heartily ſincere,</hi> even tho' he be not truly gracious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Pray what do you underſtand by <hi>unregenerate?</hi> I have ever thought, and orthodox divines have always deſcribed <hi>unregeneracy,</hi> in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> very nature of it, to conſiſt in the total alienation or oppoſition <hi>of the heart</hi> to God. Therefore I would again enquire, what kind of <hi>hearty</hi> ſincerity that perſon can exerciſe, in his approaches to God, whoſe <hi>heart</hi> is entirely againſt God, full of reigning enmity to him, and one who, according to CHRIST'S own account, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ateth both him and the father?</hi> who is an enemy to the covenant of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to ſubmit to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Well, then according to this, an unregenerate ſinner muſt not read nor pray, nor attend public worſhip; for he can do none of theſe in a gracious manner. It puts an end to all means of grace, as being of any ſervice to the unregenerate. But I ſay, the "total neglect of theſe duties is much more ſinful and provoking to God, than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due performance," and the contrary doctrine deſtroys every thing at once, and leads to the moſt open licentiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You either miſapprehend me here, or elſe you don't argue juſtly. I do not hold that an unregenerate perſon muſt not read or pray or
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012984_0018_0F903E53081CDBC8"/>attend public worſhip. Neither doth it follow from any thing I have ſaid. And I add, neither will it follow, that becauſe unſanctified men may lawfully attend theſe <hi>common means</hi> of grace, reading, hearing, &amp;c. that therefore they may attend upon the Sacraments—<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi> If there is any weight in your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, or if it proves any thing, it is <hi>this;</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> which makes it lawful and right for a man to read, pray and attend public worſhip, makes it alſo lawful for him to come to <hi>ſpecial ordinances.</hi> But you, yourſelf, I truſt, will not give in to this propoſition. You will not aſſert, that nothing more is required in order to a lawful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the <hi>latter,</hi> than the <hi>former.</hi> For you will allow that an <hi>unbaptized</hi> perſon may lawfully go to meeting, hear the word, &amp;c. but you don't think it lawful for an <hi>unbaptized</hi> perſon to bring his child to baptiſm. So that your objection is of no weight, yourſelf being judge. Therefore 'tis unreaſonable for you to ſay, that becauſe I inſiſt that ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> qualifications are neceſſary in order to a lawful attending on the Sacraments, therefore a perſon muſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon any <hi>other means of grace,</hi> without theſe qualifications. It does not follow that becauſe unbelievers cannot attend on <hi>covenant</hi> tranſactions without hypocriſy and lying, therefore they cannot ſay or do <hi>any thing</hi> without lying. Whatever implies this, they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought not to do.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I think it is manifeſt, that the objection, that this ſcheme tends to deſtroy all obligations on ſinners to attend the <hi>means of grace</hi> is without the leaſt foundation; and that, from the neceſſity of <hi>gracious ſincerity,</hi> for a perſon's lawfully attending on <hi>ſpecial ſealing ordinances,</hi> it can never be argued that a perſon ought not to attend on the <hi>common means of grace,</hi> while in an unregenerate ſtate.</p>
               <p>And I am humbly of opinion, that from what has been ſaid, it will alſo follow, that we muſt either deny <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be a <hi>ſeal</hi> of the covenant of grace—Or affirm that a parent is <hi>not active</hi> in ſealing of it, when he ſolemnly offers up his child to God in that ordinance—or elſe grant that no perſon while unregenerate has a right, or (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be ſo) can lawfully, and without wicked diſſimulation, come to that ordinance—unleſs we will rather give up one of the moſt eſſential doctrines of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and aſſert, that <hi>unregenerate</hi> men are not totally depraved, nor wholly enemies to God and his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but can, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> do ſomething that ſhall be pleaſing and acceptable to God; or in other words, that <hi>they who are in the fleſh can pleaſe God;</hi> in direct contradiction to the expreſs declarations of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 8. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I. SAYS the Parent, tho' I am not ſatisfied that I am in a gracious ſtate, or that I belong to the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church of Chriſt; yet by my <hi>baptiſm,</hi> I was made a member of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, and therefore, whether I can claim <hi>ſaving</hi> Bleſſings or no, yet I have a right to <hi>viſible,</hi> outward Priviledges, and ſuch I have right to demand, particularly <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for my Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Granting all you ſay; This will not prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our preſent practice, of admitting to <hi>one</hi> ordinance, end not to the <hi>other.</hi> If there be any force in your argument, it will prove that you have as good a right to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as to <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> for one is as much a <hi>viſible</hi> priviledge of the covenant, as the other. If therefore, your being baptized, gives you a lawful claim to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for your child, it certainly gives you a right to the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> for yourſelf. And not only ſo, but it makes it your bounden <hi>duty</hi> to come to both ordinances. So that here is no room left for dividing the ſeals. For that which gives any perſon a <hi>right</hi> to a chriſtian priviledge, doubtleſs makes it his <hi>duty</hi> to attend upon and enjoy that priviledge, when he has opportunity. How then can you think yourſelf at liberty to neglect one ſpecial ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as a precious priviledge? But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis true, by Baptiſm in infancy you was initiated into the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church of CHRIST; i. e. by your parent's act, you was introduced into the number of God's <hi>viſible</hi> covenant-people. But then it is but reaſonably expected of you, that ſince you are now prown up to adult age, you ſhould make your <hi>parents</hi> act your <hi>own,</hi> by an open chriſtian profeſſion. So long as you refuſe to acknowledge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the covenant, to confeſs Chriſt before men, profeſſing a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obey all his commands, what right have you to be received and treated as a chriſtian in good ſtanding? He that is not <hi>for</hi> Chriſt, is <hi>againſt</hi> him. And do you not <hi>renounce</hi> what your parents did, when they dedicated you to Chriſt in baptiſm?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> II. My attending the public worſhip and ordinances of God, and deſiring baptiſm for my child, are a ſufficient evidence that I do not renounce the covenant I was brought into by my baptiſm, but own and conſent to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, of itſelf, can be no proper evidence of it to the church at all. For that which is found in perſons who make <hi>no pretence</hi> to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012984_0020_0F903E5491793888"/>real, ſaving religion; who know and own themſelves to be enemies to God and his covenant, cannot certainly be any proper evidence of <hi>compliance</hi> with it in another perſon; or afford a juſt ground of a <hi>viſibility</hi> of true religion, in a judgment of rational charity. That which is common to both good and bad, gracious and ungracious perſons, cannot poſſibly be looked upon ſuch a profeſſion of religion, as Chriſt makes neceſſary in order to admiſſion to ſealing ordinances, or to the ſpecial privileges of his diſciples. The truth, in ſhort, is, none do conform to their baptiſmal covenant, but thoſe who do <hi>all things</hi> whatſoever Chriſt has commanded. Your attending on God's worſhip and ordinances in ſome inſtances, and neglecting others, as important, and as plainly commanded—your offering your child to baptiſm, while you refuſe explicitly to confeſs Chriſt and come to the holy ſupper, is rather againſt you than for you. It imports an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſurdity; and ſhews you to be too ignorant of the nature of that tranſaction, of offering up a child to God in baptiſm; than which, nothing can ſimply a more ſolemn <hi>covenanting</hi> with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> III. Well, ſays the parent, I am willing then, publickly to own the Covenant, and make a profeſſion of religion—and thus make my Parents Act, my own. What hinders me now from enjoying baptiſm for my Child?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> You will not think me unreaſonable here, if I tell you, two things are very neceſſary for you, in this caſe. One is, that you ought to underſtand what you do, and to know what you are going about, in ſuch a ſolemn affair as this is, <hi>covenanting with the great Gods.</hi> And the other is, that if you do <hi>vow</hi> and promiſe to the Lord, you ought to <hi>perform</hi> what you promiſe; otherwiſe it will be but ſolemn mockery. You ought at leaſt, to purpoſe and intend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, by the help of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ought to know and well underſtand what it is to covenant with God, before you go about it; and not go on blindfold in ſuch a ſolemn tranſaction. Now if the caſe be truly as you ſay, i. e. if there be <hi>ſuch an heart</hi> in you, as far as you are able to judge, upon the moſt careful and ſerious conſideration; I truſt none will object to your coming, and <hi>owning your baptiſmal covenant;</hi> I am ſure, none ought to refuſe you. (Obj.) But don't you hold that <hi>aſſurance</hi> is neceſſary? I have heard you held it; and that none can ſafely come but ſuch as <hi>know</hi> they are truly gracious. (Anſ.) No, I do not hold this. I do not think you ought to wait till you have <hi>aſſurance</hi> of your regenerate ſtate. I never held or taught ſuch doctrine; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will this follow from my principles. I think 'tis your duty to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012984_0021_0F903E59748A7850"/>come, if the caſe be with you, as deſcribed above; and the duty of the church to receive you; for we are not to <hi>break the bruiſed r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> But then you ought, on the other hand, to be careful that you do not mock God, by making <hi>a ſhew</hi> of covenanting, when you do not do it in ſincerity of heart; and have reaſon to think you have never really choſen God for your portion. A conſcientious perſon, ſurely would be afraid to come and profeſs before God, Angels and Men, that he does <hi>this day avouch the Lord for his God,</hi> when he has good reaſon to think that he is to this day an enemy to God, has no ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, or love to him. Perhaps when you ſay you are willing to own your baptiſmal covenant, you mean, you are willing to ſtand up, as the manner is, before the congregation, and hear the <hi>common form</hi> of covenanting read by the miniſter, bow your aſſent to it, and then bring your children out to baptiſm. But I muſt tell you, this is not all that is meant by <hi>owning, or entering into covenant</hi> with God. If your heart don't go along with the words of the covenant; if you have reaſon to think the diſpoſition of your heart does not agree to the words of your mouth, it is all but a piece of formal hypocriſy, and muſt be very diſpleaſing to a holy God. Such perſons might well expect that awful demand in Pſal. l. 16. <hi>What haſt thou to do—that thou ſhouldſt take</hi> MY COVENANT <hi>in thy mouth!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you have reaſon to think, upon the moſt diligent and prayerful examination of your ſtate, by the rules of God's word, that there is ſuch a heart in you, that you find in yourſelf a freedom, and willingneſs to give up yourſelf to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, and devote your all to him forever, according to the tenor of your baptiſmal covenant, I would encourage you, as a miniſter of Chriſt, to come and do it, and God be with you. There can be no reaſonable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your being received to all the privileges of <hi>that covenant,</hi> which was <hi>ſealed to you</hi> in baptiſm. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ought to be careful to <hi>perform</hi> as well as <hi>promiſe</hi> to God. For <hi>better is it that thou ſhouldſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay.</hi> Eccl. v. 5. By owning your covenant, you engage, by a ſolemn vow, to live and walk as a <hi>diſciple</hi> of JESUS CHRIST, to ſubmit to all his inſtitutions and to <hi>walk in</hi> ALL <hi>his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordinances blameleſs.</hi> This, as has been before obſerved, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what is implied in the very nature of covenanting with God. How then can you think of doing this, when at the ſame time you do not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012984_0022_0F903E5B0198EF80"/>intend, or think it your <hi>preſent duty</hi> to attend upon that ſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and command of Chriſt, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">And how can a Church, conſiſtently uphold a practice, which has a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make perſons think they may <hi>lawfully covenant</hi> with God, and yet <hi>lawfully neglect</hi> one of his known Commands? What is this, but <hi>virtually</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them in a manifeſt Breach of their ſolemn covenant Engagements? And do we not evidently do this, when we plead for ſuch doctrines and practices as theſe; That a perſon may lawfully own the covenant, if he has <hi>no grace</hi>— that "the doing this, would be <hi>leſs offenſive to God,</hi> than the <hi>omiſſion,</hi> even <hi>if he ſhould be</hi> really <hi>unregenerate.</hi>" That a perſon may lawfully be admitted to a covenant tranſaction with God, if he has <hi>no other</hi> or higher <hi>"principle than love to his children"</hi>—and that he may lawfully be admitted to baptiſm for his child, tho' he does not at preſent, intend, or think it his duty, to come to the other ordinance, ſo expreſly commanded by JESUS CHRIST.—What is this, but being, in ſome ſenſe, acceſſary to, and ſo <hi>partakers of other men's ſins?</hi> There is not one truth in the New Teſtament, plainer than this, viz. That 'tis the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty of all the Followers of Chriſt, to partake of the Lord's Supper, <hi>in remembrance of him.</hi> But certainly they who own or enter into covenant with God, do profeſs to be his <hi>Diſciples</hi> and followers—therefore are bound by the moſt ſacred ties, to attend <hi>that</hi> ordinance, upon pain of forfeiting the Character and all the Priviledges of his Diſciples. And therefore, no Perſon, Church or Power on Earth, can lawfully diſpenſe with ſuch attendance. And it appears equally plain to me, that no church can lawfully (by a publick vote) eſtabliſh, maintain or continue a <hi>practice,</hi> which, by plain conſtruction, does imply ſuch kind of forbearance or diſpenſation. From all which I think it evident, that the <hi>practice</hi> pleaded for, cannot be juſtified or ſupported either from Scripture, or the reaſon and nature of Things.</note>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> IV. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church had all their children <hi>circumciſed;</hi> and were commanded by God to do it, or they ſhould be <hi>cut off.</hi> And none can ſuppoſe they were all <hi>gracious</hi> perſons—or that they were required to make a <hi>publick profeſſion</hi> that implied it: And why may not all children be baptiſed now, of thoſe in <hi>viſible cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>—I mean the children of baptized parents; inaſmuch as all allow baptiſm comes in the room of circumciſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Should all this be allowed, yet this won't juſtify the <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> we are ſpeaking of. Nay if this argument has any weight at all, it is directly againſt the Practice. For you, and every one muſt allow, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were as much obliged and commanded to <hi>eat the paſſover,</hi> as to <hi>circumciſe</hi> their children. So that your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if any thing to the purpoſe, proves it to be the indiſpenſible duty of all that bring their children to <hi>baptiſm,</hi> to come them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Lord's table.</hi> And here, I pray that it may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, that the circumciſed adults in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the priviledge of circumciſion for their <hi>children,</hi> but were <hi>cut
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012984_0023_0F903E5B629174F0"/>off,</hi> by the expreſs command of God, from <hi>all the Privileges</hi> of his covenant people if they neglected or refuſed to attend on the <hi>Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> See <hi>Numb.</hi> ix. 13. <hi>But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey and</hi> FORBEARETH TO EAT THE PASSOVER, <hi>even the ſame ſoul ſhall be</hi> CUT OFF <hi>from his people.</hi> Whether this exciſion intends, being <hi>put to death,</hi> or not, yet none deny that it intended at leaſt, their being cut off from <hi>all the ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> of God's covenant people, or <hi>viſible Saints.</hi> Now I think it but a reaſonable requeſt, that thoſe, who are for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſpenſation, and build ſo much upon that, for the ſupport of <hi>this practice,</hi> ſhould endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it with this text. I think it affords a very ſtrong argument at leaſt, for not treating thoſe perſons as <hi>viſible ſaints,</hi> who refuſe or neglect to attend the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and for denying them the priviledges of God's covenant people, if not for caſting them out. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe are evidently miſtaken, who aſſert that, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not required to make a <hi>public profeſſion</hi> of their covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to God. It is manifeſt from ſcripture, that they were commanded ſolemnly to renew covenant, in a public manner, even the whole congregation, every <hi>ſeventh year.</hi>—So that none could have children to circumciſe, who had not before made a public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of religion. See <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 9—12. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>wrote this law, and delivered it unto the prieſts, the ſons of</hi> Levi <hi>which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders of Iſrael; and</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded them ſaying, At the end of</hi> EVERY SEVEN YEARS <hi>in the ſolemnity of the year of releaſe—when all Iſrael is come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he ſhall chooſe, thou ſhalt read</hi> THIS LAW, <hi>before all Iſrael, in their hearing,</hi> &amp;c. Now that this intends a <hi>public renewal of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God, is manifeſt, not only from this, that the <hi>law</hi> or ten commandments, are frequently called God's <hi>covenant,</hi> as the law, ſummarily contained that covenant, ſo that whenever there was, among that people, a publick, ſolemn profeſſion of obedience to it, by God's inſtitution, it muſt be looked upon as an explicit <hi>covenanting</hi> with God—but it will be evident, beyond all reaſonable doubt, that in <hi>this place</hi> ſuch public renewal of covenant is meant, if we will compare <hi>this paſſage</hi> and its connection with the xxix chapter, 10—15 verſes. <hi>Ye ſtand all of you this day before the Lord your God—that thou ſhouldſt</hi> ENTER INTO COVENANT <hi>with the Lord thy God, and into his oath.</hi> That which is here called GOD'S <hi>covenant</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012984_0024_0F903E5C0DC97AE0"/>oath, is in the forementioned place called his <hi>law.</hi> And whoever will be at the pains to read attentively, theſe three chapters, viz. from the xxixth to the xxxiid, muſt ſee, that what the people of Iſrael were commanded to do every <hi>ſeven years,</hi> in the xxxiſt chap. was the <hi>ſame</hi> which they had before done in the plains of <hi>Moab,</hi> mentioned in the xxixth. If the <hi>latter</hi> was a publick renewal of covenant with God, ſo was the <hi>former;</hi> for it is plainly ſpoken of as a repetition of what they had ſo ſolemnly tranſacted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place. Whence it appears, that none, among that people, had grown up to ſuch an age, as to have occaſion to circumciſe their children, but they had before, perſonally and explicitly entered into covenant with God.</p>
               <p>As to the other part of the objection, that they were not all <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons,</hi> who brought their children to be circumciſed; I would obſerve, 'Tis moſt probable, yea, there is no doubt, many of them did come to this ordinance in a <hi>hypocritical</hi> manner—did externally covenant with God, and ſeal their covenant when they had no true love to the God of ISRAEL. It is very certain, that in many periods of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate, the greater part of the people were notoriouſly wicked, groſsly hypocritical—fell into ſcandalous idolatry: Inſomuch that God ſpeaks of them in general, and calls them a <hi>hypocritical nation,</hi> and the <hi>people of his wrath,</hi> Iſai. x. 6. But will any one argue from all this, that they had <hi>a right</hi> to come to God's ordinances in the manner they did—or that God ALLOWED THEM to come with ſuch a character, much leſs, <hi>commanded</hi> them? Will any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reaſon after ſuch a ſtrange ſort as this; that becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were commanded to attend the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and many of 'em at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them in abominable hypocriſy—therefore <hi>we</hi> may do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? And becauſe they <hi>flattered</hi> GOD <hi>with their mouth, and</hi> LIED <hi>to him with their tongue,</hi> therefore 'tis lawful for <hi>us</hi> to do the ſame now? This would be, indeed, a ſurprizing way of arguing. God did enjoin that people, 'tis true, to <hi>circumciſe</hi> their children and eat the paſſover, on penalty of exciſion; But it does not follow from hence, that God enjoined or allowed them to do it in an <hi>ungracious,</hi> hypocritical man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r. Therefore it muſt be acknowledged, to the honor of the divine purity, that thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had <hi>no right</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe ordinances, in the manner that multitudes of them did.</p>
               <p>But furthermore—It may be obſerved, that this objection, taken from the <hi>Jewiſh church,</hi> does militate full as much againſt thoſe that make it, as againſt us. For <hi>they</hi> hold, that none have a right to come
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012984_0025_0F903E5CC6C7EE70"/>to <hi>either</hi> ordinance, but ſuch as are free from <hi>ſcandal.</hi> But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as before obſerved, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vaſt numbers among the <hi>Jews,</hi> attended their Sacraments, without <hi>this</hi> qualification; when they were ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly <hi>immoral,</hi> and lived in open wickedneſs and idolatry. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually were they falling into that ſin? and yet we have no account, at ſuch times, of their leaving off circumciſion or the paſſover. So that, for perſons to plead, that the Jews were <hi>expreſsly commanded</hi> to attend theſe ordinances, and therefore might do it <hi>without gracious ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>—or to urge that true holineſs was not what God required of them, becauſe the command was ſo <hi>univerſal;</hi> if of any weight here, will, in the end, prove every whit as much againſt <hi>themſelves,</hi> as againſt <hi>us;</hi> viz. That God did not require, ſo much as <hi>moral honeſty,</hi> or freedom from ſcandal, in thoſe that came to his ordinances. For there is no more exception, in the divine command, in one caſe, than in the other. The truth undoubtedly, is, though God did <hi>command</hi> them to attend on theſe duties, yet he never commanded them to do it in a <hi>graceleſs hypocritical</hi> manner. 'Tis impoſſible he ſhould—it would be inconſiſtent with the infinite, unchangeable holineſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature, to do it. Therefore, what <hi>they actually did,</hi> is no rule by which we are to judge what was <hi>right;</hi> but <hi>what God commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, God <hi>knew</hi> they had no grace, many of them, and that it was impoſſible for 'em to come in a gracious manner, and therefore he could not, conſiſtent with his juſtice, command them to come with a qualification which he knew they had not, and could not get. I anſwer—1ſt. It may as well be ſaid, that God <hi>knew</hi> many of them were <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and could not come to the ordinance without being of ſuch a character—and therefore, when he commands them ſo <hi>univerſally,</hi> he could not intend they ſhould be free from <hi>immorality</hi> when they came. But 2d. The command of God to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend theſe ordinances, was no more <hi>univerſal,</hi> or <hi>abſolute,</hi> than the command to <hi>love him with all their heart.</hi> So that it may, as juſtly be objected, that God cannot, conſiſtent with his juſtice, require men <hi>to love him,</hi> or to <hi>repent and be converted,</hi> becauſe they, at preſent have no heart, or moral power to do it.—But I conclude all orthodox perſons will allow, that God may juſtly <hi>command all men every where</hi> to love him, and <hi>to repent</hi> of their ſins, even tho' they have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>no gracious principle,</hi> or moral ability to obey. And if ſo, where is the abſurdity, or injuſtice in their being commanded to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi> their Love to God, or to attend thoſe ordinances, which are, in their nature, <hi>a profeſſion</hi> of love, repentance, faith, &amp;c.</p>

For perſons to plead, that a man can't be to blame for coming to ſealing ordinances <hi>without grace,</hi> when he has it not; and that it would be <hi>hard</hi> to puniſh perſons for not having a qualification, which it is not in their power to get, and which God alone can beſtow, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, is juſt as much as to ſay, a man can't be to blame for not loving God, when he has no Love <hi>in his Heart</hi> to him; and that it would be <hi>hard</hi> to puniſh a poor creature, <hi>with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> merely for his continuing in <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> and obſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the argument brought to ſupport this practice, taken from the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> which has been ſo much inſiſted on among us, appears to be inconcluſive and without any weight. For, 'tis abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt, as has been ſhewn, that they were not allowed to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012984_0027_0F903E5EEDC1D630"/>enjoy the priviledge of circumciſion for their children, nor any other priviledge of God's covenant people, or viſible ſaints, if they neglected to attend the <hi>Paſſover;</hi> but were to be cut off. Moreover it appears, they were all obliged perſonally and publickly to <hi>renew covenant</hi> with God—And that, however ſome of them came in <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> yet that God never allowed, much leſs commanded them to attend or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in this manner, but always forbid it—and that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct therefore, is not to be the rule by which we are to determine what was right. If thouſands under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations ſhould <hi>own the covenant</hi> in hypocriſy, and <hi>avouch the Lord for their God,</hi> while yet they are enemies to him in <hi>heart,</hi> it can never prove that it was <hi>then</hi> or is <hi>now,</hi> lawful to do it; much leſs, agreeable to the will of God and his deſign in having a viſible Church in the world, as ſome have plead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> V. Why may not perſons be admitted to the priviledges of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> now, as <hi>univerſally,</hi> and with no other qualifications than thoſe had who came to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, to be baptized? It can't be thought they were all <hi>gracious,</hi> or made a profeſſion of ſaving faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Several things are evident from this account, viz. 1ſt. That <hi>John</hi> preached <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> in the approaching Meſſiah, <hi>Math.</hi> iii. 2. REPENT <hi>ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 4. <hi>That they ſhould</hi> BELIEVE <hi>on him that ſhould come after him.</hi> 2dly. 'Tis evident alſo, that they who came to him and were baptized, made ſome <hi>publick profeſſion</hi> of faith and repentance. <hi>Math.</hi> iii. 6. <hi>And were baptized of him</hi> CONFESSING THEIR SINS. And <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 5. When they heard this, they were <hi>baptized</hi> IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS.<note n="*" place="bottom">That is, they were baptized by <hi>John</hi> himſelf; for to what purpoſe ſhould theſe perſons be <hi>rebaptized</hi> by the apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who had before been baptized with John's Baptiſm? <hi>Pol.</hi> in loc.</note> 3dly. It is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they made profeſſion of <hi>another</hi> and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>kind</hi> of repentance from that which <hi>John</hi> preached and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated upon them. But 4thly. 'Tis very evident, that was not a <hi>legal,</hi> but a <hi>ſaving,</hi> evangelical repentance. For it was <hi>repentance for the</hi> REMISSION OF SINS. And there is no remiſſion of ſins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, or that can belong to any repentance but that which is <hi>gracious</hi> and ſaving. Therefore there is nothing that can be gathered from <hi>John,</hi> or his Baptiſm, that will warrant <hi>our practice,</hi> or prove that it is lawful for <hi>unregenerate</hi> perſons to come to ſpecial ordinances. Whether thoſe that he baptized, were all true penitents or not, ('tis
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012984_0028_0F903E5F14DC7058"/>plain ſome of 'em were not,) yet this was what they <hi>profeſſed,</hi> and upon <hi>this</hi> profeſſion, he baptized them. For he had no authority to judge their hearts. He went by what was <hi>viſible,</hi> as all miniſters and churches ought. If perſons <hi>profeſs</hi> true repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and nothing appears in their liſe and conduct to contradict it, they are to be admitted. God has given us no other rule to go by, than this.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>numbers</hi> that went to John to be baptized—<hi>All Judea and Jeruſalem;</hi> by theſe expreſſions, 'tis plain nothing more is meant, than that there was a <hi>great reſort,</hi> much people from thoſe places, that went out to him. The word ALL there, can no more intend all the inhabitants of thoſe places, young and old, than the like expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſays ALL MEN FORSOOK ME. Whereas 'tis evident he was not forſaken by every individual of his friends: Or than the ſame expreſſion in <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>Since that time the kingdom of God is preached and</hi> EVERY MAN PRESSETH INTO IT.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> VI. Well, if this practice of owning the covenant, is laid aſide, what will become of our <hi>poor children?</hi> If none have a right to the ordinance of Baptiſm for themſelves or children, without covenanting with God, and if none ought to do this, but thoſe whoſe <hi>hearts are right with God,</hi> i. e. gracious perſons; if I ought not to "avouch the Lord to be my God," unleſs I have reaſon to think I have <hi>heartily choſen him for my God;</hi> if the caſe be ſo, what a dark and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly proſpect does it give, of the <hi>riſing generation?</hi> In a few years more, the greater part of our children will be <hi>unbaptized</hi>—and go without ſo much as the <hi>external mark</hi> or badge of chriſtianity; be as <hi>Pagans, Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathen.</hi> And what a <hi>reproach</hi> will this be to the children, and the families they belong to? Muſt they be treated as <hi>"dogs and not as lambs of the flock"</hi>—What a terrible conſideration is this! and what ſhall be done in this caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the firſt place, not take <hi>ungoſpel methods</hi> to remedy the difficulty. However dark the proſpect may be, and however great our concern for our children, yet we may be ſure of this, that 'tis not the right way, to get rid of this evil, to go out of the rules which Chriſt has given us with reſpect to baptiſm. Neither can we expect a bleſſing, either on us or them, if we ſhould <hi>do evil that good may come;</hi> or if we ſhould be guilty of diſſimulation and hypocriſy, in order to get our children baptized; as that perſon muſt be, who ſolemnly <hi>covenants</hi> with God, when he has not ſuch an heart in him.</p>

But as to the <hi>reproach</hi> brought upon our children, by going with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>outward badge</hi> of a chriſtian, becauſe they remain <hi>unbaptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> through the <hi>parents</hi> neglecting to make a profeſſion of godlineſs—Such an objection will appear to you, I truſt, to favor of great unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and even ſtupidity, if you do but attend to the nature of it. And here I aſk leave of the reader, to inſert the following quotation, though the paſſage be ſomewhat lengthy; to which I humbly and earneſtly aſk the ſerious attention of the reader, and particularly the people of my charge; not only becauſe I think it contains a ſolid and full anſwer to the objection made, but alſo ſome truths, of the greateſt importance, which I could wiſh, may be deeply impreſſed on the minds of all that are concerned about this controverſy—eſpecially the <hi>parents</hi> in queſtion.</p>
               <p>"Such a kind of objection (ſays he) will ſavour of a very <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſpirit.</hi> Is it not enough, if God freely offers men to own their <hi>children</hi> and give them the honour of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> in caſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will only relinquiſh their enmity to him, turn from ſin, and heartily give up themſelves and their children to him, and take upon them the profeſſion of godlineſs?—If men are truly <hi>excuſable,</hi> and not to blame for remaining in an unconverted ſtate, in not turning to God thro' Chriſt, and in not <hi>believing with their hearts</hi> and <hi>confeſſing with their mouths,</hi> why don't we <hi>openly</hi> plead that they are ſo? and why don't we openly teach ſinners, that they are <hi>not to blame</hi> for continuing among the enemies of Chriſt, and <hi>neglecting</hi> and deſpiſing his <hi>great ſalvation?</hi>—But if, on the other hand, they are <hi>not at all excuſable</hi> in this, if it be owing wholly to their own wicked hearts and indulged luſts, that they refuſe ſincerely to give up themſelves and their <hi>children</hi> to God, then how <hi>unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> is it in them to complain that their children are denyed the honor of having <hi>God's mark</hi> ſet upon them as ſome of <hi>his?</hi> If parents are angry (ſays he) and think hard of this, ſuch a temper ſhews them to be very ſenſeleſs of their own <hi>vile treatment</hi> of the bleſſed God."</p>
               <p>"And beſides, is it not very much owing to <hi>parents,</hi> that there are ſo many <hi>young people</hi> grown up, who can make no profeſſion of godlineſs?

Let parents pity their poor <hi>children,</hi> becauſe they are without <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and pity <hi>themſelves,</hi> who are in danger of everlaſting miſery, while they have no ſpecial intereſt in the covenant of grace, and ſo, have no right to covenant favors nor honors, for themſelves or children.—No religious <hi>honors,</hi> that are obtained in any other way than by <hi>real</hi> religion, are much worth contending for. And in truth, it is no honor at all to a man, to have merely the outward <hi>badges</hi> of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, without <hi>being</hi> a chriſtian indeed. Any more than it would be an honor to a man, that has no <hi>learning,</hi> but is a mere dunce, to have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012984_0031_0F903E616FA12D20"/>a degree at college: or for a man who has no <hi>courage</hi> or <hi>valour,</hi> but is a grand coward, to have an honorable <hi>commiſſion</hi> in an army; which, by liſting him up, only ſerves to expoſe him to the deeper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſets him forth as the more notable object of contempt.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, The <hi>form</hi> is better than nothing; and better have our children baptized, if their parents can't make a profeſſion of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. For to deny them the <hi>outward mark,</hi> has a tendency to make them caſt off all reſtraints, and ſo in the end will tend to general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs and immorality—as they are denied any <hi>portion in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it may be anſwered, "That CHRIST is the beſt judge of the tendency of his own inſtitutions.—But it will be found, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that this is a very great miſtake; contrary to ſcripture, reaſon and experience.—Indeed, I acknowledge it would have ſuch a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, were they to be ſhut out from having <hi>any part in the Lord,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that the two tribes and a half were.—<hi>Joſh.</hi> xxii. 25. or to fence them out by ſuch a partition wall as formerly was between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> i e. to tell them, that if they were never ſo much <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to ſerve the Lord, he was not ready to accept them, according to that notion the <hi>Jews</hi> entertained of the uncircumciſed <hi>Gentiles.</hi>—But only for us to forbear giving them honors they have no title to, and not to compliment them with the name and <hi>badge</hi> of GOD's children, while they profeſs or pretend to nothing but what is conſiſtent with their being his <hi>enemies; this</hi> can have no ſuch tendency, as is complained of in the objection. But rather the <hi>contrary</hi> practice has very much this tendency. For it is found by conſtant experience, through all ages, that blind, corrupt mankind are ſtrongly diſpoſed to reſt in a <hi>name</hi> inſtead of the <hi>thing</hi>—in the <hi>form</hi> inſtead of the <hi>power;</hi> and to make themſelves eaſy in the <hi>former,</hi> in the neglect of the <hi>latter.</hi>"</p>
               <p>"This way of proceeding tends greatly to encreaſe the negligence of <hi>parents,</hi> and to confirm the ſtupidity and ſecurity of wicked chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               <p>"This way of proceeding tends greatly to eſtabliſh the <hi>ſtupidity</hi> and irreligion of <hi>children,</hi> as well as negligence of parents.

It would be but preſumption to expect that thoſe children, who are never really given up to God, nor brought up for him, ſhould prove religious and be God's children.

And for perſons to go about with the <hi>name</hi> and viſible <hi>ſeal</hi> of God, and the ſacred badge of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity upon them, having had their <hi>bodies,</hi> by a holy ordinance, conſecrated to God as his temples, yet living in irreligion and ways of wickedneſs, this tends exceedingly to harden them and eſtabliſh them in an habitual contempt of ſacred things.

               <p>Wherefore, the only <hi>effectual</hi> way to have the difficulty removed, and which, I conceive, is the only way which God himſelf points out is, for parents to renounce their unreaſonable prejudices and oppoſition to CHRIST and the goſpel, and yield a <hi>hearty compliance</hi> with, and conſent to the covenant of grace. This is their preſent

               <p>I Can't but obſerve that Mr. C. in the greater part of his eſſays, ſeems to have entirely loſt ſight of the queſtion which was firſt propoſed, and which is the ground of the debate. The queſtion, as he has rightly ſtated it in the beginning of his book, was, "Whether the half way practice of admitting perſons to own the covenant and have baptiſm for their children, <hi>without coming to the Lord's Supper,</hi> be warrantable by the word of God." Mr. C. undertook to prove
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012984_0035_0F903E6979092688"/>the <hi>affirmative.</hi> Had he done this, from the word of God, he would have eſtabliſhed his point, and I muſt and would have freely given it up. But the attentive reader will eaſily obſerve, that in a very little while after he had firſt ſtated th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> queſtion, he goes off, to endeavour to prove <hi>another point,</hi> viz. that perſons who are <hi>unregenerate,</hi> (if baptized) have a lawful right to bring <hi>their children</hi> to baptiſm; and that their coming, in ſuch circumſtances, (if outwardly regular,) would be <hi>leſs offenſive to God than the omiſſion would be.</hi> That it is not their being <hi>gracious</hi> perſons, that the church is to have reſpect to, in admitting them, but their being <hi>baptized,</hi> and ſo in viſible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant—and that this gives them the <hi>right,</hi> whether they are gracious or no. This appears from thoſe words of his, in the 2d page "Neither does CHRIST ſo much as intimate that they were <hi>gracious</hi>—thereby letting us know, that it is viſible memberſhip gives the <hi>right.</hi>" i. e. Such a memberſhip as a perſon may have, without any need of the ſuppoſition of his being <hi>truly gracious.</hi> For the drift of his whole argument is to prove that <hi>unregenerate</hi> perſons me <hi>compleat members</hi> of the church, (if baptized and regular) ſo as to give them a lawful right to ordinances. And he muſt mean a right in the <hi>ſight of God,</hi> as well as the church; for he ſays, p. 12. "From this we infer that it <hi>is not contrary to the mind of</hi> GOD, that the children of <hi>perſons unregenerate</hi> ſhould have this ordinance admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to God." And indeed, that this is a point Mr. C. holds, is evident not only from a multitude of paſſages all over his book, but from his appearing in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to my declared ſentiments in this matter. There would be no room or foundation for oppoſing me here, if he was not of the principle above. For I have always held that we have nothing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to judge <hi>hearts,</hi> or to inſiſt that they <hi>ſhall certainly be gracious,</hi> or elſe not be admitted; far from it; we may, and often are deceived no doubt. But if perſons <hi>profeſe</hi> to be real friends to Chriſt, and appear to be <hi>ſincere</hi> in what they profeſs, and their lives are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they are to be received, not only to Baptiſm, but to <hi>all</hi> the priviledges of viſible ſaints. Whereas Mr. C. ſuppoſes, according to his book, that it is lawful for <hi>graceleſs</hi> perſons <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to come to this ordinance, own the covenant, &amp;c. and that, there is no neceſſity of their <hi>being</hi> gracious, or <hi>profeſſing</hi> grace, in order to give them a right. Otherwiſe he could not ſay, "'Tis the <hi>will of God,</hi>" they ſhould come, provided they have been baptized; or that ſuch <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> is " only a <hi>prudential</hi> of the church."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012984_0036_0F903E69A6014750"/>
And yet ſtrangely, Mr. C. ſeems to hold, in many other places, <hi>that</hi> which is directly contradictory to this. As in p. 30, 65, &amp;c. of which, more hereafter. But it is evident from what has been obſerved, that Mr. C. has forſaken the <hi>original</hi> queſtion, which was—not whether <hi>unregenerate parents</hi> have a right to bring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but whether 'tis warrantable from ſcripture for perſons to <hi>own the covenant</hi> and be admitted to the priviledge of baptiſm for their children, (thereby treating them as viſible ſaints) while they <hi>neglect to attend the other ordinance.</hi> It was <hi>his</hi> going off from the point in controverſy, that obliged me, in the courſe of our debates at the church meetings, to anſwer ſome objections and bring ſundry argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of unregenerate men's partaking of covenant priviledges; for which Mr. C. has charged me with "<hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating</hi> the queſtion," p. 65. And tells me, with an air, rather ſuited to his <hi>magiſtratical</hi> than <hi>brotherly</hi> character, "Wherefore I deſire to hear no more about <hi>qualifications.</hi>" But if perſons will them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>ramble</hi> from the point, I know of no other way but to <hi>ramble</hi> after 'em. But I will now invite Mr. C. back again, and endeavour for a while to attend to the queſtion we ſet out upon; and conſider what he has ſaid upon it; and whether any arguments he has bro't, when weighed in the <hi>ballance of the ſanctuary,</hi> will appear of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient weight to eſtabliſh what he undertook to prove.</p>
               <p>His arguments ſeem to be chiefly founded on the parents being <hi>compleat members</hi> of the church, <hi>in good ſtanding.</hi> He owns that notwithſtanding their <hi>memberſhip</hi> by baptiſm, they may be guilty of that which <hi>diſqualifies</hi> them for enjoying baptiſm for their children. That by their unchriſtian conduct and behavior they may <hi>forfeit</hi> their right. He holds, in many places, that none have the right, but <hi>viſible chriſtians</hi> or <hi>believers,</hi> p. 70, &amp;c. that is, thoſe that <hi>profeſs</hi> and <hi>appear</hi> to be <hi>real</hi> chriſtians, <hi>true</hi> believers.</p>
               <p>Now it is granted that perſons baptized in infancy, are thereby initiated into the viſible church of Chriſt, and have a proper <hi>member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> in it; and as ſuch, have a <hi>viſible</hi> title to the ordinances and priviledges of ſuch, provided they behave like chriſtians and do not exclude themſelves by their unchriſtian conduct; or in other words, as long as they appear to act <hi>agreeable to the import of their baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal covenant engagements;</hi> or do not practically renounce them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. C. ſuggeſts, in his preface and elſewhere, that I had formerly <hi>allowed,</hi> but now <hi>denied</hi> the memberſhip of infants.

               <p>Thoſe words of our Lord in <hi>Math.</hi> xxviii. 20. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, in order to prove that <hi>baptized children</hi> are <hi>diſciples.</hi> 'Tis granted they are, and continue to be ſuch, as long as, or provided they come up to the character <hi>there deſcribed,</hi> and ſubmit to the injunctions and diſcipline which CHRIST in <hi>theſe very words</hi> appoints; (which Mr. C. has left out in quoting this text) viz. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve</hi> ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER <hi>I have commanded you.</hi> But what if they did <hi>not ſubmit</hi> to this, but refuſed to obſerve <hi>ſome</hi> important commands of Chriſt?

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ples</hi> of Chriſt, or viſible ſaints? Nay would they not hereby, have acted in direct oppoſition to it? Here we have the character of a <hi>viſible chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> drawn by CHRIST himſelf. To apply it therefore to the point in debate; we muſt either ſay, CHRIST has <hi>not commanded</hi> his diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to attend that holy ordinance of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> and confeſs him before men, or elſe aſſert, in direct contradiction to our Lords
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012984_0039_0F903E6BE86D9430"/>words, that a perſon may be a good <hi>diſciple,</hi> and ought to have the <hi>priviledges</hi> of ſuch, who lives in the conſtant, <hi>viſible neglect</hi> of a plain, expreſs command of Chriſt; and which he acknowledges ſuch. Surely he who teaches, that ſuch perſons are <hi>viſible friends</hi> to Chriſt, teaches <hi>for doctrine the commandments of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>John</hi> xv. 14. our Lord confirms the doctrine taught in the abovementioned text. He ſays, <hi>Ye are my</hi> FRIENDS <hi>if ye do</hi> WHAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOEVER <hi>I command you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, "This is the touchſtone, the <hi>teſt,</hi> (not only by which a man's <hi>real</hi> grace and ſincerity is to be determined, and whether he belongs to the <hi>inviſible</hi> church of Chriſt or not, but) by which you are to judge of <hi>viſible diſcipleſhip.</hi> This is the <hi>mark</hi> by which you are to ground your <hi>charity,</hi> in the admiſſion of perſons into my <hi>viſible</hi> church and kingdom. If any call themſelves my <hi>friends,</hi> and yet keep not my commands, whatever outward advantages, relation or profeſſion they may boaſt of, they are <hi>none of mine;</hi> neither have they any right to expect or enjoy the priviledges of <hi>my friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, by a <hi>viſible diſciple</hi> of Chriſt, is meant, one that profeſſes, and viſibly appears to be a <hi>lover</hi> of CHRIST. But our Lord ſays, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 15. "If ye <hi>love</hi> me, KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS." And verſe 21ſt. "He that hath my commandments and <hi>keepeth them,</hi> he it is that <hi>loveth</hi> me." 23d v. "If any man <hi>love me,</hi> he will <hi>keep my words.</hi>" Now, by what right can a perſon call himſelf a <hi>viſible</hi> chriſtian, or <hi>lover</hi> of Chriſt, and expect to be treated as ſuch by others—or how can any teach, that they are and ought to be looked upon as ſuch, and that they are abuſed if they have not the honors and <hi>priviledges</hi> of chriſtians, when they live openly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the violation of <hi>one</hi> of the moſt important of all CHRIST's inſtitutions and commands, without being guilty of oppoſing and contradicting CHRIST, in theſe expreſs and repeated declarations of his?—<hi>St. John</hi> ſaith, "He that ſaith <hi>I know</hi> him (or profeſſes diſcipleſhip to him) and <hi>keepeth not his commandments,</hi> is a <hi>liar</hi> and the truth is not in him." 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 4.</p>
               <p>Again; thoſe words of CHRIST in <hi>Luk.</hi> vi. 46. are directly againſt ſuch claims. "And why call ye me Lord, Lord, <hi>and do not the things which I ſay.</hi>" Why do you come with ſuch a vain pretence to be my diſciples; why do you pretend obedience and ſubjection to me, as if I was your <hi>Lord,</hi> and yet live in <hi>diſobedience</hi> to me. As long as you refuſe to obey me, your claim to <hi>viſible diſcipleſhip</hi> is good for nothing—neither have you any right to be treated as ſuch."
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012984_0040_0F903E6CB77CC5E0"/>Theſe words will forever ſtand as a bar againſt admitting perſons to the character and peculiar priviledges of <hi>viſible</hi> ſaints, who keep not the commandments and walk not in the inſtituted ordinances of JESUS CHRIST. But ſuch are <hi>they,</hi> who, after proper inſtruction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, refuſe to attend on the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> as they do herein <hi>openly</hi> diſobey CHRIST in a moſt important article which he has ſtrictly enjoined on <hi>all his diſciples;</hi> and by which they are to be <hi>viſibly</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the world.</p>
               <p>ONCE MORE, agreably to what has been ſaid above, CHRIST tells his diſciples plainly, who thoſe are, that are to be looked upon as his <hi>enemies,</hi> that have <hi>no love</hi> to him, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 24. "He that <hi>loveth me not keepeth not</hi> my ſayings." q. d. By this rule you may know whom you are not to receive or treat as my <hi>viſible friends,</hi> viz. them that <hi>will not keep my ſayings.</hi> Wherever you meet with one, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually of this character, know, that he has no right to the name or priviledges of my <hi>diſciples;</hi> neither ought he, or any one elſe, to think him wronged, that he is denied them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> expreſly declares, that thoſe who have been baptized in infancy, and <hi>owned the covenant,</hi> are bound to come up to the Lord's Table. This he ſays, not merely from his <hi>peculiar principles</hi> about the Sacrament, but founds his argument upon their <hi>covenanting.</hi> Therefore he adds, "'Tis a <hi>ſcandal</hi> if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hey do not, and the <hi>church may call them to an account for their neglect.</hi>"</note> Innumerable other texts might eaſily be adduced to the ſame purpoſe; but what have been mentioned, appear to me, abundantly ſufficient to determine this queſtion, beyond all reaſonable objection. And that if we will allow the New-Teſtament to be of divine authority, and the great head of the church to be a proper perſon to determine the point, we muſt conclude, that none ought to be look'd upon as <hi>viſible believers</hi> or chriſtians, or to be allowed their priviledges, who live in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, allowed neglect or violation of <hi>any</hi> of Chriſt's commands and inſtitutions. And therefore, if we allow the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to be an inſtituted ordinance of Chriſt, and a public <hi>confeſſing of him before men,</hi> to be a commanded duty to all his diſciples, then we muſt grant that thoſe who live in the habitual neglect of them, do not come up to the character CHRIST has given, and therefore have no right to the ſpecial priviledges of his <hi>diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None, I hope, will miſtake what I have ſaid, as if I ſuppoſed a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of religion and coming to the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> were enough to denominate a man a <hi>real chriſtian</hi> or true believer; or as if this was enough to ſatisfy a man's own conſcience, that he was in a ſafe ſtate.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012984_0041_0F903E6D5DB0E808"/>This would be a very dangerous doctrine. For thouſands, no doubt call Chriſt <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>eat and drink in his preſence,</hi> to whom he will ſay, "<hi>Depart,</hi> ye workers of iniquity, <hi>I know you not.</hi>" But what I intend is, that this is what <hi>we</hi> are to judge by. And that <hi>we</hi> have no right to call perſons <hi>viſible chriſtians,</hi> or grant them ſpecial priviledges but thoſe who do make ſuch external profeſſions and obey that poſſitive command of Chriſt, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is objected, that their neglect of the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, is not owing to any "contempt" of Chriſt's command; it ariſes from "<hi>ſcruples</hi> and tenderneſs of conſcience"—therefore we ought to bear with them and let them "come <hi>as far as they will go.</hi>" That is to ſay, we ſhould look upon them in good ſtanding, and treat them as very good diſciples of CHRIST, tho' they cannot ſee their way clear to walk in all his ordinances and obey his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In anſwer to this, I pray the following things may be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we find <hi>no warrant</hi> for ſuch a diſtinction or exception, in the word of God, let the plea for it be what it will. Is it not probable we ſhould have had ſome intimation of it from CHRIST or his Apoſtles, if there had been any <hi>reaſonable grounds</hi> for ſuch an excuſe for neglecting a plain inſtitution of Chriſt? Whence comes it to paſs, that we never find, in the New Teſtament, any account of diſciples excuſing themſelves from this command of Chriſt, from <hi>ſcruples of conſcience?</hi> I can't find that this was ever tho't to be a ſufficient ground, till ſince the Apoſtles days; perhaps not till within 200 years, for admitting perſons to the number and priviledges of <hi>diſciples,</hi> who lived in the neglect of that diſtinguiſhing command of Chriſt. Have we not reaſon then, to look upon this, not of divine approbation, but as an invention of men, to palliate, if not to excuſe perſons, in their diſobedience to the commands of Chriſt, while yet they may paſs for his diſciples and goods chriſtians?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what are theſe <hi>ſcruples of conſcience,</hi> which will ſuffer a perſon to engage in the moſt ſolemn tranſaction in the world, (as they do when they <hi>own the covenant</hi>) and yet will keep him back from the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> a plain inſtituted ordinance of Chriſt? Is there not reaſon to think, at leaſt in many inſtances, that theſe <hi>"ſcruples"</hi> are in reality, an inward conſciouſneſs that all is not right within; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of their unfitneſs for ſuch a covenant tranſaction? or that they are ſatisfied in themſelves, however the church may have charity for 'em, that they have no true love to JESUS CHRIST; that they
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012984_0042_0F903E6E31CB96D0"/>are in a ſtate of polluted nature.—Yet, ſince there is ſuch a practice in the church as <hi>owning the covenant</hi> without coming to the Lord's Supper, they will venture to comply with it, for the ſake of their <hi>children;</hi> hoping ſecretly, all the while, that it is not really the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace</hi> that they <hi>own;</hi> nor of the ſame nature, in point of obligation, with that covenant which perſons make, when they come up to <hi>full communion.</hi> Is there not great reaſon to fear this is truly the caſe with many, in thoſe places where this practice is upheld?—Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they do not <hi>ſcruple</hi> to do the <hi>greater,</hi> why ſhould they ſcruple to do the <hi>leſs?</hi> Their tender conſciences won't ſcruple to <hi>own the covenant,</hi> which is one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f the greateſt and moſt ſolemn tranſactions a perſon can perform on this ſide death and the eternal world. For he therein calls God, Angels and men to witneſs his vows and the dedication of himſelf to God, and engagements to be the Lord's, to walk in all his ways. I ſay his <hi>ſcruples</hi> don't terrify him from this—he can do this with a ſafe and eaſy conſcience; and yet he <hi>ſcruples</hi> to come to the Lord's table—i.e. ſcruples whether 'tis ſafe for him to fulfil what he has juſt before bound himſelf in covenant to perform. For our opponents ſay there is but <hi>one covenant;</hi> ſo that they who <hi>own the covenant</hi> are under the <hi>ſame</hi> obligations to walk in all <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> that thoſe are, who join in full communion. It may alſo be enquired,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why theſe fears and <hi>ſcruples</hi> don't operate as ſtrong to keep him away from <hi>one</hi> ordinance, as from the <hi>other,</hi> equally ſolemn and important; and to the right attendance on which, love to CHRIST is as much required? There is as much a profeſſion of love to CHRIST, and as much of a covenant tranſaction in a perſon's offering his child to God in <hi>baptiſm,</hi> as in his coming to the <hi>Lord's table.</hi> And if any parents think otherwiſe, they are greatly miſtaken. Therefore ſhould they perſiſt in pleading <hi>ſcruples of conſcience</hi> for neglecting the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, while yet they demand Baptiſm for their children, will not ſuch groſs <hi>inconſiſtence</hi> ſhew, either that they are too ignorant of the <hi>nature</hi> of Baptiſm and the import of it, to be admitted to baptiſm for their children, until better inſtructed; or elſe, that they do not act from any love to CHRIST in inſiſting upon it; but from ſome worldly views, ſuch as the honor and credit of it, or ſome other ſiniſter motive?

5. Let us for a moment turn the tables, and ſuppoſe a <hi>parent</hi> ſhould come, who had <hi>never been baptized</hi> himſelf, and ſhould deſire <hi>baptiſm</hi> for his child, and to be admitted to the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> himſelf. You tell him he can't be admitted to <hi>either,</hi> till he is <hi>himſelf baptized,</hi> He replies, he is afraid to come to that ordinance; <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> appears ſo ſolemn an ordinance, that he dare not venture; he <hi>ſcruples</hi> his fitneſs for it. Now muſt be he borne with, and admitted to the Lord's Supper under a notion that we ſhould let him come <hi>"as far as he can go,"</hi> and ſo bear with him as to baptiſm, till his <hi>ſcruples</hi> are removed?

               <p>I anſwer, it is a fact, that in the fourth century, about 330 years after CHRIST, in the reign of <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> people had much the ſame opinion about <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that many among us now have, about the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> They looked upon it ſo awful and ſacred an ordinance, that if they were not holy perſons, or fell into ſin after they had been <hi>baptized,</hi> their <hi>baptiſm</hi> would <hi>ſeal their damnation;</hi> therefore they dare not approach to that ordinance, but put it off till they were juſt going to die, that they might aſcend pure to the celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial regions.<note n="*" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I cannot but think, that if miniſters would be painful in declaring what is the truth in this matter, and determine no longer to ſubmit to a practice, which themſelves, many of them, acknowledge carries in it an inconſiſtency; and if churches would join in aboliſhing this unſcriptural <hi>practice,</hi> which has tended ſo much (I ſpeak from my own knowledge) to miſlead and bewilder honeſt, enquiring minds with reſpect to <hi>covenanting</hi> with God, there is no doubt but the prejudices and ſcruples of all honeſt, conſcientious perſons would ſoon be removed; and they would ſee that they might as <hi>ſafely</hi> come to the <hi>Lord's table</hi> as offer up a child to God in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> or it would be as difficult to perſwade them to come to the <hi>latter</hi> as the <hi>former.</hi>

What he has ſaid here, I apprehend may poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lead ſome into a miſtake.

I am ſure I could never ſee the leaſt hint of it in the <hi>new teſtament,</hi> but the cleareſt evidence to the contrary.

Tho' there are many churches who practice upon the plan, yet there are very few, that I have heard of (who have thought much of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) but will own there is a great impropriety and even inconſiſtency in making ſuch a diſtinction, tho' their ſentiments may be various with regard to qualifications.

This is not a little ſurpriſing. Need HE be told that all the Churches in New-England were firſt ſettled upon this plan? And that the Church, of which HE is a member, the oldeſt in New England, were on <hi>this plan</hi> for more than a hundred and ten years after their coming over; and that the <hi>innovation</hi> was made, not 42 years ago; and then that the difficulties were ſo great againſt it, that the Church was near ſeven years upon it, before it could be accompliſhed!—</note> But after ſome time, when the country en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and children that had been baptized grew up, and did not come to the Lord's table, tho' they had families, many were terrified at the thoughts of having a generation of unbaptized children; and therefore at a <hi>Synod</hi> called in the year 1662, among other things, the major part of the <hi>Synod</hi> came to an agreement to baptize the children of thoſe who ſolemnly renewed covenant and were looked upon as <hi>real</hi> chriſtians, having "juſtifying faith," (as one of the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly among them, expreſſed it) tho' on account of ſome darkneſs and fears, they did not ſee their way clear to come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the other ordinance. This was the <hi>Synod</hi> s plan; and this is what has been the occaſion, (tho' contrary to their deſign) of ſuch a melancholly proſtitution of that holy ordinance of Baptiſm, in ſo many places; where <hi>owning the covenant,</hi> is dwindled into a mere piece of formality, and perſons are allowed to bring their children to baptiſm, who don't ſo much as look upon themſelves to be real chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, true diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. That <hi>Synod,</hi> who were a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of godly and excellent men, no doubt, little thought this would be the conſequence of their agreement. It is evident that they had no notion of pleading the lawfulneſs of "unregenerate ſinners coming" to <hi>that,</hi> or either of the ordinances; or that they would "ſin more in ſtaying away than in coming." For Dr. <hi>I. Mather,</hi> who was at laſt, full in the <hi>Synod</hi>'s plan, has theſe remarkable words, "It is only a <hi>juſtifying faith</hi> which giveth right to baptiſm before God, ſo it is the profeſſion or <hi>viſibility</hi> of <hi>this faith</hi> which giveth right before
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012984_0047_0F903E7250A594D8"/>the church." And again, "If he doth not <hi>conſent with</hi> HIS HEART that this God ſhall be his God, he hath no right to Baptiſm." The reader may now judge whether Mr. C. has or has not warped off from the ſentiments and original deſign of the <hi>Synod,</hi> while he aſſerts the lawfulneſs of unregenerates coming to this ordinance, and that "we have <hi>no buſineſs</hi> to prevent their coming, becauſe the ordinance is often bleſt to thoſe in ſtate of unregeneracy."</p>

               <p>Mr. C. abundantly aſſert that baptized perſons are <hi>real</hi> members—<hi>compleat</hi> members of the church, in good ſtanding, &amp;c. and that they are viſible chriſtians, p. 27. and many other places. Yet in p. 29. he in effect calls them a "carnal generation," who would "ruſh into the church as the horſe to the battle," if they were not allowed to own the covenant and have their children baptized, without coming to the Lord's table. To ſay, that he only means <hi>ſcandalous</hi> perſons, by that <hi>carnal generation,</hi> would be but a mere evaſion. For none ever plead the lawfulneſs of <hi>ſuch</hi> coming to either ordinance. So that, it ſeems, thoſe who, in one breath, are called "viſible believers, <hi>diſciples,</hi> compleat members"—are in the next, "a carnal generation," and therefore beſt they ſhould be kept together by themſelves, by keeping up the <hi>half way</hi> practice, leaſt they ſhould, to get their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized, <hi>"ruſh in"</hi> among the communicants. And what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarkable, Mr. C. owns he ſhould be willing to receive theſe very perſons into communion.

Yea Mr. C. advances that, in his zeal for this practice, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all diſtinction between ſaints and ſinners, viſible chriſtians and ſcandalous perſons; and which gives the children of <hi>all,</hi> a right to baptiſm, independant of the character of their parents. So that there ſeems to be no neceſſity of their being ſo much as <hi>moral</hi> in order to have their children baptized. For he ſays, p. 19. "The children's memberſhip is a <hi>diſtinct thing</hi> from that of their parents;—and to puniſh <hi>them</hi> becauſe their <hi>parents</hi> do not immediately come to the Lord's table is <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>injurious.</hi>" i. e. (if there is any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or meaning in the expreſſions) As the memberſhip of <hi>children</hi> does not depend on the character or conduct of the <hi>parent,</hi> or <hi>his</hi> memberſhip, they ought to be baptized, let the <hi>parent</hi> be what he will. The <hi>child</hi> has a right to the ordinance, becauſe it has a compleat, <hi>diſtinct memberſhip</hi> of <hi>its own;</hi> therefore 'tis "hard and injurious to puniſh the child" by denying it baptiſm, becauſe the <hi>parent</hi> is of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>In p. 16 and 17, Mr. C. has a number of particulars, ſhewing in what reſpects baptiſm is a <hi>ſeal.</hi> And among other things ſays, "Baptiſm ſeals <hi>ſaving bleſſings</hi> to the <hi>unregenerate</hi> conditionally." 'Tis not eaſy to find out what he means by this expreſſion. If he means that thoſe who are baptized have this truth confirmed to them. that <hi>if they believe</hi> they ſhall <hi>be ſaved;</hi> 'tis no more than what all <hi>unbaptized</hi> perſons enjoy, who live under the goſpel and have their bibles. If he means, God has <hi>bound himſelf</hi> by <hi>covenant</hi> to beſtow ſaving bleſſings on thoſe that comply with the <hi>conditions</hi> of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; in this ſenſe, all mankind are in covenant with God. He may be ſaid to have <hi>bound himſelf to them</hi> ALL, <hi>conditionally,</hi> whether baptized or unbaptized, Jews, Deiſts or Mahometans, if they have heard of the goſpel. For the goſpel confirms and proclaims that truth to all the world, <hi>He that believeth ſhall he ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame kind of confuſion, it appears to me, there is in his idea or deſcription of a <hi>ſeal</hi> in p. 67, with which word, he ſays, "People are ſo continually <hi>dinned</hi> and <hi>drowned.</hi>" It certainly ſeems as if this, or ſomething elſe, has had this effect upon his mind, if we attend to his account of a <hi>ſeal</hi> in this place. He ſays firſt, "<hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>ſeal</hi> of the covenant of grace." And how does he prove this? why thus; or to this effect; becauſe true believers, when in the exerciſe of faith, ſay in prayer, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> (for none elſe can ſay it in the manner he there ſpeaks of) they ſet to their <hi>ſeal</hi> that God is <hi>their father.</hi> Therefore <hi>unregenerats</hi> men may <hi>ſeal</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:012984_0050_0F903E7A5FF9F190"/>the covenant of grace, becauſe 'tis lawful for ſuch to <hi>pray.</hi> For this is the drift of his argument here, as appears by his ſaying, a little after, "Muſt then all <hi>unregenerate</hi> men be debar'd from theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances?" He ſays further, "<hi>Hearing</hi> is a <hi>ſeal,</hi>" by this he means <hi>that</hi> hearing which the unregenerate are capable of; for he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, as an ordinance which none are to be "debar'd" from. And what is his proof of this? 'Tis in theſe words, "Becauſe when we <hi>heartily believe</hi> the truths delivered, we ſet to our <hi>ſeal</hi> that God is true," i. e. becauſe <hi>ſaving faith</hi> ſeals the truth of the goſpel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>hearing</hi> the word is a <hi>ſeal.</hi> Or becauſe true believers in <hi>hearing</hi> the word, <hi>

               <p>To the ſame purpoſe he adds, "<hi>reading</hi> is a ſeal," and to prove it, ſays, they that "<hi>apply</hi> the law or goſpel to their ſouls (this muſt be by faith) <hi>ſeal</hi> the truth of it." Therefore, the inference muſt be this, as the unregenerate ought not to be "debared" from <hi>reading;</hi> ſo they ought to be allowed <hi>baptiſm;</hi> as one is no more a <hi>ſeal</hi> than the other. If there be any weight in ſuch kind of reaſoning, it certainly proves that all ſorts of men, good and bad, even the moſt ſcandalous ſinners living, have a right to the ordinance of baptiſm. For none will deny that ſuch may lawfully <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us attend a little further to his manner of arguing in p. 18. He inſiſts, that if <hi>grace</hi> be neceſſary in order to perſons lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ordinances, then a perſon has no right to come, unleſs he has <hi>aſſurance,</hi> or <hi>knows</hi> he has grace. And if he has this, he ſays, in another place, <hi>what need he come at all.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. C. in various parts of his book, eſpecially in p. 10, ſeems to entertain very ſtrange notions about <hi>aſſurance:</hi> That perſons, as ſoon as they have arrived to a <hi>full aſſurance,</hi> are then come to a <hi>ſlop.</hi> As if the grand point, the <hi>main thing</hi> that God and man are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence he ſays, "if we have this (aſſurance) <hi>before</hi> we come, what need we come at all? at leaſt we need not come—to get our evidences and comforts ſtrengthened. "It appears to me, that by what Mr. C. has wrote upon <hi>aſſurance,</hi> in this performance, he has very <hi>low</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> conceptions of the nature and tendency of this precious grace: And that what he has advanced, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unfound, and really of dangerous tendency. Is it not evident from ſcripture, that the <hi>end and deſign</hi> of GOD, in beſtowing <hi>this grace</hi> upon believers, is to give a clearer manifeſtation of the glory of his perfections, particularly of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> in CHRIST, that the ſoul may, <hi>by beholding his glory,</hi> be more conformed to God, more quickened to duty, more than ever engaged in the love and ſervice of God, and in a conſtant, <hi>cheerful</hi> obedience to all his commandments and <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;</hi> in a word, that he may hereby be enlarged to <hi>run the way of God's commands;</hi> and better fitted for his attendance on <hi>all</hi> the duties of the chriſtian life? Surely the ſoul, when it has obtained ſuch precious manifeſtations—when GOD has given it an <hi>aſſurance</hi> of his love, is far, very far from thinking that at "<hi>need not come at all</hi> to the Lord's Supper;" or that it needs no further <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> or <hi>comfort.</hi> For the more the ſoul knows and enjoys of God, the more its <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities</hi> are enlarged, its <hi>love</hi> enſlamed, its <hi>deſires</hi> increaſed, and the perſon <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> both for duty and ſufferings. It is ſo far from thinking that it has "arrived at its full ſtrength" or growth, that it <hi>counts not itſelf to have</hi> yet <hi>apprehended.</hi> however <hi>full</hi> his aſſurance, or however <hi>high</hi> his attainments may be. Is there not a <hi>progreſſive</hi> knowledge of God, and conformity to him, both in the life of <hi>grace,</hi> and in the life of <hi>glory?</hi> and conſequently a <hi>progreſſion</hi> or advancement in ſpiritual "comforts" and in <hi>all the graces</hi> of the ſpirit?—Mr. Cotton, <hi>are thou a</hi> MASTER IN ISRAEL, <hi>and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi>

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012984_0051_0F903E7AD038D118"/>ſays he, hangs like a <hi>dead weight</hi> upon this opinion." And yet in p. 30, he holds that <hi>grace,</hi> "real grace" is neceſſary; and that no perſon has a right in the ſight of God, without it. Nay, what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appeared very ſtrange and inconſiſtent to me is, that it is well known to be Mr. C.'s <hi>profeſſed principle,</hi> that no perſon ſhould come to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> but thoſe that are <hi>converted.</hi> So that it is certain, this <hi>"dead weight"</hi> lies full as heavy on <hi>himſelf</hi> as on <hi>us.</hi> Let him tell how he gets from under it himſelf, and he will remove it from us.<note n="*" place="bottom">It has always been ſurprizing to me, that any ſhould boaſt of this as an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument againſt us; when, if it has any weight, it falls as heavy on <hi>every</hi> ſcheme, even their own, as on ours. For on <hi>every</hi> plan, ſome <hi>mental,</hi> inward qualifications are inſiſted on as neceſſary to give a right to ſealing ordinances. According to them, no perſon, therefore, muſt come to either ordinance, till he abſolutely <hi>knows,</hi> and is <hi>aſſured</hi> he has that qualification; let it be moral ſincerity, or whatever. But do they ever require this <hi>abſolute knowledge?</hi> If a perſon comes and tells them, that as far as he knows his own heart, after careful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, he <hi>thinks and believes he has</hi> that qualification; will they turn him away, becauſe he is not abſolutely <hi>certain</hi> he has it? They muſt do it, according to their argument. The truth of this matter undoubtedly is this. To <hi>confeſs</hi> Chriſt before men and come to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> is a <hi>commanded duty</hi> for every <hi>true diſciple</hi> of Chriſt, and none elſe; according to <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 19. To abſtain from this, if I am <hi>in heart</hi> a friend to Chriſt, is <hi>ſin.</hi> To do it in hypocriſy, is alſo <hi>ſin.</hi> Therefore in ſuch a caſe, a man's conſcience will lead him to act according to his prevailing judgment. He is obliged to do ſo. Mankind ever do thus, in all doubtful matters. The reaſon why there appears any weight at all in this objection, is doubtleſs this; Men are apt to conſider the Lord's Supper as a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> only, and not a <hi>Duty.</hi> If it were only a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> which I am allowed to take, upon certain <hi>qualifications</hi> in me; and forbidden, if I had <hi>not</hi> thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications; In ſuch a caſe, it would certainly be ſafeſt for me to abſtain, till I <hi>know</hi> I have the qualifications. But ſuppoſing I am ſtrictly <hi>commanded</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by God, to take, if I <hi>have</hi> thoſe qualifications; then it is equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to <hi>neglect</hi> on uncertainties as to <hi>take</hi> on uncertainties. The danger is equal both ways. If the queſtion were only what I have a <hi>right to,</hi> I might forbear till I am <hi>ſure;</hi> But the queſtion is, not only whether <hi>I</hi> have a right to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but whether <hi>God</hi> alſo has not a right to my attendance there. If I am a real d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea he goes on further and ſays, "It is a certain maxim of truth that if a man declares upon oath more than he <hi>knows,</hi> he is guilty of <hi>perjury,</hi> tho' it ſhould happen afterward to be true; if a man then publickly profeſſes that God is his God, and that he has <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> and does not <hi>know it</hi> to be ſo, tho' it ſhould appear afterwards to be the caſe, he ſolemnly, and as it were, upon oath declares that to be true, which he does not know but may be falſe, which is the very eſſence of a lie, conſequently there can be no covenanting with God upon this new ſcheme, without a certain knowledge of a man's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtate." P. 66. And yet in the <hi>ſame page</hi> he holds, that a perſon when he offers his child in baptiſm, muſt ſay, "that as far as he knows his own heart, he is <hi>ſincerely willing</hi> to give up himſelf and his children to God," which is as high a profeſſion as ever any in the <hi>new</hi> ſcheme (as he terms it) inſiſted upon in order to their coming to <hi>any</hi> ordinance. So that if the perſon profeſſing this, has no <hi>ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith,</hi> no "real grace" (which Mr. C. holds a neceſſary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the ſight of God) or if he <hi>has</hi> it and don't know it, he is, according to Mr. Cotton, guilty of <hi>perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it is abſolutely neceſſary, according to Mr. C's reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>forms</hi> of covenanting made uſe of all over the country, and formerly by himſelf, ſhould be all immediately aboliſhed, and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012984_0053_0F903E7C5E4DE770"/>ſome new one found out. For they all with one voice, according to Mr. C. conſpire to make men <hi>perjure</hi> themſelves; nay all that ever joined to a church, have already been guilty of downright "perjury and lying," unleſs they had full <hi>aſſurance</hi> that they were <hi>truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi> For they have ſolemnly as it were upon oath <hi>avouched the Lord for their God, and given themſelves up to him,</hi> &amp;c. when they did not <hi>know</hi> it was <hi>true,</hi> which Mr. C. ſays is the "very eſſence of a lie."</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, he ſays, p. 4. "They do not come with a <hi>lie</hi> in their mouths if they act conſcientiouſly, and if, as far as they know their own hearts, they are <hi>ſincere</hi> in what they profeſs." A direct contradiction to his account of <hi>perjury,</hi> juſt quoted. For according to what he ſays now, if they ſincerely believe, what they profeſs, to be true, they <hi>do not lie,</hi> whatever profeſſion they make; whether they have <hi>aſſurance</hi> or no. But it would be endleſs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Mr. C. in all the contradictions and inconſiſtencies, which he ſeems neceſſarily to run into, in vindicating his plan.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. ſtrenuouſly and repeatedly inſiſts, that <hi>Infant baptiſm</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be maintained upon the plan he is oppoſing, but muſt be given up. P. 2, 62. But this he aſſerts on a ſuppoſition entirely without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, viz. That we <hi>deny infant memberſhip:</hi> Which is a very great miſtake in him; (to call it no more) I never denied or tho't of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were made viſible members of the church, by that initiating ordinance. As I have before obſerved, all that I ever held, was that Baptiſm in infancy, did not ſo conſtitute them <hi>members,</hi> as that nothing elſe was neceſſary, when they grew up, in order to their being admitted to ſpecial ordinances; or that they might enjoy theſe priviledges, whether they made any profeſſion of faith in Chriſt and obedience to him or not, or walked in all his commandments or not. This I denied; and do ſtill.</p>
               <p>It might with great truth and juſtice be retorted, I apprehend, that the practice he is ſo fond of, tends to bring <hi>infant baptiſm</hi> into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and that it can never be vindicated on his plan. Infants are baptized, conſidered as <hi>parts of their believing parents,</hi> and as <hi>one</hi> with them, as Mr. C. owns, p. 13. The right to the external ſeal is argued from <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. where God promiſes to be <hi>a God to him and to his ſeed.</hi> Which the Apoſtle quotes, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 39. <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is unto you and to your children,</hi> i. e to you who are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> and have the <hi>faith of Abraham;</hi> and to your <hi>children,</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of yourſelves. For the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 29.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012984_0054_0F903E7D13EEFB48"/>"If ye be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, then are ye <hi>Abraham's ſeed</hi> and heirs according to the <hi>promiſe.</hi>" There are no promiſes made in the covenant of grace to <hi>unbelievers,</hi> or to their <hi>children.</hi> Whereas we may find promiſes all over the bible concerning the <hi>ſeed</hi> or <hi>children</hi> of believers. That God will bleſs their ſeed for <hi>their ſake.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxii. 2. <hi>The generation of the upright ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> So Pſ. ciii. 17, 18. Deut. vii. 9, &amp;c. And allowing theſe to be indefinite promiſes, yet they reſpect none but the ſeed of the <hi>righteous.</hi> Where do we find any ſuch promiſes to the ſeed of unſanctified men, the enemies of Chriſt and ſervants of Satan? The baptiſm of infants is the ſeal of <hi>theſe promiſes</hi> made to the ſeed of the faithful, or true believers. And on <hi>theſe</hi> principles, ſome rational as well as ſcriptural account may be given of <hi>infant baptiſm.</hi> But there can be none, upon Mr. C.'s ſcheme of the lawfulneſs of perſons coming to this ordinance tho' "really deſtitute of grace;" and that "their coming ſo, will be <hi>leſs offenſive</hi> to GOD, than the omiſſion would be." On <hi>this</hi> ſcheme, I may be bold to ſay, no warrant can be found in ſcripture, for <hi>infant baptiſm;</hi> tis a "mere nullity." For <hi>promiſes</hi> are the only warrant for <hi>priviledges.</hi> But there are no promiſes in the word of God to the <hi>ſeed</hi> of impenitent, unregenerate ſinners.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. indeed, in other places ſays, perſons muſt be <hi>viſible believers,</hi> in order to bring their children to baptiſm. But it has been ſhewn, I think clearly, that they are not ſo, according to CHRIST's deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>viſible diſciples</hi> or believers. And therefore the <hi>children</hi> of ſuch, can have no right to baptiſm, conſidered <hi>as</hi> children of believing parents. From what quarter then, do they derive their right?</p>
               <p>It might further, be well obſerved here, that pleading for <hi>lower</hi> qualifications for <hi>baptiſm</hi> than for the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> tends greatly to leſſen the ſolemnity and importance of that ordinance; and adminiſtring baptiſm in the latitude pleaded for, tends to reduce it to little more than a mere ceremony. And I verily think, there is nothing in the world has contributed more to prejudice many, <hi>againſt</hi> infant baptiſm, and to encreaſe the number of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> among us, than this <hi>half way practice,</hi> and the lax method of baptizing the children of any that come and own the covenant; tho', in many places, they are in no other reſpect diſtinguiſhed from the world.<note n="*" place="bottom">I would not be underſtood by this, or any thing elſe I have ſaid, to impeach the characters of any in <hi>this place</hi> who have <hi>owned the covenant</hi> ſince my acquaintance with them. It muſt be acknowledged they are, to all appearance, perſons of good characters and exemplary converſation, God alon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012984_0055_0F903E7DC82EF880"/>religious) ſtand up and make the moſt ſolemn vows and promiſes before God; and then view their lives and converſation afterwards, they are ſhocked. "How can this be right, <hi>ſay they?</hi>" Can it be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the word of God that the infants of <hi>ſuch</hi> parents ſhould be bro't to that holy ordinance? Can it be lawful for <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons to offer them up to God? Surely no. This can never be an inſtitution of God, or agreable to his will." And thus many ſerious people, are gradually led to give more and more into the <hi>Antipoedobaptiſts</hi> notions—This induces them to liſten to their teachers, who appear, many of them, to be men of real religion and zealous in the cauſe of God—who, by ſpecious gloſſes on various texts of ſcripture, eſtabliſh them in their prejudices againſt the baptizing of infants; till finally, they leave their former paſtors and principles, and become thorough proſelytes to <hi>anabaptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this ſection with obſerving, that Mr. C. in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>this practice,</hi> (as many others have done before him) has naturally, and I think, upon his plan, neceſſarily, warped off from <hi>Calviniſm</hi> and run into ſentiments, reſpecting man's <hi>natural depravity,</hi> exactly agreable to <hi>Arminian</hi> writers. Which he would not have done, undoubtedly, had he been aware of it. Whether my obſervation is juſt, I leave the reader to judge by what follows.</p>
               <p>He frequently repreſents <hi>natural</hi> men, as truly deſirous of avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord for their God; as <hi>ſincerely</hi> entering into covenant with God and giving up themſelves and their children to him in covenant. See p. 4, 66, 68, &amp;c. Not only ſo, but he repreſents the converſion of ſinners as owing, ſometimes at leaſt, to their <hi>not reſiſting</hi> the Spirit of God. For ſpeaking of the benefits of infant baptiſm, he ſays, "As for thoſe that grow up, it is a ſeal at leaſt that they ſhall not only have the offer of CHRIST, but the <hi>ſtrivings of his Spirit,</hi> which, <hi>if not reſiſted,</hi> will prove effectual to their converſion." p. 17. This, at leaſt, ſuppoſes, that in <hi>ſome</hi> inſtances, the Spirit of God is <hi>not reſiſted</hi> by ſuch perſons, and that this non-reſiſtance is the <hi>reaſon</hi> why his <hi>ſtrivings</hi> are effectual to their converſion. Is not this a plain, implicit denial of the doctrines of <hi>total depravity</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtible grace,</hi> which have been reckoned ſuch important doctrines of <hi>Calviniſm?</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012984_0056_0F903E7E866A1318"/>world to himſelf, that a ſinner <hi>did not reſiſt</hi> the Spirit of God; whether he had been baptized or not? And did not Mr. C. uſe to preach up ſuch doctrine formerly? What can he intend here then, by intimating that <hi>baptized unregenerates</hi> may ſometimes <hi>not reſiſt</hi> the Spirit of God, and ſo, by <hi>that means</hi> become converted? Is not this the plain ſenſe and ſcope of his argument in this place? If it be not, I am utterly at a loſs what ſenſe can be put upon it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, further to ſupport this ſentiment he has quoted the words of a writer, not the moſt noted for <hi>Calviniſm;</hi> in which, I would alſo obſerve, he eſpouſes the doctrine of <hi>promiſes</hi> of ſaving bleſſings to the <hi>unregenerate.</hi> For he quotes with approbation, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words from that author: "The Lord will as <hi>aſſuredly</hi> ingraſt us into Chriſt, and cloath us with his righteouſneſs, as we have the <hi>outward waſhing,</hi> IF <hi>we deprive not ourſelves thereof by our own careleſſneſs,</hi>" p. 17. The careleſſneſs here intended, muſt be the careleſſneſs of the unregenerate, which they may put off, and yet be <hi>unregenerate</hi> ſtill. Otherwiſe there is no ſenſe or meaning in the words. If, by putting off this <hi>careleſſneſs</hi> he means <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> or believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſalvation, none ever denied that <hi>ſuch</hi> would be "cloathed with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt"—and therefore this would be quoting the paſſage to no kind of purpoſe for the argument he has in hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. further ſuppoſes, that men while <hi>unregenerate</hi> do <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> to believe, repent and obey; in <hi>confidence</hi> of God's help and aſſiſtance. And that theſe <hi>endeavours</hi> are <hi>goſpel duties,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men <hi>diligently perform,</hi> p. 17, marg. "One end of this ordinance is to quicken our dulneſs, and excite our diligence in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming goſpel duties,</hi> viz. our endeavours to <hi>believe, repent,</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> in <hi>confidence</hi> of God's help and aſſiſtance." According to this, graceleſs perſons, (for he is ſpeaking of thoſe that are deſtitute of the "ſpiritual waſhing") do with diligence <hi>perform goſpel duties.</hi> And theſe evangelical duties are, <hi>"endeavours to believe;"</hi> to which endeavours, there are <hi>promiſes</hi> of aſſiſtance; for without this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there could be no ground of <hi>"confidence"</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>He has alſo plainly aſſerted p. 19, that in <hi>infants</hi> there is <hi>no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> or <hi>oppoſition</hi> to God's grace. Speaking of infants, he ſays, concerning moſt of them, "they have not the <hi>grace</hi> of the covenant, tho' there be <hi>no reſiſtance</hi> or <hi>oppoſition</hi> on their parts." This is to ſay, they are not depraved and have not original ſin, if our <hi>aſſembly of divines</hi> have given a right account of it. For they ſay expreſly, that "original corruption is that whereby we are MADE OPPOSITE to <hi>all good,</hi>" (Conf. of faith.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:012984_0057_0F903E7F648D6048"/>
May not Mr. C. with great propriety be adviſed to look round himſelf, and ſee into what company he is fallen, by attempting to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his ſcheme? Surely it is a bad cauſe that can be defended with no better weapons than theſe, and thus leads a man unawares, into the mire. It can be no great matter of ſurprize, if Mr. C. ſhould <hi>now</hi> meet with the approbation and <hi>applauſe</hi> of <hi>ſome,</hi> for his performance, whom <hi>once</hi> he did not eſteem the greateſt friends of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and of what <hi>he</hi> has called <hi>experimental</hi> religion.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to obſerve, that they who will <hi>conſiſtently</hi> hold the doctrine of man's <hi>total depravity</hi> by nature, and will adhere to the ſcripture account of the character and ſtate of unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as being <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> their carnal minds <hi>enmity againſt God</hi>—full of <hi>oppoſition</hi> in their hearts to all <hi>holineſs</hi>—as having no real <hi>deſires</hi> after it—but naturally <hi>oppoſing</hi> the Spirit of God; and as being <hi>voluntary</hi> in all this, and therefore entirely to blame, and wholly <hi>without excuſe</hi> in their continued impenitence and unbelief; ſuch, will naturally drop all notions of unregenerate men's <hi>ſincerely covenanting</hi> with God; and will be moſt likely to come into the true ſcriptural plan of <hi>infant baptiſm.</hi> While thoſe, who would be called <hi>half way Calviniſts,</hi> may oppoſe it zealouſly, and in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (without deſign perhaps) give up ſome of the moſt fundamental doctrines of <hi>Calviniſm.</hi> So that it will perhaps appear, at bottom, that the diſpute is, really, more about <hi>doctrines</hi> than <hi>diſcipline,</hi> and that if we were entirely agreed in the <hi>former,</hi> there would not be much difficulty as to the <hi>latter.</hi>

                  <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> Shewing wherein Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> has, in ſome inſtances, <hi>miſapprehended</hi> me, and in others <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> Things, both reſpecting me and the Brethren on the ſame ſide of the Queſtion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Cannot think it quite a fair way of proceeding, for Mr. C. ſo frequently to repreſent it as our opinion, that a man <hi>muſt know</hi> he is in a gracious ſtate—muſt have <hi>aſſurance</hi> that he is converted, before he <hi>preſume</hi> to come to theſe ordinances. 'Tis a doctrine we never held, but have over and over diſclaimed, in public and private. Neither does it follow that <hi>aſſurance</hi> is neceſſary, any more from <hi>our</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:012984_0058_0F903E8002D70530"/>principles than <hi>his own.</hi> And yet how often does he repreſent us as holding this opinion? P. 6, 7, 9, 10, 20, &amp;c. and indeed throughout a great part of his firſt eſſay, and in many other places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In p. 6. he plainly intimates that I "vehemently urge perſons to come into full communion." And p. 26. That I am for "obliging them to come immediately into full communion." As if I would merely force them in, whether willing or no. This is a very hard and unjuſt repreſentation. I appeal to all that have ever come to talk with me on that head, whether this has been my method, or any thing like it. The moſt that I have ever ſaid to them in theſe caſes, is, they if they found a heart to give up themſelves to God in Chriſt, as they profeſs to do in owning the covenant, I apprehended they might as lawfully and ſafely come to the Lord's Supper, as to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have good grounds to think Mr. C. is miſtaken in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation he has given of the manner in which this practice was firſt introduced into this church by Mr. <hi>Leonard,</hi> p. 26. The fact was this, my venerable Predeceſſor propoſed this plan to the church firſt, in <hi>July</hi> 1726. He gave his reaſons for it, which are upon record. But the church acted nothing upon it at this time. It is certain there was a great number of the church againſt the new propoſed plan; I have reaſon to think the bigger part. For the affair was in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before it was accompliſhed, near ſix years. In <hi>December</hi> 1731, there was a vote obtained for it; not by a unanimous voice, but (as the records ſay) by "a very <hi>conſiderable</hi> majority." And tho' there was a <hi>calm ſpirit,</hi> no bitter contentions at the meeting when it paſſed, yet there were ſome, and of the moſt reſpectable members too, who were againſt it to the laſt; and at the very time it was obtained, ſome "objected againſt it," as Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> himſelf has recorded. And there is now living an aged and worthy member, who was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and has told me it was matter of great grief to him and many others of the brethren; that they never could approve of the practice, and ſeveral he knew, bore it as their burden to their dying day.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. frequently charges me with making an <hi>innovation</hi> in the church—and repreſents me as to blame for endeavoring to bring in a <hi>new</hi> ſcheme, &amp;c. and intimates that the church were all very well contented with the former practice. In this he is certainly greatly miſtaken. It has been far from being agreable to the minds of all the church or congregation, for many years paſt. Numbers have told me, long before I ever mentioned the affair at the church meeting, that it always appeared a dark, unaccountable affair to them; that they
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012984_0059_0F903E86658CD2D0"/>never could ſee into the lawfulneſs or propriety of this half way practice, of perſons making ſuch a ſolemn profeſſion of religion, and never coming up to the Lord's table.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould I be charged with making an <hi>innovation</hi> in the church, any more than Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> before me? Mr. C. has never, that I know of, looked upon it as a crime in him, or that he diſturbed the peace of the church, by propoſing this practice; when indeed, it might with much greater propriety be called an <hi>innovation</hi> at that day; for it was a thing entirely unknown to the church, from their foundation to that time. Neither is there the leaſt appearance, but that the church were quite contended with the <hi>good old way</hi> they had always been in: And that the alteration entirely originated from their paſtor. (Not that I think he had no right to make the motion, as he was conſcientiouſly of that opinion.) Whereas my propoſal was, only to return back to the original plan of this church and of all the churches in New England, reſpecting Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. C. muſt have greatly miſapprehended me, in that he has repreſented me in p. 55. as holding that "the baptiſm of children, and of adults is quite of a <hi>different nature;</hi>" and that "adults, by baptiſm, were entitled to <hi>all</hi> the priviledges of the church, whereas infants were not." I have ſaid, and do ſtill hold, that Baptiſm <hi>alone,</hi> does entitle, neither <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ctice conformable to their baptiſmal vows and obligations. In ſhort this long ſtring of arguments in his <hi>laſt</hi> eſſay, ſeems to be founded entirely upon a miſtaken ſuppoſition that we had <hi>denied</hi> infant memberſhip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a ſenſe, in which we never thought of denying it.</p>
               <p>But he will object, perhaps, of what advantage then is infant-baptiſm? Thoſe that have <hi>never</hi> been baptized, have a right to all church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, upon their making a <hi>profeſſon</hi> of faith, and a <hi>practice</hi> agreeable. Anſ. This objection ſuppoſe either, 1. That unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons have a right to ſpecial ordinances, provided they have been baptized; which is directly repugnant to his declared ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, p. 30. Or 2dly. That baptiſm actually confers <hi>grace;</hi> and that it is a regenerating ordinance. Otherwiſe how can their baptiſm in infancy give them a lawful <hi>right,</hi> when he acknowledges none can have this <hi>right</hi> without "real grace?" Therefore inſiſting on this objection, is only running himſelf into a direct inconſiſtency. But I think there is a further, and eaſy anſwer to be given to the objection. The advantages of infant baptiſm are <hi>much every way.</hi> They are
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012984_0060_0F903E87E771FA08"/>hereby initiated into the <hi>viſible</hi> family or church of God; ſolemnly devoted to God by the believing parent, who lays himſelf under the moſt ſacred engagements to bring them up <hi>in the nurture and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Lord.</hi> They are hereby declared children of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant—<hi>viſible</hi> heirs of eternal life, by virtue of the believing parent's covenanting with God, in which covenant, the parent takes hold of that divine promiſe, "I will be a God to <hi>thee</hi> and to <hi>thy ſeed.</hi>" So that they are <hi>viſibly</hi> introduced among the <hi>ſaved,</hi> the <hi>holy people</hi> of God, and (as to <hi>men</hi>) have a <hi>viſible</hi> right to all covenant priviledges and ought to be admitted to them, when capable of them, unleſs by <hi>their own</hi> conduct they diſcover the contrary, and exclude themſelves by a manifeſt <hi>refuſing</hi> to own the God of their fathers for <hi>their</hi> God and to ſubject themſelves to Chriſt in all things according to the tenor of their baptiſmal covenant. They are, moreover, by their baptiſm, taken under the ſpecial <hi>watch</hi> and care of the <hi>church</hi>—entitled in a more peculiar manner to their <hi>prayers,</hi> as well as to the painful <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, admonition, care</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> of the <hi>parent;</hi> who is under <hi>covenant bonds</hi> to theſe things. Are all theſe a "mere nullity?" Is ſuch a child in no better condition, and under no more advantages than thoſe whom Mr. C. calls "<hi>Pagans, Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathens?</hi>" And if the <hi>diſcipline</hi> of our churches was not dwindled almoſt to nothing, if parents and charches were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>hildren, would they not then, be under any better advantages for their ſouls, than the <hi>unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</hi> And if when they grow up, and thro' the negligence and wicked careleſſneſs of their parents and other means, they appear not to have the fear and love of God in them, but live in the <hi>habitual neglect</hi> or violation of thoſe commands which Chriſt has enjoined on all his <hi>diſciples</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the world; I ſay, if this be the caſe with baptized perſons when grown up, muſt we be charged with "<hi>unchurching</hi> and <hi>excommunicating</hi> them" if we don't allow them the ſpecial priviledges of <hi>diſciples?</hi> And muſt we be repreſented as treating them like "dogs," and <hi>abuſing</hi> them, when they are denied theſe priviledges, merely on their <hi>own</hi> account, viz. becauſe they will not act up to the character and obligations laid upon them by their baptiſm? If they will only do this, and there be the viſible appearance of it to the church, we are ready, with all our hearts, to grant them this, and <hi>all</hi> priviledges. If they will not do this, the ſin lies, not at <hi>our,</hi> but at <hi>their own</hi> door. It would be unreaſonable, in the higheſt degree, to blame the church, or thoſe who are for not granting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012984_0061_0F903E8849A715A8"/>to perſons who do not come up to the character CHRIST <hi>himſelf</hi> has given, of thoſe unto whom ſuch priviledges belong.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What a new and ſurprizing expoſition has Mr. C. given of that text in <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>Turn O backſliding children for I am married unto you.</hi> P. 59, he ſays, "'Tis abundantly evident that this is ſpoken of <hi>unregenerates.</hi>" 'Tis the firſt time, I confeſs, that I ever heard ſuch a conſtruction put upon theſe words.</p>
               <p>Whoever will be at the pains to read the context, will ſee, that theſe words were ſpoken to a people <hi>in covenant</hi> with God; <hi>viſible believers,</hi> and in <hi>that character only;</hi> whatever their inward ſtate was. God ſpeaks, as to <hi>true ſaints,</hi> thoſe whom he had choſen and called, and had bro't <hi>near</hi> to himſelf. Therefore he is <hi>not aſhamed to be called their father.</hi> Hence he ſpeaks to them in that endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, <hi>verſe</hi> 4th. <hi>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me,</hi> MY FATHER, <hi>thou art the guide of my youth,</hi> &amp;c. Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this dear relation, and their obligations to God, they had ſhamefully backſliden from him. Wherefore, with the bowels of an affectionate huſband, with inexpreſſible tenderneſs, he calls to them in theſe words; enough to melt their hearts into tears of ſilial ſorrow and ſhame; <hi>Turn ye backſliding children, for I married unto you.</hi> God is ſpeaking to them here, evidently after the manner of men. Loth to give them up, notwithſtanding they had ungratefully depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gone out of the way, he is inviting them to return. They were in the caſe of a <hi>wiſe,</hi> who has forſaken her <hi>huſband,</hi> and gone after <hi>other lovers.</hi> Her huſband, inſtead of divorcing her, as he juſtly might, is uſing means to reclaim her; and kindly promiſes, upon her return, freely to forgive her, and to remember her iniquities no more. For he remembered <hi>the kindneſs of her youth and the love of her</hi> ESPOUSALS, and is willing to be <hi>pacified towards her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can it be wondered at then, that I ſhould endeavour (as Mr. C. tells his readers I did, ſoon after) to reſcue theſe words from, what I thought, ſo glaring and dangerous a miſapplication; eſpecially when it was delivered with ſo much confidence, and in ſo public a manner, to the people of my charge?</p>
               <p n="6">6. I come now to take notice of a very cruel inſtance of his <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation,</hi> in (p. 62) Where, (tho' he does not call me by name) yet he plainly intimates that I have ſpoken, with the moſt ſhocking contempt, of the ordinance of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> in thoſe words, "What ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies it to have an infant ſprinkled with a little water?" Any perſon by reading this ſentence, and obſerving the manner in which 'tis bro't
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012984_0062_0F903E89079F9960"/>in, would naturally think me guilty of that, which was not much ſhort of a <hi>blaſphemous</hi> aſſertion. And very juſtly too, had I ſpoken with that ridiculous contempt of a ſacred ordinance of Chriſt, as he there repreſents. For he has never given his readers any account of what was ſaid before or after the expreſſions he has put down. Mr. C. cannot but know that he has not herein acted, <hi>as he would that others ſhould do to him;</hi> but has greatly abuſed me. The utmoſt that <hi>charity</hi> itſelf can do, in excuſe for him, is, to ſuppoſe or hope that, in the great perturbation of his ſpirits, he did not attend to what I was ſpeaking of at the time I ſuppoſe he refers to. Let it be obſerved then, Mr. C. had then been inſiſting on the great priviledge of infants baptiſm; and had, as I tho't, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the matter too far; even ſo far, that people would be in danger of thinking that they were actually <hi>regenerated</hi> by baptiſm; and therefore all that were not baptized muſt conſequently be loſt. Moreover, inſiſted that <hi>all</hi> baptized perſons had a right to this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whether regenerate or not, if they were free from <hi>hereſy</hi> or <hi>ſcandal,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. In anſwer to which, I ſaid, to this effect,, "That the baptizing the infants of believing parents, tho' it made them <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> members, yet 'tis certain that many of theſe, when grown up, appear to be <hi>not real chriſtians.</hi> And it would be very dangerous to view them as ſuch. "For <hi>circumciſion</hi> availeth nothing, nor <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> but a <hi>new creature.</hi>" And as to baptizing the children of thoſe, who make no profeſſion of <hi>real</hi> religion, and appear to have no other qualification than only their having been <hi>baptized themſelves</hi> and free from open wickedneſs, I apprehended they had <hi>no ſcripture warrant</hi> for it. And if ſo, what <hi>right</hi> have we to baptize ſuch? What good will baptiſm do their children, if adminiſtered without a divine warrant? Of what advantage can it be to the ſouls of their children, barely to have the <hi>external waſhing, or water ſprinkled upon them?</hi> Will this <hi>ſave them?</hi> will it entitle them to any of the ſpecial priviledges of God's covenant? If not, why ſhould this matter be puſhed ſo vehemently, as if the <hi>ſalvation of their ſouls</hi> depended upon their having this <hi>outward ſign</hi> adminiſtered to them—and therefore they <hi>muſt</hi> be bro't, and the church <hi>muſt</hi> receive them, whether they have a lawful right according to Chriſt's rules or not." This was the ſubſtance and ſcope of what I ſaid in anſwer to Mr. C. at the meeting. I meant nothing more. How injurious therefore muſt it be, for Mr. C. to inſinuate, that I had caſt ſuch ſacrilegious <hi>contempt</hi> upon that holy ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, as he evidently
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012984_0063_0F903E89C6735630"/>does, by the <hi>manner</hi> in which he mentions the above paſſage. Such treatment is exceeding unkind; and none can think it ought to paſs without proper notice and reſentment.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Mr. C.'s fondneſs for adducing human teſtimonies in ſupport of his ſcheme, has led him to aſſert with confidence, a propoſition, which I am confident he will be put to ſome difficulty to prove—unleſs <hi>his</hi> aſſerting it ſhould be deemed ſufficient proof. The propoſition is this, p. 63, "This has been the <hi>univerſally</hi> received opinion of miniſters and churches, from Chriſt's time to this day; except Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Mr. <hi>Street</hi> and 2 or 3 others in the time of the <hi>Synod;</hi> and a few <hi>Connecticut</hi> miniſters, &amp;c. in our days." By "opinion" here, he can't intend, merely their opinion concerning the <hi>memberſhip of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;</hi> for thoſe miniſters whom he has ſtruck off from his liſt, never did deny, (that I have ever heard) <hi>infants being members;</hi> initiated by baptiſm. So that it muſt be concluded he means they were all of <hi>his opinion</hi> in this controverſy. Therefore the propoſition needs no comment. The judicious reader, who has had the leaſt acquaintance with eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, will form his own judgment, concerning the probability of the truth of the aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. in the ſame page, in his manner of ſumming up the matter, would induce his readers to imagine, the point I have diſputed for muſt be given up, upon <hi>my own conceſſion</hi>—(ſee bottom of p. 63)—his conſequence is, Therefore <hi>"it undeniably follows that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch as have been baptized, are to be baptized; and none can lawfully deny them this priviledge,</hi> UNLESS <hi>they have forfeited it by their wickedneſs."</hi> I allow it all—And what advantage has he got by the conceſſion? I humbly conceive, that inſtead of overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcheme I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh, he has implicitly, but effectually given up <hi>his own,</hi> unleſs he will deny it to be "wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" to live in the habitual and continued <hi>neglect</hi> of, and <hi>diſobedience</hi> to the expreſs <hi>command of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; which enjoins all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to openly acknowledge and <hi>confeſs him</hi> before the world, and <hi>walk in</hi> ALL <hi>his ordinances,</hi> upon pain of a juſt forfeiture of the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of his diſciples, or viſible chriſtians.</p>
               <p>What Mr. C. has ſaid, in his <hi>"challenge,"</hi> p. 64, concerning <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm</hi>—<hi>Atheiſm,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be judged of by the impartial reader. After what I have already remarked concerning the tendency of this practice, I am free to ſubmit it to the <hi>Calviniſtick</hi> world to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be ſupported, without running a perſon directly into <hi>Arminian</hi> ſentiments, reſpecting the great and peculiar doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012984_0064_0F903E8AAC837648"/>mentioned. But why he brings in the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> in this argument, I can't deviſe; nor the pertinency of it to what he would prove. I confeſs I don't ſee why he might not have bro't any verſe in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> or <hi>Exodus,</hi> and it had been about as much to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as this. Beſure I think he has exhibited a remarkable talent at argumentation in this page. Becauſe I ſuppoſed, that <hi>this plan,</hi> in its neceſſary conſequences, tended to ſupport ſome of the <hi>Arminian</hi> tenets, <hi>therefore,</hi> I am accuſed of charging Mr. <hi>Leonard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>James</hi> and myſelf, with being direct <hi>Arminians.</hi> Pray may'nt a perſon hold to ſome things, which in their <hi>conſequences,</hi> involve a denial of or giving up ſome <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> doctrines, without being juſtly called an <hi>Arminian?</hi> And when, if he ſaw theſe to be the neceſſary conſequences of his principle, he would immediately renounce it?—In no other ſenſe then this, did I ever charge Mr. C. with being an <hi>Arminian</hi>—And I have repeatedly told him, that I did not think him an <hi>Arminian,</hi> but the contrary; as I believed he was not aware of, what appeared to me, the unavoidable conſequence of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon <hi>this practice.</hi> And yet Mr. C.'s repreſentation of this matter is ſuch, as muſt neceſſarily lead his readers to think, I had ſet him forth to my people (as he expreſſes it elſewhere) as "a <hi>ſoul-deſtroying Arminian</hi> and deceiver, unfit ever to preach any more;" and that I did this, with no other deſign, neither, than to "throw out a <hi>bugbear</hi> and <hi>ſcarecrow,</hi> to prevent people liſtening to his arguments." Is there no <hi>"conſeriouſneſs"</hi> or <hi>"uncharitableneſs"</hi> in this? I would aſk Mr. C. whether he thinks I might not, with ſome propriety here, exclaim in <hi>his own language,</hi> and ſay—He repreſents me "as merely acting a part—that all was grimace and farce—that my diſcourſe was calculated to impoſe on the auditory—to make them believe what I <hi>knew</hi> was not true—Lawyerlike, uſing craft inſtead of argument"—by trying to make them believe he was an <hi>Arminian,</hi> when I <hi>knew</hi> he was not, but only meant it for a <hi>"ſcarecrow."</hi> To the ſame purpoſe, Mr. C. often ſpeaks of my "management"—as if twas all a piece of art and tricking. And of my inſiſting upon <hi>grace</hi> in this diſpute only out of "pretence," p. 29, 65, &amp;c. Why might I not, upon this, with equal reaſon, cry out, as he has done,—that he has charged me with <hi>diſſembling with my brethren,</hi> and made me a "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, finiſhed <hi>hypocrite.</hi>" And then add—"What aſſuming the prerogative of God—the <hi>rankeſt ſeperate</hi> never exceeded you in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs"—then appeal to the world whether my treatment of him does not reſemble the "<hi>ſcratch</hi> of a pin"—and his—"the <hi>ſtab</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:012984_0065_0F903E8B47304948"/>of a dagger thro' the vitals?" There is one obſervation, which many have made, during our debates here—and which could hardly eſcape the notice of thoſe who have been acquainted with Mr. C.'s manner of conduct thro' this affair—that is, <hi>'Tis the nature of ſome people to be of</hi> VERY QUICK SENSATION, <hi>when injuries are done to</hi> THEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELVES—<hi>while at the ſame time, they are perfectly</hi> CALLOUS <hi>and inſenſible to the injuries</hi> THEY do to OTHERS.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is one inſtance more, wherein Mr. C. has exceedingly miſrepreſented our ſentiments; which is all I ſhall particularly remark upon at this time: 'tis in p. 65. where he expreſsly aſſerts that <hi>we</hi> inſiſt "upon the <hi>higheſt ſort</hi> of evidence of grace, as neceſſary" in order to a perſon's enjoying ordinances, &amp;c. What colour of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he had for this aſſertion, I cannot conceive; when it is directly againſt my repeatedly declared ſentiments; and I have reaſon to think, againſt the ſentiments of every member of the church on this ſide the queſtion. I have publickly, in all our <hi>church meetings</hi> declared the contrary, viz. That the very <hi>leaſt degree</hi> of grace intitled a perſon to <hi>all</hi> the priviledges of the covenant, in the ſight of God—and as to the <hi>church,</hi> that where a candidate exhibited the <hi>loweſt rational evidence</hi> of it, or ſuch an outward manifeſtation as rendered it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, on ſcripture grounds, that they were <hi>ſincere friends</hi> to religion, they ought to be admitted. I never was for ſtraining things, in the manner Mr. C. repreſents. I never tho't a church ſhould inſiſt on the "<hi>higheſt ſort</hi> of evidence" in this caſe. Indeed, I never tho't it was ſcriptural to admit them upon "<hi>negative</hi> evidence," or no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all, 'tis true. I can't ſuppoſe it <hi>any</hi> evidence at all of a perſon's being gracious, merely that he is <hi>not</hi> a drunkard—<hi>nor</hi> a thief—<hi>nor</hi> a murderer—<hi>nor</hi> an adulterer, &amp;c. Theſe are, indeed, an <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that a man is <hi>not</hi> an open <hi>ſcandalous ſinner</hi>—but are no proper evidence that he is a <hi>ſaint;</hi> or upon which, the ſcriptures will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſuch a preſumption of it, as will make it lawful for us to treat them as ſuch.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION VII.</hi> On the Subject of the <hi>Letters,</hi> &amp;c. and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Remarks upon them.</head>
               <p>I Think there is juſt cauſe for ſome apology to be made to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, eſpecially to choſe who are unacquainted with the peculiar circumſtances of affairs in this place, for troubling them with matters which are merely <hi>perſonal,</hi> between Mr. C. and myſelf. A ſtranger may well ſay, "what have we to do with theſe <hi>letters?</hi>" The <hi>queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in debate is of public importance, 'tis true.—But what concern have the <hi>publick,</hi> with <hi>private letters;</hi> which relate to ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between two perſons at Plymouth? How came theſe <hi>letters</hi> to be pala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed upon the world, along with the <hi>arguments?</hi>" This has been the enquiry and ſurprize of many. And I can make no other anſwer to the queſtion for the reader's ſatisfaction, than that they were publiſhed entirely without my knowledge or conſent. He never ſo much as aſked whether I was <hi>willing</hi> my letters ſhould be printed with the eſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ys: or even hinted to me that he had it in view—nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever <hi>ſuſpect</hi> they would be publiſhed to the world, any more than my yeſterday's converſation, till after they were gone to the preſs. But, contrary to all the rules of politeneſs, humanity or chriſtianity, he has made them as publick as he could, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to aſk my leave. The world will judge whether ſuch conduct is juſtifiable, or whether it is not <hi>below</hi> the character of a man of benevolence and uprightneſs. This alone is that which has conſtrained me to trouble the reader with this ſection on the <hi>letters.</hi> Mr. C. has, I am informed, endeavoured to excuſe this part of his conduct to ſome, by ſaying, 1ſt. That I had read or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>his letter</hi> to many perſons before—and that people had wrong notions about it; therefore 'twas neceſſary he ſhould publiſh <hi>all,</hi> to vindicate his character. As to this—I can ſay truly, that altho' theſe <hi>letters</hi> were ſoon handed about, and the ſubject of them in almoſt every one's mouth; yet it was not thro' <hi>my</hi> means, but <hi>his own.</hi> I never ſhewed them to four perſons in the world, till I had heard he had given off <hi>copies</hi> of them to perſons, who, I am told, made it their buſineſs to propagate them thro' the town and to various parts of the county. And I have no doubt of the truth of it, from ſome curious remarks and ſpeeches which, 'tis ſaid, were made by ſome of his—acquaintance at a diſtance, in conſequence hereof. So that, if theſe letters were made, in a meaſure, <hi>publick,</hi> before they were printed, it
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012984_0067_0F903E8CC6340B10"/>was owing to himſelf and not to me. But 2dly. Another method Mr. C. has taken, I have been informed, is, by endeavouring to prove <hi>that they were not private letters.</hi> Becauſe I had given <hi>this</hi> as a reaſon of my writing to him at firſt, viz. "That I had not time to make a reply to his 3d eſſay, in publick, at the church meeting." Whence he argues, that <hi>my letter</hi> is to be looked upon, as tho' it had been ſpoken or read at the meeting before the whole aſſembly—not as a private letter, but as a publick anſwer to his eſſay, which he had been reading in public. Well, ſuppoſing it had been ſo, does that give him a right to <hi>print it</hi> without my knowledge or conſent? If a miniſter ſhould preach a <hi>Sermon,</hi> (which is a thing of a more publick nature ſtill) and a perſon ſhould be able to take it all down in writing, ſo that he is poſſeſſed of the whole, as it was delivered; has he, even in this caſe any right to go and publiſh it, without the preacher's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? When we preach, or when we write letters, we ſhould be glad to know, and perhaps be conſulted, if they are like to be ſent <hi>to the preſs,</hi> aſſoon as they are out of our hands. So that I can conceive of no plea in the world that can juſtify Mr. C.'s conduct, in the freedom he has taken to <hi>print my letters,</hi> unknown to me. I am willing to leave it to the whole impartial world, whether it be chriſtian, or manly treatment: or doing as they would be done by.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>contents</hi> of my firſt leter to Mr. C. it contained my real ſentiments upon his manner of conduct and the things he had advanced. And I have never yet met with any juſt cauſe to <hi>alter</hi> my ſentiments upon them. After ſtating a few facts, I ſhall leave it to the reader's judgment, whether I was wrong, in writing what I did.</p>
               <p>The grounds and reaſons of my writing to him were theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. His having delivered ſeveral things which I really tho't of very <hi>dangerous tendency,</hi> before a large number of the people of my miniſterial charge.</item>
                     <item>2. His having groſsly <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> us.</item>
                     <item>3. Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>undue</hi> and <hi>unfair methods</hi> to ſupport his ſcheme, and prejudice the brethren and others againſt our ſentiments.</item>
                  </list>
—Theſe were the real grounds of my letter. I thought it was my duty, in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to do as I did. If I was miſtaken, it was an error of <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not of <hi>will.</hi> And truly if I had had a thought beforehand that it would have had ſuch an effect on him, and cauſed him to put ſuch a conſtruction upon it, as he had done, ſo different from what I ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or tho't of—and to rave at me with ſuch vehemence of ſpirit, as he has done in that <hi>remarkable poſtſcript</hi> to his firſt letter—I ſhould not have wrote at all to him, but have taken ſome other method. For
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012984_0068_0F903E8D8C6ADD10"/>notwithſtanding his intimations to the contrary, I had no deſign in my heart, or deſire to "pick a quarrel with him."—</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt</hi> ground or reaſon of my writing to him, was, his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered ſeveral things, which I looked upon of very <hi>dangerous tendency;</hi> ſuch as theſe. His teaching that it was lawful or ſafe for <hi>unregenerate</hi> men to <hi>covenant</hi> with God. That all who have ever been baptized, are <hi>viſible chriſtians</hi>—that is, are to be looked upon as <hi>believers,</hi> if they are but free from open <hi>profaneſs</hi> and <hi>ſcandal.</hi> P. 27, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such doctrine, is directly contrary to what I have always taught my people. I look upon it as <hi>ſewing pillows under armholes</hi>—that it has a natural tendency to <hi>quiet</hi> ſinners in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy—and flatter them with vain hopes that their ſtate is ſafe, when it is really infinitely dangerous. Whether it has not this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, let thoſe judge, who experimentally know the deceitfulneſs of the human heart, and how extremely prone ſinners are to reſt in any thing ſhort of CHRIST, and to flatter themſelves in their deluſions.</p>
               <p>Moreover, his applying the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God to thoſe that never made any <hi>pretence</hi> to, or <hi>profeſſion</hi> of ſaving religion or faith in Chriſt: As he has evidently done in that <hi>text,</hi> p. 29, <hi>"God ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to your joy."</hi> Not, of thoſe who have given their <hi>names</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> to Chriſt. He was not ſpeaking to ſuch; but to the <hi>baptized</hi> only, who had never made any publick profeſſion of religion, or ſo much as <hi>renewed their baptiſmal covenant.</hi>—Now had I not reaſon to ſay, (when I heard ſuch things delivered, ſo publickly, which were ſo <hi>contrary</hi> to what I had ever inſtructed this people into) that they were of <hi>dangerous tendency,</hi> and in my view, deſtructive of ſome of the great truths of the goſpel and of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and tended to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the contrary doctrines?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing mentioned, as the ground of my writing to Mr. C. and which I charged him with, was, that he had <hi>miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi> us. Of this alſo, let the readers judge, not only from what has been already obſerved, in the 6th Section—but from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,—he repreſents p. 26, as if I was for "<hi>obliging</hi> perſons to come <hi>immediately</hi> into full communion" contrary to my ſentiments and univerſal practice, ever ſince I have been ordained as before obſerved. In p. 30, he ſays, "Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> owns 'tis a matter of <hi>indifferency</hi>" whether perſons make <hi>relations</hi> or not; and "that a church may be rightly conſtituted without." And in another place he ſays, I have "<hi>ſpoken ſlightingly</hi> of them." This is a groſs and injurious miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation; without all foundation. All that I have ever ſaid, was, that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012984_0069_0F903E8E7A605600"/>I tho't <hi>relations</hi> ought not to be made <hi>eſſential terms of communion,</hi> for if ſo, we condemn ourſelves and act contradictorily; as we admit thoſe from <hi>other churches,</hi> to our communion, who have never made any <hi>relations.</hi> As to a church's being "rightly conſtituted" with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, I truſt Mr. C. would not care to expoſe himſelf to the charge of ignorance of the nature of a church, ſo much, as to aſſert, that <hi>relations</hi> are abſolutely neceſſary to the very <hi>"conſtitution"</hi> of a church; ſo that they are not to be looked upon as <hi>"right"</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular churches, who don't inſiſt on them.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of this kind, is in p. 32, where he repreſented, as if we held that perſons muſt not bring their children, unleſs they have a certain knowledge or <hi>aſſurance</hi> of their gracious ſtate. That "our plan ſuppoſes it <hi>neceſſary.</hi>" This is not a little unkind in Mr. C. when we had publickly and conſtantly declared directly the contrary all along. What could be the deſign of ſuch a repreſentation, if it was not to prejudice the brethren againſt our ſentiments? And had I not juſt ground, therefore, to ſay, that "he muſt <hi>certainly know,</hi> we held no ſuch thing?" For he muſt have heard me frequently declare againſt it, as I had done at all our meetings. If the expreſſion is tho't, by any, to carry the matter too far, I am willing to ſay, inſtead of it, that Mr. C. had <hi>good reaſon and ſufficient opportunity to know</hi> the contrary. For I can't abſolutely be <hi>certain,</hi> but that he might have turned his face and attention another way, every time I had declared my ſentiment as above.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. repreſents as tho' I was for <hi>driving the matter on with violence.</hi> I have nothing more to ſay upon this, than only, that they who were preſent at our meetings, are the beſt judges, who appeared with moſt <hi>violence</hi> and temper.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt thing mentioned, as the reaſon of my writing the <hi>letter</hi> aforeſaid, was the <hi>unfair methods</hi> he took, working upon people's <hi>paſſions,</hi> inſtead of reaſon, in order to eſtabliſh the point in queſtion. Of which I ſhall give a few inſtances, and ſubmit it.</p>
               <p>In p. 29, he repreſents to the brethren, as if we were going to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> their children—to <hi>unchurch</hi> them, and make <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> of 'em. Surely this muſt appear a terrible thing to a <hi>parent</hi> that has any love to his <hi>child.</hi> The thought is enough to <hi>frighten</hi> him from being of <hi>our opinion;</hi> if we are ſuch cruel, unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſort of people. But what does he ground this upon? Why truly <hi>this.</hi> Becauſe we hold, that if perſons do not <hi>own Chriſt before men,</hi> and walk in <hi>all</hi> his commandments and ordinances, they ought not to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012984_0070_0F903E8F0C88C550"/>be admitted to the <hi>priviledges</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>viſible diſciples.</hi> This in all the <hi>unchurching</hi> them, that we are guilty of. And for <hi>this,</hi> we are charged with <hi>excommunicating</hi>—making them <hi>Pagans</hi> and creating them as "dogs and not lambs."</p>
               <p>But this is not all—As if he was determined to prevent the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from daring to <hi>"hold up their hands"</hi> to vote to repeal the practice, he ſignifies to them, that they would hereby <hi>deliver their children over to Satan.</hi> For theſe are his very words, p. 29.— "Your children are no doubt dear to you, and—will you, with your own hands lifted up to heaven, <hi>deliver them to Satan?</hi>" Dreadful thought! What parent, in his wits, would do this? And yet this is what you will do, brethren, if you vote with Mr. R. and his brethren. Is not this the plain import of the ſentence? And can this be called a <hi>fair,</hi> upright way of managing a cauſe? Is ſuch a method, <hi>generous,</hi> in a diſputant? If this is not "appealing to men's <hi>paſſions</hi>" inſtead of their reaſon and judgment, I acknowledge I know not what is.</p>
               <p>But we have ſtill more of the ſame kind, in the ſame page. "If they muſt be <hi>diſcovenanted,</hi> I can't help turning myſelf to them"— (and then he turned round and looked up to the galleries, full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and with great <hi>Pathos</hi> addreſſed thoſe that were <hi>baptized</hi> in their infancy, in theſe words) <hi>Iſai.</hi> lxvi. 5. Your brethren that caſt you out [pointing to me] for my name ſake, ſaid, let the Lord be glorified—(i. e. as he explains it in the next line but one, <hi>they</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEND <hi>they are aiming at the glory of God</hi>—this is only a <hi>"pretence."</hi>)—<hi>But he ſhall appear to</hi> YOUR <hi>joy, but</hi> THEY <hi>ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> i. e. Your miniſter and thoſe of the church that think as he does; for he directed himſelf to us, in theſe laſt words. Now whoever will be at the pains to turn to this chapter, will immediately ſee, that in theſe words is contained, a terrible <hi>threatning</hi> or <hi>curſe,</hi> on the one hand; and a precious <hi>promiſe,</hi> on the other. On the one hand, God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> to the <hi>enemies</hi> of his people—on the other, he <hi>promiſes</hi> JOY and confort and ſalvation to his <hi>children.</hi> And this was the <hi>text</hi> Mr. C. made uſe of, in the <hi>manner</hi> above deſcribed: <hi>Applying</hi> and directing the <hi>promiſe</hi> of it, to the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> i. e. to thoſe who never made any pretence or <hi>profeſſion</hi> of grace—and the <hi>curſe</hi> or threatning of it, to <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>thoſe of the church</hi> that were with me in ſentiment. Let the reader then judge, whether I had not good reaſon to ſay, that he <hi>wreſted</hi> or <hi>miſapplied</hi> ſcripture, to a <hi>bad purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leaſt the brethren ſhould not be ſufficiently terrified from vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the <hi>practice;</hi> he has a <hi>finiſhing ſtroke,</hi> in p. 32, which is,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012984_0071_0F903E94375A6900"/>that they muſt not preſume to vote, unleſ they "can ſay upon their <hi>conſciences,</hi> that the practice <hi>ſprung from</hi> HELL."—<hi>Such</hi> was Mr. C.'s manner of treating this affair, at the church meeting. And all the while, appeared to be in as great heat and vehemence of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as I ever ſaw a man, on any ſuch like occaſion, in my life. This was not barely my own, but the obſervation of multitudes that heard and ſaw him. Theſe are facts, which ſhould never have been made more publick by me, had not Mr. C. really <hi>obliged</hi> me to it, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate myſelf from thoſe <hi>charges</hi> which he has thrown out againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in his <hi>bitter remarks</hi> upon the <hi>letters;</hi> which have made it <hi>neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> that I ſhould thus let the world know the <hi>particular reaſons</hi> of my conduct, eſpecially in writing that <hi>letter,</hi> which he has endeavoured to repreſent to his readers, in ſuch terrible colours.</p>
               <p>And now I beg the reader's patience, while we take a view of the ANSWER Mr. C. returned to my letter, and his conduct thereupon. There are a great variety of things ſuggeſted in <hi>his letter,</hi> which have no juſt foundation. 'Tis intimated particularly, here and elſewhere by him, that I had turned away, or <hi>refuſed</hi> perſons who came to me to deſire to <hi>own the covenant.</hi> He inſtances in <hi>one perſon,</hi> by name, towards the beginning of his letter—but without <hi>his</hi> knowledge, I am well aſſured. And who he had his information from, I am not able to ſay. For that perſon, (who is a man of an unexceptionable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſo far as I know, or have ever heard) has told me ſince, that he never had told any perſon whatever, that I had <hi>refuſed</hi> him; neither did he even look upon it that I had <hi>denied him,</hi> any more than I had denied the <hi>whole congregation.</hi> He has indeed frequently diſcourſed with me on the affair in debate, as many others have—and has wiſhed that it might be peaceably ſettled—and if ſo, that he ſhould be glad to enjoy the priviledge of <hi>baptiſm</hi> for his children. But as Mr. C. has repreſented the matter, there is not the leaſt foundation for it; as the perſon himſelf will willingly declare, (as he has told me) to any one's ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. has alſo, in <hi>this letter,</hi> given a very wrong turn to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of mine, concerning <hi>the moſt godly among us,</hi> being on our ſide the queſtion. It will appear, I think, to every one who will attend to the <hi>whole</hi> of what I ſaid there, that I had a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> reference to <hi>thoſe</hi> in the church, who cannot <hi>act</hi> in the affair. (See poſtſcript of my firſt letter.) But if any ſhould think, my <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of expreſſion conveys an idea of <hi>judging</hi> or <hi>condemning</hi> any of the church; or a <hi>publick</hi> preferring one before another, who are
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012984_0072_0F903E9585F57B70"/>profeſſed chriſtians—I neither intended nor allow of any ſuch thing; nor do I think it juſtifiable, whatever our <hi>private</hi> judgment may be.</p>
               <p>I don't know what reaſon Mr. C. had to inſinuate that I am "not enough <hi>acquainted</hi> with my people to judge who are <hi>experienced,</hi> good chriſtians and who are not." If it be ſo, I truſt he won't ſay, he aſſerts this from <hi>his own</hi> knowledge or acquaintance with them. Neither do I think he would have uttered ſuch a ſentence, if he had felt <hi>good natured,</hi> or of a chriſtian temper.</p>
               <p>As to what he has ſaid reſpecting the <hi>women</hi> of the church—it has been hinted to me, that ſome have underſtood his expreſſions, as if he <hi>deſigned</hi> to caſt ſome reflection or <hi>odium</hi> upon my character—If that <hi>was</hi> his deſign, I have a right to expect and demand an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him. Tho' I acknowledge it did not enter into <hi>my</hi> mind, that <hi>that</hi> was his intention, or that any one would underſtand the words in ſuch a light.</p>
               <p>But what ſurprized me moſt of all was, that group of extravagant expreſſions in p. 41, where he ſpeaks of my "thundering <hi>Anathema,</hi> authoratively denounced againſt him, for advancing ſuch <hi>pernicious, ſoul-damning, deſtructive</hi> doctrines." Will the reader believe it, that <hi>not one</hi> of theſe violen expreſſions is contained in my whole let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? But what was it then, that cauſed this vehement outcry? Why truly, 'twas becauſe I was ſo audacious as to ſay, "I could not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>encourage the inſtructions of thoſe</hi> who advanced ſuch doctrines, among a people, the charge of whoſe immortal intereſts was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me;" becauſe I looked upon them of <hi>dangerous tendency.</hi> This was the <hi>thundering anathema,</hi> and this was all.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, what a ſtrained conſtruction does he put upon the abovementioned expreſſion of mine, ſaying 'it equally involved the <hi>brethren,</hi> and that I had <hi>virtually</hi> excommunicated half the church at once." What I becauſe I looked upon <hi>his</hi> doctrines as dangerous in their <hi>conſequences</hi> and tendency, therefore I charge the <hi>brethren</hi> with <hi>embracing</hi> them. When, in truth, I was ſo far from it, that I did not even ſuppoſe, that <hi>Mr. C. himſelf,</hi> was aware of thoſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,</hi> or would eſpouſe them.</p>
               <p>Again, I can't but take notice of that unchriſtian reflection in p. 43. where he inſinuates, that I am guilty of <hi>partiality</hi> in admitting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to own the covenant, or to communion. "Eſpecially <hi>thoſe of note,</hi>" ſays he. My own conſcience is witneſs, and I truſt a higher power ſtill, that I have ever made it my practice in affairs of this ſacred importance, to treat <hi>all alike:</hi> whether they be <hi>perſons of note,</hi> or not; to make no deſtinction between high and low, rich or poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:012984_0073_0F903E970D295AB0"/>
There are ſeveral things in the remarkable <hi>poſtjeript</hi> to his letter, which alſo merit obſervation. Mr C. can better give the reaſon tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I, why he inſinuates that "I had a mind <hi>to leave" my people:</hi> After 'tis notoriouſly known, that I had publickly declared the contrary; that I had no deſire, but to ſpend my life with this people, if I could live in peace, and there was any proſpect of my being ſerviceable to their beſt intereſt: And that all reports to the contrary, were groundleſs.</p>
               <p>Another thing Mr. C. has implicitly charged me with is, <hi>breaking open a letter,</hi> ſent to him from my father. This has been induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly propagated and aggravated by ſome perſons. 'Tis neceſſary therefore the truth ſhould be known. The <hi>letter</hi> to Mr. C. was ſent incloſed to me—and <hi>unſealed</hi>—with my father's expreſs deſire that I would look it over, and ſee whether I thought it might anſwer any good end to ſend it. If not, (as I knew the circumſtances of affairs here better than he did) he directed me to ſuppreſs or deſtroy it—and left it wholly with me, to conduct as I tho't moſt proper in the matter, This is the whole truth of the affair; which I am ready to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any one that deſires it, by my father's letter, which I now have by me. I eraſed two ſhort paſſages—and ſhould be as willing the world ſhould know what they were as not, were they in the <hi>leaſt degree</hi> material to the preſent controverſy—but they are not, as Mr. C. himſelf knows, who has ſince heard them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, this <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> I apprehend, will appear, to every one who attends to and compares it with what it refers to, a moſt peculiar one of its kind. Mr. C. has, indeed by <hi>inverted commas</hi> given his readers to underſtand, that he <hi>quotes</hi> the ſentences from <hi>my letter.</hi> Whether his quotations are juſt, or whether he has not perverted my meaning almoſt in every paſſage, the reader will beſt judge, by only comparing it with my letter. He has, beſure, repreſented my letter, in a very frightful light. But I do not <hi>own</hi> the letter in this dreſs. He has certainly ſtripped it of the garb that belonged to it, and has dreſſed it up in one of his own manufacture; terrible enough, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; and then ſeems to have viewed and reviewed it, in this ugly hue, till he had got quite out of all patience, and, as if unable to contain any longer, he at length breaks forth in ſuch expreſſions as theſe—<hi>thundering anathema—ſoul-damning doctrines—finiſhed hypocrite—lawyer like—aſſuming the prerogative of God—the rankeſt ſepera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:012984_0074_0F903E9750AFC250"/>to have ariſen, ſo far as I can find out, from theſe <hi>two things,</hi> viz. My ſaying that I looked upon ſome things he had advanced, to be of an <hi>arminian tendency</hi>—and that I could not <hi>encourage the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of thoſe, that promoted <hi>ſuch principles.</hi> Theſe two things, 'tis evident, are the chief, which he appears ſo exceedingly to reſent; as if I had herein been guilty of the higheſt crime that could poſſibly be committed againſt a mortal. But I think a perſon muſt be of a very irritable diſpoſition, to conceive ſuch poignan reſentment at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions like thoſe above.</p>
               <p>There are but two other things, which I ſhall particularly notice in <hi>this letter.</hi> One is, his repreſenting that I had "been <hi>obliged to retract</hi> ſome opinions which I formely held." And the perſon I <hi>learned</hi> them of, he politely tells me, was <hi>Bellamy.</hi> Without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking upon the manner in which Mr. C. has here and elſewhere treated that divine; I can inform him and the world if neceſſary,

                     <item>1. That I never eſpouſed any principles, merely becauſe they were held by Dr <hi>Bellamy,</hi> or any other man.</item>
                     <item>2. That I have never, ſince I have been in this place, <hi>retracted</hi> or ſeen cauſe to retract any ſentiments in divinity, which I had "formerly h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The other thing is, the <hi>laſt paragraph</hi> in Mr. C.'s letter, which was wrote upon the <hi>ſabbath,</hi> April 12th. Upon which I obſerve, that it appears to ſavour, not of a very chriſtian ſpirit; and morover is a <hi>miſrepreſentation</hi> of the matter: at leaſt, ſuch a repreſentation, as will naturally give a ſtranger a wrong idea. I, no doubt, did uſe thoſe words of the Apoſtle, which he mentions; but not in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> or with the <hi>deſign</hi> he ſuggeſts. And is it not very hard, to have it <hi>flung</hi> at me, in the manner Mr. C. has done in his <hi>marginal note</hi> upon it? "in a <hi>ſever</hi> (ſays he) as <hi>his manner is</hi> when <hi>moved.</hi>" So that if ever I feel any <hi>impreſſive ſenſe</hi> of divine things upon my own mind, I muſt take care not to diſcover it, nor appear with any degree of <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> in prayer or preaching, leaſt I ſhould be reproached with <hi>being "in a ſever</hi> as my <hi>manner is."</hi> How does it look, for one who has been an <hi>old miniſter,</hi> (but now a hearer) to ſit as a captious <hi>critick</hi> under the miniſtry of a <hi>young man,</hi> carping at his expreſſions, and finding fault, with no other grounds than he has mentioned above?
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012984_0075_0F903E9806E9CA68"/>How diſcouraging muſt it be, to be always expoſed to ſuch <hi>cants</hi> as theſe—that "if he lived to the age of <hi>Methuſaleh,</hi> he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>whole counſel</hi> of God," if he did not make more haſte about it, than he had done—That he had never "preached <hi>fifteen twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieths</hi> of the heads of divinity" which a miniſter ought to preach, &amp;c. If theſe things are true, I am indeed very much to blame, I acknowledge. But is it not a little ſtrange, that <hi>no others</hi> of the congregation ſhould have found this out, and complained of it for years paſt? Or if it was becauſe Mr. C. had ſo much more knowledge and diſcerning than the reſt, that he diſcovered it, what can be the reaſon that he had never mentioned it before? Why did he not, in a friendly manner, hint it to me, that I might <hi>amend</hi> for the future; eſpecially ſince we had "held a good correſpondence" before; and ſince this has been ſuch "matter of grievance to him for years" paſt? and was "no ſudden ebullition of paſſion?" But if he thought it was owing to my <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and that I was not <hi>able</hi> to handle thoſe points, why does he <hi>expoſe</hi> my weakneſs, and publiſh it to the world?—But, if I may be allowed to diſſent from Mr. C. I muſt ſay, that his aſſertion there, is not according to the truth of fact. And that "it is in my power to prove it," not "by an <hi>interleaved almanack,</hi>" but from <hi>others</hi> of my hearers, who will be allowed to have <hi>ſome</hi> underſtanding, as well as Mr. Cotton, and alſo by <hi>my own notes.</hi> So that I think I have good right to <hi>appeal</hi> from his <hi>almanacks,</hi> to a more impartial teſt: and the more ſo, becauſe he has <hi>one or two texts</hi> ſet down (by his own account) which I <hi>never did preach from.</hi> I have reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to call in queſtion the <hi>authenticity</hi> of his records, and to look upon his "interleaved almanack" as apocriphal and not genuine.</p>
               <p>Another remark he has, of much the ſame nature, in the margin of the next page; where he repeats an aſſertion he had, in his <hi>former letter,</hi> viz. "That his <hi>brethren all think</hi> as he does." If this be rightly and truly expreſſed, I own, I am entirely ignorant of the minds of <hi>all the members</hi> of the church reſpecting this debate; and can have no idea of the difference between a <hi>negative</hi> and an <hi>affirmative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Cotton, in the following page 50, exhibits to his readers fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofs of his kindneſs and friendſhip to me, in a catalogue of charges he has drawn up; at the cloſe of which, he tells his readers, he "mentions theſe things <hi>not to expoſe me,</hi> but to <hi>prevent</hi> the like for time to come." It ſeems 'tis a <hi>preventive</hi> potion which he here intended to adminiſter: I wiſh it's operation may be ſalutary; tho' I muſt acknowledge, the <hi>ingredients</hi> ſeem to be ſomewhat <hi>better</hi>—
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012984_0076_0F903E98CF4491C0"/>I ſhall not trouble the reader by repeating the ſeveral <hi>articles of charge,</hi> in this catalogue: But only obſerve, in general, that there is a mixture of <hi>miſrepreſentation, ſuſpicion</hi> and <hi>jealouſy;</hi> things which are <hi>ſurmiſed,</hi> without the leaſt foundation: Particularly what he has ſaid of my <hi>praying</hi> at the church-meeting—"ſermon of triumph"— <hi>pſalms</hi> being ſung at him, &amp;c. They are too low and even ridiculous to mention. I can with truth declare, that during the whole of theſe debates, I have never once, either prayed, ſung or preached with any deſign to diſguſt Mr. C. or any one elſe—but have always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avoid every thing that might be looked upon as <hi>pointed,</hi> or intended to irritate. The <hi>pſalms</hi> were ſung in courſe. As to the <hi>ſermon,</hi> which he intimates was made in a way of <hi>triumph</hi> after the <hi>church-meeting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That ſermon</hi> was made above a month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the church-meeting had an exiſtence; and therefore before I could poſſibly know (or even ſuſpected) what would be done at that meeting. I utterly deny the charge, of it's being my "uſual phraſe to ſay <hi>"my friends</hi> and <hi>my enemies."</hi>—What Mr. C. ſays, likewiſe, in the <hi>poſtſcript</hi> of his <hi>little</hi> letter, p. 51, I am certain he has no grounds for, from <hi>his own</hi> knowledge. And if he had it by <hi>informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is there not ſome danger, that his <hi>informer</hi> has had as great a ſhare in the "triſting diſcourſe" as any one elſe? As to his letter being "ſent back opened," this is a very great miſtake—It might poſſibly be opened in his own family, before <hi>he</hi> received it—but it was never opened in mine; but immediately returned to him <hi>unopened</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by any perſon in my family—And I ſhould probably never have been favoured with the <hi>contents</hi> of it, <hi>the challenge,</hi> &amp;c. but as he has ſeen ſit to publiſh it, with the other letters. As to the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>ſtyle</hi> of of it, I leave the reader to make his own remarks on them—and paſs</p>
               <p>To take ſome notice of <hi>his</hi> REMARKS <hi>on theſe letters</hi>—p. 51. 52, &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> intimates, that before theſe <hi>letters,</hi> "we held a <hi>good correſpondence."</hi> Of HIS <hi>friendly diſpoſition</hi> towards me, the reader might be better able to judge, perhaps, if I were (after his example) to publiſh a <hi>private letter,</hi> which he ſent me by way of chaſtiſement, many years ago, for a part of my conduct <hi>as a miniſter,</hi> which I never was faulted for, but by Mr. C. He has, indeed, ſince that time, ſhewn inſtances of kindneſs and friendſhip; which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with gratitude. And beſure, I could ſcarcely have believed <hi>then,</hi> that it were poſſible he could have ſaid and done thoſe things, which, <hi>ſince,</hi> we have had but too ſad occaſion to obſerve,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012984_0077_0F903E9999634C50"/>I cannot therefore, but have reaſon to apprehend, from all that has appeared of late, that he has long had ſome <hi>root of prejudice</hi> againſt me—and that nothing was wanting but an opportunity for it to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt itſelf, as it has now done. I wiſh I may be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>provocation</hi> given by <hi>my letter;</hi> I can truly ſay, I never meant or intended that <hi>abuſe</hi> of him, which he complains of; or to "begin any quarrel" with him; whatever his jealous mind may have ſuggeſted. Neither am I now at all diſpoſed to <hi>keep up</hi> a variance. I deſire nothing but peace and reconciliation. I ſhould be ſincerely glad to have Mr. C. return to us, with a <hi>kind, charitable, chriſtian</hi> ſpirit; and that <hi>we</hi> might, with the ſame ſpirit receive him, and live and walk as brethren. I never purpoſely did any thing to drive him away. And ſince his withdraw, I have endeavoured a <hi>reconciliation,</hi> in the preſence of a number of the church—the greater part of whom ſaid, and ſtill ſay, that the terms I offered and propoſals I made, were, in their opinion, reaſonable and ſufficient, and agreeable to the goſpel—that they ſhould deſire no more, had they been the offended; and yet Mr. C. refuſes to be reconciled and to return.</p>
               <p>I think the account he has given of this matter p. 53, is far from being ſo impartial and full, and it ought to be. The fact was this. At a meeting of a number of the brethren at my houſe with him, in order to confer and endeavour to heal this unhappy perſonal breach; after the affair was opened by Mr. C. I told him, I was ſorry for the unhappy difference that ſeemed to ſubſiſt between us, and was willing to do any thing that was reaſonable and ſcriptural, for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and would make <hi>this propoſal</hi>—viz. "Being ſenſible that it has been a day of <hi>temptation</hi> and <hi>controverſy</hi> among us, wherein we had <hi>both,</hi> no doubt, ſaid and done many things which are wrong, and which, at another time, we ſhould not have done—Let us now mutually <hi>forgive</hi> each other, and bury all that has been amiſe, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each others faults and failings with a <hi>mantle' of love and charity</hi>—I am heartily willing to do it myſelf, and deſire the ſame of you; and hereafter let us love and live like brethren." <hi>This</hi> was what I offered him—and <hi>this</hi> he utterly refuſed; and let me know, that unleſs I would go into <hi>particulars,</hi> and bring over ſundry <hi>articles</hi> of grievance that he had againſt me, he would not make up the matter. I told him I was not willing to that, and refuſed to do it; and that the only objection I had to it was, that it would tend only to <hi>exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> on both ſides—that raking open the <hi>coals</hi> would ſerve but to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>creaſe the heat, inſtead of quenching the fire—and that the only
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012984_0078_0F903E9A60C724D0"/>way, therefore, in the judgment of <hi>others,</hi> (both <hi>miniſters</hi> and <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>) as well as myſelf, would be mutually to aſk and grant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs— This I was free to do—and thought it moſt reaſonable that <hi>he</hi> ſhould comply with it; eſpecially conſidering the injurious treatment, I thought, he had given me ſo frequently before. He ſays, I thought it a <hi>condeſcention</hi> in me to make this propoſal. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it—and do now think ſo—and am very far from being alone, in my judgment, among thoſe who have been moſt acquainted with our affairs. But be it a condeſcention or no condeſcention, I won't diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that matter with him. I think it a <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>chriſtian</hi> propoſal; and am willing ſtill to comply with it. Mr. C. after this, perſiſted ſtill to <hi>refuſe</hi> to conſent to it; and pull'd out of his pocket a <hi>paper,</hi> containing three or four <hi>confeſſions</hi> for me to make; or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of grievance, for which he expected I make a diſtinct <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</hi> I told him I did not think ſit to comply with his requeſt—and withal aſked him if he thought HE was ſo entirely innocent, as that he ought to make no <hi>conceſſions</hi> on <hi>his</hi> part? His anſwer was in theſe words, <hi>"I ſhall not anſwer that queſtion."</hi> And thus the affair, in ſhort, ended; and thus it remains.</p>
               <p>There are innumerable other paſſages in Mr. Cotton's writings and conduct, which manifeſt how <hi>little</hi> he thinks <hi>himſelf to blame</hi> through the whole affair—how quick to cenſure and condemn others and to juſtify himſelf; to <hi>aggravate</hi> the faults of his brethren and to <hi>leſſen</hi> and even annihilate his own. An inſtance, among many others, of this, we may ſee in p. 52, 53. "Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> may <hi>thank himſelf</hi> IF I have been provoked to ſpeak ſometimes too harſhly," <hi>If</hi> I have. Nay, he brings it out, and ſays plainly p. 54. "I was not conſcious I had wronged him at all." And again, "I am <hi>not conſcious</hi> I have exceeded <hi>chriſtian bounds</hi> in my treatment of Mr. R." Perhaps <hi>others</hi> may be better judges of that, than Mr. C. or I. Be it as it may, it is certain, that moſt people among us happen to differ much from his judgment in this matter.</p>
               <p>But what a remarkable talent has he, on the other hand, at finding out crimes in <hi>others</hi> and making mountains of molehills. In p. 70, under his 11th obſervation, he charges me with "ſeeing with others eyes'—never "examining for myſelf"—and ſo I am condemned as not being "a lover of truth;" only becauſe I had ſaid, that <hi>ſome who have turned to the paſſages of ſcripture referred to by the</hi> SYNOD, <hi>to prove the lawfulneſs of</hi> THIS PRACTICE, <hi>had ſaid, they could not ſee that they had proved it, or were to the purpoſe.</hi> Does this imply,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012984_0079_0F903E9B0703C6C0"/>that <hi>I had never obſerved the ſame</hi> MYSELF? His obſervation or inference is truly worthy a <hi>Logician,</hi> in this inſtance.</p>
               <p>Yet this is a mere trifle, compared with his charge againſt me in the next page, (marginal note) which is, that "I did in <hi>direct terms,</hi> in the face of the church, give him the LYE." This is a high charge indeed: And <hi>obliges</hi> me in vindication of myſelf, to ſay <hi>that,</hi> which I have been very loth to believe, and would now be glad, (otherwiſe) to have been ſilent about: viz. That it is a <hi>fact,</hi> that there has been much talk among us of late, of what he there refers to. <hi>Many</hi> have been of the opinion, that Mr. C. (to mention none beſides) has had a <hi>deſign</hi> to get me away from this people, if he could. This opinion they formed, I ſuppoſe, from the whole tenor of his conduct towards me of late. But when he read his <hi>laſt piece</hi> at the church meeting, <hi>June</hi> 30th, (tho' the church voted twice not to hear it) I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that by the <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>extraordinary manner</hi> in which it was delivered, I was, more than ever before, ſatisfied in my own mind, that <hi>thoſe reports</hi> were true; and that he would be glad to procure a diſſolution of my relation to this people. I grounded my opinion upon that old, but true proverb, that <hi>actions ſpeak louder than words.</hi> And I did expreſs this my opinion—and for <hi>this</hi> he is pleaſed to ſay, I gave him the LYE. I am perſwaded, had any one been in my ſituation, and obſerved the whole ſeries of Mr. C.'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior towards me at thoſe meetings, and <hi>ſince,</hi> he would be at no great loſs to conjecture what he would have, if it was in his power. Poſſibly I may be miſtaken; but I ſpeak as things really appear to <hi>me</hi>—and I believe to many others. However, I would ſpeak it with thankfulneſs to GOD, and alſo to my <hi>people,</hi> I have reaſon to believe (tho' moſt unworthy) that I have as much evidence of the love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection of my people in general, as almoſt any miniſter whatever.—I pray that I may continue, both to deſerve and enjoy it. And I am not without hopes, notwithſtanding the late troubles, that a gracious God will, in due time, cauſe all animoſities and diviſions to ceaſe among us; that <hi>peace</hi> may be reſtored, and that we may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to attend to, beſides controverſy, even the <hi>one thing needful</hi>—that that we may <hi>know the things which belong to our peace, before they are hid from our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the methods propoſed in the church, for an <hi>accommodation</hi> of the publick diſpute, I had mentioned the following, viz. "That if the church would admit thoſe perſons into <hi>full communion</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be qualified to <hi>renew their baptiſmal covenant,</hi> I ſhould
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012984_0080_0F903E9C26C44930"/>be willing to <hi>baptize</hi> their children, tho' perhaps ſome of them could not ſee light to come <hi>immediately</hi> to the Lord's Supper." This Mr. C. "rejected with contempt," as ridiculous; ſaying, that there would "not be one perſon that ſhould vote for it, but would be <hi>aſhamed of it</hi> before a twelvemonth."<note n="*" place="bottom">Had I an inclination to follow Mr. C.'s example, I might well retort and ſay, he has "<hi>given ME the L—e.</hi> if not ſeveral others, in the face of the church," in ſaying "no church in the province practices any thing like it." And again,—"a report indeed we have, that <hi>one</hi> church in <hi>Connecticut</hi> hath adopted ſome ſuch ſcheme, <hi>whether true or not we cannot tell.</hi>" p. 73. Whereas I had told <hi>him</hi> and the church, publickly, that <hi>ſome churches had practiſed</hi> in this method, both in <hi>this province</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> That I had my information from indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable authority: In the <hi>former,</hi> from the <hi>miniſter</hi> of a church that are in the practice—in the <hi>latter,</hi> from a member of our church, of unſpotted character, whoſe <hi>name</hi> I mentioned alſo, and whoſe <hi>futher,</hi> a learned and worthy divine in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> has long been in the <hi>practice</hi> which I propoſed. And yet Mr. C. is pleaſed to ſay, in the face of theſe ſeveral teſtimonies, <hi>"whether 'tis true or no, we cannot tell."</hi>
                  </note> I knew indeed, there were ſome <hi>difficulties</hi> attending the method I propoſed; but I did it to avoid <hi>greater.</hi> My meaning was this—"If <hi>ſcruples</hi> of conſcience call for the church's <hi>forbearance</hi> in this caſe, let us <hi>forbear</hi> with them <hi>as members</hi> in covenant, not as <hi>half members.</hi> (For perſons will look upon them as <hi>half members,</hi> according to the preſent practice.) Let us bear with their <hi>ſcruples,</hi> as we do with old communicants, who are in the dark. It appeared to me, that this would be much more conſiſtent, than the practice we have been in.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Mr. C.'s propoſal was, "that a <hi>neighbouring miniſter</hi> come and <hi>baptize</hi> the children of the perſons in queſtion—and that the <hi>Deacons,</hi> or a <hi>committee</hi> of the church propound them for <hi>owning the covenant.</hi>" I told him, this was not only an <hi>innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> a plan, which I had never heard of in any church before—but, it appeared to me, would be inſtituting a kind of <hi>new</hi> eccleſiaſtical ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: And that it would be attended with many difficulties and inconveniencies—that I doubted whether any neighbouring miniſter would be willing to officiate in ſuch circumſtances. And if they would, I queſtioned whether <hi>three perſons,</hi> if a ſingle one, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation would deſire it—that we had never heard any thing of this kind <hi>hinted,</hi> by the perſons concerned, or who were not of the church.—I did not however, treat his propoſal, in the <hi>contemptuous</hi> manner he has ſuggeſted: nor tell the brethren they "would be aſhamed of it" ſhould they adopt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:012984_0081_0F903E9CAA4BC628"/>
I think the <hi>information</hi> Mr. C. gives, in the laſt page, "to thoſe who live at a diſtance," will hardly give a full idea of the manner in which "this diſpute terminated;" that it is a little to <hi>partial</hi> and defective. It ſeems to convey an idea, that the church meeting was <hi>diſſolved</hi> for the ſake of peace, but not to the ſatisfaction of the <hi>paſtor</hi>—that I remained <hi>"unſatisfied."</hi> It is well known that I was not at all <hi>unſatisfied</hi> with the diſſolution of the meeting; but was very <hi>deſirous</hi> of it—that I had long tho't, as well as above three quarters of the church, that theſe <hi>church meetings</hi> rather <hi>hurt</hi> than <hi>promoted</hi> the peace of both church and town: And that a <hi>diſſolution,</hi> would, we had reaſon to hope, put an end to the unhappy diſcords among us, at leaſt for the preſent. It is alſo as well known, that Mr. C. appeared greatly <hi>diſſatisfied</hi> with the church's propoſal to diſſolve the meeting and ſtrove againſt it with great vehemence. And that there never had been ſo much warmth and unchriſtian heat, at all our meetings before, as at this time. (We have all of us reaſon to think and ſpeak of it with ſhame.) The occaſion of it, 'tis evident, was, the <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that was made to <hi>diſſolving</hi> the meeting; altho' the <hi>declared deſign</hi> of it was, <hi>for the ſake of peace.</hi> A paper had been, for this end, drawn up a day or two before the <hi>laſt meeting,</hi> and ſigned by more than half the church—not by conſtraint or perſwaſion, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly—the purport of which was, "conſidering the unhappy diſputes that have ſubſiſted in the church, and being earneſtly deſirous to <hi>reſtore peace,</hi> we, for this end would propoſe and deſire that the church meeting which ſtands adjourned to the laſt of <hi>June,</hi> may then be <hi>diſſolved</hi> without entering into <hi>any further debates</hi> on the affair—the church to <hi>reaſſume</hi> the conſideration thereof when they ſhall think proper. This paper, being given into my hand at the opening of the meeting, and read, it was oppoſed with the greateſt earneſtneſs, as mentioned above; Mr.C. inſiſting upon <hi>reading further</hi> what he had wrote on the debate. On the other hand, the church in general, not willing to hear any thing more; as we had ſeen but too ſad effects of Mr. C.'s <hi>Eſſays</hi> in former meetings—and were therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>irous the matter might reſt at preſent, and the meeting be <hi>diſſolved</hi> in peace. However, after ſome debate, the <hi>queſtion</hi> was deſired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e put, and a vote called,—<hi>Whether the church incline to hear any thing further?</hi> It paſſed in the <hi>negative.</hi> After this, it being ſuſpected there was ſome miſtake in the vote, it was called again, in the ſame words, and paſſed clearly in the <hi>negative</hi> again. But ſo great were the complaints, and ſo vehement the oppoſition of Mr. C. and two or three more,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012984_0082_0F903EA16D6287C0"/>that the church, after this, did, in pure condeſcention to the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of theſe brethren, <hi>reconſider</hi> their vote, and gave liberty for Mr. C. to read his <hi>laſt eſſay.</hi> Aſſoon as he had finiſhed, the queſtion was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, once more to be put, whether the meeting ſhould be <hi>diſſolved?</hi> And it paſſed in the <hi>affirmative,</hi> by a much greater majority than in either of the former votes. And thus the affair now remains. And I cannot but think, that, notwithſtanding our difference in ſentiments, and ſome paſt unhappy things which have taken place among us, yet, if Mr. C. had not, "in his advanced ſtate of life," engaged in this <hi>publick</hi> controverſy—and needleſsly publiſhed to the world, thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> with the <hi>Eſſays</hi>—(contrary I believe I may ſafely ſay, to the minds of almoſt the whole church, and congregation too) our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties would have ſoon ſubſided, and matters return to their former peaceful ſtate. But his publiſhing <hi>this book,</hi> as it had a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to renew theſe things in peoples minds, to exaſperate their ſpirits, and to blow up the <hi>coals</hi> of contention; ſo it has been followed with ſome other unhappy effects, which otherwiſe, would never have taken place.</p>
               <p>What the iſſue of theſe things will be now; is known only by him who rules the world in infinite wiſdom and righteouſneſs, and will govern and direct all events for his own glory and the good of his church. But it is, and ought to be matter of comfort to all that wiſh well to Zion, that while the church, like the <hi>ark</hi> of old, is ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with waters, and many times <hi>toſſed</hi> up and down by <hi>ſtorms</hi> and <hi>tempeſts,</hi> yet JESUS CHRIST ſits at helm; and <hi>the Lord on high, is mightier than the noiſe of many waters;</hi> and can ſay to them, <hi>Peace, be ſtill!</hi>—For <hi>this,</hi> let the <hi>children of Zion</hi> pray; and at all times, <hi>be joyful in their King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now, but to requeſt earneſtly, the prayers of all that love the intereſt and kingdom of Chriſt and the edification and peace of his members; that God would, in his tender mercy, <hi>viſit this vine,</hi> which we truſt, <hi>his own right hand hath planted</hi>—that he would give to more and more of the ſpirit and temper of the goſpel—unite our hearts in brotherly kindneſs and charity, and grant that we may all meet at laſt, in that holy world, where the church of CHRIST are <hi>one</hi> in ſentiment and affection.</p>
