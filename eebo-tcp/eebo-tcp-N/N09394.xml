            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But in a more particular manner is this neceſſary, when any new and uncommon diſtemper occurs, of which the peculiar pathognomonic and diagnoſtic ſigns ſhould be carefully laid down, and a particular account given of what evacuations, regimen, and medicines were uſeful or hurtful in it.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>FROM a conviction of the truth and importance of theſe obſervations, and in obedience to the precept of ſo great a Man as Huxham, I have determined to attempt the hiſtory of a diſeaſe, which has lately appeared among the children of this city; and which, both as an uncommon and highly dangerous diſtemper, well deſerves an attentive conſideration. In delivering it therefore, I ſhall firſt carefully enumerate the ſymptoms with which it was attended, and deſcribe the appearances
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011977_0005_0FB8726E8F071F48"/>
which occurred on inſpecting the bodies of ſuch as died of it; then enquire into its nature and cauſe; and laſtly lay down the method of cure which has been found to be moſt ſucceſsful in its treatment.</p>
            <p>IN general, this diſeaſe was confined to children under ten years old, though ſome few grown perſons, particularly women, (while it prevailed) had ſymptoms in ſome reſpects reſembling it. Moſt of thoſe who had it were obſerved to droop for ſeveral days before they were confined. And the firſt ſymptoms, in moſt inſtances, were a ſlighty inflamed and watry eye, a bloated and livid countenance, with a few red eruptions here and there upon the face, and in one caſe a ſmall ulcer in the noſe, whence ooſed an ichor ſo ſharp as to inflame and erode the upper lip. At the ſame time, or very ſoon after, ſuch as could ſpeak, complained of an uneaſy ſenſation in the throat, but without any great ſoreneſs or pain. Upon examining it, the tonſils <hi>or almonds,</hi> appeared ſwelled and ſlightly inflamed, with a few white ſpecks upon them, which, in ſome, increaſed ſo as to cover them all over with one general ſlough, and in a few the ſwelling was ſo great, as almoſt to cloſe up the paſſage of the throat; but this, altho' a frequent ſymptom, did not invariably attend the diſeaſe; and ſome had all the other ſymptoms without it. The breath was either no ways offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, or had only that kind of ſmell which is occaſioned by worms; and the ſwallowing was very little, it at all, impeded.</p>
            <p>THESE ſymptoms, with a ſlight fever at night, continued in ſome for five or ſix days, without alarming their friends; in others a difficulty
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011977_0006_0FB87270414E32B0"/>
of breathing came on within twenty-four hours, eſpecially in the time of ſleep, and was often ſuddenly encreaſed to ſo great a degree as to threaten immediate ſuffocation. In general, however, it came on later, increaſed more gradually, and was not conſtant; but the patient would now and then enjoy an interval of an hour or two, in which he breathed with eaſe, and then again a laborious breathing would enſue, during which he ſeemed incapable of filling his lungs, as if the air was drawn through a too narrow paſſage.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtage of the diſeaſe was attended with a very great and ſudden proſtration of ſtrength; a very remarkable hollow dry cough; and a peculiar change in the tone of the voice; not eaſily deſcribed, but ſo ſingular, that a perſon who had once heard it, could almoſt certainly know the diſeaſe again by hearing the patient cough or ſpeak. In ſome the voice was almoſt entirely loſt, and would continue very weak and low for ſeveral weeks after recovery. A conſtant fever attended this diſeaſe, but it was much more remarkable in the night than in the day time; and in ſome there was a remarkable remiſſion towards morning. The pulſe at the wriſt was in general quick, ſoft and fluttering, though not very low, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that at the ſame time the pulſations of the heart were rather ſtrong and ſmart than feeble. The heat was not very great, and the ſkin was commonly moiſt.</p>
            <p>THESE ſymptoms continued for one, two, or three days. By that time it was uſual for them to be greatly increaſed in ſuch as died; and the patients, though commonly ſomewhat comatous
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011977_0007_0FB87272625E3F90"/>
from the beginning, now became much more ſo; yet even when the diſorder was at the worſt, they retained their ſenſes, and would give diſtinct anſwers, when ſpoken to; although on being left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they lay for the moſt part in a lethargic ſituation, only raiſing up now and then to receive their drink. Great reſtleſſneſs and jactation came on towards the end of the diſeaſe, the ſick perpetually toſſing from one ſide of the bed to the other, but they were ſtill ſo far comatous as to appear to be aſleep, immediately upon changing their ſituation or poſture. An univerſal languor and dejection were obſerved in their countenances; the ſwelling of the face ſubſided; a profuſe ſweat broke out about the head, neck and breaſt, particularly when aſleep; a purging in ſeveral came on; the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breathing increaſed, ſo as to be frequently almoſt entirely obſtructed, and the patient died apparently from the ſuffocation. This commonly happened before the end of the fourth or fifth day; in ſeveral within thirty-ſix hours from the time the difficulty of breathing firſt came on. One child, however, lived under theſe circumſtances to the eighth day; and the day before he died, his breath and what he coughed up, was ſomewhat offenſive; but this was the only inſtance in which I could diſcover any thing like a diſagreable ſmell, either from the breath or expectoration.</p>
            <p>OUT of ſixteen caſes attended with this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſuffocation in breathing, ſeven died; five of them before the fifth day, the other two about the eighth. Of thoſe who recovered, the diſeaſe was carried off, in one, by a plentiful ſalivation, which began on the ſixth day; in moſt of the others, by an expectoration of a viſcid mucus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011977_0008_0FB87273CCC1AFA0"/>I DISTINGUISH between the ſalivation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration, becauſe in one the diſcharge ſeemed to come from the ſalivary glands, and was attended with little or no cough; in the others it manifeſtly came from the Trachea, and was attended with an inceſſant cough; and I judged the ſalivation to have been a natural criſis, as the patient had taken but ſix grains of calomel before it came on. Her gums were not inflamed, her teeth were not looſe, nor had her breath or ſaliva, the ſmell of perſons under a mercurial ſalivation. In this caſe the voice, in the ſpace of a few hours, from being pretty ſtrong and loud, became ſo low as to be with difficulty heard.</p>
            <p>ONE of the firſt families in which this diſeaſe appeared was that of Mr. W. W. of this place. He had ſeven children in his family, all of whom were taken ill one after another. The four firſt had the diſeaſe as I have juſt now deſcribed, and three of theſe died; the one who recovered was the inſtance I mentioned, in which the diſeaſe was carried off by a ſalivation. The other three were the youngeſt. They had not the difficulty of breathing, but in its ſtead, very troublſome ulcers behind their ears. Theſe began with a few red pimples, which ſoon ran together, itched violently, and diſcharged a great deal of a very ſharp ichor, ſo as to erode the neighbouring parts, and in a few days ſpread all over the back part of the ear, and down upon the neck. They all had a fever, particularly at night, and one of them had a perpetual teneſmus, <hi>(or urging to go to ſtool.)</hi> This ſymptom appeared in ſome who had the difficulty of breathing, but in none to ſo remarkable a degree as in this child.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:011977_0009_0FB872754431F1B0"/>AFTER this, many other children had ſimilar ulcers behind their ears, and ſome of them ſeemed ſlightly affected with the difficulty of breathing, but it never became alarming while this diſcharge continued. Theſe ulcers would continue for ſeveral weeks, appeared covered in ſome places with ſloughs, reſembling thoſe on the tonſils; and at laſt grew very painful and uneaſy.</p>
            <p>IN ſome caſes they were attended with ſwellings of the glands under the tongue and behind the ears, which ſubſided on the eruptions appearing, and diſcharging freely, and again ſwelled upon the diſcharge being checked.</p>
            <p>I MET with nothing like this complaint in adult perſons, unleſs the two following caſes may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as allied to it; they happened about the ſame time, and both were women; one of them had aſſiſted in laying out two of the children that died of it. At firſt her ſymptoms reſembled rather an inflammatory angina, but about the third day the tonſils appeared covered with thick ſloughs, her pulſe was low and feeble; ſhe had a moiſt Skin, a dejection of ſpirits, and ſome degree of anxiety; though nothing like the difficult breathing of the children.</p>
            <p>THE other was a ſoldier's wife, who for ſome time before ſhe perceived any complaint in her throat, laboured under a low fever. Her tonſils were ſwelled, and entirely covered with ſloughs, reſembling thoſe of the children; but her breath was more offenſive, and ſhe had no ſuffocation.</p>
            <p>I HAVE had an opportunity of examining the nature and ſeat of this diſeaſe, from diſſection, in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011977_0010_0FB872779431A1C8"/>
three inſtances. One was a child of three years old. Her firſt complaint was an uneaſineſs in her throat. Upon examining it, the tonſils appeared ſwelled and inflamed, with large white ſloughs upon them, the edges of which were remarkably more red than the other parts of the throat. She had no great ſoreneſs in her throat, and could ſwallow with little or no difficulty. She complained of a pain under her left breaſt; her pulſe was quick, ſoft and fluttering. The heat of her body was not very great, and her ſkin was moiſt; her face was ſwelled, ſhe had a conſiderable proſtration of ſtrength, with a very great difficulty of breathing, a very remarkable hollow cough, and a peculiar change in the the tone of her voice. The next day her difficulty of breathing was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and ſhe drew her breath in the manner before deſcribed, as if the air was forced through too narrow a paſſage, ſo that ſhe ſeemed incapable of filling her lungs: She was exceedingly reſtleſs, toſſing perpetually from ſide to ſide, was ſenſible, and when aſked a queſtion, would give a pertinent anſwer, but otherways ſhe appeared dull and comatous. All theſe ſymptoms continued, or rather increaſed, until the third night, on which ſhe had five or ſix looſe ſtools, and died early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>UPON examining the body, which was done on the afternoon of the day ſhe died, all the back parts of the throat, and the root of the tongue were found interſperſed with ſloughs, which ſtill retained their whitiſh colour. Upon removing them, the parts underneath appeared rather pale than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. No putrid ſmell could be perceived from them, nor was the corps in the leaſt offenſive.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011977_0011_0FB872791B8D2578"/>
The Oeſophagus, <hi>or gullet,</hi> appeared as in a found ſtate. The epiglottis, <hi>which covers the wind-pipe,</hi> was a little inflamed, on its external ſurface, and on the inner ſide, together with the whole larynx, was covered with the ſame tough white ſloughs, as the glands of the throat. The whole trachea quite down to its diviſion in the lungs, was lined with an inſpiſſated mucus, in form of a membrane, remarkably tough and firm; which, when it came into the lungs, ſeemed to grow thin and diſappear: It was ſo tough as to require no inconſiderable force to tear it, and came out whole from the trachea, which it left with much eaſe; and reſembled more than any thing, both in thickneſs and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a ſheath of thin ſhammoy leather. The inner membrane of the trachea was ſlightly inflamed; the lungs too appeared inflamed, as in peripneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic caſes; particularly the right lobe, on which there were many large livid ſpots, though neither rotten or offenſive; and the left lobe had ſmall black ſpots on it, reſembling thoſe marks left under the ſkin by gun powder. Upon cutting into any of the larger ſpots, which appeared on the right lobe, a bloody ſanies iſſued from them without frothing, whereas upon cutting thoſe parts which appeared ſound, a whitiſh froth, but ſlightly tinged with blood, followed the knife.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond diſſection I attended, was of a child about ſeven years old, who had had all the ſymptoms with which this diſeaſe is commonly attended, except that in this caſe the glands of the throat, and upper parts of the wind pipe, were found entirely free from any complaint, and the diſeaſe ſeemed to be confined to the trachea only, which was lined with this tough mucus,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011977_0012_0FB8727AA27A37B8"/>
inſpiſſated ſo as to reſemble a membrane: We could trace it into the larger diviſions of the trachea, and it was evident that the ſmalleſt branches were obſtructed by it, for it was very obſervable, that upon opening the breaſt the lungs did not colapſe as much as is uſual, but remained diſtended, and felt remarkably firm and heavy, as if they were ſtuffed with the ſame mucus.</p>
            <p>THE laſt was a child of about three years old, who died in thirty-ſix hours after the difficult breathing firſt came on; yet even in this caſe, I diſcovered and ſhewed to ſeveral by-ſtanders, the inſpiſſated mucus which lined the trachea, and which was ſo remarkable as to be evident to all who ſaw it, that it muſt have been the cauſe of the child's death.</p>
            <p>THIS is a faithful hiſtory of this complaint, as it appeard in moſt of the caſes I have met with; and in which I have been careful to enumerate ſuch ſymptoms only, as I myſelf have ſeen. In the next place, let us compare it with ſome ſimilar diſeaſes deſcribed by others, with a view to diſcover what connection there is between them, and to ſee if this compariſon will throw any light upon its diagnoſtic ſigns, its nature, or cure.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR HOME, in an eſſay publiſhed ſome years ago at Edinburgh, deſcribes a diſeaſe under the name of the Croup, or Suffocatio Stridula, attended with the following ſymptoms:—It was peculiar to children, attended with a ſingular change in the tone of the voice, which he reſembles to the crowing of a cock, but acknowledges it is not eaſily deſcribed; a quick and laborious
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011977_0013_0FB8727CCB6A6CA0"/>
breathing, without much difficulty in ſwallowing, or remarkable inflammation in the throat, a dull pain about the upper part of the wind-pipe, and ſometimes a cough, but not of the common kind, but more ſhort and ſtiffled, and leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive, with little or no expectoration. He adds, that the children preſerved their ſenſes to the laſt, and were remarkably free from all other complaints, ſo that they would eat a minute before they expired, that they commonly drooped ſome days before they were confined, and that in many the face was ſwelled and bloated.</p>
            <p>SUCH a remarkable agreement in the ſymptoms, is of itſelf almoſt ſufficient to determine theſe diſeaſes to be the ſame, but when we compare the appearances from diſſection, it is placed beyond a doubt. In eight caſes of which he gives the diſſection, the mucous membrane I have deſcribed, was conſtantly found, and put on exactly the ſame appearances; it was of a firm conſiſtence, looſely adhering to the trachea, from which it came off in the ſhape of a hollow tube, and either in that form, or as a tough mucus, deſcended into the ſmalleſt branches of the trachea, ſo as to choak their cavities, and conſequently ſuffocate the patient. It is true, Doctor Home does not mention the ſwelling of the tonſils, or the ſloughs upon them, as frequent ſymptoms; but in ſome caſes here they were wanting; and he mentions ſome, in which the tonſils, together with all the glands about the root of the tongue, were ſwelled, and covered with mucus; ſo that upon the whole it can hardly be doubted, but that they are the ſame diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011977_0014_0FB8727E4AB47698"/>DOCTORS FOTHERGILL and HUXHAM, have both written upon a diſeaſe, under the title of a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ulcerous ſore throat; which in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, particularly an eryſipelatous eruption, with which it was attended, and many ſymptoms which indicated a high degree of putreſcency in the humours, widely differed from the complaint I have deſcribed; and yet they agree in ſo many other, and ſuch remarkable ſymptoms, that I cannot help entertaining an opinion, that they bear ſome relation to each other. Do not theſe circumſtances, their being in a great meaſure peculiar to children, their infectious nature, their beginning with a watry inflamed eye, ſucceeded by an inflamation, ſwellings and ſloughs on the tonſils and neighbouring parts, unattended with any remarkable difficulty in ſwallowing; the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and diſcharge from the noſe, behind the ear, &amp;c. the fever and poroxiſm at night; but above all the peculiar difficulty in breathing, the hoarſe dry cough, and remarkable change in the tone of the voice? I ſay, do not theſe ſymptoms, in which they all agree, juſtify ſuch an opinion, and although theſe diſeaſes may ſpecifically differ, yet determine them to be generically the ſame? And may not the eryſipelatous eruptions, and putrid ſymptoms mentioned by theſe gentlemen, have belonged rather to the conſtitution of the air, than to the eſſential nature of the diſeaſe; juſt as the ſmall pox, according to accidental circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, puts on a mild or a malignant appearance. There ſeems great reaſon to believe this was the caſe, eſpecially in that diſeaſe deſcribed by Doctor Huxham, for he particularly mentions that all the diſeaſes of that ſeaſon, were attended with <q>ſome kind of cuticular eruptions, and that too
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011977_0015_0FB87280720442A0"/>
even in pleuretic and peripneumonic diſorders, ſo greatly did the conſtitution of the air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeem diſpoſed to produce eruptions in all ſorts of feveriſh indiſpoſitions, and the blood drawn from the diſeaſed during all that time was very rarely viſcid, but generally florid, and eſpecially at the beginning of the diſeaſe of a very looſe texture.</q> He particularly mentions too, the ſtrangulated breathing, and hoarſe hollow voice as characteriſtic ſymptoms; and ſays, that <q>this noiſe in ſpeaking and breathing was ſo peculiar, that any perſon in the leaſt converſant with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe might know it by this odd noiſe.</q> And ſeveral Spaniſh and Italian phyſicians, quoted by Doctor Fothergill, as treating of the ſame diſeaſe, on which he writes, not only take notice of this very remarkable ſymptom, but even name the diſeaſe from it, Garotillo &amp; Morbus Strangulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. A ſtrong proof that the ſuffocation muſt (in the caſes they met with, as it was with thoſe I have deſcribed) have been the moſt ſtriking ſymptom, and that which conſtituted the danger of the diſeaſe. This is ſtill more evident from the reaſon given by R. Moreau, why the Spaniards call it Garotillo, <q>becauſe, (ſays he,) thoſe afflicted with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, appear to be affected in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſuch as are ſtrangled by a rope.</q> It is likewiſe remarkable, that ſome of the firſt writers on the complaint of which Doctor Fothergill treats, call it ſimply <hi>Garotillo, Morbus Strangulatorius, &amp;c.</hi> taking little notice of the ſymptoms of putrefaction; while others, as Severinus connect them together, terming it <hi>Peſtilens ac praefocans pueros abſceſſus;</hi> and others again entirely omit the ſymptoms of ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and name it <hi>Angina Peſtilens, Angina Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenoſa, malignant ulcerous ſore throat, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011977_0016_0FB872815081B540"/>THE ſame difference too is to be remarked with regard to the opinion the firſt writers on it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of its infectious nature; for whilſt many declare it to be peſtilential and contagious without reſtriction, ſome, particularly Corteſius, an Italian phyſician conſider it as contagious, only in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limitted ſenſe; <hi>"non eſſe abſque aliqua conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione,"</hi> are his words.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Fothergill's Account of the ſore Throat.</note> So that it ſeems very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that even the diſeaſe which Doctor Fothergill treats of, was frequently connected with thoſe affections of the trachea, and that every remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſuffocation and ſtrangulation in breathing, which ſo ſtrongly characteriſe that, we have lately had among us; and on the other hand that the ſymptoms of putrefaction greatly differed at different times, and in different places in that on which he writes: Nor is it improbable to ſuppoſe, that where the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of putrefaction moſt prevailed, there the ſuffocation would be leaſt evident; as it would naturally prevent the formation of that mucous membrane, which occaſions the ſuffocation.</p>
            <p>NEITHER Doctors Fothergill nor Huxham, have favoured us with any diſſections of perſons who died of the complaints they treat of; but Huxham obſerves that pieces of the internal membrane of the wind-pipe were ſometimes ſpit up, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were nothing but the inſpiſſated mucus I have mentioned, from its very near reſemblance to it, miſtaken for the membrane of the trachea. And Doctor Monro, ſen. in the diſſection of ſome children who died at Edinburgh, of a diſeaſe then conſidered to be the putrid ſore throat, found the ſame mucus membrane lining the trachea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011977_0017_0FB87282C6040A00"/>
into its minuteſt branches, ſimilar to what is found in the croup: It was not, however, univerſal in all he examined, but wherever it was found, it was remarkable that the children, whilſt alive, breathed in the ſame manner, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, as thoſe who were affected with the croup; a pretty evident proof, that theſe diſeaſes are at leaſt allied to, and apt to run into each other. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Doctor Withering's Theſis on the Angina Gangrenoſa.</note>
            </p>
            <p>MAY not therefore, the great diſcharge of mucus from the trachea and fauces, mentioned by Dr. Fothergill and Huxham, have ariſen from the ſame ſource, only that from the greater acrimony and putreſcency in that ſpecies of the diſeaſe it put on a thinner conſiſtence? Or is it improbable to ſuppoſe, that the ſymptoms of putrefaction, mentioned by theſe gentlemen, have rather been accidental, and ariſen from the peculiar conſtitution of the air at that time, or from ſome other occaſional circumſtance, than of the nature of the diſeaſe, and eſſential to it. I muſt confeſs I am inclined to be of this opinion, particularly as I find from all accounts, that the difficulty in breathing, and ſymptoms of ſuffocation almoſt invariably attended this complaint; and that thoſe of putrefaction differed greatly at different times, and in different patients. There is one caſe in particular mentioned by Doctor Fothergill, of a girl about twelve years old, who died in twenty-four hours from the attack of the diſeaſe, evidently from the ſtrangulation, and not from a putrid diſſolution of the humours; and on the other hand, I have been aſſured by ſome of the oldeſt practiitoners in this place, that they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011977_0018_0FB872851691E888"/>
have ſeen but a few years ago the diſeaſe I have deſcribed, attended both with eryſipelatous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and highly putrid ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole therefore I am led to conclude, that the diſeaſe called by the Italians Morbus Strangulatorius, the croup of Doctor Home, the ſore throat of Huxam and Fothergill, this diſeaſe, and that diſcribed by Doctor Douglaſs of Boſton, however they may differ in the ſymptoms of putreſcency and malignancy, do all bear an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial affinity and relation to each other, are apt to run into one another, and in fact, ariſe from the ſame Leven, which, as Doctor Fothergill ſtiles it, is a <hi>Stimulous of a peculiar nature,</hi> which more or leſs, according to particular circumſtances, generates an acrimony in the humours, and diſpoſes them to putrefaction; and which has a ſingular tendency to attack the throat and trachea, affecting the mucous glands of theſe parts, in ſuch a way, as to occaſion them to ſecrete their natural mucus, in greater quantities than is ſufficient for the purpoſes of nature; and which in this particular ſpecies, when ſecreted, is either really of a tougher or more viſcid conſiſtence than natural, or is diſpoſed to become ſo from reſt and ſtagnation.</p>
            <p>THE diſeaſe I have deſcribed, appeared evidently to be of an infectious nature, all infection muſt be owing to ſomething received into the body, this therefore whatever it is, being drawn in by the breath of a healthy child, irritates the glands of the fauces and trachea as it paſſes by them, and brings about a change in their ſecretions. The infection, however, did not ſeem in the preſent caſe to depend ſo much on any prevailing diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011977_0019_0FB872868E5E6FB0"/>
of the air, as upon effluvia received from the breath of infected perſons. This will account why the diſorder ſhould go through a whole family, and not affect the next door neighbour; and hence we learn a very uſeful leſſon, namely to remove all the young children in a family, as ſoon as any one is taken with the diſeaſe; by which caution I am convinced, many lives have been, and may again be preſerved.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now proceed to deliver the method of cure, which was found moſt ſucceſsful in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as far as it fell under my own obſervation. And in the firſt place, as from all the ſymptoms related, it is evident, that this diſorder is not always and in every ſtage, attended with any remarkable degree of putreſcency; and from the diſſections it appears, that an inflammation of the lungs, if not the cauſe, may at leaſt be the conſequence of the diſtemper, one would imagine that bleeding and evacuations were not totally to be forbid; and accordingly we find Dr. Douglaſs directing us, that if the fever is high, and the patient is plethoric, or accuſtomed to bleeding, to take away ſome blood, but with diſcretion: and if the tonſils are much inflamed, with great pain and diffiulty in ſwallowing, to open the jugular veins. And Huxham acknowledges, in the ulcerous ſore throats of which he treats, <q>That there were certainly ſome of them with a pretty ſmart fever, that bore bleeding at the beginning with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that he was obliged in ſeveral to give nitre with diaphoretics.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT Doctor Fothergill, ſpeaking of the ſore throat diſtemper, which came under his notice,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011977_0020_0FB87289CBCE8D70"/>
and which ſeems to have been of a more highly putrid kind, aſſures us; that although in ſuch caſes he has been induced to order bleeding, yet it did not appear to have any advantageous effects; and concludes, that notwithſtanding the vehemence of the ſymptoms, it is proper in general to omit this evacuation; nor can I hear of any perſon who has uſed it, in the diſtemper which appeared lately amongſt us, with ſucceſs, or any remarkable benefit; ſo that I hardly dare venture to preſcribe it, but muſt leave it to the diſcretion of the Phyſician, until farther experience ſhall confirm its utility, or forbid its uſe.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething very ſingular in the tendency of the virus in this diſeaſe, as I have already hinted, to attack the throat and trachea, nor are the effects it produces there leſs remarkable. Dr. Fothergill, in his account of the putrid ſore throat, deſcribes the ſloughs on the tonſils, as mortified eſcars; but in the diſeaſe we have met with, they appeared as in the trachea, to be nothing more than the mucus of the part, preternaturally thickened into the form of a membrane. At firſt I imagined this to be only a peculiar kind of pus, which is ſometimes found upon the ſurface of internal inflamed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; but upon removing it, the membrane of the trachea did not appear to have been ſufficiently inflamed, to juſtify ſuch an opinion. And in a caſe I lately had an opportunity of examining, where the patient died of a very violent inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the internal membrane of the trachea, there was no ſuch mucus lining to be diſcovered upon it. Nor does it appear to be the effect of any ſpaſm or conſtriction of the lungs, as it is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally remarked as occuring in ſuch as have died
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011977_0021_0FB8728BE75DD1E0"/>
of ſpaſmodic aſthmas, in which particular it is not long ſince I had an opportunity of being ſatisfied in the caſe of a ſailor, who actually died in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fit of a ſpaſmodic aſthma, which had laſted for ſeveral days; and yet there was not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch mucous membrane after death, either in the large or ſmaller branches of the trachea. This morbid appearance is particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly noticed by ſeveral gentlemen who have favoured us with an account of the diſſections of thoſe who have died under an angina gangrenoſa, or putrid ſore throat. Doctor Monro, ſen. as I have already taken notice, found it in ſeveral he diſſected; and Rolandus Martin Profeſſor of Anatomy at Stockholm, mentions a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtance of it, where this mucous membrane deſcended into the minuteſt branches of the trachea arteria, growing thinner as it deſcended deeper into the lungs, until it reſembled the membrane which lines the ſhell of an egg. He adds, that the lungs were not inflamed, nor in the leaſt injured, ſo that the infant died merely from the ſuffocation. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Doctor Withering's Theſis on the Angina Gangrenoſa.</note> And even thoſe who have written of the ulcerous ſore throat, as Doctors Huxham and Douglaſs, and have not given the appearances from diſſection, have mentioned many mucous linings being expectorated, which Douglaſs compares to the cuticle raiſed by veſications, and Huxham conceived to be really pieces of the internal membrane of the trachea. So that this is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſeems to be peculiar to the diſeaſe; and which generally does occur in it; and thoſe who die, on the ſecond or third day, with the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011977_0022_0FB8728FA5A008C8"/>
ſtrangulated breathing, are probably ſuffocated by this membrane. This affection, therefore, of the mucous glands, muſt be conſidered as the proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe, it readily accounts for all the other ſymptoms; and from it only, eſpecially in the beginning of the complaint, can we ſafely draw our indications of cure; paying at the ſame time a conſtant attention to any ſymptoms of putreſcency that may occur.</p>
            <p>IT is from viewing the diſeaſe in this light only, that we can account for the uſe of Mercury in it; a medicine which if we conſider it as a ſpaſmodic complaint, cannot poſſibly have any good effect, or if we look upon it merely as a putrid diſeaſe, ſeems directly contrary to every intention of cure; but which, nevertheleſs, undoubted experience has proved to be highly beneficial. And indeed, if we conſider the peculiar acrimony which this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe occaſions in the fluids in general, independant of putrefaction, and the inſpiſſation of the mucus of the trachea, we might reaſonably conclude a priore, that Mercury, which in general corrects acrimony, in a very remarkable manner thins all the mucous ſecretions, particularly thoſe of the mouth and fauces, and affects the breath very early, would be beneficial in it, and either prevent the formation of this membrane, or promote its ſeparation and expulſion, when already formed. Dr. Douglaſs viewing the matter in this light firſt tried it, and meeting with ſucceſs, afterwards recommended it to others; and, in a very few words, has explained both his theory and practice in this particular. <q>Any affection of the throat, (ſays he) does frequently produce a natural ptya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm. Mercurials uſed with diſcretion, are a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011977_0023_0FB8729047237FD8"/>
kind of ſpecific in ſuch like ulcers, and ulcuſcula, and in fact here moiſten the throat and mouth, ſtop the ſpreading of the ulcuſcula, and promote the caſting off of the ſloughs; and as an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory advantage, the patients being moſtly children, deſtroyed worms. Amongſt all the preparations calomel anſwered beſt. The gentle vomiting and few ſtools that it occaſioned in ſome, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the natural courſe of the diſtemper. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith produces too ſtrong a revulſion, and the eruption is thereby too much diverted. This diſtemper did not well bear any other evacuation but mercurials.</q> And in another place he ſays, <q>the diſpumation of this acrid inquination of the juices in our diſtemper, that is, its natural criſis, ſeems to be by the patent and ſalutary emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the fauces and ſkin. In corroſive taints, u. g. venerial and others, a Mercurial ptyaliſm, and ſudorific decoction of the woods anſwer beſt, this gave us the hint of promoting the tendency of nature in our illneſs, by mercurials and gentle breathing ſweats in bed, which with good management ſeldom failed, excepting where the necroſis was irrimediable from the beginning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is a ſingularity in this Gentleman's ſtile, but his obſervations are accurate and judicious; and as he ſays himſelf, being founded upon real, not imaginary caſes, muſt therefore be of permanent truth. And <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ſe I met with, in which the diſorder (and in no trifling degree) was carried off by a very copious ſalivation, is of itſelf, almoſt a ſufficient vindication of this practice; and together with the caſe of that child whoſe body I firſt opened, where I ſaw the moſt powerful antiſeptics faithfully adminiſtered, which not only failed of ſucceſs, but
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011977_0024_0FB87291D1D72F38"/>
did not even mitigate the ſymptoms, was what firſt led me to enquire more minutely into the nature of this diſeaſe, and of the remedies which had been uſed with moſt ſucceſs in its cure. Upon reading Dr. Douglaſs's little eſſay, (which gave me the greater ſatisfaction becauſe he wrote upon the diſeaſe as it appeared in this country, and under his own immediate obſervation) I found he placed his chief dependence upon mercurials, which I was the more readily induced to make trial of, from the appearance I found from diſſection, the idea I thence naturally formed of this complaint, and the teſtimonies of ſome other Gentlemen in their favour: and indeed the good effects they have been attended with, fully juſtifies the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Dr. Douglaſs has given of them; as the more freely I have uſed them, the better effects I have ſeen from them. Calomel is what is commonly recommended, and has been given to the quantity of 30 or 40 grains, or indeed a much larger quantity, in five or ſix days, to a child of three or four years old; not only without any ill effects, but to the manifeſt advantage of the patient; relieving the difficulty of breathing, and promoting the caſting off of the ſloughs, beyond any other medicine. That it may the more immediately enter the blood, and act more powerfully as an attenuant, it ſhould at firſt be joined with a mild opiate; and what is a little remarkable, is, that given in this way, it ſeldom or never raiſed in children any ſalivation; though indeed no ill conſequences are to be apprehended from it, if it ſhould. After the firſt or ſecond doſe, the opiate may be omitted, as then the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury will not be ſo apt to go off by the inteſtines, and the opiate if continued will, by leſſening the ſenſibility of the trachea, counteract, in ſome
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011977_0025_0FB872940B562920"/>
meaſure, the attenuating effects of the calomel, and alſo increaſe the coma.</p>
            <p>THE operation of the calomel, as an expectorant will be very much promoted by a prudent uſe of oxymel of ſquills, or leaſt that ſhould purge, by ipecacoanha, given ſo as to puke two or three times. We well know the good effects of vomits in humoural aſthmas, upon the ſame principle are they indicated in this diſeaſe, to relieve the lungs from a load of mucus with which they are oppreſſed. They are ſo far from being attended with any ill effects, (as has been apprehended) that in fact they never fail in ſome meaſure to relieve the breathing. Doctor Fothergill particularly recommends them, and indeed the more the complaint has a tendency to putrefaction, they are the more neceſſary, and will be found of greater utility; for in that caſe the mucus and diſcharge from the lungs, which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren commonly ſwallow, is very acrid, and unleſs frequently diſcharged by puking, will erode the coats of the ſtomach, and ſpread the diſeaſe. And what Huxham ſays with regard to vomits, is ſtill more to our purpoſe, and of itſelf almoſt ſufficient to refute any prejudices which may have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt them. <q>In children it was often neceſſary to make them puke frequently, with a little oxymel of ſquills, eſſence of antimony or the like, otherwiſe <hi>the vaſt amaſs of tenacious mucus would quite choak them.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Huxham on the ulcerous ſore throat. Page 290.</note>
               </q> The efficacy therefore of this remedy can hardly be doubted, ſince it is not only pointed out by analogy, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011977_0026_0FB872958A2F0E40"/>
confirmed by experience, but has the united teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the beſt writers on the ſubject, Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, Huxham, and Douglaſs in its favour.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH Mercury is here conſidered as the baſis of the cure, eſpecially in the beginning of this diſeaſe, it is by no means intended to condemn or omit the uſe of proper alexipharmics and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeptics; of which the ſerpentaria, contrayerva, and peruvian bark are the moſt powerful, and have been uſed with the greateſt ſucceſs. Sweating is certainly one way, by which nature carries off this diſeaſe; inſomuch that Huxham declares he did not remember to have had one patient miſcarry, who fell into a ſoft, eaſy, univerſal ſweat: and therefore, whatever method of cure was purſued, this ſhould be always connected with it. The patient ſhould be kept in bed, and as the diſeaſe has a putrid tendency, the diaphoretics ſhould be of the alexipharmic and antiſeptic kinds. The bark is certainly a moſt powerful antiſeptic, and when the ſymptoms of putrefaction, ſuch as a moiſt clammy ſkin, highly putrid breath, and haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges appear, muſt be attended with advantage. But early in the diſeaſe, while the ſkin continues dry, attended with a great difficulty of breathing, and the ſymptoms of inflammation rather than thoſe of putrefaction prevail, it ſhould be omitted; and here the removal of the diſorder ſhould be attempted, chiefly by mercurials and mild ſudorifics. And indeed the whole art, in the cure of this diſeaſe, depends upon properly timeing theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and inſiſting upon one or the other, as the ſymptoms of putrefaction, do more or leſs prevail.

to take it, will promote the attenuating effects of the calomel: as an alexipharmic and antiſeptic, the Virginian ſnake root is the moſt powerful, but the contrayerva is the leaſt diſagreable, and children will on that account frequently take that the moſt freely.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides a ſalivation, and ſweating, nature frequently carries off this diſeaſe by an eruption on the ſkin, ulcers behind the ears, or in other parts of the body, or an external ſwelling of the throat, all of which ſeem evidently to indicate the uſe of bliſters. And accordingly Doctors Fothergill and Huxham recommend them, particularly Doctor Huxham, who ſays he has ſometimes bliſtered the throat from ear to ear with great ſucceſs. It has indeed been ſaid, that they ſometimes produced mortifications, and that even the diſcharge they occaſioned, ſeemed to be more than the patient could bear, but as I have never heard this remark confirmed, I cannot help imagining, that the caſes in which they were tried, were particularly unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, and more remarkably putrid than is uſual; for in the child, who died on the eighth day, bliſters were applied behind the ears, and they had not the leaſt appearance of mortification or gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, even after the child's death. And in a caſe of very great danger, which I lately met with, they were certainly of great ſervice, and very effectually ſupplied the place of thoſe natural diſcharges, by which nature carries off this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I WOULD recommend their application early in the diſeaſe, from the ſame principle that they are applied in inflammatory anginas or pleuriſies, to relieve the throat and trachea, and to derive the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011977_0028_0FB872994589B1B0"/>
flow of humours from the internal, to the external parts.</p>
            <p>AS the caſe to which I refer was a very remarkable one, in which the diſeaſe was attended with ſome of the worſt ſymptoms I have ever ſeen and the method I have been adviſing was ſtrictly purſued, and attended with ſucceſs; I cannot help conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſucceſs to be in ſome meaſure a proof of the propriety of the treatment, and for that reaſon ſhall here inſert the caſe at large.</p>
            <p>THE patient was a child of about two years and a half old, who had complained for about a week of a ſore throat and hoarſeneſs. The day before I ſaw her, ſhe had ſome difficulty of breathing, which on that day was greatly increaſed, and exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the breathing of the children whoſe caſes I have before related, when moſt ſtrangulated. Upon examining her throat I found the tonſils ſwelled, inflamed, and covered with ſloughs of a yellowiſh colour. Her breath was not in the leaſt offenſive, her pulſe was ſmall and fluttering, and her ſkin pale and clammy. Two very large bliſters were immediately applied, one behind each ear, ſo as to meet at her throat. She took four grains of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, with a quarter of a grain of opium, and was directed to drink a decoction of Virginian ſnake root, diſguiſed with old methegſin, as a common drink; and as her ſkin was pale and clammy, ſhe had a clyſter of one drachm of peruvian bark, and ten grains of the ſnake root in milk, to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered every ſix or eight hours; but of theſe ſhe received but one that night; and as we found ſhe did not retain them, they were ſoon diſcontinued; nor could ſhe be prevailed on to drink but very <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the decoction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:011977_0029_0FB8729AC71C01E0"/>I SAW her ſeveral times during the firſt day, and ſhe appeared worſe at each time. About eight that evening ſhe had ſomething like a fit, and at nine, the ſtrangulation in her breathing was much increaſed, her pulſe was ſunk, her countenance changed, her noſe appeared to be pinched up; her eyes were fixed and glaſſy, a blue ring was obſervable about her mouth, and ſhe was comatous. I left her, expecting ſhe would ſoon die. Her bliſters had been dreſſed a little before, had riſen well, and diſcharged freely; and within two or three hours, as I was informed by the watches who ſat up with her, ſhe ſeemed to revive. The next morning I was greatly ſurpriſed, not only to find her living, but in a ſitting poſture, eating her breakfaſt, with little or no difficulty of breathing, having her natural countenance returned, with ſome colour in her cheeks, and her pulſe rather riſen. At twelve o'clock, however, her breathing grew more difficult, and though not ſo ſtrangulated as the day before, was very quick and uneaſy. From this time for five days ſhe remained in a very dangerous ſituation, and gave but little reaſon to expect her recovery. Her breathing continued quick and laborious, and her voice was almoſt entirely gone; her pulſe was quick and low; ſhe ſweated profuſely, particularly at nights, and conſtantly lay in her bed in a comatous ſituation, giving however diſtinct anſwers when ſpoken to. I could diſcover nothing diſagreable in her breath, though ſometimes what ſhe brought up was a little offenſive. During this time, and for many days after, the bliſters diſcharged very freely, and the matter of the diſcharge was ſo ſharp and coroſive as to inflame and erode the ſkin almoſt from the chin to the breaſt-bone. She conſtantly took twice
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011977_0030_0FB8729DC6A00F68"/>
a day three grains of calomel; and except the firſt doſe without opium, until ſhe had taken upwards of thirty grains; and continued the uſe of the decoction of ſnake root in as large quantites as ſhe could be prevailed on to take it. On the ſeventh day from the time I firſt ſaw her, ſhe began to cough a good deal, with which ſhe expectorated pretty freely, and brought up ſome very tough mucus. She breathed more freely, opened her eyes and looked about with ſome ſprightlineſs, and drank a glaſs or two of wine. From this time ſhe gradually grew better, and by the fifteenth day from the time I ſaw her, all her ſymptoms had left her, except great weakneſs, and ſo remarkable a hoarſeneſs, or rather loſs of voice, that it was with great difficulty ſhe could be heard; and a peculiar ſenſibility of the larynx, with regard to fluids, ſo that the moment ſhe attempted to drink ſhe fell into a fit of coughing, although ſhe could ſwallow ſolid food without difficulty. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſoon left her, but her weakneſs and lowneſs of voice continued a much longer time, ſo that in two months ſhe could hardly walk alone, or ſpeak in a tone above a whiſper.</p>
            <p>WHEN ulcers appear behind the ears, or in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the body, they require a particular treatment; the diſcharge ſhould be encouraged by frequently waſhing them with warm milk and water, and poultices of bread and milk, may be applied to them; but greaſy applications always do harm, as they check the diſcharge: nor will they bear digeſtives. In ſome caſes, however, after the diſcharge had continued for a great length of time, it was found neceſſary to check it, with a very weak ſollution of white Vitrol, which anſwered this
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011977_0031_0FB8729F4558AAE8"/>
intention well; nor did I ever obſerve any ill effects from it: But it was always uſed with great caution, and never ventured on until the general virus of the diſeaſe, had been corrected by a previous uſe of Mercurials. In reſpect to gargles, I would entirely follow Doctor Fothergill's advice. Fomentations applied to the breaſt, and fumigations with the ſteams of ſome mild aromatic herbs, and warm vinegar, not only give eaſe, but ſerve, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to attenuate the mucous in the Trachea; and by gently ſtimulating the lungs, raiſe a ſlight cough, and promote the expectoration. The treatment of any accidental ſymptoms, after endeavouring to form a juſt idea of the diſeaſe, muſt be left to the diſcretion of the phyſician.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the ſentiments, which, from an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obſervation of the ſymptoms, and progreſs of this diſeaſe, I have entertained of its nature, and moſt proper treatment. It is indeed a complaint formidable in its nature, and of a very doubtful event, ſo that there is no wonder if parents in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſhould be greatly alarmed at the leaſt ſymptom of its approach: but, on the other hand, it is ſtrongly marked, and by a perſon of common obſervation, at all converſant in it, eaſily known and diſtinguiſhed. It has gone too much under the appellation of a ſore throat, and has by many been confounded with the common diſeaſes of that kind, ſo that parents have often been greatly alarmed where there was no cauſe of fear, and much terrified where there was no ſymptom of danger. In truth, the throat, altho' frequently affected, is not the ſeat of the diſeaſe, and many have died where that has been entirely free from complaint; nor are ſwelled tonſils, an inflammation in the throat, even where it ſhould

happen to be ſpecked, or a palate hanging to one ſide, any more the marks of this diſtemper, than <hi>a very laborious breathing, a hoarſe hollow cough, and a peculiar change in the tone of the voice,</hi> unattended with inflammation, are the ſigns of a common quinſey. In reality, the wind-pipe and lungs are moſt affected in this diſeaſe, and it is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of theſe organs which gives origin to its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic ſymptoms, and conſtitutes its danger. By attending to which, we ſhall, at all times, be enabled to diſtinguiſh this dangerous malady from any other diſtemper, parents will be ſaved much unneceſſary pain and anxiety, and children preſerved from the danger which muſt neceſſarily attend an erronious treatment of their complaints.</p>
