            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>eſpotiſm, ſince the commencement of this reign, makes it evident to the meaneſt capacity, that a deſign was formed (and it has with too much ſucceſs been carried into execution) for ſubverting the religion, laws, and conſtitution of this kingdom, and to eſtabliſh, upon the ruins of public liberty, an arbitrary ſyſtem of government. In a word, the deſtruction of this kingdom will ſoon be effected by a Prince of the Houſe of Brunſwick.</p>
            <p>The bloody reſolution has paſſed the Houſe of Commons and the Houſe of Lords to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our preſent humane, gentle Sovereign, to give directions for enforcing the cruel and unjuſt edicts of the laſt Parliament againſt the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013927_0002_0F925772C13B3F20"/>Americans. His Majeſty, poſſeſſing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which nothing can equal but the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, will, no doubt, give imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate orders for carrying effectually into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution the maſſacre in America; eſpecially as he is to be ſupported in polluting the earth with blood, with the lives and fortunes of his faithful butchers, the Lords and Commons; would to God they only were to fall a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this unnatural civil war.</p>
            <p>The day of trial is at hand; it is time to prove the virtue, and rouſe the ſpirit of the people of England; the proſpect is too dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it is too melancholy to admit of farther delay.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayor of London ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to call a common hall for the purpoſe of taking the ſenſe of his fellow citizens, at this alarming criſis, upon preſenting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance to the throne, couched in terms that might do honor to the city, as the firſt and moſt powerful in the world, and to them as men determined to be free; in terms that might ſtrike conviction into his Majeſty's breaſt, and terror into the ſouls of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. This is not a time for compliments, nor ſhould tyrants, or the inſtruments of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, ever be complimented.</p>
            <p>The merchants of London, it is to be hoped, and the whole commercial intereſt of England, will exert themſelves upon this great occaſion, by ſending to the throne ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pointed remonſtrances, worthy of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013927_0003_0F92577389CC3978"/>by noble and generous ſubſcriptions, and in every other manner give all the relief, and all the aſſiſtance in their power, to their oppreſſed and injured fellow ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>Let them heartily join the Americans, and ſee whether tyranny and lawleſs power, or reaſon, juſtice, heaven, truth, and liberty, will prevail.</p>
            <p>Let them, together with the gentlemen of landed property, who muſt greatly ſuffer by this unnatural war, make a glorious ſtand againſt the enemies of public freedom, and the conſtitutional rights of the colonies; for, with the ruin of America, muſt be involved that of England.</p>
            <p>Let them, in plain terms, declare their own ſtrength, and the power of the people, a power that has hitherto withſtood the united efforts of fraud and tyranny; a power to which all Kings have ever owed their crowns; a power which raiſes them to a throne, and, when unworthy of their delegated truſt, can pull them down.</p>
            <p>Let them declare to the world, they will never be ſo baſe and cowardly as quietly to ſee any part of their fellow ſubjects butchered, or enſlaved, either in England or America, to anſwer the purpoſe of exalted villany; and by that means become the deteſted inſtruments of their own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Let them declare to the world, they are not yet ripe for ſlavery, that their forefathers
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013927_0004_0F925774424131B8"/>made a noble reſiſtance, and obtained a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive victory over tyranny and lawleſs power, when the Stuarts reigned; that they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do themſelves juſtice, and not to ſuffer any farther attacks upon their freedom, from the preſent Sovereign, who is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſirous, as well as ambitious, to deſtroy the liberties of mankind; but that they do inſiſt upon a reſtoration of their own violated rights, and the rights of Britiſh America.</p>
            <p>Let them enter into an aſſociation for the preſervation of their lives, rights, liberties, and privileges; and reſolve at once to bring the whole legion of public traitors, who have wickedly entered into a conſpiracy to deſtroy the dear bought rights of this free nation to condign puniſhment, for their paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diabolical proceedings, which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſtained the land with blood, and theaten deſtruction to the human race.</p>
            <p>A few ſpirited reſolutions from the city of London, and the whole body of merchants of England, would ſtrike terror into the ſouls of thoſe miſcreants, the authors of theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful public miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>The grand principle of ſelf-preſervation, which is the firſt and fundamental law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, calls aloud for ſuch exertions of public ſpirit; the ſecurity of the nation depends upon it? Juſtice and the preſervation of our own, and the lives of our fellow ſubjects in America, demand it. The very being of the conſtitution makes it neceſſary, and whatever is neceſſary to the public ſafety muſt be juſt.</p>

The preſent conſpirators againſt the peace and happineſs of mankind ought to know, that no ſubterfuges, no knaviſh ſubtilities, no evaſions, no combinations, nor pretended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, ſhall be able to ſcreen or protect them from public juſtice. They ought to know that the people can follow them through all their labyrinths and doubling meanders; a power confined by no limitations but of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice, and the public good; a power that does not always follow precedents, but makes them; a power which has this for its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that extraordinary and unprecedented villanies ought to have extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented puniſhments.</p>

               </head>
               <p>You can neither be ignorant of, or unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the arbitrary ſteps that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King, ſupported by an abandoned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and a venal ſet of proſtituted Lords and Commons, is now purſuing to overturn the ſacred conſtitution of the Britiſh empire, which he had ſworn to preſerve.</p>
               <p>You are not, or will not long be ignorant that the King, the Lords and Commons, have (to ſatiate their revenge againſt a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals) declared the whole people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to be in a ſtate of rebellion, only becauſe they have openly avowed their reſolution to ſupport their charters, rights and liberties,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013927_0006_0F92577613BBF4C8"/>againſt the ſecret machinations of deſigning men, who would deſtroy them, and you are fixed upon as the inſtruments of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. However, I entertain too good an opinion of you to believe there is ONE TRUE ENGLISHMAN, who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the BLOODY work. Men without fortunes, principles or connexions, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed handle their arms in any deſperate cauſe, to oblige a tyrant, or monſter in human ſhape; but men of family and fortune, or of honeſt principles, I hope could never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to ſheath their ſwords in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of their countrymen. Engliſhmen ſurely cannot be found to execute ſo diabolical a deed, to embrue their hands in innocent blood, and fight againſt their friends and country; actions which muſt brand them with perpetual marks of reproach and infamy.</p>
               <p>O! my countrymen, let neither private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, nor friendſhip, neither relations nor connexions, prevail with, or induce you to obey (as you muſt anſwer at the laſt day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the awful judge of the world, for the blood that will be wantonly and cruelly ſpilt) the murderous orders of an inhuman tyrant; who, to gratify his luſt of power, would lay waſte the world. No, rather enter into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn league, and join with the reſt of your countrymen, to oppoſe the preſent meaſures of government planned for our ruin.</p>
               <p>When your country calls, then ſtand forth and defend the cauſe of liberty, deſpiſe the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013927_0007_0F92577B070FA5D0"/>degeneracy of the age, the venality of the times, and hand freedom down to poſterity: that your children may ſmiling bleſs, not curſe, your warlike reſolution. To die glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly fighting for the laws and liberties of your country, is honorable, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a crown of martyrdom; to die fighting againſt it is infamy, and you would for ever deſerve the heavieſt curſes and execrations.</p>
               <p>I hope neither you nor the Iriſh have forgot the ſhameful inſults you have received from the King ever ſince the concluſion of the laſt war. You have been deſpiſed, neglected, and treated with contempt, while a parcel of beggarly Scotchmen only have been put into every place of profit and truſt, in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, in England and America, and the preference has, of honor and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, been conſtantly given to thoſe people, nay even to rebels, and ſome who have ſerved in the French ſervice.</p>
               <p>Be aſſured, if you can be prevailed upon to butcher, or enſlave your fellow ſubjects, and to ſet up an arbitrary power on the ruins of public liberty, that your ſubſiſtence would ſoon be reduced to the miſerable pittance of foreign troops; and you, with the ſurviving ſubjects of England and America, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the miſerable condition of being ruled by an army of Scotch janizaries, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Roman Catholics.</p>
               <p>Let every Engliſh and Iriſh officer, ſoldier, and ſeaman, ſeriouſly weigh theſe things; and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013927_0008_0F92577CA23BA048"/>then if they are valiant, courageous, magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and free, like their forefathers; if they are true to their King and their country; if they value their religion, laws, lives, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, families and poſterity, no conſideration can prevail with them to engage againſt the Americans in an inhuman bloody civil war.</p>
               <p>Let every man then, who is really and truly a Proteſtant, who wiſhes well to his country and the rights of mankind, lay aſide his prejudices, and conſider the cauſe of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and her ſucceſs in this ſtruggle for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as a thing of the laſt conſequence to England, upon which our ſalvation depends, for the preſent plan of royal deſpotiſm is a plan of general ruin. I ſay, let us all ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily unite, and endeavour to defend them from their open, and ourſelves from our own ſecret and domeſtic enemies, and if any are lukewarm in this great public cauſe, and at this time of imminent danger, let them be made an example of treachery and cowardice, that the preſent generation may deteſt and abhor them, and poſterity declaim againſt and curſe them, as unnatural monſters, who would deſtroy the human race.</p>
