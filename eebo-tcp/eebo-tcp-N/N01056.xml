            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ESSAY which I am going upon, is, To Reſcue ſome Glorious <hi>Truths</hi> of GOD and of GRACE, from the <hi>Abuſe,</hi> which I See they commonly meet withal. <hi>Truths,</hi> I am ſure, they are, which the Service of our Holy Religion mightily requires us to Explain and Propound in ſuch a manner, as that <hi>they</hi> may be Serviceable. <hi>O Eternal Spirit of Truth, Who Leadeſt thy Servants into all Truth, Aſſiſt and Proſper my Undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Illuſtrious Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> Some that Profeſs the Belief of it, very Sinfully <hi>Pervert</hi> it, as if it were a Doctrine Calculated either for the <hi>Security,</hi> or the <hi>Diſcouragement,</hi> of them who ſhould be brought unto <hi>Repentance;</hi> to make Sinful Men, either <hi>Preſumptuous</hi> or <hi>Deſperate,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:001256_0003_0FB18A3C357A1BF8"/>
Whereupon the Doctrine is decried by the Sons of Pride and Profaneneſs, as if it were an <hi>Uſeleſs,</hi> yea, and an <hi>Hurtful</hi> Doctrine, and as if it were beſt of all never at all to meddle with it.</p>
            <p>A Glorious Doctrine of Chriſtianity, has been <hi>Crucifyed</hi> between <hi>Two Thieves:</hi> It muſt be <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Sword;</hi> the <hi>dear</hi> Truth muſt be <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Power of the Dog:</hi> A <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> muſt be ſet upon the Head thereof.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> hath its Myſteries, its Abſtruſe Difficulties, and Soaring Sublimities. But, for men to pretend therefore, that it ſhould be Silenced and Smothered &amp; Shut out of Sermons, is for them to be, as the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Leyden</hi> juſtly Expreſſed it, <hi>Praepoſtere Cauti,</hi> more <hi>Nice</hi> than <hi>Wiſe,</hi> more Cautious than they need to be; and there is uſually, <hi>A Snake in the Graſs,</hi> when ſuch a <hi>Doctrine of Godlineſs</hi> is much <hi>hiſſed</hi> at. We find, the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> Propoſed by our LORD, and His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, with a very frequent Inculcation; We find, that it hath a wondrous Tendency to the <hi>Edification</hi> of the Faithful in their <hi>moſt Holy Faith,</hi> and the Ignorance of it mutilates the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of God, and cheriſhes the <hi>Vice</hi> of man, in very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Inſtances. Briefly, Tis no little part of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and we do not fully Preach the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Declaring the whole Counſel of God,</hi> if there be nothing of <hi>this</hi> Declared.</p>
            <p>This is a thing to be ſet before you, in the moſt advantageous Terms that I can meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001256_0004_0FB18A3D6713FF70"/>
And where can any be met withal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thoſe in the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> among thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which are Subſcribed by all the Allowed Clergy of the Nation!</p>
            <p>PREDESTINATION <hi>to Life, is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Purpoſe of God, whereby before the Foundations of the World were laid, He hath conſtantly Decreed by His Counſel, ſecret to us, to deliver from Curſe and Damnation, thoſe whom He hath Choſen in Chriſt Ieſus out of Mankind, and to bring them by Chriſt to Everlaſting Salvation, as Veſſels made to Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It Proceeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Godly Confideration of</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DESTINATION <hi>and our Election in Chriſt, is full of Sweet, Pleaſant and Vnſpeakable Comfort to Godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſuch as feel in themſeves the workings of the Spirit of Chriſt, — as well becauſe it doth Eſtabliſh and Confirm their Faith of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to be Enjoy'd thro' Chriſt, as becauſe it doth frequently kindle their Love towards God; ſo for curious and carnal Perſons lacking the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, to have continually before their Eyes, the Sentence of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, is a moſt dangerous Down fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001256_0005_0FB18A3FF92F6780"/>The Doctrine ſo Plainly <hi>Aſſerted</hi> by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is every Day ſo Unaccountably De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried, and Reproached, by many from whom One could not with any <hi>Reaſon</hi> have Expected it, many, who boaſt themſelves <hi>the Sons of the Church;</hi> that it is high Time for us, to do what we may, to <hi>Magnify it and make it Honourable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord-Redeemer is now Preaching of the Doctrine. He had a very ſorrowful Sight before Him; the <hi>Unbelief,</hi> the General and the Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Unbelief of the People to whom He had been Exhibited. That our Lord might Comfort Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the <hi>Unſucceſsfulneſs</hi> of His Miniſtry, and that He might preſerve others from the <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> therein Laid before them, He Propounds, the <hi>Decree</hi> of God in His Eternal <hi>Predeſtination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What elſe can we have, in any meaſure to allay the Diſcompoſure of our Minds, when we ſee the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hitherto ſo little Crown'd with <hi>Succeſs</hi> in the World! <hi>All that the Father gives to me,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>ſhall come to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis plainly Aſſerted, That <hi>every one, who is given</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by God the Father, ſhall at one Time or other by Faith <hi>come unto Him.</hi> Tis plainly Aſſerted, That theſe Perſons are <hi>given</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, before they do by Faith <hi>come unto Him.</hi> Hence it follows, That the <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of any to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by God the Father, is not His <hi>Bringing</hi> them to <hi>Believe</hi> on Him. If it be <hi>Before</hi> their Believing, we ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001256_0006_0FB18A427110DA20"/>
ſoon find it to be, as other of the Divine Oracles have told us, <hi>From all Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the DOCTRINE to be inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are Some, whom God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has from all Eternity given unto our Lord-Redeemer, to be brought by Him unto Eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs; and all that are ſo Given unto our Lord, ſhall in Time come unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not imagine, That I am going to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with Unprofitable Speculations. No; Your Entertainment ſhall be a <hi>Great Myſtery of Godlineſs;</hi> I ſhall uſe my beſt contrivance, that every Stroke of it may be moſt ſenſibly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient unto the Deſigns of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> Shall we prove, <hi>That there are Some, whom God has from all Eternity Choſen, to be brought unto Eternal Bleſſedneſs?</hi> They who Diſpute this, <hi>do Err, not knowing the Scripture, nor the Nature of God.</hi> Indeed, the <hi>Chriſtian Fathers</hi> did not ſo often and ſo clearly Expreſs themſelves about our <hi>Eternal Election,</hi> before the <hi>Pelagian Hereſy</hi> made much Diſturbance, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> and Others did afterwards. But the Word of God is very Poſitive; [Rom. 8.29.] That there are Some, <hi>Whom God did Fore-know, and whom He did Fore-know, He alſo did Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001256_0007_0FB18A43E43341F8"/>
to be conformed unto the Image of His Son.</hi> And, [2 Theſſ. 2.13.] That there are Some, <hi>Whom God has from the Beginning Choſen to Salvation.</hi> And, [1 Pet. 1.2.] That there are Some, <hi>Elect according to the Fore knowledge of God the Father.</hi> Do we not read, [Rev. 13.8.] Of, <hi>Names Written in the Book of Life of the Slain Lamb, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World?</hi> In the Word of God, we find a Remarkable Diſtinction, [1 Theſſ. 5.9.] Between Some <hi>Appointed unto Wrath,</hi> and Others <hi>Appointed to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Import of theſe paſſages, will ſoon be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if you will but lay together a few Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Concluſions.</p>
            <p>There is an <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs;</hi> or, a <hi>Reſt which remains for the People of God,</hi> yea, a State wherein God ſhall become <hi>All in All</hi> unto His People. No body doubts of this.</p>
            <p>There are Some who do arrive to <hi>Eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs;</hi> And they are but <hi>Some; Some</hi> there are who <hi>fall ſhort of Entering into Reſt.</hi> No body doubts of this.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs</hi> is the gift of <hi>God;</hi> None ever come to <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs,</hi> but ſuch as are by the Bleſſed GOD Himſelf brought unto it. No body doubts of this.</p>
            <p>God from all Eternity does infallibly <hi>Fore know</hi> whom He will bring unto <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</hi> It can't be ſaid of any Perſon in the <hi>Eternal Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> That God once did not infallibly <hi>Fore know</hi> whether this Perſon ſhould ever come unto it.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001256_0008_0FB18A4569ECECE8"/>
Can any body doubt of this?</p>
            <p>Once more; The <hi>Eternal Certainty</hi> of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſedneſs</hi> to be granted unto theſe and thoſe Perſons, cannot ariſe from the Perſons themſelves, who are not yet in Being; It can ariſe from nothing but <hi>God</hi> Himſelf Determining of it; from nothing but the <hi>Determination</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>The Sum of the Argument is this.</p>
            <p>If it be Certainly and Exactly <hi>Fore known</hi> by God from all Eternity, Who ſhall be brought by Him to <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs,</hi> then it is <hi>Decreed</hi> by God; there is in the <hi>Will</hi> of God a <hi>Determination</hi> of it. But there is a moſt <hi>Certain Fore knowledge</hi> of God, <hi>(unto whom all His Works are known from the Beginning,)</hi> even from all Eternity, Aſſuring Him, who ſhall be brought by Him to Eternal Bleſſedneſs. God forbid, We ſhould ſo derogate from His Infinite Majeſty, as if He did not from all <hi>Eternity</hi> moſt certainly <hi>Know</hi> what ſhall come to paſs in <hi>Time: Lord, Thy Underſtanding is Infinite!</hi> Therefore, it remains, That there are Some Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by a <hi>Decree</hi> of God, from all Eternity, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Upon this Argument, our <hi>Twiſs</hi> openly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the whole Nation of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> he truly ſayes of it, It is, <hi>Nullo humano acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Solubile;</hi> It is unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>But now, My Hearers, Let us make a Pauſe. This admirable Truth ſhall not go out of our Hands, until we feel it make a moſt Heart-melting Impreſſion on our Hearts.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001256_0009_0FB18A46E1FB95C0"/>§. We will Enquire, firſt; <hi>Whether they whom God has from all Eternity Choſen to Eternal Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may come to Know that they are ſo Choſen to it, while they are yet but in the way loading to it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes; They may. They may <hi>Know</hi> it, by their being <hi>in the way leading to it;</hi> For it is, <hi>The Way Everlaſting.</hi> There are ſome, whoſe Priviledge is that, 1 Theſſ. 1.4. <hi>Knowing your Election of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how ſhall we attain to this Priviledge?</p>
            <p>O Child of God; <hi>Say not in thy Heart,</hi> who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, to ſee whether I have my <hi>Name Written in Heaven?</hi> Who ſhall bring down to me the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am Enroll'd in that Book or no? The Proof of all this matter is <hi>Nigh</hi> unto thee; Tis in thy own Heart, in thy own Life; There it may be met withal. Oh! Give a Great Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
            <p>You have <hi>not forgotten the Exhortation, that ſo ſpeaks unto you;</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give Diligence to make your Calling and Election Sure.</hi> If you are <hi>Sure,</hi> That you are <hi>Effectually Called,</hi> you may be <hi>Sure,</hi> That you are <hi>Eternally Choſen</hi> of God. The matter may <hi>at this Moment</hi> be brought unto a wondrous Iſſue. The <hi>Call</hi> of our Great Saviour is at this Moment made from Heaven unto every one of us; <hi>Look unto me, and be Saved; come unto me, that I may make you Wiſe, and Righteous and Holy and Happy.</hi> May the Spirit of Grace now fall upon us; may our Conquered Souls comply with the Call, and Reply to it; <hi>Lord, I Look!
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001256_0010_0FB18A48AF80F320"/>
Lord, I come! Lord; Thou haſt made me willing to take thee for my Saviour, my Leader, my Ruler for ever more!</hi> From this Moment, O Regenerated Souls, you may take for granted your <hi>Election</hi> of God; you may take it for granted; <hi>My God will now give me to ſee the Good of His Choſen, and rejoyce with the gladneſs of His Nation, and Glory with His Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read, Act. 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained unto Eternal Life believed.</hi> Examine then; <q>Do I <hi>Believe</hi> on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Is my whole <hi>Reliance</hi> upon Him, as my <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> for my Peace with God? Am I heartily Reſign'd unto Him, for Him to <hi>Guide me by Counſil, and bring me to Glory?</hi>
               </q> If it be ſo, then be of Good Comfort; Thou art moſt certainly <hi>Ordained unto Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read, Eph. 1.4. <hi>He has Choſen us, that we ſhould be Holy.</hi> Examine then; <q>Am I <hi>Holy?</hi> Do I follow nothing ſo much as <hi>Holineſs?</hi> Do I La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nothing ſo much as my want of <hi>Holineſs?</hi> Do I Sincerely <hi>Dedicate</hi> my ſelf unto God? Would I fain be entirely Poſſeſſed by <hi>God,</hi> and have my All employ'd in Serving of Him?</q> If it be ſo, then be of Good Comfort; God who <hi>knows who are His,</hi> has <hi>Choſen</hi> thee for one of His.</p>
            <p>Go on, and bring the Matter to this <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi> We read; 1 Joh. 4.19. <hi>We Love Him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He firſt Loved us.</hi> Even ſo; <hi>We chuſe God, becauſe He firſt choſe us.</hi> Bring it under an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Examination.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001256_0011_0FB18A49DF1BBEC0"/>
There is a Twofold <hi>Satisfaction</hi> Profered unto you; A Satisfaction in <hi>Creatures,</hi> and, A Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in <hi>God.</hi> You have once <hi>Choſen</hi> a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Creatures.</hi> Do you Bewayl, Diſclaim, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke that <hi>Choice?</hi> Do you now <hi>Chuſe over again?</hi> Tis <hi>Religion,</hi> (Perhaps in the very <hi>Etymology</hi> of the Word) ſo to do.

Lam. 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul; therefore I will hope in Him?</hi> And, Pſal. 119.57. <hi>Thou art my Portion, O Lord; I have ſaid, that I would keep thy Words.</hi> Do you <hi>Chuſe</hi> rather to have the <hi>knowledge</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Image,</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Favour</hi> of GOD, than to have all the Good Things of a Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>World?</hi> Is this the <hi>Choice</hi> and the Voice of your Minds; <hi>Lord, There is nothing that I deſire in compariſon of thee!</hi> Then, Rejoyce, O <hi>Choſen</hi> Soul, <hi>Rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory;</hi> God has <hi>Choſen</hi> thee to <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt. Will you not Admire, <hi>O Choſen of God,</hi> Admire the <hi>Abſolute Sovereignty</hi> of God in His <hi>Chuſing</hi> of you! Vaſt is the <hi>Difference</hi> which the <hi>Choice</hi> of God puts between One Man and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But what is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of His putting ſuch a <hi>Difference?</hi> Tis even ſo, <hi>Lord, Meerly becauſe it pleaſes thee.</hi> Thus we are adviſed; Rom. 9.16, 18. <hi>It is not of him that Willeth, nor of him that Runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy: He hath Mercy on whom He well.</hi> Why has our God <hi>Elected</hi> One, and <hi>Rejected</hi> Another? Tis that <hi>Firſt Cauſe</hi> of all things, that is the <hi>Sole Cauſe</hi> of this; namely, The <hi>Will</hi> of the Glorious One. The <hi>Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> of God is wonderfully Exerted in this matter; and <hi>He will give none Account of the matter.</hi> Is the Fore-ſight of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why God has <hi>Choſen</hi> us? Then ſay, We <hi>firſt</hi> chooſe God <hi>before</hi> He chooſes us! Not at all. It was a Text often quoted by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to confute this Fancy; Joh. 15.16. <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> We are choſen TO <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> not choſen FOR our Foreſeen <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> They are the <hi>Effects</hi> of our <hi>Election;</hi> they cannot be the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it. Our Gods <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> preſuppoſes His purpoſe to beſtow <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> upon us; For theſe are alwayes the <hi>Gifts of God.</hi> Now this very purpoſe is our <hi>Election</hi> it ſelf; And hence,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001256_0013_0FB18A4FC2BB3030"/>
the <hi>Fore-ſight</hi> of thoſe <hi>Gifts</hi> cannot be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Election.</hi> What ſayes our Apoſtle? Rom. 9.11. <hi>The Purpoſe of God, according to Election, tis not of Works.</hi> Our <hi>Election</hi> is indeed <hi>Abſolute.</hi> No Decree of God is <hi>Conditional,</hi> tho God may decree a <hi>Condition.</hi> It were derogatory to the Perfection of God, for His <hi>Decree,</hi> to depend on any <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> tho' the Things Decreed, may in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, do ſo. The Decree of <hi>Election</hi> is not, <hi>That if we will Believe we ſhall be Saved,</hi> but it is, <hi>That we ſhall be Saved, and that in order to it we ſhall believe.</hi> So <hi>Abſolute</hi> our <hi>Election.</hi> And how <hi>Gratuitous!</hi> Altogether <hi>Free.</hi> The Great God is <hi>Bleſſed</hi> for ever in and of Himſelf. He has no <hi>Need</hi> of <hi>Us.</hi> He was under no <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> to <hi>Chuſe</hi> any of us unto Eternal Bleſſedneſs. If He would chuſe <hi>any,</hi> He was under no <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to pitch upon <hi>Such</hi> or <hi>Such,</hi> Make thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, O <hi>Choſen Veſſel.</hi> 
               <q>Oh! why am I a <hi>Choſen Veſſel of Mercy,</hi> and not a <hi>Veſſel of Wrath!</hi> Why would God ſet His Love upon <hi>me,</hi> rather than upon another! <hi>Lord, Thou Loveſt, Becauſe thou Loveſt!</hi> Be Satisfied, O my Soul, Be Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in the uncontroleable, the unaccountable <hi>Will of God,</hi> as the only <hi>Cauſe</hi> of His <hi>Chuſing</hi> me for His own.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; Will you not Admire, <hi>O Choſen of God,</hi> Admire the <hi>Eternity</hi> from which He has <hi>Choſen</hi> you, the <hi>Eternity</hi> to which he has <hi>Choſen</hi> you.</p>
            <p>Look <hi>Backwards.</hi> When was it that our God firſt made His <hi>Choice</hi> of us? We read, Eph. 1.4.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001256_0014_0FB18A50D4DC6C70"/>
               <hi>He has choſen us before the Foundation of the World.</hi> Then, it was before the very Firſt Dawn of <hi>Time;</hi> For, <hi>Time</hi> is but the <hi>Duration of the World.</hi> And thus, we are told, That God has a <hi>Gracious Purpoſe concerning us, before the World began.</hi> A Ridiculous Abſurdity it is, to imagine, That a Man is not <hi>Elected,</hi> until God has waited all the Time of a Mans Life, to ſee whether he will <hi>Perſevere</hi> in a Courſe of Well-doing, or no. Far from it! <hi>Before the Mountains were ſettled, while God had not yet made the Earth, nor the Higheſt part of the Duſt of the World,</hi> Even then were we <hi>Choſen</hi> of God. How does the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Dayes</hi> comfort us! Jer. 31.3. <hi>I have Loved thee with an Everlaſting Love.</hi> Think, O moſt undeſerving Object of <hi>Love:</hi> 
               <q>When did the Lord <hi>Begin</hi> to Think of beſtowing His <hi>Love</hi> and His <hi>Life</hi> upon me! Truly, His Thoughts of <hi>Love</hi> to me never did <hi>Begin:</hi> but they have been <hi>from Everlaſting;</hi> and <hi>Ever of Old;</hi> Tho' I am one of the <hi>pooreſt</hi> and <hi>vileſt,</hi> and moſt Worthleſs Things in the World, yet my God has been <hi>Thinking upon me,</hi> and had His Kind purpoſes concerning me, infinitely before the Foundation of the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Look <hi>Forwards.</hi> Will the Lord Repent of His <hi>Choice?</hi> Never; Never. 'Tis unaltarable. We read, 1 Sam. 15.29. <hi>He is not a man, that he ſhould Repent.</hi> The <hi>Choice</hi> made of us, 'tis an Act of Him, whoſe Name is, <hi>I am that I am;</hi> and, <hi>The God who changes not.</hi> There is nothing wanting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001256_0015_0FB18A5222BCB340"/>
in His <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or His <hi>Power;</hi> What can there be to Diſpoſe Him to a <hi>Change?</hi> He abides firm to His Intentions. <hi>The purpoſe of the Lord ſhall Stand,</hi> and, <hi>I will do all my pleaſure, ſaith the Lord.</hi> We have ſuch Tidings from Heaven to fortify us; Rom. 8.39. <hi>Nothing ſhall be able to Separate us from the Love of God.</hi> If <hi>Elected,</hi> then how <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed?</hi> The Earth may be Removed, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains may be overturned, the Pillars of Heaven may tremble; but our Hope of Heaven is laid on a <hi>Foundation that cannot be Shaken!</hi> Think, O Son of well-founded <hi>Hope:</hi> 
               <q>The God who is Reſolved, That He will ſurely do me Good, will never alter His Reſolution. I am a poor, feeble, fickle creature; &amp; I ſhould ſoon <hi>Caſt off God,</hi> if I were left unto my ſelf; But He has purpoſed that He will not <hi>Caſt off me;</hi> and therefore He will not Leave me unto my ſelf. I ſhall be <hi>kept by the mighty power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> We muſt proceed now to Obſerve; <hi>That there is an Eternal <hi>Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wherein God the Father Gave His Choſen Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unto our Lord-Redeemer, for Him to bring us unto Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</hi> The <hi>Choſen</hi> of God, are ſuch as the <hi>Father</hi> has <hi>Given</hi> unto our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. We read, Eph. 1.4. <hi>He has Choſen us in Him.</hi> Our LORD Himſelf is the <hi>Firſt Choſen,</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi> of all the <hi>Choſen;</hi> and all the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> are committed into His Glorious <hi>Hands.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001256_0016_0FB18A5425DA1810"/>Let us take in the Evangelical <hi>Idea</hi> of the Matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt; In the Eternal <hi>Election</hi> of God, it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, That Such and Such, <hi>[The Perſons are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and the Number of thoſe Perſons is with God!]</hi> They are to be <hi>Heirs of God,</hi> and <hi>Joint-Heirs</hi> with His <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in the Eternal Bleſſedneſs. But the Decree alſo Permitted theſe Heirs of <hi>Life,</hi> to <hi>Fall</hi> into wretched circumſtances, that ſhould render it Neceſſary for the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to take upon Him, the Character of a REDEEMER for them. Wherefore, in the Eternal <hi>Election</hi> of God, the <hi>Son</hi> of God was <hi>Ordained</hi> the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of His <hi>Choſen,</hi> and <hi>Appointed</hi> to do all that was to be done in the <hi>Redemption</hi> that muſt bring us, to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bleſſedneſs. But now, the Son of God, was wholly <hi>Free,</hi> about His own coming into the <hi>Decree</hi> of a <hi>Redeemer;</hi> He moſt <hi>Freely</hi> came into it; It was with his <hi>Free,</hi> and Fair and Full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; It was without any <hi>Compulſion</hi> that He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Man. Hence it is, that the Tranſaction between God the Father, and out Lord-Redeemer, in the <hi>Decree</hi> for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> of Man, is moſt fitly repreſented in the Form of a <hi>Covenant;</hi> which we call, <hi>The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption.</hi> With an Eye to this wonderful Tranſaction, we find that paſſage in our <hi>Lively Oracles;</hi> Pſal. 89.3. <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen, I have Sworn unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid my Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very Surpriſing to find, in the Writings
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001256_0017_0FB18A55AA1E97C0"/>
of the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, a confeſſion of this <hi>Myſtery.</hi> A Book of theirs, called <hi>Peſikta,</hi> recites this, as a <hi>Dialogue</hi> between the <hi>Almighty</hi> and the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>GOD, beginning to make a <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> Spake thus to Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They whoſe Sins are unknown to thee, would impoſe a Yoke of Iron upon thee, by which they will make thee, like to a Young Heifer, almoſt Blind with Labour, and they will deſtroy thee; Becauſe of their Iniquity, thy Tongue ſhall cleave unto the Roof of thy Mouth.

                  <q>MESSIAH.] I willingly Submit to it, on Condition that no Iſraelite Periſh, but that they ſhall all be Saved; thoſe that are born after my Time, and thoſe that are already Dead, ſince Adam.</q>

            <p>O ye Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> that cannot bear to hear of a <hi>Suffering Meſſiah,</hi> what can you ſay to this Quotation?</p>
            <p>To go on; In this <hi>Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Great GOD commits the care of His Choſen, unto the Charge of our Lord-Redeemer.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001256_0018_0FB18A57F98422E8"/>
Tis becauſe of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> that our Lord could ſay; Joh. 17.2. <hi>Thou haſt given Him Power over all Fleſh, that He ſhould give Eternal Life unto as many as thou haſt given Him.</hi> God the <hi>Father</hi> then propounded unto the <hi>Son;</hi> 
               <q>There are ſuch and ſuch, whom I <hi>Chuſe,</hi> to be brought unto a Glorious and Intimate <hi>Communion</hi> with thee, in thy <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi> I put theſe my <hi>Choſen</hi> into thy Hands, for thee to <hi>Redeem</hi> them out of all the Wretchedneſs, from whence they muſt be <hi>Raiſed,</hi> before they can come to that <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi> Do Thou, <hi>O Mine Elect, in whom my Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,</hi> Do Thou undertake the Work of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> for theſe my <hi>Choſen;</hi> I will do all that belongs to Me, for thy <hi>Encouragement</hi> in this Excellent Undertaking.</q> [See, Pſal. 40.8. and, Iſa. 42.1, 4. and, Iſa. 49.6, 8. and, Iſa. 53.10, 12. and, Tit. 1.2, 3. and, Heb. 12.2. <hi>The Joy ſet before Him.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Our Lord-Redeemer then Accepted the <hi>Charge</hi> thus Committed unto Him. He took the very <hi>Names</hi> of thoſe, for whom He would become an <hi>Atonement</hi> and an <hi>Advocate.</hi> He Promiſed unto His Eternal <hi>Father,</hi> That He would not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Man,</hi> but alſo be <hi>Born of a Woman,</hi> and be <hi>Made under the Law,</hi> and <hi>Appear in the Form of a Servant,</hi> and become <hi>Obedient unto the Death of the Croſs,</hi> and thoroughly diſcharge the part of a <hi>Surety</hi> for His <hi>Choſen,</hi> and <hi>Save them unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</hi> [See, Heb. 10.5, 7. and, Joh. 14.31.]</p>
            <p>Hence it is, That the <hi>Choſen</hi> of God, even
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001256_0019_0FB18A5AA7EE9860"/>
while they are yet in their Sins, are called, Joh. 10.16. <hi>The Sheep of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Yea, He vouchſafes to call them; Heb. 2.13. <hi>The Children which God has given me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally. There is a <hi>Special Intent</hi> in the Heart of God, and of our Lord Redeemer, that they who are <hi>Choſen</hi> by God, and <hi>Given</hi> to the Lord-Redeemer, ſhall have a <hi>Diſtinguiſhed</hi> and <hi>Peculiar</hi> Share in His <hi>Redemption.</hi> Our Lord-Redeemer has Engaged, and Obeyed, and Suffered, with a <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> and a <hi>Peculiar Eye,</hi> to thoſe whom the <hi>Father has Given unto Him.</hi> The <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Succeſs,</hi> of our Lords Engagement in the Work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> depends not meerly upon the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,</hi> of what Reſpect the <hi>Free-Will</hi> of Man, may <hi>happen</hi> in Time to ſhow unto it. For ſo, it might <hi>happen,</hi> That <hi>no man</hi> at all ſhould ever be the better for that <hi>Redemption:</hi> which muſt by no means be imagined! Our Lord, in the work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> has bought <hi>Faith</hi> for Some; He has bought this <hi>Favour</hi> for ſome, <hi>That they ſhall by Faith be brought actually to Enjoy the Benefits of His Redemption.</hi> Oh! Let none of the <hi>Faithful</hi> be ſo Ungrateful, as to ſay, <hi>My Faith is a Grace, which the Blood of my Redeemer never bought for me!</hi> If <hi>this Grace</hi> be <hi>Bought</hi> for any; the Grace, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and by Receiving to Enjoy, the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Then it muſt be <hi>Bought</hi> for a <hi>Special Number,</hi> who are known unto the Lord. Surely, The Great God never ſo fully <hi>Intended</hi> the <hi>Redemption</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001256_0020_0FB18A5BE419B6E8"/>
for thoſe, who He from Eternity <hi>Fore-knew,</hi> would never come to partake in the Advantage of it, as for thoſe whom, <hi>He Gave to the Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> Never ſay, Sirs, Never ſay, That <hi>Peter</hi> was no more beholden to his <hi>Lord-Redeemer,</hi> than <hi>Judas!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well; But, my Hearers, Let us again make a Pauſe. We have before us a <hi>Truth,</hi> with which we are Singularly Illuminated: You ſhall ſee, what Incomparable <hi>Good,</hi> what <hi>Honey of the Rock,</hi> will preſently be Dropping from it.</p>
            <p>§. We will Enquire, firſt; <hi>Whether a Man may come to know, that he is from all Eternity in the Covenant of Redemption given by God the Father to our Lord-Redeemer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes; He may. And you that are now before the Lord, may immediately come to know, That God has <hi>Given</hi> you unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. You may know it by this Unqueſtionable Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. <hi>Do you give your ſelves unto the Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST? One whom the <hi>Father had given</hi> to our Lord, came to <hi>know</hi> it, by his being Able to Say; 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that He is able to keep that which I have Committed unto Him.</hi> I will Say; Do you <hi>know,</hi> that you have ſo <hi>Believed</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as to <hi>Commit your ſelves</hi> unto Him? The Lord-Redeemer ſays, <hi>My Son, Give me thy Heart.</hi> Is this now your Anſwer to the Lord-Redeemer? <hi>Lord, I would fain Give thee my Heart!
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001256_0021_0FB18A5D9A720500"/>
Oh! Give me the Grace to give thee my Heart, and my All!</hi> Diſtreſſed Soul; Doſt thou <hi>Give</hi> up thy ſelf unto the Conduct of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as thy <hi>Shepherd,</hi> thy <hi>Great Shepherd,</hi> and thy <hi>Good Shepherd,</hi> wiſhing to be led by Him in the <hi>Pathes of Righteouſneſs?</hi> Doſt thou <hi>Give up</hi> thy ſelf unto Him, with that Supplication, that Expectation; <hi>Lord, I am thine; Save me!</hi> It is then beyond all Queſtion, That God from all Eternity has <hi>Given</hi> thee to thy <hi>Lord-Redeemer: Thy Name</hi> is in the Liſt of thoſe, for whom He did become a <hi>Lord-Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, We will ſo expreſs it. If a Man come into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> he may be ſure, that he is in the <hi>Covenant of Redemption.</hi> There is a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein the Great GOD offers to be <hi>Our God.</hi> All the <hi>Sure Mercies</hi> of our <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> JESUS are offered unto us, in this <hi>Everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Have you Really and Heartily come into this <hi>Covenant?</hi> Have you Embraced God the <hi>Father,</hi> as your <hi>Father;</hi> God the <hi>Son,</hi> as your <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi> God the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as your <hi>Leader?</hi> And have you Reſolved, That you will with His Help <hi>Live</hi> to Him, and <hi>Walk</hi> with Him, to the End of your Lives? Is this your wiſh: <hi>O Great God, be thou my God; O my God, make me thy Servant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Covenant.</hi> We read, Ezek. 16.8. <hi>I Entred into Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt Mine.</hi> This I will ſay; The <hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> did firſt make us <hi>the Lords,</hi> if in the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> we are become <hi>the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001256_0022_0FB18A5F095897E8"/>§. But we will next Enquire; <hi>Whether there be no Special Duties, wherein they that know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Given to the Lord-Redeemer in the Covenant of Redemption, ſhould be thereby drawn to Glorify God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many <hi>Duties,</hi> many <hi>Duties,</hi> become now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on you, O you whom the Lord has thus wonderfully comforted.</p>
            <p>Methinks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The firſt of them ſhould be, To <hi>Wonder</hi> at the Goodneſs of God unto us, and even unto us who are <hi>Sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> that we are admitted into the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the moſt Glorious Tranſaction that ever was. We have an Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to an Acquaintance, with that Secret and Glorious Tranſaction, <hi>The Covenant of Redemption.</hi> We have Learnt the very Words, as I may ſay, of the Conſultation that Paſſed between God the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> at the <hi>Council-Table</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when there was none elſe preſent, but that Principal <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, who has Revealed it. The <hi>Fifty Third</hi> Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> has a Copy of them. Oh! Wondrous <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> of Him, who <hi>Humbles Himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things that are done in Heaven,</hi> to tell us, pittiful Worms upon the Earth, what <hi>He Himſelf did in Heaven</hi> from all Eternity! Will any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> call that, <hi>A Fiction,</hi> which is indeed the very Marrow and Subſtance of the <hi>Glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Bleſſed God;</hi> the very <hi>Fountain</hi> of all our <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs!</hi> O Sinful Ingratitude, unto Him, that has even <hi>Lifted us up to Heaven,</hi> by communicating unto us, theſe <hi>Deep things of the Spirit of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001256_0023_0FB18A62062EE6A8"/>But then, there Enſues another point of <hi>Practice</hi> for us, which is indeed the <hi>Sum</hi> of all <hi>Practical Chriſtianity:</hi> Tis that; Heb. 12.2. <hi>Looking unto</hi> JESUS. Whither ſhall we now Look for every thing, but unto Him, unto whom the <hi>Father</hi> has <hi>Given</hi> us, that He may <hi>Give</hi> all unto us; that is to ſay, Our Lord JESUS CHRIST. This, This muſt be the continual Sentiment of our Minds; <q>If ever I come to <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs,</hi> it is my <hi>Lord-Redeemer</hi> that muſt bring me to it; Why has God the <hi>Father given</hi> me to the <hi>Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer?</hi> Tis becauſe my <hi>Lord-Redeemer</hi> is to do all for me. <hi>Unto thee then, O Lord-Redeemer, I Look for all.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> What remains is; <hi>That all that are from Eternity Choſen by God, and given to the Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, ſhall in due Time come unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Link in the <hi>Golden Chain of Salvation;</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom He did Predeſtinate, them He alſo called.</hi> It is a <hi>Chain</hi> that ſhall never be broken: It lies not at the Arbitrary <hi>Determination</hi> of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>Free-Will,</hi> whether it ſhall be broken or no. God will ſo move by His Powerful <hi>Grace</hi> upon the <hi>Will,</hi> of ſuch as are <hi>Choſen</hi> for Himſelf, and <hi>Given</hi> to His Chriſt, that it ſhall not be broken. Tho' we do not know the <hi>Way of the Spirit,</hi> in this illuſtrious part of the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> over the World, nor <hi>After what manner,</hi> the God who <hi>forms the Spirit of Man within him,</hi> does Effectually move His People by His <hi>Verticordious Influences,</hi> and yet
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001256_0024_0FB18A6535944348"/>
not Extinguiſh or Overwhelm the <hi>Free-Will</hi> of the <hi>Rational Creature:</hi> Yet this we know, The <hi>Determination</hi> of this point, <hi>Who Will,</hi> and, <hi>Who Will not,</hi> be brought unto the <hi>Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> is not left unto ſuch a <hi>Contingency,</hi> as what the <hi>Free-Will</hi> of a Fallen and Corrupt <hi>Man,</hi> only addreſs'd with a <hi>Moral Swaſion,</hi> ſhall pleaſe to do concerning it. The <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> will with his own <hi>Peculiar Influences,</hi> infallibly bring about the <hi>Effectual Vocation,</hi> of all thoſe whom He has <hi>Choſen</hi> for Himſelf, and <hi>Given</hi> to His Chriſt; and, what tho' the <hi>Manner</hi> of His <hi>Working</hi> upon the Minds of His People, be not fully to be <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended?</hi> It is no little part of the <hi>Homage,</hi> which we owe unto the Glorious GOD, Humbly to admire and adore His Conduct, and acknowledge it <hi>Incomprehenſible!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> I find <hi>Giants</hi> to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with.</p>
            <p>There is a very Numerous party of men, in the World, who hold no <hi>Grace</hi> neceſſary to bring a Sinner into a State of Salvation, but only that which they call <hi>Moral Grace,</hi> or, <hi>Moral Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> and which amounts to no more than a <hi>Rational Propoſal</hi> of our Duty, <hi>To turn from Sin to God in Chriſt,</hi> with <hi>Reaſonable Conſiderations,</hi> to Excite men unto the doing of this their Duty. <hi>They Deny,</hi> any <hi>purpoſe of Mercy</hi> in God, for any, but what may be obliged by a <hi>Fore-ſight</hi> of the <hi>Good Uſe,</hi> which a Sinner may make of his own <hi>Free-will. They Deny,</hi> all Gracious <hi>Qualities,</hi> created
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001256_0025_0FB18A66649B79A8"/>
in the Heart, or <hi>Will</hi> of a Repenting Sinner by the Spirit of God, and reject the Notion of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Habits. They Deny,</hi> all ſuch Sanctifying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Almighty <hi>Spirit,</hi> on the <hi>Will</hi> of a Sinner, as will or can <hi>Certainly</hi> incline it to act, or incline it any more <hi>to act,</hi> than <hi>not to act.</hi> All that they will allow <hi>Grace</hi> to do, is to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> unto the <hi>Will,</hi> and leave the <hi>Will Indifferent,</hi> and leave it wholly unto the <hi>Determination</hi> of the <hi>Free-Will</hi> in the Sinner, whether the Propoſal ſhall have any Effect or no. Tis no <hi>Special Grace,</hi> which they allow; there is in it, no more done by the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> for them that are <hi>Saved,</hi> than for them that are <hi>Damned.</hi> In the mean time, they aſcribe ſuch a Vaſt Power unto the <hi>Will</hi> of Sinful Man, that they Expreſsly aſſert, <hi>The Will of man cannot be determined unto its Acts by any Irreſiſtible motion,</hi> [Ne ab ipſo Deo quidem!] <hi>no, not from the Great God Himſelf.</hi> They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That when all the <hi>Works of Grace</hi> in order to the Converſion of a Sinner are paſt upon the <hi>Will,</hi> it ſtill remains in the <hi>Free Power</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> to Convert, or not Convert it ſelf. The Lord ſhall not have <hi>His Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Undertaking</hi> of CHRIST, and the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the SPIRIT; ſhall all come to nothing, if the <hi>Will</hi> of Sinful Man, will pleaſe to Reſiſt it all; The Great GOD can <hi>do nothing</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Reſiſtance!</hi> Thus is there an <hi>Idol</hi> Set up, which has more <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> falling down before it, than there did
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001256_0026_0FB18A68144D28A8"/>
before that in the Plain of <hi>Dura</hi> of old. What if the Diſpoſition of a <hi>carnal Mind,</hi> ſo generally, to Dethrone the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and Set up the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> in the Throne of God, ſhould be found, but a <hi>Refined Idolatry</hi> after all?</p>
            <p>It is of Great Conſequence to the Intereſts of our Holy Religion, that we ſhould ſet before you the <hi>Dangerous Tendency</hi> of theſe Opinions.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, Can it be any other than a thing full of <hi>Danger</hi> unto the Souls of Men, to be ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the <hi>Wounds</hi> which <hi>Original Sin</hi> has given unto all the <hi>Faculties</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto our <hi>Wills?</hi> While men ſay, [as the Succeſſors of the ancient <hi>Enemies of Grace,</hi> do expreſsly ſay, and therein indeed <hi>wax worſe and worſe than</hi> the Old <hi>Pelagians,</hi>] <hi>That no immediate Operation of the Spirit upon the Mind or Will, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any one, that he may believe:</hi> they proclame, that they have little Senſe of any <hi>Corruption</hi> in the <hi>Will</hi> of Sinful Man.

            <p>By theſe <hi>Principles</hi> the <hi>Redemption</hi> of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST, has unſufferable Indignities caſt upon it.

Chriſtian, Thy Soul upon due Delibration, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but abhor the Thoughts of <hi>this;</hi> That when <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> have Enriched thee, there ſhould nothing be aſcribed unto the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST on that occaſion? That ſuch <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings,</hi> muſt be no more than meer <hi>Contingencies!</hi> Yea, if it muſt be, as theſe would have it, The <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath not <hi>certainly</hi> purchaſed the Salvation, of <hi>any one</hi> Perſon in the World. Tho' the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord have been offered up, yet, it ſeems, there is no <hi>certainty,</hi> that any <hi>One</hi> Perſon ſhall ever have any Saving Advantage by it. The <hi>Uncertain Will</hi> of Man alone, muſt have the Honour to <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> it.</p>
            <p>What an Affront is given by theſe <hi>Principles,</hi> to the Holy SPIRIT? They allow Him to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us, but only to diſpenſe unto us a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Light,</hi> ſuch as is enjoy'd even by the <hi>Children of Darkneſs;</hi> And that <hi>Light</hi> ſo ineffectual, that the <hi>Will</hi> is not <hi>Effectually Inclined</hi> by it. No more for Him to do but this! Oh! Do not ſo Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> unto whom our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Infinite!</p>
            <p>But there is no End.

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001256_0033_0FB18A756C5EFE58"/>
to <hi>Neglect the Great Salvation,</hi> and perſiſt in the courſe of Sin, which will bring upon you a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Deſtruction from God.</hi> If <hi>Converſion</hi> be in your <hi>own Power,</hi> you will think, that you may take your <hi>own Time</hi> for it; and that you may go on in a courſe of Sin, till you may ſee your <hi>own Time</hi> to break it off. If no <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and no <hi>Hardneſs</hi> can be contracted, but what your own <hi>Will</hi> may ſhake off at pleaſure, and there be no Hazard of a <hi>Peradventure,</hi> whether God may give you <hi>Repentance,</hi> What Encouragement will this give unto Sinful Men, to <hi>go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes,</hi> till they ſee themſelves likely to breathe no longer among their Fellow-Sinners in the World?</p>
            <p>I apprehended if <hi>High Time,</hi> that my Country, ſhould be call'd upon, to watch againſt the <hi>Growth</hi> of theſe <hi>Tares,</hi> or I had not now ſo much inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it. We will go on to clear our <hi>Propoſition.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Why? Becauſe the <hi>Honour</hi> of God and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> make it requiſite, that it ſhould be ſo; and there is nothing to hinder, or to render why it ſhould not be ſo.

But if men do not <hi>Come</hi> unto the Lord, they cannot but miſs of <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs,</hi> Tis a <hi>Faithful Saying,</hi> and worthy to be trembled at; Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that Believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be, Next, asked; <hi>How ſhall they that are Choſen by God, and Given to Chriſt, come unto Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How? Their <hi>Coming</hi> to the Lord, is by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> on Him. Our Lord ſayes as much as this comes to; Joh. 6.35. <hi>He that cometh to me, is he that Believeth on me.</hi> They that are <hi>Choſen of God,</hi> and <hi>Given to Chriſt,</hi> ſhall <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, as unto their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> their <hi>King;</hi> They ſhall <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, with <hi>Petition</hi> to Him, and with <hi>Dependence</hi> on Him, for His <hi>Precious Benefits;</hi> They ſhall <hi>come</hi> unto Him, with ſuch Diſpoſitions; <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> I Repair to thee, <hi>Lord,</hi> I Rely on thee, for <hi>Grace,</hi> for <hi>Glory,</hi> for <hi>Every Good Thing.</hi> I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to <hi>Obey</hi> thee, and Look for that <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> whereof thou art the <hi>Author, to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as Obey thee!</hi>

Inſtead of all <hi>Evil-ſurmiſing,</hi> whom the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord may be <hi>for,</hi> and whom <hi>not,</hi> it is the Duty of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one</hi> preſently and Thankfully to <hi>Accept</hi> of it. The Invitation unto <hi>Every one</hi> of us all is This; <q>Thou art a <hi>Sinner;</hi> A <hi>Sinner</hi> wants a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> provided for thee, is that of a Crucified JESUS. Come, and caſt the <hi>Load</hi> of thy Soul, and place the <hi>Hope</hi> of thy Soul, on that <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and plead it with God, That thou mayeſt for the ſake thereof be Saved from all thy Sins.</q> It may very truly be ſaid, Nothing ſhall hinder thy Salvation by the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, O Sinner, but thy wilful Refuſing of it. Whenever thou doſt become really <hi>Willing</hi> to be <hi>Sprinkled</hi> with the <hi>Blood of the Lumb,</hi> and thereby to have all the

                  <hi>Enmity</hi> between God and thy Soul, taken away, it ſhall be Done; there ſhall be Nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. We have a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, under that moſt agreeable Fygure; Zech. 13.1. <hi>A Fountain Opened.</hi> Come, O periſhng Souls, come every one of you, unto that <hi>Fountain;</hi> Tis in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>Opened</hi> for you: Tis proclaimed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that you ſhall be <hi>Welcome</hi> unto it. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you fall down before the Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and ſincerely ſay, <q>O Glorious Lord; The Benefits of thy precious Blood, I know, thou haſt offered them unto me. I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at thy offer, and by the Help of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, humbly receive thy Blood. Let the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it upon me, be not only to Save me from thy Wrath, but alſo to Cleanſe me from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and to cure all the Maladies of my Soul, I pray thee, I pray thee!</q> Do thus; The Conſequence will be, <hi>Salvation, Salvation</hi> World without End.</p>
               <p>Your Way to the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> I hope, is a little cleared by theſe Meditations.</p>

            <p>AND <hi>is this Thy Voice,</hi> O our Lord RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER? It is verily ſo.

            <p>That ſhort and ſweet Sentence, which we are now taking from the Gracious Lips of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, has been Employ'd by His Almighty Spirit, for the Converſion of many Thouſands. There are <hi>Holy Myriads,</hi> who have upon a <hi>Quickening</hi> from this very Word, <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and found Him as Good as His Word. There are Bright

               <hi>Conſtellations</hi> of Saints in the Heavenly World, who were, by this very Call brought Home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and at laſt into that World. Oh! that this <hi>Faithful Saying</hi> may find the ſame <hi>worthy Acceptation</hi> with you, My Hearers, which it has had with Multitudes that have gone before you!</p>
            <p>Our Glorious Lord-REDEEMER, having firſt comforted Himſelf under the ſad ſight, which He had in the general, and criminal and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Unbelief</hi> of His Hearers; firſt comforted Himſelf with the Aſſurance which He had, <hi>That all His Choſen ſhould come unto Him:</hi> He proceeds unto the comforting of His <hi>Choſen,</hi> who do <hi>Come</hi> unto Him; Comforting of them with an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, <hi>That He will make them welcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall I obſerve, That the <hi>Firſt</hi> Thing before us, is, The <hi>Duty</hi> of a Sinner? I hope, you take this for granted. Certainly, a <hi>Duty</hi> of greater Importance, a <hi>Duty</hi> of better Conſequence, was never ſet before a <hi>Sinner. <hi>To come unto the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </hi> This is the <hi>Duty,</hi> which muſt be done, by every Sinner that will be Saved; the <hi>Duty,</hi> which the Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery of us all does moſt of all turn upon.</p>
            <p>But we will then Obſerve; That the <hi>Next</hi> Thing is, A <hi>Promiſe</hi> to the Sinner who does this <hi>Duty.</hi> The <hi>Expreſſion</hi> is <hi>Negative. <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out.</hi>

him out; No, will I not.</hi> But the <hi>Intention</hi> is <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> Yea, there is more in the <hi>Intention</hi> than can be cloathed with any <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> Our LORD will not <hi>Caſt us cut.</hi> Lord, <hi>What wilt thou then do unto us!</hi> Why, He will <hi>do all that needs to be done,</hi> that we may be brought unto Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs; He will do <hi>beyond all that we can Ask or Think;</hi> He will <hi>Save us unto the uttermoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine of God our Saviour</hi> which now calls for our Attention, is This.</p>
            <q>Our Great <hi>SAVIOUR,</hi> will not Reject any Sinner that comes unto Him; No, tho' the Sin of that Sinner be never ſo great; But He will beſtow His Great Salvation, upon all who diligently Seek Him.</q>
            <p>My Hearers, What, what is the Turning point, of our Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs? <hi>Hearken Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently;</hi> For I am going to tell you.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> All that would be <hi>Saved,</hi> muſt <hi>Come unto the</hi> Great SAVIOUR; Yea, all that <hi>ſhall</hi> be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will</hi> do ſo.</p>
            <p>This will preſently be determined, by but knowing, <hi>What it is to come unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Who can Interpret it ſo well, as our LORD Himſelf? His interpretation, which is infinitely to be Rely'd upon, was, That a <hi>Coming</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:001256_0047_0FB18A929E2B0D90"/>
to Him, is a <hi>Belief</hi> in Him. As it was ſaid, <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe;</hi> ſo we may ſay, <hi>To Believe, is to Come unto our Lord.</hi> Is it indeed ſo? Then ſee what will come of it: We are told by <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, Mark 16.16. <hi>He that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſhall be Saved; but he that Believeth not, ſhall he Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have all the Reaſon imaginable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon this Action. We will briefly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>Action,</hi> of, <hi>Coming unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</hi> And we will Beſeech the God of all Grace, to Diſpoſe and Aſſiſt us all, unto the <hi>Doing</hi> of this <hi>Action,</hi> while we are <hi>Hearing</hi> of it. <hi>O Spirit of Grace, come down upon us, with thy Gracious Influences!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Phraſe, <hi>To Come unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we are ſenſible, it is <hi>Metaphorical;</hi> We are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that FAITH is the thing meant in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor:</hi> The moſt <hi>Precious Grace</hi> that a Sinner can be inſpired withal!</p>
            <p>The Action of a True FAITH, has more than one Reſemblance, in the Oracles of God. It is Reſembled unto the Action of the <hi>Eye,</hi> and called, <hi>A Looking to the Lord;</hi> unto the Action of the <hi>Ear,</hi> and called, <hi>An Hearing, that the Soul may Live;</hi> unto the Action of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and called, <hi>A Feeding on the Lord;</hi> And unto the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Hand,</hi> for which it is called, <hi>A Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him.</hi> Conſider, O Soul, conſider what <hi>Action of the Soul,</hi> can anſwer to every one of theſe Terms; Fall into ſuch a <hi>Full Action;</hi> and

Lift up thy Cry unto thy Saviour; <q>

            </p>
            <p>But now, the <hi>Foot</hi> alſo muſt afford an Action, by which a Saving FAITH ſhall be ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. Tis a <hi>Coming</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And many <hi>Motions</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> are contained in it. Yea, <hi>Awake my whole Soul, and All that is within me, to do this Noble Action!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Come unto the Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST, is, with a Lively FAITH to ADDRESS Him, as the CHRIST of God, and <hi>for ſuch Bleſſings</hi> as are to be Deſired and Expected from the CHRIST of God. More Particularly,</p>
            <p>Firſt; The <hi>Addreſs</hi> with which our <hi>Faith</hi> muſt <hi>Come</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is to <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him as the CHRIST of God.</hi> We do not <hi>come</hi> aright unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST if we do not <hi>come</hi> with that Acknowledgment; Joh. 6.69. <hi>We believe and are ſure, That thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the Living God.</hi> When we <hi>come</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, it is neceſſary, that we have ſome <hi>Knowledge</hi> of His Admirable <hi>Perſon;</hi> yea, that we Admire Him as a Perſon <hi>Altogether Lovely.</hi> In <hi>coming</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, we muſt Behold Him, as <hi>God and Man in One Perſon;</hi> we muſt Behold Him as the Only <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Man; we muſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Him, and make that Confeſſion of Him,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001256_0049_0FB18A969BD62110"/>
Joh. 4.42. <hi>This is indeed the CHRIST, the Saviour of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And that Confeſſion; Act. 4.12. <hi>There is no other Name given among men, whereby we muſt be Saved:</hi> And that Confeſſion; Heb. 5.9. <hi>He becomes the Author of Eternal Salvation, unto all them that Obey Him.</hi> We do not <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, if we do not Confeſs Him to be, The <hi>Son of God</hi> Aſſuming <hi>our Nature,</hi> and with a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from God becoming <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:</hi> An <hi>Offering</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God for us, and now our <hi>Advocate</hi> in the Heavens, and <hi>Sitting at the Right Hand of God</hi> as the <hi>Governour</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>The Language of our Souls, in <hi>coming</hi> to our Lord JESUS CHRIST, muſt be of this Tenour.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O Glorious JESUS; Thou art the CHRIST, <hi>the Son of the Living GOD.</hi> Thou art the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Blood cleanſes from all Sin.</hi> Thou art the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who doeſt <hi>Make us Wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> Thou art the <hi>King,</hi> who doeſt make us Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs.</hi> Thou art the <hi>Wonder of the Heavens,</hi> and Worthy to be <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all Nations</hi> upon Earth. Oh! There is <hi>None to be Compared</hi> with thee! There is no <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> comparable to that of an <hi>intereſt</hi> in thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Addreſs</hi> with which our <hi>Faith</hi> muſt come unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is to <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Expect</hi> from Him, ſuch <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> as the CHRIST of God beſtows upon His People.</p>
            <p>We cannot <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord JESUS
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001256_0050_0FB18A97F6DBAF98"/>
CHRIST, Except we ſee our ſelves <hi>Fallen</hi> from God; <hi>Fallen</hi> and Plunged into horrible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: Except we ſee our ſelves utterly <hi>unable</hi> to Recover our ſelves out of our Sinful and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Circumſtances. In our <hi>coming</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, we muſt have that Anguiſh on our Minds; Rom. 7.24. O <hi>Wretched One that I am?</hi> Such, even ſuch muſt be our Soliloquies; Theſe muſt be our Thoughts, and our Griefs before the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have <hi>Sinned,</hi> I have <hi>Sinned!</hi> And by <hi>Sin</hi> I am now become, how very <hi>Miſerable!</hi> I am De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the <hi>Favour</hi> of GOD, and of the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of GOD, and of the <hi>Image</hi> of GOD. O Dreadful Miſeries! I am Expoſed unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Luſt,</hi> and unto the Tyranny of <hi>Satan,</hi> and unto an Everlaſting <hi>Baniſhment</hi> from God, into <hi>Outer Darkneſs,</hi> among the forlorn <hi>Veſſels of Wrath.</hi> O Fearful Miſeries! O <hi>wretched One that I am! who ſhall Deliver me!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is our <hi>Deliverer.</hi> Our <hi>Deſign</hi> in <hi>coming</hi> to our Lord JESUS CHRIST, muſt be, to obtain <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What? May we be ſo <hi>Selfiſh,</hi> as to aim at our own <hi>Salvation</hi> in <hi>coming</hi> to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Yes; Tis a Laudable <hi>Selfiſhneſs.</hi> A <hi>Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that reſcues a Sinner from his <hi>Enmity</hi> to GOD; A <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> that reſtores a Sinner to the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of GOD; A <hi>Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whereby GOD ſhall have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of Eternal <hi>Glory</hi> from the Sinner: Oh, be not Afraid of Seeking ſuch a <hi>Salvation:</hi> It will be

no Faulty <hi>Self-ſeeking,</hi> you may be Satisfyed.</p>
            <p>But then, What are the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to be ſought from our Saviour, in His <hi>Great Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we <hi>come</hi> unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, He puts this Demand unto us; Matt. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.32. <hi>What will ye that I ſhall do unto you?</hi> We muſt render a fit Anſwer to this Demand. Our Anſwer muſt be; to this Purpoſe.</p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Anſwer muſt be more than ſo; It muſt have this in it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> I <hi>come</hi> unto thee for <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> Oh! Guide me in the <hi>Way of Peace!</hi> Oh! cauſe me to know the <hi>Things of my Everlaſting Peace!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And there muſt be yet more in our Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt go thus far.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Lord,</hi> I <hi>come</hi> unto thee for <hi>Government.</hi> Oh! Conquer my Rebellious Heart, and Incline me to Love and Keep thy <hi>Laws;</hi> Oh! make me a Conqueror over all my <hi>Spiritual Adverſaries!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch as theſe Bleſſings, are we to Propound, in our <hi>coming</hi> unto our Lord.</p>
            <p>That our <hi>Addreſs</hi> in our <hi>coming</hi> may not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, there are Two Qualifications of it, that are to be Endeavoured.</p>
            <p>Firſt. We may not <hi>Separate</hi> the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> for which we <hi>come</hi> unto Him. God has <hi>Joyn'd</hi> them; God will not own the Man that
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001256_0052_0FB18A9ADD9B3940"/>
               <hi>Parts</hi> them. We muſt be for a <hi>whole</hi> CHRIST, and for <hi>Every Article</hi> of the <hi>Salvation</hi> which a CHRIST has to confer upon us. We muſt be for a CHRIST, that will give us <hi>Repentance</hi> as well as <hi>Remiſſion of Sins;</hi> and for being <hi>Sanctified</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtified.</hi> We read, Col. 1.19. <hi>In Him there does all Fulneſs dwell.</hi> And we muſt come for <hi>All,</hi> if we would not be put off with <hi>None.</hi> A <hi>Genuine Faith</hi> has many <hi>Errands</hi> upon which it <hi>comes</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST. It is not a <hi>Genuine Faith,</hi> which does <hi>Neglect</hi> any of them, <hi>Deſpiſe</hi> any of them. It is not enough, to <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, only that we may be brought into His <hi>Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> we muſt alſo Ponder on all the <hi>Maladies</hi> of our Souls, and Specify them <hi>All,</hi> and Mention them <hi>All,</hi> and Long for the Relief of them <hi>All;</hi> very Particularly. <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> my Mind is <hi>Ignorant;</hi> Oh, Do thou En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten it. My Heart is <hi>Depraved;</hi> Oh, Do thou Rectify it. I have a <hi>Slothful</hi> Soul; Oh, Do thou make me <hi>Lively.</hi> I have a <hi>Barren</hi> Soul; Oh, Do thou make me <hi>Fruitful.</hi> I have a Soul inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſet upon the <hi>World;</hi> Oh!

               </q> God will hear this <hi>Cry of the Humble!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, Secondly; When we <hi>come</hi> to our <hi>Saviour</hi> for His <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> we are both to <hi>Deſire</hi> them, and to <hi>Expect</hi> them. Our <hi>Faith</hi> muſt carry
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001256_0053_0FB18A9D47646CF0"/>
us to a CHRIST for <hi>Salvation,</hi> on the <hi>Two Wings,</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and of <hi>Hope.</hi> In our <hi>coming</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, there muſt be a <hi>Petition</hi> to Him for Salvation; ſuch a <hi>Petition</hi> as that; Pſal. 116.4. <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord, to deliver my Soul.</hi> And there muſt be a <hi>Dependence</hi> on Him for Salvation; ſuch a <hi>Dependence</hi> as that; Pſal. 25.2. <hi>O my God, I Truſt in thee.</hi> Firſt, We are to <hi>Beg</hi> of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> That He <hi>would</hi> undertake for us, and <hi>Guide us by Counſil and Bring us to Glory;</hi> And then, we are to <hi>Truſt</hi> in Him, that He <hi>will</hi> do ſo. Firſt we are to <hi>Commit</hi> our ſelves unto our Lord; Saying, <q>Lord, I am Thine, Save <hi>me,</hi> Lead <hi>me,</hi> Rule <hi>me!</hi>
               </q> And then we are to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> our ſelves, with ſome Degree of Confidence or Affiance, in the Lord; Saying, <q>
                  <hi>Return to thy Reſt, O my Soul,</hi> for the Lord will deal bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with me!</q>

            <p>You now Apprehend, <hi>What</hi> it is, <hi>To come unto the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>II.</hi> There is a <hi>Great</hi> SALVATION to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon all who thus <hi>Come unto the Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST <hi>Will in no wiſe caſt out thoſe that come unto Him.</hi> He will then <hi>Take</hi> them under His Conduct: But, Oh! Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Conduct! Oh! Thrice and Four times Bleſſed they that are under ſuch a Conduct! <hi>O Lord, How Great is thy Goodneſs, which thou haſt
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001256_0054_0FB18A9EA45FEF78"/>
Laid up for them, who put their Truſt in thee!</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Thy Great SAVIOUR has thoſe Things to Do for thee, which will cauſe thee to Sing; [Pſal. 126.3.] <hi>The Lord has done Great Things for me, whereof I am Glad!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will our Saviour do for them that <hi>Come</hi> unto Him? The Anſwer in ſhort is, He will do <hi>all that</hi> for which they <hi>Come</hi> unto Him?</p>
            <p>SALVATION is <hi>That,</hi> SALVATION is the <hi>End of our Faith.</hi> We are told; Act. 16.31. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou ſhalt be SAVED.</hi> But all that is Comprehended in that <hi>Salvation,</hi> 'tis inexpreſſible, 'tis inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Imagine, if you can, all that is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that Incomprehenſible Catalogue of <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Redemption.</hi> Believer, Theſe are all <hi>Thine,</hi> from the firſt moment of thy Believing.</p>
            <p>Yet we will make a feeble Eſſay, to tell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what our Great SAVIOUR, will do for them, whom <hi>He will not Caſt out,</hi> but will <hi>Take in</hi> under the <hi>Shadow of His Wings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Comers to the Lord;</hi> ADOPTION will be one point of your <hi>Salvation.</hi> We read; Joh. 1.12. <hi>As many as Received Him, to them He gave pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to become the Sons of God.</hi> This, This is the Engagement of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; <q>
                  <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe</hi> Leave in the ſad and black Family of <hi>Satan;</hi> I will make him a <hi>Child of God;</hi> an <hi>Heir of God.</hi> I will give him a Title to a matchleſs <hi>Inheritance;</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:001256_0055_0FB18AA030007B90"/>
He ſhall be a <hi>Joint-Heir with me;</hi> He ſhall <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things. My Father</hi> ſhall be <hi>His Father,</hi> and Bleſs Him wonderfully!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another point of your <hi>Salvation</hi> ſhall be your JUSTIFICATION. We read, Rom. 3.22. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God, is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that Believe.</hi> This is the Engagement of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; <q>
                  <hi>Him that Cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe</hi> Leave under the <hi>Wrath of God.</hi> God ſhall be <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> unto him. Tho' God has been <hi>Angry</hi> with him, the <hi>Anger</hi> ſhall be turned away. All Sin ſhall be <hi>Forgiven</hi> him. He ſhall ſtand in the <hi>Favour</hi> of God; be <hi>highly Favoured</hi> of the Lord. He ſhall have a claim to all the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of the Righteous.</hi> I will put my <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> upon him; A Robe outſhining the Splendor of the brighteſt Angels in Heaven!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another point of your <hi>Salvation</hi> ſhall be your SANCTIFICATION. We read, Act. 26.18. We are <hi>Sanctified by Faith.</hi> There is the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: <q>
                  <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe</hi> Leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Power of Sin.</hi> I will make him a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of God, and <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion</hi> over him. I will knock off the Chains of Hell from his Mind; and <hi>Enlarge his Heart</hi> ſo that he ſhall <hi>Run the way of my Commandments.</hi> I will give him a <hi>New Heart,</hi> a <hi>Soft Heart,</hi> a <hi>Clean Heart;</hi> and I will incline his Heart unto all the Things that are <hi>Holy, and Juſt, and Good.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:001256_0056_0FB18AA19DA9C000"/>This is not All. Your <hi>Salvation</hi> muſt have a Conſummation, in <hi>Heavenly Glory;</hi> in the <hi>Riches of the Glory of the Inheritance</hi> reſerved for the Saints in another World. We read, Joh. 6.47. <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, He that Believeth on me, hath Everlaſting Life.</hi> Thus does our Lord JESUS CHRIST Engage Himſelf; <q>
                  <hi>Him that cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> into the <hi>Outer Darkneſs,</hi> where the Ungodly ſhall be for ever Exiled from God. No; At the cloſe of his <hi>Earthly Pilgrimage</hi> I will take his Immortal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into an <hi>Heavenly Paradiſe,</hi> where it ſhall be Cloathed with <hi>Garments of Light.</hi> At the Laſt Day, I will Reſtore his <hi>Body</hi> to his <hi>Spirit,</hi> no longer ſubject unto <hi>Corruption;</hi> and I will take him into the <hi>Holy City,</hi> where he ſhall be <hi>Filled with all the Fulneſs of God</hi> for ever and ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And are they ſuch Things as theſe, that our Saviour will do for them that <hi>Come</hi> unto Him? Verily, They are. Oh! Great <hi>Salvation!</hi> Oh! Saviour, Oh! Saviour; Before whom the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that ever was, muſt vaniſh as a <hi>Shadow!</hi> Why do we not All immediately <hi>Come</hi> unto Him!</p>
            <p>It may be, our extream <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and Filthineſs, and Unworthineſs is our Diſcouragement. Indeed, we all have cauſe humbly to Declare with him; Luk. 7.7. <hi>Lord, I do not think my ſelf worthy to come unto thee.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we have before us a marvellous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>

               <hi>III.</hi> Our Great SAVIOUR will not <hi>Reject</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Sinner,</hi> that <hi>Comes unto Him;</hi> no, <hi>tho' the Sin of that Sinner be never ſo Great.</hi> He has given His Word; Be he who, or what he will, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out.

            </p>
            <p>I will firſt, Argue thus. Did our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ever <hi>caſt out</hi> any of thoſe, that came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, <hi>in the Days of His Fleſh,</hi> for any of His Favours! No, He Received <hi>All,</hi> He Relieved <hi>All;</hi> Yea, it was caſt as a Reproach upon Him; Luk. 15.2. <hi>He receiveth Sinners.</hi> What was this, but a moſt obliging Intimation, That our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> will ſtill give a Kind Entertainment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>All</hi> that <hi>come</hi> unto Him? Come unto thy SAVIOUR, O Soul, ſo <hi>Blind</hi> as to <hi>ſee</hi> nothing of the Things which are <hi>Inviſible;</hi> O Soul, ſo <hi>Lame</hi> as to be unable to take a ſtep in the <hi>Way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> O Soul, <hi>Grievouſly Vexed with Devils,</hi> which throw thee into the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and into the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Company,</hi> and make thee <hi>Cut</hi> and <hi>Wound</hi> thy ſelf among the <hi>Monuments of the Dead.</hi> Come unto thy <hi>Great Saviour:</hi> He will do as Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things for thee, as any that were done in His <hi>Miracles</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>I will go on, and Argue thus. <hi>How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, How is it poſſible,</hi> for ſuch infinite <hi>Grace</hi> as fills the Heart of the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ever to <hi>Reject</hi> the Sinner that <hi>comes</hi> unto Him?

               <hi>Trial</hi> of Him; and upon the <hi>Trial</hi> he Publiſhed this Report unto all the World; [1 Tim. 1.14.] <hi>The Grace of our Lord, Oh! tis Exceeding Abundant!</hi> A Man that has but a Little <hi>Grace,</hi> yet if there be, <hi>Any thing of CHRIST,</hi> in him, he will <hi>caſt out None</hi> that come unto him for Help; he will treat <hi>all</hi> that come unto him, with Compaſſion, with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity; he will Help them <hi>all,</hi> and Serve them <hi>all,</hi> and rejoyce to do them all the Good that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he can, All this <hi>Grace</hi> is but a very Little <hi>Picture,</hi> and Scarce <hi>That;</hi> of what is in our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It is unto <hi>His,</hi> not ſo much as a <hi>Drop</hi> unto the <hi>Ocean.</hi> It was of old ſaid; Joel 2.13. <hi>Turn unto the Lord your God, for He is Gracious and Merciful and of Great Kindneſs.</hi> And we will now ſay, Come unto the Lord your Saviour, in whom it is that God becomes <hi>your God,</hi> for He is a <hi>Gracious</hi> and a <hi>Merciful</hi> Saviour; None can ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of His <hi>Kindneſs!</hi>

            <p>I will not yet ceaſe to Argue; But Oh, Hear, what <hi>I have yet to ſpeak, on the behalf</hi> of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saviour; <hi>I will aſcribe</hi> a Peerleſs and Endleſs <hi>Goodneſs</hi> unto Him.

Chriſt: And what became of them?

It may not without Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror be thought upon. And yet! Some of theſe very Murderers, Repented, and Repairing unto the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> obtained the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of all their Sin. There were horrid Sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> [1 Cor. 6.9, 10.] <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Sodomites, Theeves, Coveteous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners.</hi> What a <hi>Black Liſt</hi> is here!

Now, we were long ago thus called upon; <hi>O Give Thanks to the God of Heaven, For His Mercy Endureth for ever.</hi> The <hi>Mercy</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which of old Received the Greateſt Sinners that <hi>came</hi> unto Him, ſtill <hi>Endures,</hi> ever <hi>Endures; come</hi> to Him, O Sinner, Thou ſhall find the Like <hi>Mercy</hi> in Him, that was found in the former Ages.</p>

Whether you ſhall Chuſe to do the part of <hi>Devils,</hi> and have a part with <hi>Devils,</hi> and be held in the <hi>Chains</hi> of <hi>End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Darkneſs</hi> laid upon you? O unaccountable Indifferency! O inexcuſable Stupidity!</p>
            <p>Briefly; The Doom will paſs upon you, from the Mouth of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, either, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed;</hi> or, <hi>Go, ye Curſed:</hi> This Doom will paſs, according to your <hi>Coming</hi> to, or <hi>Keeping</hi> from, the Glorious LORD. Oh! No longer then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Unreſolved; But, as we read; Joh. 11.28, 29. <hi>She called Mary her Siſter ſecretly, Saying, The Maſter calleth for thee: Aſſoon as ſhe heard that, ſhe aroſe quickly, and came unto Him.</hi> I do here <hi>Openly</hi> declare unto you, <hi>The Saviour calleth you;</hi> Oh! That Now, <hi>Aſſoon</hi> as you <hi>hear that,</hi> you would <hi>ariſe quickly, and come unto Him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will bring the Matter to an Iſſue. <hi>Try, Try,</hi> Whether you cannot with a Quickened Soul, Addreſs your Great SAVIOUR. O Great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Greateſt, Vileſt, Saddeſt of Sinners, Make the <hi>Trial. Take with you Words.</hi> You ſhall have <hi>Words</hi> put into your <hi>Mouths; Words</hi> which your moſt Gracious LORD has Himſelf Prepared for you; <hi>Words</hi> which if you do with your <hi>Hearts</hi> bring before the Lord, He will <hi>receive you graciouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto your Great SAVIOUR, Let your <hi>Firſt
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001256_0066_0FB18AB22A71F780"/>
Addreſs</hi> be in thoſe Words; Pſal. 4.1. <hi>Hear me when I call, and be thou the God of my Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let your <hi>Next Addreſs</hi> be in thoſe Words; Pſal. 25.4. <hi>Shew me thy ways, O Lord, Teach me thy Pathes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let your <hi>Third Addreſs</hi> be in thoſe Words; Pſal. 119.133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy Word, and let not any Iniquity have Dominion over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is for theſe Intents and Purpoſes, that you are to <hi>come</hi> unto your <hi>Saviour.</hi> And, Believe Him; He will <hi>caſt out none that ſo come unto Him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may not Conclude the Diſcourſe, without Some Endeavours to deliver the Minds of my Hearers, from ſome <hi>Difficulties,</hi> which I find often Encumbring of them.</p>
            <p>One thing that Supplies much <hi>Objection</hi> to them that are Invited by a Great SAVIOUR, to <hi>come</hi> unto Him, is This;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot come. I am not Able to Believe. Tis not in me to do it of my ſelf. I cannot do it, until the Lord pleaſe to Enable me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this <hi>Objection</hi> may not hold any People in their <hi>Impenitency,</hi> there are theſe things to be ſaid upon it.</p>
            <p>Firſt. The <hi>Impotency</hi> of a Sinner to do it, muſt not be uſed as any <hi>Apology,</hi> for his <hi>Not coming</hi> to a Saviour. Where is the Seat of this <hi>Impotency?</hi> Tis in the <hi>Will;</hi> Tis in a Depraved <hi>Will.</hi> Tis <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and therefore tis very <hi>Sinful.</hi> When a Sinner ſays, <hi>I cannot come to the Saviour, and own Him for my Saviour;</hi> the plain Truth is, <hi>He will not come.</hi> So tis charged upon Unbelievers; Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001256_0067_0FB18AB3A0ABF3E0"/>
will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> I Pray, What Excuſe is it, for any other Crime, to Say, <hi>My Will ſtands that way!</hi> The moſt Vicious People in the World, have an Excuſe for their not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of their Vices, if the want of a <hi>Will</hi> to do it, may go for one. As little will this Excuſe our <hi>Neglect of the Great Salvation;</hi> to plead, <hi>I have no Will to Look after it!</hi> When the Exhortations are made unto the <hi>Sinner,</hi> to <hi>Come</hi> unto a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and receive <hi>the Unſearcheable Riches of Chriſt,</hi> Why does he not <hi>Come?</hi> What is the Reaſon? Sinner, the <hi>Reaſon!</hi> Speak out plainly; Say, <hi>I will not come unto the Lord: My Mind is no way diſpoſed, my Heart is very much Averſe, unto it!</hi> Oh! <hi>Scandalous Excuſe</hi> for the worſt <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> imaginable! To Say, <hi>I am Wicked, becauſe I am not willing to be otherwiſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may Venture to Aſſert This; That never any man in the World, could Say, <hi>I am willing to come unto my Saviour, but He does not make me Able to come.</hi> The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner does Really <hi>Begin</hi> to Believe on a Glorious CHRIST, if once he do Sincerely <hi>Deſire</hi> to do it, or Deſire that God would Enable Him to do it. <hi>Faith</hi> is actually <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi> in the Soul, that is made Sincerely <hi>Willing</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. One Sincerely <hi>Willing</hi> to <hi>come</hi> unto the <hi>Saviour,</hi> had rather be gratified in this Point, than in any World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt; He Prefers a Glorious CHRIST, above all the Things of this World; He Neglects no <hi>Means,</hi> he Omits no <hi>Cryes,</hi> that he may obtain the <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>Lay Hold</hi> on Him, &amp; on <hi>Eternal Life</hi> in Him. Unbeliever, Thou art <hi>not, Willing</hi> to be any other than what thou <hi>art.</hi> And, This, This, will be thy <hi>Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. This <hi>Impotency</hi> muſt be confeſſd and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled in our <hi>Coming</hi> to our Saviour; &amp; our Senſible
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001256_0068_0FB18AB55CEEC8B8"/>
Confeſſion of it, is a <hi>notable ſtep</hi> of our <hi>Coming</hi> unto Him. It is not likely, that the Spirit of Grace will <hi>Enable</hi> us to <hi>Come</hi> unto our Saviour, till we feel and own that we are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nable</hi> to <hi>Come.</hi> When we become <hi>Senſible</hi> that we are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nable,</hi> and become <hi>Deſirous</hi> to be <hi>Enabled,</hi> then we are indeed <hi>Beginning</hi> to come. When the <hi>Grace</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on a Glorious CHRIST, is to be wrought in a Soul, the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> will have the Glory of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. See, O Sinner, That thou art <hi>Justly Damned,</hi> if thou doſt not come to thy Saviour. <hi>See</hi> this; and <hi>Say</hi> it before the Lord. But at the ſame time alſo humbly ſay; <hi>Lord, I ſhall not come to my Saviour, if thy Sovereign Grace do not help me to come!</hi> 'Tis true, Such a Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is upon the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Man,</hi> that he <hi>will not come</hi> unto a Glorious CHRIST, but indeed have a greater Enmity to this, than to any one thing in all Religion; till there be an Efficacious and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Operation of God upon the <hi>Will,</hi> not only to lay <hi>Moral Suaſions</hi> before it, but alſo to infuſe a <hi>New Frame</hi> into it, and Effectually Incline it unto the <hi>Faith</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is an Enemy. So far is the Sinner, from an <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to change his own <hi>Will,</hi> and bring it unto the <hi>Faith</hi> of a Glorious CHRIST, that whatever he does from his own meer <hi>Natural Ability,</hi> cannot oblige the God of Heaven, to make a Saving Change upon it. Let us keep to that famous <hi>Tenth Article</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> 
               <q>The Condition of man is ſuch, after the Fall, that he cannot turn, nor prepare himſelf by his own Natural Strength, to Faith and Calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do Good Works pleaſant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God preventing us, that we may have a Good Will, and working with us, when we have that Good Will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But then, how is this <hi>Good Confeſſion</hi> to be proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Not now to <hi>Ly down like a Stag in a Net,</hi> with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001256_0069_0FB18AB711E8F600"/>
ever to eſcape the <hi>Fury of the Lord.</hi> No; but from thy <hi>Sinful Grave,</hi> O Sinner, ſend up thy Sighs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. Tho' Lying in the <hi>Belly of Hell,</hi> yet give a <hi>Look</hi> towards the <hi>Holy Temple.</hi> Make that Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come, except the Father Draw him.</hi> But then beg it of the <hi>Father; Oh! Draw me, Draw me to my Saviour!</hi> Acknowledge that; Eph. 2.8. <hi>Faith, is not of your ſelves, 'tis the Gift of God.</hi> But, then, beg it of God; <hi>Oh! Give me, Give me, a true Faith in my Saviour!</hi> Acknowledge that; Phil 2.13. <hi>It is God, who worketh in you, both to Will and to Do, of His Good pleaſure</hi> But then, beg it of God; <hi>Oh! Work in me the Will, and help me to do this thing, to Come unto my Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>praeface</hi> unto it, <hi>Now</hi> come! Now ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou canſt not, with a <hi>New Life</hi> infuſed into thee from Heaven, ſay, <hi>Lord! I come unto thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing, that cauſes much <hi>Confuſion,</hi> to them that are invited by a Great SAVIOUR, to <hi>Come</hi> unto Him, is This.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Does it not Look like Double Dealing? What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality can there be, in the Lords bidding all men to come unto Him, when He knows He will not help them all to do it. If the Lord has not Really purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that He will Enable any but His Elect Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to come unto Him, what Sincerity can there be in His calling them to come?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sinner, Let none of theſe <hi>Cavils</hi> retard thy <hi>Coming</hi> to thy <hi>Saviour.</hi> It's a meer piece of <hi>Confuſion</hi> to inſiſt upon them. 'Tis Enough, That He calls <hi>Thee</hi> to <hi>Come,</hi> and He will <hi>not coſt thee out,</hi> if thou <hi>Come.</hi> Do but <hi>Come,</hi> and thou ſhalt find He has been moſt <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> in His <hi>Call</hi> unto thee.</p>
            <p>'Tis true; The Lord knows, that <hi>Reprobates</hi> will not <hi>Come</hi> unto Him; And, He knows, that He will
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001256_0070_0FB18AB871E84E60"/>
not give them a <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Come.</hi> Yet He Delude no man, when He ſays to <hi>all</hi> men, <hi>Him that comes unto <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I will in no wiſe cast out.</hi> Where is the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> who can ſay, <hi>That the Lord has dealt falſely with him?</hi> It muſt be a man, who <hi>knows</hi> himſelf to be a <hi>Reprobate.</hi> This <hi>no man</hi> Living does. O man, As 'tis <hi>thy Duty</hi> to come unto thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo 'tis <hi>thy Duty</hi> to reckon it <hi>probable,</hi> that thou art one whom the Lord intends to <hi>bring</hi> unto <hi>thy Saviour.</hi> To doom thy ſelf a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> would be a Criminal Impiety: <hi>Oh! Do it not!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Call</hi> to <hi>come</hi> unto a <hi>Saviour,</hi> been directed unto the <hi>Elect,</hi> excluſive of the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> or been any other than unto <hi>All the Children of man</hi> in general, the <hi>Ends</hi> of the <hi>Call</hi> had utterly been defeated. On the one ſide; No man would have <hi>Obey'd</hi> the <hi>Call;</hi> For no man can know himſelf to be one of the <hi>Elect,</hi> until he has <hi>Obey'd</hi> the <hi>Call.</hi> Every Individual man, would have been at a Loſs; whether he <hi>might</hi> have <hi>come</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Saviour,</hi> or no. On the other ſide; The <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> now Enjoy many <hi>Priviledges,</hi> many <hi>Advantages</hi> by the <hi>Call.</hi> It Reſtrains them from very much <hi>Diſorder:</hi> It proves an Inſtrument that furniſhes them with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Ornaments.</hi> And, It prevents their paſſing away their Time, in ſuch a doleful <hi>Deſperation,</hi> as would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe make very <hi>Devils</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reprobation</hi> is not the Immediate <hi>Cauſe,</hi> why the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate</hi> will not <hi>Come</hi> unto the <hi>Saviour.</hi> No; Their own Sinful, Corrupt, Wicked <hi>Nature</hi> is the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> If God ſhould Lay <hi>Chains</hi> upon a <hi>Sinner,</hi> againſt his <hi>Will,</hi> and then Bid him to <hi>Come</hi> unto a <hi>Saviour,</hi> this indeed would look like a <hi>Mockery.</hi> But the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> does not <hi>Come</hi> unto a <hi>Saviour,</hi> is not becauſe God will not <hi>Enable</hi> him; 'Tis becauſe he has <hi>Diſabled</hi> himſelf; he has caſt himſelf into the <hi>Snares</hi> of Death, and keeps the <hi>Chains</hi> of Hell upon his own Soul.</p>
