            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>AS my Capacities and Condition of Life are very low, it cannot be expected that I ſhould make thoſe Remarks on the Sufferings I have met with, or the kind Providence of a good GOD for my Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as one in a higher Station; but ſhall leave that to the Reader as he goes along, and ſo I ſhall only relate Matters of Fact as they occur to my Mind—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON Monday, 25th Day of <hi>December,</hi> 1747, with the leave of my Maſter, I went from <hi>Marſhfield,</hi> with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go a Voyage to Sea, and the next Day, the 26th, got to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where I immediately ſhip'd myſelf on board of a Sloop, Capt. <hi>John Howland,</hi> Maſter, bound to <hi>Jamaica</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008611_0003_102F98D11A1AF008"/>
and the <hi>Bay</hi>—We ſailed from <hi>Plymouth</hi> in a ſhort Time, and after a pleaſant Paſſage of about 30 Days, arrived at <hi>Jamaica;</hi> we was detain'd at <hi>Jamaica</hi> only 5 Days, from whence we ſailed for the Bay, where we arrived ſafe in 10 Days. We loaded our Veſſel with Logwood, and ſailed from the <hi>Bay</hi> the 25th Day of <hi>May</hi> following, and the 15th Day of <hi>June,</hi> we were caſt away on <hi>Cape-Florida,</hi> about 5 Leagues from the Shore; being now deſtitute of every Help, we knew not what to do or what Courſe to take in this our ſad Condition:—The Captain was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, intreated, and beg'd on, by every Perſon on board, to heave over but only 20 Ton of the <hi>Wood,</hi> and we ſhould get clear, which if he had done, might have ſav'd his Veſſel and Cargo, and not only ſo, but his own Life, as well as the Lives of the Mate and Nine Hands, as I ſhall preſently relate.</p>
            <p>After being upon this Reef two Days, the Captain order'd the Boat to be hoiſted out, and then aſk'd who were willing to tarry on board? The whole Crew was for going on Shore at this Time, but as the Boat would not carry 12 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at once, and to prevent any Uneaſineſs, the Captain, a Paſſenger, and one Hand tarry'd on board, while the Mate, with Seven Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides myſelf, were order'd to go on Shore in the Boat, which as ſoon as we had reached, one half
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008611_0004_102F98D2AB0BA358"/>
were to be Landed, and the other four to return to the Sloop, to fetch the Captain and the others on Shore. The Captain order'd us to take with us our Arms, Ammunition, Proviſions and Neceſſaries for Cooking, as alſo a Sail to make a Tent of, to ſhelter us from the Weather; after having left the Sloop we ſtood towards the Shore, and being within Two Leagues of the ſame, we eſpy'd a Number of Canoes, which we at firſt took to be Rocks, but ſoon found our Miſtake, for we perceiv'd they moved towards us; we preſently ſaw an Engliſh Colour hoiſted in one of the Canoes, at the Sight of which we were not a little rejoiced, but on our advancing yet nearer, we found them, to our very great Surprize, to be <hi>Indians</hi> of which there were Sixty; being now ſo near them we could not poſſibly make our Eſcape; they ſoon came up with and boarded us, took away all our Arms Ammunition, and Proviſion. The whole Number of Canoes (being about Twenty,) then made for the Sloop, except Two which they left to guard us, who order'd us to follow on with them; the Eighteen which made for the Sloop, went ſo much faſter than we that they got on board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Three Hours before we came along ſide, and had kill'd Captain <hi>Howland,</hi> the Paſſenger and the other hand; we came to the Larboard ſide of the Sloop, and they order'd us round to the Starboard, and as we were paſſing round the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008611_0005_102F98D446E09AD8"/>
Bow, we ſaw the whole Number of <hi>Indians,</hi> advancing forward and loading their Guns, upon which the Mate ſaid, "<hi>my Lads we are all dead Men,</hi>" and before we had got round, they diſcharged their Small Arms upon us, and kill'd Three of our hands, viz. <hi>Reuben Young</hi> of <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> Mate; <hi>Joſeph Little</hi> and <hi>Lemuel Doty</hi> of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> upon which I immediately jump'd overboard, chuſing rather to be drowned, than to be kill'd by thoſe barbarous and inhuman Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. In three or four Minutes after, I heard another Volley which diſpatched the other five, viz. <hi>John Nowland,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Rich,</hi> both belonging to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Elkanah Collymore,</hi> and <hi>James Webb,</hi> Strangers, and <hi>Moſes New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock,</hi> Molatto. As ſoon as they had kill'd the whole of the People, one of the Canoes padled after me, and ſoon came up with me, hawled me into the Canoe, and beat me moſt terribly with a Cutlaſs, after that they ty'd me down, then this Canoe ſtood for the Sloop again and as ſoon as ſhe came along ſide, the <hi>Indians</hi> on board the Sloop betook themſelves to their Canoes, then ſet the Veſſel on Fire, making a prodigious ſhouting and hallowing like ſo many Devils. As ſoon as the Veſſel was burnt down to the Water's edge, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtood for the Shore, together with our Boat, on board of which they put 5 hands. After we came to the Shore, they led me to their Hutts, where I expected nothing but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008611_0006_102F98DB98C00F40"/>
Death, and as they ſpoke broken Engliſh, were often telling me, while coming from the Sloop to the Shore, that they intended to roaſt me alive. But the Providence of God order'd it otherways, for He appeared for my Help, <hi>in this Mount of Difficulty,</hi> and they were better to me then my Fears, and ſoon unbound me, but ſet a Guard over me every Night. They kept me with them about five Weeks, during which Time they us'd me pretty well, and gave me boil'd Corn, which was what they often eat themſelves. The Way I made my Eſcape from theſe Villains was this; A Spaniſh Schooner arriving there from <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi> the Maſter of which, whoſe Name was <hi>Romond,</hi> aſked the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> to let me go on board his Veſſel, which they granted, and the Captain <note n="*" place="bottom">The Way I came to know this Gentleman was, by his being taken laſt War by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Privateer, and brought into <hi>Jamaica,</hi> while I was there.</note> knowing me very well, weigh'd Anchor and carry'd me off to the <hi>Havanna,</hi> and after being there four Days the <hi>Indians</hi> came after me, and inſiſted on having me again, as I was their Priſoner;—They made Application to the Governor, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me again from him; in anſwer to which the Governor told them, that as they had put the whole Crew to Death, they ſhould not have me again, and ſo paid them Ten Dollars for me, adding, that he would not have them kill any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008611_0007_102F98DD27688810"/>
hereafter, but take as many of them as they could, of thoſe that ſhould be caſt away, and bring them to him, for which he would pay them Ten Dollars a-head. At the <hi>Havanna</hi> I lived with the Governor in the Caſtle about a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, where I was walking thro' the Street, I met with a Preſs-Gang who immediately preſt me, and put me into Goal, and with a Number of others I was confin'd till next Morning, when we were all brought out, and aſk'd who would go on board the King's Ships, four of which having been lately built, were bound to <hi>Old-Spain,</hi> and on my refuſing to ſerve on board, they put me in a cloſe Dungeon, where I was confin'd <hi>Four Years and ſeven months</hi>; during which Time I often made application to the Governor, by Perſons who came to ſee the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, but they never acquainted him with it, nor did he know all this Time what became of me, which was the means of my being confin'd there ſo long. But kind Providence ſo order'd it, that after I had been in this Place ſo long as the Time mention'd above the Captain of a Merchantman, belonging to <hi>Boſton,</hi> having ſprung a Leak was obliged to put into the <hi>Havanna</hi> to refit, and while he was at Dinner at Mrs. <hi>Betty Howard's,</hi> ſhe told the Captain of my deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſaid ſhe would be glad, if he could by ſome means or other relieve me; The Captain
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008611_0008_102F98DEC285EB78"/>
told Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> he would uſe his beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for my Relief and Enlargement.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, after Dinner, came to the Priſon, and aſk'd the Keeper if he might ſee me; upon his Requeſt I was brought out of the Dungeon, and after the Captain had Interrogated me, told me, he would intercede with the Governor for my Relief out of that miſerable Place, which he did, and the next Day the Governor ſent an Order to releaſe me; I lived with the Governor about a Year after I was delivered from the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, in which Time I endeavour'd three Times to make my Eſcape, the laſt of which proved effectual; the firſt Time I got on board of Captain <hi>Marſh,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Twenty Gun Ship, with a Number of others, and lay on board conceal'd that Night; and the next Day the Ship being under ſail, I thought myſelf ſafe, and ſo made my Appearance upon Deck, but as ſoon as we were diſcovered the Captain order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Boat out, and ſent us all on Shore— I intreated the Captain to let me, in particular, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was obliged to go on Shore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:008611_0009_102F98E218D87558"/>After being on Shore another Twelvemonth, I endeavour'd to make my Eſcape the ſecond Time, by trying to get on board of a Sloop bound to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and as I was going from the City to the Sloop, was unhappily taken by the Guard, and ordered back to the Caſtle, and there confined.—However, in a ſhort Time I was ſet at Liberty, ond order'd with a Number of others to carry the <note n="*" place="bottom">He is carried (by Way of Reſpect) in a large Two-arm Chair; the Chair is lin'd with crimſon Velvet, and ſupported by eight Perſons.</note> 
               <hi>Biſhop</hi> from the Caſtle, thro' the Country, to confirm the old People, baptize Children, &amp;c. for which he receives large Sums of Money.— I was employ'd in this Service about Seven Months, during which Time I lived very well, and then returned to the Caſtle again, where I had my Liberty to walk about the City, and do Work for my ſelf;—The <hi>Beaver,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War then lay in the Harbour, and having been informed by ſome of the Ship's Crew that ſhe was to ſail in a few Days, I had nothing now to do, but to ſeek an Opportunity how I ſhould make my Eſcape.</p>
            <p>Accordingly one Sunday Night the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Ship with a Number of the Barge Crew were in a Tavern, and Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> who had before been a Friend to me, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008611_0010_102F98E7CA9AD800"/>
with the Lieutenant to carry me on board: the Lieutenant ſaid he would with all his Heart, and immediately I went on board in the Barge. The next Day the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came along ſide the <hi>Beaver,</hi> and demanded me again, with a Number of others who had made their Eſcape from them, and got on board the Ship, but juſt before I did; but the Captain, who was a true <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> refus'd them, and ſaid he could not anſwer it, to deliver up any <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> under <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours.—In a few Days we ſet Sail for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where we arrived ſafe, after a ſhort and pleaſant Paſſage.</p>
            <p>After being at <hi>Jamaica</hi> a ſhort Time we ſail'd for <hi>London,</hi> as convoy to a Fleet of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantmen, who all arrived ſafe in the <hi>Downs,</hi> I was turned over to another Ship, the <hi>Arcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceil,</hi> and there remained about a Month. From this Ship I went on board the <hi>Sandwich</hi> of 90 Guns; on board the <hi>Sandwich,</hi> I tarry'd 6 Weeks, and then was order'd on board the <hi>Hercules,</hi> Capt. <hi>John Porter,</hi> a 74 Gun Ship, we ſail'd on a Cruize, and met with a <hi>French</hi> 84 Gun Ship, and had a very ſmart Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note n="*" place="bottom">A particular Account of this Engagement, has been Publiſh'd in the <hi>Boſton</hi> New-Papers.</note> in which about 70 of our Hands were Kill'd and Wounded, the Captain loſt his Leg

in the Engagement, and I was Wounded in the Head by a ſmall Shot. We ſhould have taken this Ship, if they had not cut away the moſt of our Rigging; however, in about three Hours after, a 64 Gun Ship, came up with and took her.—I was diſcharged from the <hi>Hercules</hi> the 12th Day of <hi>May</hi> 1759 (having been on board of that Ship 3 Months) on account of my being diſabled in the Arm, and render'd inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Service, after being honourably paid the Wages due to me. I was put into the <hi>Greenwich</hi> Hoſpital where I ſtay'd and ſoon recovered.—I then ſhip'd myſelf a Cook on board Captain <hi>Martyn,</hi> an arm'd Ship in the King's Service. I was on board this Ship al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Two Months, and after being paid my Wages, was diſcharg'd in the Month of <hi>October.</hi> —After my diſcharge from Captain <hi>Martyn,</hi> I was taken ſick in <hi>London</hi> of a Fever, and was confin'd about 6 Weeks, where I expended all my Money, and left in very poor Circumſtances; and unhappy for me I knew nothing of my <hi>good Maſter's</hi> being in <hi>London</hi> at this my very difficult Time. After I got well of my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhip'd myſelf on board of a large Ship bound to <hi>Guinea,</hi> and being in a publick Houſe one Evening, I overheard a Number of Perſons talking about Rigging a Veſſel bound to <hi>New-England,</hi> I aſk'd them to what Part of <hi>New-England</hi> this Veſſel was bound? they told me,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008611_0012_102F98EC713AD438"/>
to <hi>Boſton</hi>; and having aſk'd them who was Commander? they told me, Capt. <hi>Watt</hi>; in a few Minutes after this the Mate of the Ship came in, and I aſk'd him if Captain <hi>Watt</hi> did not want a Cook, who told me he did, and that the Captain would be in, in a few Minutes; and in about half an Hour the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain came in, and then I ſhip'd myſelf at once, after begging off from the Ship bound to <hi>Guinea;</hi> I work'd on board Captain <hi>Watt's</hi> Ship almoſt Three Months, before ſhe ſail'd, and one Day being at Work in the Hold, I overheard ſome Perſons on board mention the Name of <hi>Winſlow,</hi> at the Name of which I was very inquiſitive, and having aſk'd what <hi>Winſlow</hi> they were talking about? They told me it was <hi>General Winſlow;</hi> and that he was one of the Paſſengers, I aſk'd them what <hi>General Winſlow</hi>? For I never knew <hi>my good Maſter,</hi> by that Title before; but after enquiring more particularly I found it muſt be <hi>Maſter,</hi> and in a few Days Time the Truth was joyfully verify'd by a happy Sight of his Perſon, which ſo overcome me, that I could not ſpeak to him for ſome Time—<hi>My good Maſter</hi> was exceeding glad to ſee me, telling me that I was like one aroſe from the Dead, for he thought I had been Dead a great many Years, having heard nothing of me for almoſt Thirteen Years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:008611_0013_102F98EFCD435ED8"/>I think I have not deviated from Truth, in any particular of this my Narrative, and tho' I have omitted a great many Things, yet what is wrote may ſuffice to convince the Reader, that I have been moſt grievouſly afflicted, and yet thro' the Divine Goodneſs, as miraculouſly preſerved, and delivered out of many Dangers; of which I deſire to retain a <hi>grateful Remembrance,</hi> as long as I live in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, That in the Providence of that GOD, who delivered his Servant</hi> David out of the Paw of the Lion and out of the Paw of the Bear, <hi>I am freed from a</hi> long <hi>and</hi> dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Captivity, among worſe Savages than they; <hi>And am return'd to my</hi> own Native Land, to Shew how Great Things the Lord hoth done for Me; <hi>I would call upon all Men, and Say,</hi> O Magnifie the Lord with Me, and let us Exalt his Name together!— O that Men would Praiſe the Lord for His Goodneſs, and for his Wonderful Works to the Children of Men!</p>
