            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words were ſpoken by king David, on occaſion of the death of Abner, the commander in chief of the armies of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>The funeral ſolemnities being completed, the king's friends invited him to partake of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. But he declined it with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of an oath, on account of the afflictive event of the day, and hereby evinced that his ſorrow was deep and abiding. By far too much ſo, to be diſſipated by the formalities of the funeral; however decent and reſpectful to the dead.</p>
            <p>Our text ſuggeſts a weighty reaſon for his conduct, and, implicitly, calls on the nation at large, to mingle ſorrows, and join in lamenting the common loſs.</p>
            <p>The likeneſs of that event to what now calls forth the general tear from every part of the United States, is ſufficiently obvious.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I. We are to ſhew what conſtitutes human greatneſs, and the means which produce it.</p>
            <p>In attending to this branch of our ſubject, it muſt be kept in mind, that greatneſs, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to man, is not to be underſtood in an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but in a compartaive ſenſe. Men who are great, when compared with moſt of their fellow men, are little, in compariſon with created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of higher orders.—How little when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the boundleſs ſource of all created ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtences! In this compariſon, the moſt exalted creature, is like the ſmall duſt of the balance. Yea even leſs than nothing and vanity!</p>
            <p>With this, impreſſed on our hearts, we name the following things as conſtituting human greatneſs, and compriſing the moſt eſſential means to its production.</p>
            <p>In general it may be defined, a ſufficiency for a courſe of great and good actions, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037587_0005_100EE0A0D572BCE8"/>
of them, through a ſeries of trials and dangers. We ſpeak of great and <hi>good</hi> actions, becauſe no character can be truly great, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever productions of power, and of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may exhibit, if they are not good. We contemplate, with averſion and terror, a Being poſſeſſed of great abilities without the will to do good. Great qualities are in no view deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, excepting as the requiſite means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing extenſive good, and, conſequently, they ceaſe to be objects of eſteem and admiration, when not thus applied.</p>
            <p>By <hi>good</hi> actions we mean thoſe which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and adapted for the promotion of human happineſs, in ſubſervience to the beſt intereſts of the moral ſyſtem. Not a ſingle action, but <hi>a course</hi> of ſuch actions, conſtitute a great charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Becauſe, one ſingle action may have the ſemblance of a great exertion of virtuous benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, to the imperfect and ſuperficial view of man; and may, however, be educed from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which are wholly the reverſe. But this can, ſcarcely, be ſuppoſed, in the caſe of a courſe, or long continued ſeries of actions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently great and good. We can, indeed, form no conception of <hi>good actions,</hi> except from their apparent deſign and tendency.</p>
            <p>Thoſe actions which are apparently deſigned and adapted directly to promote the happineſs of a particular circle of rational beings, and to coincide with that of univerſal exiſtence, we pronounce to be good, and thoſe of an oppoſite tendency we conſider as evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037587_0006_100EE0A2ADFBAEC8"/>
A diſtinction muſt be preſerved in our minds between a <hi>good</hi> character, and one which is great; a perſon of ſmall abilities, in the moſt private walk of life, may uniformly aim to do good, and may merit and poſſeſs the character of a <hi>good man,</hi> with thoſe who know him, but he will never be called great.—Thus it appears that to conſtitute a great man, there muſt be a ſufficiency for a courſe of great and good actions, and the exhibition of them, through a ſeries of trials and dangers.—We mention this laſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance becauſe perſeverance in a courſe of good conduct through ſuch a ſeries, gives much additional evidence of inward ſincerity, and unſhaken reſolution.</p>
            <p>A ſufficiency for ſuch a courſe of action is to be underſtood with the limitation neceſſary, when applied to all created agents, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, and abſolutely dependent on the will and power of the great Creator. By this ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we therefore mean thoſe abilities, means, opportunities, and diſpoſitions, which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on thoſe whom he deſigns to make truly great.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, we proceed to name the following means, or requiſites of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man greatneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Good natural abilities are eſſential to the formation of a great character. That the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal capacities of men are extremely diverſe, is obvious, however this diverſity is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. It is immaterial, to our preſent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether it conſiſts in the original conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of different minds, or is the reſult of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037587_0007_100EE0A4F317C1F8"/>
with different bodies. That a wide and important difference exiſts, will be admitted. Some men are evidently poſſeſſed of powers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to important ſtations, and great actions. Such minds readily expand in the field of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and have a happy talent in its application.—Others may, indeed, appear to have genius for learning, and become ſcientific men. But the genius adapted to form a great man, purſues practical knowledge, and applies it to great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and without an original capacity of this deſcription, all attempts for human greatneſs will be vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Good means for improvement are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to form a great man. The progreſs of the mind, like that of animal and vegetable life, is effected by means. Proper cultivation expands the mental powers and qualifies the man for great and worthy exertions. Much is effected to this object by the wiſe leſſons of parental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by lenient and ſteady government, and direction of the unformed principles and manners of childhood and youth.—The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of books, and men, is highly important, and eſpecially the force of good example. Without theſe and other ſimilar means of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, the moſt promiſing natural abilities may be buried in obſcurity, and be loſt to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and to the world.</p>
            <p>An appeal to the ſtate of individuals and of ſociety, under the different degrees of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will exhibit a diſtinction between the man of learning and improvement, in cultivated ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and the mere man of nature, the untutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037587_0008_100EE0A6CD29C810"/>
ſavage, in many reſpects not leſs ſtriking, than between that ſavage and the moſt ſagacious of brute animals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another requiſite to human greatneſs is a diligent and perſevering improvement of the means to excel.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more evident than that the beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and means to form a great man, will utterly fail, unleſs theſe abilities are exerted, and the means improved.</p>
            <p>The human mind is not poſſeſſed of original, or innate perceptions, knowledge muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. A ſuperior capacity for its reception conſtitutes the primary greatneſs of man; but that capacity unapplied will avail nothing, and means not improved will leave the ſoul empty. The diligent hand maketh rich, but idleneſs brings poverty no leſs in reſpect to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the mind, than of property. This is a ſtated law of our nature; eſtabliſhed by its wiſe and beneficent Author. Experience and obſervation agree with this remark; and the general hiſtory of mankind is adapted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A noble ardor of mind for great and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is not to be found in every wiſe man. A certain abſence of the ſpirit of exertion, and an immoderate love of eaſe and indulgence, have prevented many perſons of reſpectable abilities and improvements from effecting any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, either great or good. Great minds, poſſeſſed of the ardor which has been mentioned, are far from indifference in the tendency of their actions, and their effects on ſociety.—Deſtitute
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037587_0009_100EE0A8CD7269D0"/>
of public affection, and governed by private conſiderations, their apparent intereſts may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with that of the public, and they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its moſt dangerous enemies. But influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a noble regard to the public, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own felicity in the common good, their ardent ſpirit of enterprize will be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote it.</p>
            <p>They embrace an object truly great, and of immenſe value. The mind is filled with its weight and importance, and every power is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to obtain it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Opportunity and occaſion for great and good actions muſt be given, to form the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a great man.</p>
            <p>Without theſe the beſt abilities and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, connected with an ardent deſire to do good, might never effect any thing very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and important.</p>
            <p>This obſervation will be illuſtrated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by reviewing the accounts of Noah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Joſeph, Moſes, David, Joſiah, the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paul, and other worthies, in ſcripture hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thoſe of the famed ſages, and other great men, of ancient and modern times, in the writings of profane authors, or of ſuch as have appeared in our day.</p>
            <p>The deluge, to which the old world was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſly doomed, gave opportunity and occaſion for thoſe great and good actions in Noah, which have perpetuated his name, and "by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith." And ſimilar obſervations might be made in regard to the reſt.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037587_0010_100EE0AA982BF148"/>
It is not improbable that abilities as great and hearts as good may have exiſted in the private walks of life, which with equal advantages and opportunities, would have merited equal rank in the annals of fame, with thoſe great men whom we juſtly celebrate.</p>
            <p>Even our WASHINGTON, whom we place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt in human greatneſs, had the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican revolutionary war, and conſequent inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, not exiſted, would he have merited or enjoyed that high diſtinction to which he now has an indiſputable claim!</p>
            <p n="6">6. Invincible fortitude and perſeverance, are neceſſary to form a great character.</p>
            <p>In a courſe of great and good actions, there is much labor, vigilance and care. There are many obſtacles to be ſurmounted, difficulties, and dangers to be encountered, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſuſtained. The proſpect of ſucceſs is often clouded, and the beſt and moſt labored exertions for the public good are miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cenſured.</p>
            <p>In circumſtances like theſe, men of but a common ſhare of reſolution and firmneſs, will be diſcouraged, and never arrive to human greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Hence the neceſſity of invincible fortitude and perſeverance, to form a great man—The candidate for this muſt deliberately count the coſt, at ſetting out, and in view of the many diſcouragements in his way, muſt find that worth and importance in the object of purſuit, which out-weigh them all, and which prepares
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037587_0011_100EE0ACA947A080"/>
him to ſacrifice every thing for its ſake. The man who places his higheſt enjoyment in human happineſs, and the higheſt perfection of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſyſtem, and who reſts in the unwavering faith of the univerſal and perfect government of the exalted Redeemer, can feel commanding inducements to engage in the moſt painful and hazardous enterprizes, for the public good. Amidſt the uncertainties of futurity, in regard to himſelf, he is aſſured that, as it reſpects the object of his chief concern, all will be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered well, and the final iſſue will be good. Hence, under the impreſſion of the perfection of divine ſuperintendance, in application to all events, he is confident in God. He reſolves with deliberation, and executes with undaunted courage and perſeverance.—From the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed law of Heaven, ſuch fortitude and reſolution make the faireſt proſpect of ſucceſs. Other particulars might be named, as influencing to form a great character, but they would be found to be involved in thoſe already mentioned, or connected with them.</p>
            <p>To the ſuperficial view of man, it is indeed requiſite that, to form a great character, a courſe of great and good actions ſhould be crowned with ſucceſs. But this is not to judge from a direct view of the nature and tendency of actions, but from other events, and thoſe not certainly connected with the actions. Alſo the ultimate and moſt important conſequences of great and good actions, are often beyond the extent of human view, and wrapped up in futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Hence the judgement of the quality of actions, formed on their preſent and viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences is very uncertain, and in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037587_0012_100EE0AE8B95BE78"/>
the events which we conſider as the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of particular actions, might, with more juſtice, be educed from other, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cauſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being obvious, it follows that, however neceſſary for us it may be to judge of characters, in part, by the apparent conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of actions, the rule is imperfect, and we are liable to err.—To the all-ſeeing mind, each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and character, in itſelf, is open to view, and the truly great man, is clearly diſcerned and approved, according to the nature and tendency of his actions, with whatever effects we may view them as connected. In the final adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things in the moral ſyſtem, every great and good action and character will appear in its true light, and the ultimate conſequences of ſuch actions will appear to be good. Then the wiſe, and the righteous, all the great and good, "ſhall ſhine forth as the ſon in the kingdom of their father."</p>
            <p>II. Our next object is to trace human great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to its divine Author.</p>
            <p>The abſolute dependence of creatures on their Creator, is ſo obvious to reaſon, and that "ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery good gift cometh down from the father of lights," is ſo clearly taught in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is, on the whole, a truth ſo nearly ſelf evident, that it is difficult to render it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or more certain by argument. Inſenſibility of this truth is not the fault of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of the heart.</p>
            <p>Human greatneſs we have ſhown to be the reſult of good natural abilities—placed under
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037587_0013_100EE0B0B5594D88"/>
good means for improvement—a diligent and perſevering uſe of thoſe means—a noble ardor of mind for great and good actions—opportunity and occaſion for their production—and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortitude and perſeverance in a courſe of ſuch actions.</p>
            <p>Is there any one of theſe which is not the gift of God? However manifeſt it is that men are generally inſenſible of the inviſible hand which ſupports them in life, and might be addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the divine language to Cyrus, "I girded thee, though thou haſt not known me." Yet few will queſtion the truth of the doctrine. A deep and abiding impreſſion of it on our hearts is highly important in the general concerns of human life, and eſpecially in the formation of a great and good character. Without this, all fancied human greatneſs will vaniſh in the light of Divine truth, as the miſt before the riſing ſun.</p>
            <p>III. We proceed to conſider the ends of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom in raiſing up great men.</p>
            <p>We may reaſonably ſuppoſe that infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has many particular objects to accompliſh by ſuch events, beyond the extent of human comprehenſion. In the divine operation, many ends are accompliſhed by one work, in ours, the reverſe is true. Many works are neceſſary for the accompliſhment of one end. We men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, the following particulars, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently compriſed in the divine plan, in raiſing up great men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The benefit of the ſubject. God is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the whole creation, "His goodneſs is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037587_0014_100EE0B254967648"/>
over all his works," "He doth good to the evil and unthankful, He cauſes his ſun to riſe, and his rain to deſcend, on the evil and the good." But thoſe on whom he has beſtowed uncommon talents, and who faithfully improve them, are the objects of his peculiar care. To theſe he gives the unrivalled pleaſure of doing good, and honors them with a great reward. He treats them as his own children. He beſtows on them the marks of his peculiar favor. He gives them to ſee the fruit of their labor, in the felicity of his kingdom, and to be ſtill uſeful, and to rejoice forever in his love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another end of God, in raiſing up great men, is the good of ſociety. From the genuine conſequences of the works of God, we may infer his deſigns, becauſe we know He is never diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. In every caſe, his council will ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But nothing is more evident than that under God, the intereſts of ſociety are preſerved and advanced by the labors of great men, qualified, and promoted to places of eminence, by God, for this end. Such preſerve the ſtate from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ruin, defend it from enemies, ſecure its intereſts, and advance its proſperity. They are inſtrumental in giving complexion to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and manners of the people at large, of bringing many bleſſings to their own generation, and conveying them to the children of future times. "Wo to thee O Land when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning. Bleſſed art thou O land when thy king is the ſon of nobles, and thy princes eat in due ſeaſon, for ſtrength and not for drunkenneſs."</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:037587_0015_100EE0B42044E128"/>
3. The benefit of the church of God is anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er object of Divine wiſdom, in raiſing up great men.—The truth and importance of this obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation are evident from the repreſentations of holy ſcripture, importing that the complete ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the redeemed church is a leading ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in all divine operations, and that Jeſus Chriſt is exalted to be "head over all things to the church."—It is evident from the hiſtory of the wiſe and good of all ages. Theſe have devoted their lives to ſerve the beſt intereſts of the church of God. For this, Moſes and Joſhua, Samuel, and David, lived, labored and ſuffered.—This has engaged prophets, apoſtles, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous men of all ages, and nations. For this, they have prayed, labored, and ſuffered, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their names to reproach, and their lives to death.—We add</p>
            <p n="4">4. Great men are raiſed up for the purpoſes which have been named, that hereby there might be a proper diſplay of all divine perfections, through Jeſus Chriſt, in all worlds, throughout all ages, to the praiſe and glory of God, forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.—This is the apoſtolic doctrine to the church at Corinth, and, for the ſame reaſon, to every chriſtian church and individual.</p>
            <p>"All things are for your ſakes, that the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace, through the thankſgiving of many, might redound to the glory of God"—In this we ſee a concatenation of objects, the moſt deſirable and important, in which alſo the leſs is ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the greater, in ſucceſſion, and all abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the expreſſion of Divine fulneſs, and the everlaſting glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:037587_0016_100EE0B5EB8BFEB8"/>
IV. Our next enquiry reſpects the manner in which a people ſhould receive and improve ſo ſingular a favor from God as the beſtowment of great men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We anſwer briefly, they ſhould be received with unfeigned gratitude to God, the giver. With expreſſions of ſuch gratitude the ſcriptures abound, we adduce but one. It is the thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of king David, near the cloſe of life, in a review of the great things which God had done for him and his people.</p>
            <p>David bleſſed the Lord before all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and David ſaid, bleſſed be thou, Lord God of Iſrael, our father, forever and ever. Thine O Lord is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majeſty, for all that is in the heaven and the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as head above all. Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all. Now therefore, our God we thank and praiſe thy glorious name. [1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 10, 11, 12, 13.]</p>
            <p n="2">2. People to whom ſuch men are given, ſhould receive them as great bleſſings, and reſpect and honor them accordingly.</p>
            <p>They ſhould ſecond their exertions for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, by a prompt ſubjection to their injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as rulers &amp; magiſtrates. By uſing their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the promotion of order in ſociety, and they ſhould help them with their prayers—wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037587_0017_100EE0B84D62B260"/>
improving the privileges they enjoy by their means: giving to God the glory of his goodneſs in ſo great a bleſſing, teaching their children to reſpect the intereſts of ſociety, and to revere the rulers and the laws.—And laſtly, they ſhould hold ſuch important characters, as the gift of God, and be prepared to honor him by humble ſubmiſſion, when he ſhall ſee fit to remove them.</p>
            <p>V. We proceed to apply the ſubject to the preſent ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>That a great man is fallen in our land, is the unanimous voice of that ſolemn ſadneſs which pervades the union.</p>
            <p>To preſent him truly to the preſent, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations, will be the honorable, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous taſk of the hiſtorian. The recollection, however, of the following ſketches, ſeems to be due to his memory at this time.</p>
            <p>He was born on the 11th of February 1732. Though deſcended from reſpectable parents, his ſame reſts not on the merit of his progenitors. By the death of his eldeſt brother, he came to the poſſeſſion of the family eſtate, which was ample, and might, perhaps, have influence to bring him more early into public view. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing completed his education, under a domeſtic tutor, agreeably to the cuſtom in that part of the country. About the age of twenty-one, he was intruſted with public buſineſs, by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, important in its conſequences, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much danger. This he executed to the ſatisfaction of his employers. The following year (1754) he was appointed to the command
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037587_0018_100EE0BA1C5C0668"/>
of a poſt, near the ſpot of ground where the town of Pittſburgh now ſtands. Attacked in this poſition by a vaſtly ſuperior force of the enemy, after his ammunition was nearly exhauſted, he extricated himſelf and his little army, from this perilous ſituation, in a manner which did him great honor.—In the year 1755, he marched with his regiment, under General Braddock, to attack the French who had occupied the poſt juſt mentioned, and were in force, and after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat and death of that unfortunate General, he ſaved the remainder of the army, with great mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary addreſs.</p>
            <p>About this time he was marked out, in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſcourſe, by ſomething like a prophetic ſpirit, as the future ſupport, and ſaviour of his country.<note n="§" place="bottom">See Preſident DAVIES' ſermon on religion and patriotiſm, addreſſed to Capt. OVERTON's Independent Company of Volunteers, Hanover county, Virginia, Aug. 17, 1755.</note>
            </p>
            <p>After the peace of 1763, the field for military achievments was not open. But on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of our troubles with Great-Britain, he was a repreſentative in Congreſs in the year 1774, and 5, and when a deciſion of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, by an appeal to arms, became inevitable, he was appointed by congreſs to the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the forces raiſed, and to be raiſed, for our defence. The dignified modeſty with which he accepted this appointment, was a pledge of that fidelity, wiſdom and fortitude, which mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his official conduct through the war.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory will relate the events of this arduous conflict, and the numerous and unequalled diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, hazards and diſcouragements, which he had to encounter, and the unſhaken fortitude
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037587_0019_100EE0BC28ACEEF0"/>
with which he ſuſtained them, till eight revolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years of diſtreſs and ſlaughter, endured with unabating firmneſs by our army, and our citizens, and the ſubjection of two Britiſh armies by our forces, induced the government of Great-Britain to deſpair of ſucceſs, and agree on terms of an honorable peace.</p>
            <p>The treaty of peace being ratified, we next find our beloved General bidding an affectionate farewell to his army, fraught with ſalutary and ſeaſonable counſels, which did great honor to his underſtanding, but ſtill more to his heart. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſbanded the army, he appeared before the Preſident of Congreſs, in a full ſeſſion of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and with a ſolemn and affectionate dignity, which admits not of deſcription, but which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds can feel, he reſigned his commiſſion to the preſident; and retired, as a private man to his ſeat at Mount Vernon, there deſigning to ſpend the remainder of his days in ſweet retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the pure joys of domeſtic harmony.</p>
            <p>The public exigencies however ſoon called him from his beloved retirement, and we find him preſiding in the convention of 1787, which formed the happy conſtitution of our general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. When that conſtitution appeared and was adopted, the eyes and hearts of the friends of order, through the union, were fixed on WASHINGTON, to preſide in the new government. He was accordingly elected, without a diſſenting voice. Having determined to accept the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, he left his beloved retirement, in the ſpring of the year 1789, and proceeded to New-York, where Congreſs was convened. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037587_0020_100EE0BE05D5CE10"/>
of reſpect which were paid him by all claſſes, in the various places through which he paſſed were unequalled. Among which thoſe at the bridge of Trenton will be long remembered.</p>
            <p>When he arrived at New-York, and offered himſelf to receive the legal qualifications of his high office, the ſcene was unutterably mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In an open gallery, in the view of many thouſands of admiring ſpectators, the Preſident advanced with a ſlow and ſolemn pace, laid his hand on the holy volume, and ſwore to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of his high office, while the tears of uncorrupted patriotiſm plentifully watered his venerable cheeks. A general acclamation of the joyous ſpectators ſucceeded. Had not the irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible flow of the tender paſſions precluded utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in many, it would have been univerſal.</p>
            <p>Having filled the office of Preſident of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, for the conſtitutional term of four years, he reluctantly accepted a ſecond unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous election to the office, which he filled, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſecond time, with no leſs wiſdom and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy than the firſt.</p>
            <p>Previous to a third election, he publiſhed his reſignation, his fixed purpoſe of retirement, and laſt advice to the citizens of the United States, full of patriotiſm, full of wiſdom.</p>
            <p>In 1798, the exigencies of the public calling for his aid, he was appointed, by Preſident A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, to the command of the armies of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. Which appointment he accepted, as he had all others, as a gratuitous ſervice to his country, and added another proof to the many
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037587_0021_100EE0BFAFB516C8"/>
already given, of the purity and diſintereſtedneſs of his patriotiſm. The happy influence, on the public mind, of this laſt teſtimony of affection to his country, is freſh in your memory.</p>
            <p>With painful ſenſibility I cloſe this narration with relating, that, on the 14th of December 1799, at 11 o'clock at night, after an illneſs of 24 hours only, this man of incalculable worth, was removed from us forever.—He died as he had lived.—He reſigned his breath with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enity becoming a great and good man.</p>
            <p>VI. It now remains that we ſuggeſt a few thoughts on the improvement to be made of the mournful event we are contemplating.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are called to humble thankſgiving to the God of grace who raiſed up this great man in our land, at ſuch a time, and endued him with thoſe diſtinguiſhed accompliſhments, which furniſhed him for the important part, he was called to act, in the American revolutionary war, and in the ſubſequent events.—That wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more than human, and integrity incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, marked his path, has been often obſerved. It has been the opinion of many wiſe heathens, that eminently wiſe and good men were the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar care of heaven. The holy ſcriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſupport this ſentiment.—In our WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON it is illuſtrated and confirmed.</p>
            <p>The preſervation of a life ſo important, through ſo many dangers, to ſo late a period, is a wonder of divine mercy to be ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered and gratefully acknowledged. His influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on our army to prevent it from diſbanding,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037587_0022_100EE0C143010330"/>
in ſeaſons of extreme diſtreſs and irritation, and his ſucceſsful exertions in the introduction of that conſtitution of government, which is the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our country, as well as the wiſdom, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſucceſs, of his adminiſtration, as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, were of God, and to Him be the glory.</p>
            <p>Great will be the influence connected with the character and example of the firſt Preſident of the United States. What man of worth, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of honeſt ſame, who ſhall ſucceed him, will have the boldneſs to counteract the ſyſtem of adminiſtration which he adopted?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us ſubmit with the deepeſt humility to the righteous ſtroke of God's anger, in this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event.</p>
            <p>God is righteous, He has puniſhed us far leſs than our iniquities deſerve. It becomes us to accept the puniſhment of our ſins, and by deep repentance, and humble ſupplication, to ſeek his favor on our land, on our government, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on the Preſident of the United States. In celebrating the virtues and achievments of WASHINGTON, we are not to be inſenſible, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the good hand of our God on us, in giving him a ſucceſſor whoſe abilities and virtues do honor to his office, and promiſe much good to the United States.</p>
            <p>Let us unite in humble ſupplication to the throne of grace that much of the ſpirit of Elijah may reſt on Eliſha, and that our union may be bleſſed with an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of Preſidents, each of whom, in abilities, virtues, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and ſucceſs, ſhall be a WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:037587_0023_100EE0C356DE7E00"/>
3. We are loudly called to ſtand in our lot for the ſupport of our happy conſtitution, and the preſent wiſe and good adminiſtration of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Great are the proſpects of the American Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. But it has many adverſaries in its own boſom, and ſtill more in Europe. French philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, atheiſm, and diſorganization, will exert their utmoſt, to effect the proſtration of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the demolition of our order and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
            <p>Our Republic is yet new; it is far from having attained the ſtability of riper years. And theſe ſons of Zeruiah will be too hard for us, if we ſlumber over the ineſtimable truſt committed to us by Heaven.</p>
            <p>Unleſs the Lord be on our ſide, when men of this deſcription riſe up againſt us, they will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up quick. But through him they ſhall be diſappointed. The ſnare ſhall be broken and our ſouls delivered. Let us ever commit the United States to the guardianſhip of Him, who never ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth. And let us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently teach our children to fear and ſerve him, to imbibe the principles of true religion, order, morality and good government; to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them all their days, and tranſmit them to their children, that the generations to come, may be wiſe and happy; and that religion, and good order may flouriſh in the American Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:037587_0026_100EE0C5699C5030"/>
4. Our ſubject teaches us the vanity of man as mortal, and our great concern, to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for death and to meet the retributions of eternity.</p>
            <p>If wiſdom, honor, greatneſs and worth, united, will not deliver from death. If there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in this war, we are taught not to "put our truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help." But in the living God. Let us commit ourſelves, our families, and our country, to his gracious protection and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Let us ſerve our generation by the will of God. And let us unite in thankful praiſes to the God of all grace, that although our fathers are dead, and WASHINGTON, our friend, our protector is dead, yet Jeſus Chriſt our Almighty Redeemer ſtill lives, and ſhall never die. But is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and forever,—AMEN.</p>
