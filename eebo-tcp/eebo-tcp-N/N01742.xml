            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE our laſt Diſcourſe about the uneaſie threatning Circumſtances of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> as to <hi>Money</hi> or a <hi>Medium</hi> of <hi>Trade.</hi> I have employed my thoughts ſomewhat in the matter, and I'll briefly hint ſome things that have occur'd to my mind.</p>
            <p>OUR Fathers that firſt ſettled the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> brought ſome <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> with them, after a while, ſome <hi>Money</hi> was Coined here, as <hi>Shillings, Six-Pences,</hi> &amp;c. But in proceſs of time, (even long before <hi>Silver</hi> Money was generally <hi>Exported,</hi> or carried out of the Province,) the greateſt part of the <hi>paſſing Money</hi> here, was <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> viz. <hi>Pieces of Eight, Half Pieces, Eight Pences,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Money</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was chiefly the <hi>Returns</hi> made for our <hi>Fiſh, Lumber, Horſes, Grain, Beaf, Pork,</hi> &amp;c. Exported or carried out of the Country. I think this demonſtrates, that in thoſe times what we <hi>Exported</hi> of our <hi>own produce</hi> (or the fruits of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002067_0002_0FBB78FE535274F8"/>
our own labour,) was more than what was <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> from other Places, either for <hi>Food, Drink,</hi> or <hi>Cloathing;</hi> therefore to make the <hi>Ballance, Money</hi> came in, and continued Circulating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. In thoſe times the Wealth of this Country was on the <hi>growing band.</hi> But of late Years, I'll ſuppoſe the <hi>Twenty</hi> laſt paſt, our <hi>Silver Money</hi> has been generally <hi>Exported,</hi> ſo that now there is not a <hi>Penny</hi> of it paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man. Tho' I don't know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly (nor I believe any one elſe) how much <hi>Money</hi> has been <hi>Exported</hi> this laſt <hi>Twenty Years,</hi> yet I'll now ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds;</hi> and I'll ſuppoſe we have now about <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> out in <hi>Province Bills;</hi> what's out in <hi>Province Bills,</hi> and to be Collected by <hi>Tax,</hi> the Province <hi>owes</hi> for, and is ſo much <hi>in Debt;</hi> what's out upon <hi>Loan,</hi> is owing for by <hi>particular Perſons</hi> in the Province, ſo that the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of this Province owe for the whole. Now if the gueſs I have made be exact, (which I don't pretend to) or pretty near it, then this <hi>Province</hi> in what is <hi>ſpent</hi> and what is <hi>owed</hi> for, are about <hi>Five Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> ſunk in their Eſtates, in about <hi>Twenty Years.</hi> If my gueſs be right in the <hi>Silver Exported,</hi> and the <hi>Province Bills</hi> now out, then the Concluſion I've drawn muſt needs be true.</p>
            <p>BUT how comes it that we have ſunk ſo
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002067_0003_0FBB78FF87043808"/>
much in our Eſtates, in ſo ſhort a time? If any think it occaſioned by the <hi>Wars</hi> we have had in the laſt <hi>Twenty Years;</hi> I'm humbly of a different Sentiment; for we did <hi>not hire Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners</hi> to manage our <hi>Wars.</hi> This Province did not ſend away <hi>Silver Money,</hi> to hire aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>French.</hi> My opinion therefore is, that our <hi>decay in Wealth</hi> is chiefly owing to our <hi>Miſmanagements,</hi> eſpecially our <hi>Extravagance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT is <hi>Imported</hi> into the Province, &amp; <hi>Spent</hi> here, is, or ſhould be <hi>Paid for;</hi> elſe we are <hi>diſhoneſt,</hi> which does not become <hi>Men,</hi> much leſs <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as we are: And if the Fruits and <hi>Produce of our own Labour in this Province,</hi> won't make a ſufficient <hi>Export</hi> to pay for what we receive <hi>from Abroad,</hi> and <hi>Spend</hi> here; then the <hi>Silver</hi> goes to make the <hi>Ballance,</hi> and pay the remainder.</p>
            <p>AND this is the very Caſe, the ſhort and long of the Buſineſs. Our <hi>Silver</hi> is gone to pay the <hi>overplus</hi> of <hi>Imported Goods,</hi> above what our own <hi>Product Exported,</hi> could pay. Among the Commodities <hi>Imported,</hi> ſome are really <hi>uſeful</hi> for us, which we are not able to <hi>raiſe,</hi> or <hi>make</hi> our ſelves, ſome not at all, ſome not as yet, or not enough of it, as <hi>Canvas, Riggin, Braſs, Copper, Pewter, Tin-Ware, Glaſs</hi> for Windows, <hi>Sugar, Meloſſes, Cotton-Wool, Paper, Needles, Pins, Scythes, Sickles, Cutlary Ware,</hi> &amp;c. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002067_0004_0FBB7900F91F8130"/>
our <hi>own Produce</hi> (if we joyned <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> together) which might be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,</hi> would be enough to pay for all the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> Commodities, which are really <hi>needful</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>BUT then many things have been <hi>Imported,</hi> which have <hi>not been neceſſary,</hi> yet very coſtly; ſuch as <hi>Silver and Gold Lace,</hi> worn on <hi>Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Shoes, Velvet, Rich Silk, Sattin, Silk Stockings, Fine Broad-Cloths, Camlets, Perriwiggs, Fine coſtly Shoes and Pattoons, Ribbons, Rich Lace, Silk-Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs, Fine Hatts, Gloves</hi> of great price and little worth, <hi>China Ware,</hi> very <hi>Coſtly-Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſſes, Cane-Chairs, Coſtly Beds &amp; Furniture,</hi> &amp;c. We in the Country, think that <hi>ſome ſcores of Thouſands of Pounds</hi> in late Years, have been ſpent by this Province in theſe things, and that the Province would have been much better without them. I don't now contend againſt theſe things as being <hi>Unlawful in themſelves;</hi> but for us to ſend off our <hi>Silver Money</hi> to buy them, &amp; now not have a Penny to paſs between Man &amp; Man for our neceſſary buſineſs, I think has not been our <hi>Prudence</hi> but our great <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>POSSIBLY ſome will ſay, the fault is in the <hi>Middling</hi> or <hi>Poorer</hi> ſort of People, who buy theſe things, and go <hi>above their Ability,</hi> in doing it. The reply is, Poſſibly it has been great <hi>weakneſs</hi> in the <hi>Richer</hi> ſort to lead in theſe things, and <hi>greater folly</hi> in the <hi>Poorer</hi> to follow them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002067_0005_0FBB79098DED3750"/>
HOWEVER, its matter of Fact, that there's much <hi>needleſs Expence</hi> in ſundry of theſe things, and tho' ſome <hi>Richer</hi> Perſons or Families can bear the <hi>Coſt</hi> of theſe Expences, yet <hi>Poorer</hi> ones (who too much affect them) can't; but whether ſuch things are ſpent by <hi>Rich</hi> or <hi>Poor,</hi> its all one to the Province in general. For what's <hi>Imported</hi> and ſpent in the Province muſt be paid for by <hi>Export</hi> from it; and if the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of our Labour</hi> won't do it, our <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> muſt go (or rather is gone) to make it up.</p>
            <p>AND as I'm humbly of Opinion, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had much better have been without, many <hi>Scores of Thouſands of Pounds</hi> of fine coſtly things <hi>Imported</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpent</hi> here; ſo I believe other things tho' <hi>uſeful</hi> in their <hi>time &amp; meaſure,</hi> have been <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> and Spent in <hi>greater Quantities,</hi> than has been for our good, Such as <hi>Wine, Rum, Brandy,</hi> (not to mention <hi>Tea, Coffee, Chacolet,</hi> which People here formerly did very well without) that there has been much <hi>needleſs Expence</hi> in theſe things, I ſuppoſe none will deny. So far and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as any have drunk to <hi>exceſs,</hi> the Sin of <hi>Drunkènneſs</hi> has been chargeable on them, which they ſhould ſeriouſly and penitently conſider of; but I'm now conſidering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to <hi>Coſt</hi> of ſuch <hi>Imported Liquors.</hi> If <hi>ſeveral Thouſand Pounds Yearly,</hi> are <hi>needleſly</hi> ſpent in theſe things, ſo many <hi>Thouſands a Year</hi> we are hurt even on this account, that our <hi>Export</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002067_0006_0FBB790AE79627C0"/>
does not (without ſending off <hi>Silver</hi>) equal our <hi>Import.</hi> If out of our <hi>own Produce,</hi> a Cargo of <hi>Staves, Hoops, Horſes, &amp;c.</hi> has for its <hi>return,</hi> a Cargo of <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Rum,</hi> and <hi>one Third</hi> of it is <hi>needleſly</hi> expended and waſted here; if inſtead of this <hi>Third</hi> needleſly ſpent, the return had been made in <hi>Silver,</hi> I think this might be call'd <hi>double gain.</hi> And ſince as to the <hi>Coſt part</hi> (beſides the <hi>Sin</hi> of Intemperance) we are much hurt by the <hi>needleſs Expence</hi> of <hi>Imported Liquors;</hi> I conceive that the <hi>needleſs</hi> multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Retailers,</hi> tends further to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh us. For Perſons thus <hi>employ'd</hi> think to get a <hi>Living</hi> by their <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and ſo are for <hi>drawing</hi> and <hi>vending</hi> as much <hi>Liquor</hi> as they can, and its to be fear'd, criminally incourage others to buy, and the more is ſpent for what's <hi>Imported,</hi> the more muſt be <hi>Exported</hi> in one thing or other to <hi>Pay</hi> for it. And tho' ſome may think it a <hi>Publick advantage</hi> to <hi>multiply Licences</hi> for <hi>ſelling of Drink,</hi> to draw more <hi>Exciſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> into the <hi>Treaſury;</hi> yet I conceive it to be a <hi>Publick hurt,</hi> becauſe our <hi>Import</hi> muſt be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered by our <hi>Export;</hi> and yet we have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the latter to do it; therefore our <hi>Silver Money</hi> is gone.  A <hi>needleſs</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of <hi>Retailers,</hi> whether of <hi>Drink</hi> or <hi>Shop Goods,</hi> is no advantage to the Publick. For if the ſame Goods are bought by <hi>Ten Perſons</hi> one after another, with deſign to Sell again,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002067_0007_0FBB790C4CB54FA8"/>
before the Perſon buys them that deſigns to <hi>wear</hi> or <hi>uſe</hi> them; each of thoſe <hi>Ten Perſons</hi> aims at <hi>Gain</hi> in paſſing thro' his hands, and the <hi>laſt</hi> buyer and <hi>uſer</hi> pays it all; whereas if he had bought it of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Seller,</hi> he might have ſav'd the <hi>gain</hi> which the other <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Nine</hi> Perſons had, and thoſe Perſons might have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in other Buſineſs. For tho' in this caſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Nine needleſs Retailers,</hi> get ſome gain to themſelves, and the laſt <hi>buyer</hi> and <hi>uſer</hi> pays it all, yet the <hi>Province,</hi> or <hi>Publick</hi> is not enrich'd <hi>one Farthing</hi> by their labour. If they had been employ'd in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> or <hi>Handycraft-Buſineſs;</hi> there would probably have been ſome produce of their labour for the Publick Good; either <hi>Grain, Cattle, Hemp, Flax raiſed,</hi> or <hi>Cloath, Shoes,</hi> or <hi>Utenſils</hi> made, which might be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to themſelves or others; but their <hi>meer banding of Goods one to another,</hi> no more increaſes any Wealth in the Province, than Perſons <hi>at a Fire</hi> increaſe the <hi>Water in a Pail,</hi> by paſſing it thro' <hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Forty hands.</hi> This matter might be conſidered, as to <hi>Petty Shops,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> and <hi>Foreſtallers of the Market.</hi> I would not be thought here to condemn <hi>Retailing</hi> in general, for doubtleſs Perſons may get an <hi>honeſt Living</hi> by it, and thoſe who <hi>buy</hi> of them may be <hi>gainers</hi> too, by having the Commodities brought <hi>nearer,</hi> which prevents the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Expence</hi> of <hi>travelling</hi> farther for them. It's therefore only
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002067_0008_0FBB790DFA3926C0"/>
a <hi>needleſs Retailing</hi> (whether of <hi>Drink</hi> or other <hi>Commodities</hi>) which I look on as hurtful to the Publick, becauſe the Perſons ſo employed, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>raiſe or produce no good to the Public<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> which they might do if labouring in ſome other and proper buſineſs. <hi>Needleſs Retailers,</hi> with reſpect to any Publick benefit, are really <hi>Idlers;</hi> they help to ſpend what is <hi>Raiſed</hi> or <hi>Imported,</hi> but produce neither by their labour.</p>
            <p>THUS I've hinted by what way and means I conceive our <hi>Silver</hi> has been <hi>Exported,</hi> and we are ſunk ſo <hi>deep in Debt,</hi> viz. by <hi>Importing</hi> and ſpending many things which we had better been without; and by an <hi>exceſſive ſpending</hi> ſome things <hi>Imported,</hi> which in themſelves conſider'd, and in their <hi>time</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> may be reckon'd <hi>uſeful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion is, How to <hi>redreſs this grievance, &amp; extricate our ſelves from theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi> I think this Queſtion is not improper to be thought upon, by any one that wiſhes well to this Province, as I'm ſure I heartily do. My Opinion is, that we can't ſuddenly or at once get rid of theſe difficulties, which our own <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Extravagance</hi> have brought us into. Yet I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that in a few Years time, by an ordinary courſe of Providence we might gradually free our ſelves from them. When a <hi>Traveller</hi> knows he has miſſed his way, he often goes back in the ſame Path, 'till he's ſure that he is in the right
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002067_0009_0FBB791590D7A928"/>
road again. I think we ſhould take the ſame method. In the mean time, let us Cultivate <hi>Peace, Love, Unity,</hi> not be hard on one another for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſentiments, about ways to mend our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; let us not foment <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but ſtudiouſly avoid them, as we love GOD and our COUNTRY, <hi>Every City or Houſe divided againſt it ſelf, ſhall not ſtand.</hi> Thus watching againſt Diſcord, I'll ſay, Let not Merchants <hi>Import needleſs Commodities,</hi> or if they do, let us <hi>not buy or uſe</hi> them; nor uſe <hi>more than needs</hi> of what is <hi>uſeful</hi> in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>LET no <hi>Wool, Hides, Leather, Grain</hi> nor <hi>Candles</hi> be <hi>Exported,</hi> when at a dear price. Let us grow more <hi>Frugal</hi> in <hi>furniſhing &amp; adorning</hi> our Houſes, in our <hi>Cloths, Food</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> this we might do (many at leaſt) without hurting our Bodies by <hi>Cold, Thirſt</hi> or <hi>Hunger.</hi> Let us be diligent and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, to <hi>raiſe, produce, make</hi> as much as we can for our own ſupport, as to <hi>Food, Raiment, Tools, Utenſils.</hi> Let <hi>Husbandry,</hi> (tilling theground) be more diligently and generally followed, that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Fleſh</hi> may be rais'd, and <hi>Barley</hi> to make <hi>Drink,</hi> that ſo the leſs <hi>Imported Drink</hi> might be called for. Let us raiſe more <hi>Sheep &amp; Flax,</hi> and make as much of our own <hi>Clothing,</hi> both <hi>Woollen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Let us by diligent labour <hi>raiſe</hi> &amp; <hi>make</hi> as much as we can for our ſelves, of <hi>Food, Raiment, Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, &amp;c.</hi> and buy no more of <hi>Imported</hi> Goods than <hi>neceſſity</hi> requires, I ſay, the obſerving theſe Rules would ſoon <hi>turn the Scales,</hi> and better our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: I'm humbly of opinion, that a Thouſand Schemes about <hi>Banks</hi> and <hi>Paper-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

But the longer we continue in our <hi>preſent courſe</hi> of ſpending ſo much of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Commodities,</hi> and <hi>raiſing ſo little by our own labours,</hi> ſo much the deeper we neceſſarily ſink into miſery.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002067_0012_0FBB791A8AA7C0B0"/>
room of it; I ſay, hereby <hi>Merchants Imported Goods</hi> are come to an <hi>Extravagant Advance.</hi> When we buy <hi>European</hi> or <hi>West-India</hi> Goods, we give for ſome <hi>double,</hi> for others <hi>more than double</hi> the Price that was given <hi>Fifteen</hi> or <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Years ago. This neceſſitates us in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> to <hi>raiſe in ſome proportion</hi> the Price of our <hi>Grain, Fleſh, Wood, Hay, Butter, Cheeſe, &amp;c.</hi> We formerly Sold <hi>Butter, Six pence a Pound,</hi> that <hi>Six Pence</hi> would buy <hi>Two Pounds of Sugar,</hi> and if we now have <hi>Nine pence</hi> a Pound for <hi>Butter,</hi> that <hi>Nine pence</hi> will buy but <hi>One Pound of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> or thereabouts. So that when we receive ſo great a Price as we do, yet we find it hard enough to rub along; and the more ſo, becauſe <hi>Boſton diſtemper</hi> is got into the <hi>Country,</hi> that is, <hi>We</hi> and our <hi>Families</hi> are fond of many <hi>needleſs Imported Commodities,</hi> and muſt pay the <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> or Merchants an Extravagant rate for them. If this <hi>raiſing on one another</hi> in Trade, <hi>helps</hi> ſome, yet it <hi>hurts</hi> more.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER thing which very much deſerves our conſideration is, That <hi>Salary Men, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, School-Maſters, Judges of the Circuit, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident &amp; Tutors</hi> at <hi>Colledge, Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans, &amp;c.</hi> are pincht and hurt more than any; for while they pay it may be double or more, both for <hi>Imported Goods,</hi> and the <hi>Produce of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> yet their <hi>Salaries</hi> are not increas'd (if at all) <hi>in proportion,</hi> to what the <hi>Merchant</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002067_0013_0FBB791DB82BBAF0"/>
               <hi>Husbandman</hi> raiſes upon one another, tho' they muſt buy of <hi>both.</hi> If Juſtice and Equity don't ſay, their <hi>Salaries</hi> ought to be increas'd, let any one judge.</p>
            <p>BUT poſſibly ſome will ſay, if we do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to <hi>raiſe neceſſaries for our ſelves,</hi> and buy no more than <hi>neceſſity</hi> requires of <hi>Imported Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> this courſe will ſpoil <hi>Merchandizing</hi> and <hi>Trading.</hi> I reply, the good of the whole ſhould be preferred to that of a part. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing</hi> and <hi>Trading</hi> are neceſſary and <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for us, if well manag'd; but miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, may hurt a People. <hi>Trading</hi> has carried off our <hi>Money,</hi> we have not a <hi>Shilling</hi> in <hi>Silver</hi> Paſſing, and we are deep in Debt; has <hi>not this Trading</hi> almoſt ruin'd us? Is not this, to <hi>buy and ſell and live by the loſs?</hi> It is not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Publick, to have <hi>too many</hi> of any <hi>particular Trade or Calling,</hi> for they muſt either be <hi>idle</hi> (when they might be imploy'd in proper buſineſs) or labour <hi>for little or nothing,</hi> which is unprofitable to themſelves, and to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick therein. If there be Merchants enough to manage the <hi>Export</hi> we can <hi>raiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Import we need,</hi> there's enough; <hi>Supernumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are <hi>hurtful</hi> not <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to the Publick; 'twould be better they were imploy'd in other buſineſs.</p>
            <p>POSSIBLY, ſome think, that the Emitting <hi>more Paper Money</hi> would bring us out of our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002067_0014_0FBB791FD379BF90"/>
difficulties, but I'm humbly of another Opinion. I think ſome engaged in Trade have obſerv'd, that ſince the Emitting the <hi>laſt Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds,</hi> the <hi>Price</hi> of Commodities <hi>Imported,</hi> and of our own <hi>Produce,</hi> has been conſiderably <hi>rais'd;</hi> which is not ſo much from the <hi>ſcarcity</hi> of ſuch <hi>Commodities,</hi> as from the <hi>mean opinion</hi> Perſons have of the <hi>paſſing Money.</hi> The laſt I have heard is, that when <hi>Silver Money</hi> is Sold (now and then a little as ſome can get it) it fetches <hi>Eleven</hi> or <hi>Twelve Shillings</hi> an <hi>Ounce</hi> in <hi>Paper Money;</hi> whereas according to our <hi>Law (Seventeen Penny Weight at Six Shillings) Silver</hi> Money is but a very ſmall matter more than <hi>Seven Shillings an Ounce.</hi> This plainly ſhows the <hi>low value</hi> People have for <hi>Paper Money.</hi> It ſeems as tho' the more 'tis <hi>increas'd</hi> the <hi>leſs 'tis valued.</hi> I'm prone to think, that if <hi>every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> in the Province, had a <hi>Thouſand Pounds in Paper Money; Twenty Shillings</hi> of it, would not then buy ſo much, as <hi>Five Shillings</hi> will now. In this Province, People generally deſire to be <hi>Freehold,</hi> they don't chuſe to be <hi>Tenants,</hi> and <hi>pay Rent.</hi> But if we <hi>take up Money</hi> whether of the <hi>Province</hi> or <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> on our <hi>Lands;</hi> we ſo far become <hi>Tenants</hi> to the <hi>Lenders,</hi> and <hi>pay Rent</hi> to them. And if we can't pay when what's borrowed is regularly call'd for, but a <hi>Courſe of Law</hi> recovers <hi>Land</hi> from us; poſſibly <hi>more Land</hi> will be taken, then we ſhould have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002067_0015_0FBB79252D69BF68"/>
been willing to have Sold, for <hi>half ſo much more</hi> as we have <hi>borrowed.</hi> Poſſibly ſome who have <hi>taken up Money on their Lands,</hi> by being uncapable of paying will <hi>loſe them; Frugality</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> would have been a greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch, than their <hi>hiring Money</hi> was.</p>
            <p>THIS (out of true love to my dear Country, where I was born, and hitherto have liv'd, without ill will to any Perſon or Perſons whatſoever,) I've freely given you ſome hints of my Opinion, about our preſent uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumſtances; you may conſider 'em, and communicate 'em to your Neighbours if they I do any good. If you ſee meet to return your own thoughts to me in Writing, I ſhould be glad of your Opinion as to the following Queries, viz.</p>
            <p>IF <hi>Richer and Abler Perſons and Families,</hi> would abate conſiderably of their <hi>Rich needleſs fineries, and coſtly way of living;</hi> therein giving a <hi>leading Example</hi> to Inferiors?</p>
            <p>IF needleſs Extravagant Expences at <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings &amp; Funerals</hi> were retrench'd; and no <hi>Gloves</hi> but of our own make, given at either; nor <hi>Drink</hi> at Funerals but of our <hi>own produce;</hi> nor <hi>Scarves</hi> but for Perſons of ſome <hi>diſtinguiſh'd drunk?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF <hi>Counſellors, Miniſters, Militay Commiſſion Officers,</hi> would <hi>purpoſely</hi> wear <hi>Garments, Shoes, Stockings, Gloves, Hatts,</hi> (as ſoon as they can get 'em) of our <hi>own make?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF conſiderable encouragement were given
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002067_0016_0FBB7926960E6C60"/>
by the <hi>Publick</hi> for the <hi>Raiſing</hi> and <hi>Manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> eſpecially that the <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>Town and Country</hi> might be <hi>Employ'd;</hi> and for <hi>Manufacturing of Iron,</hi> (whereof there is plenty of <hi>Oar</hi> in the Land,) eſpecially in Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Potts, Kettles,</hi> making <hi>Nails</hi> of various ſorts, &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>IF <hi>Waſte Lands</hi> within Townſhips were Tax'd, to make the Owners themſelves <hi>Improve</hi> 'em, or <hi>Sell</hi> 'em to thoſe that would, for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>more plenty</hi> of <hi>Grain, Fleſh, Butter, Cheeſe, Wool,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHETHER theſe Methods would not be of Publick Service?</p>
            <p>BUT as to my own Opinion, 'tis in ſhort what I ſaid before, to <hi>raiſe what we can </hi> by our own labour, to ſupply our ſelves, and to buy no more than <hi>neceſſity</hi> requires of <hi>Imported Goods,</hi> is the moſt ſure way to relieve us.</p>
