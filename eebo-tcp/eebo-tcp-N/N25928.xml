            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a common place obſervation "that man is born with a capacity to enjoy happineſs." Each one believes this true in theory, and imagines, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others have failed of practically verifying it, he ſhall certainly be an illuſtrious inſtance of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification. His predeceſſor has blindly miſtaken the way, and he has found it; but at the cloſe of life, when he is taking a retroſpective view of his journey, he finds that he has been purſuing a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, like thoſe who went before him, and while, with the wiſe man, he exclaims that "all is vanity," he feels, on his dying bed, experimental evidence, that the only real "good under the ſun, is for a man to eat, and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, for that is the gift of God."</p>
            <p>Something here is in the wrong. Either happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not to be obtained in this world, or thoſe who ſeek it miſtake the road which leads to it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the former is the fact—though I believe, much more felicity might be enjoyed than there is, if people knew how to ſeek for it. If the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034482_0003_0FFDE742E93996C0"/>
faculties of man, did not participate in his joys and ſorrows, his tranquility would but rarely be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, where objects for ſenſual gratification were within his reach. Having ſatisfied the claims of hunger and thirſt, and protected his body from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement ſeaſons, his remaining care would be, to ſooth the calls of ſenſuality, by indulgence to the full. But this is not the caſe. Man is created with a ſenſual, and a mental, capacity for enjoyment.— Theſe are not unfrequently in direct oppoſition at each other, where the ſenſes deſire what reaſon diſapproves. Notwithſtanding they are often at variance, yet they are perfectly reconcilable; and when in harmony, a rational indulgence of the one, will contribute much to the gratification of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the paſſions get the ſtart in infancy, and by the time that reaſon begins to exerciſe its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they have generally become ſo headſtrong, that they turn a deaf ear to her advice, and like Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu, drive furiouſly after their enemy.</p>
            <p>The infant ſcarcely opens its eyes before it cries for the moon. It is a pleaſing object to its ſight, and reaſon has not yet taught it to know the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of its indulgence. The ſchool-boy finds his gratification, at times, in his bow and arrow, in his popgun, in his ſkates, his hoop and his whiſtle— and, although actual poſſeſſion at this time of life, affords more laſting contentment, than at any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent period, yet, even now, it is fleeting; it fades with the novelty of its object, and is forgotten almoſt as ſoon as known. How ſoon will the boy forget his whiſtle, when his comrade produces a jews harp? And how readily does the jews-harp give place to the top? as childhood draws to a cloſe, the childiſh ſports are laid aſide, and the young man places his happineſs in his horſes, his beauty, the favorable reception which he may meet with among the young ladies, or on ſome other object equally
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034482_0003_0FFDE742E93996C0"/>
trivial. It is not enough that he poſſeſſes theſe— but they muſt be pre-eminently his. So long as his horſe is the handſomeſt and moſt the ſubject of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, he is contented with it. But no ſooner does his townſmen appear with a handſomer horſe, and a fine new chaiſe, than his own looſes half its value, and immediately he ſets his thoughts at work to invent how he can ſurpaſs his comrade in both. Suppoſe he does it. His happineſs is again diſſipated the moment he ſees an acquaintance in his phaeton, drawn by his ſpan and driven by his ſervant.— Should he procure theſe, his felicity would again be deſtroyed by the firſt coack and four which he ſaw.</p>
            <p>A ſmall part even of our temporal happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in actual poſſeſſion. While an object of deſire is contemplated in futurity, we behold in it nothing but that which promiſes pleaſure. When obtained, though it may poſſeſs all that which made it deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble while at a diſtance, it is found uſually to poſſeſs more. The roſe bloſſoms on a briar buſh, and the ſun too long beheld, deſtroys the ſight. To illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the foregoing, we will turn our thoughts, for a moment, to a child, and follow him in his progreſs to old age. His firſt great wiſh, which promiſes fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, is to have his petticoats exchanged for a boy's dreſs. He ſoon wants a penknife, a top or a pair of ſkates. Theſe afford him no permanent ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until he can open the firſt, ſpin the ſecond, and run upon the third. After he has learned theſe, do they ſatisfy him? No; he now longs to be of age. At twenty-one years, he wants to be in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by himſelf, to have a houſe, and to be married. A wife cannot render him contented without chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Is he contented with theſe? He now muſt have an eſtate to educate them, and to ſecure them from poverty, if he ſhould die during their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. How many anxieties does he feel on their account? If one of them is ſick, the parent takes
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034482_0004_0FFDE744A4BAB1D8"/>
no reſt until he thinks him out of danger. When he is in health, his ſolicitude is transferred to ſome other concern for the good of his child. After his children are reared up to manhood, he is uneaſy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are married and ſettled in life. His next wiſh muſt be gratified, for without it, this is of no importance; he muſt ſee their children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his name will be perpetuated to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; elſe all his former cares, and anxieties, are not worth the trouble they have coſt. Does this grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him? Is he now ready to reſign up all to them, and be laid down in peace? No; all the ſolicitude, the diſappointments, and mortifications, he has met with in this world, do not alienate his affections from life; nor does his experience yet make him feel that permanent happineſs cannot be procured. He will <hi>tell</hi> you that it cannot, before he is ten years old, but he never practically believes it until on his deathbed. I have known a man, of nearly four ſcore years, who had lived in ſorrow all his days, and had ſtruggled with poverty and ſickneſs, during his whole life, who had been blind for about a year. Often has he told me, that all the troubles of his life were not half ſo burthenſome as the loſs of his eye ſight. He had enjoyed it longer than the period uſually allotted to man, and it had ſerved him only to witneſs ſcenes of pain and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet he thought that if he could only have his ſight reſtored to him, if it was but juſt enough for him to walk about, he ſhould be <hi>perfectly happy.</hi>— Juſt ſuch creatures we are. When we poſſeſs a bleſſing, we know not how valuable it is, nor how much our happineſs depends upon it, until we are deprived of it. Some future good allures us; and, when obtained, we find it not to poſſeſs <hi>that</hi> for which we ſo earneſtly ſought it; and away our wiſhes fly to ſomething <hi>ſtill remote</hi>—which, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>btained, ſerves us in the ſame manner. And if
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034482_0004_0FFDE744A4BAB1D8"/>
we were to puſh on, like Alexander the Great, to the conqueſt of the world, like him, we ſhould ſit down and cry when it was vanquiſhed; not becauſe we had poſſeſſions enough, but becauſe there would be <hi>nothing more to ſeek for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Providence has ſo formed us, and ſo variegated our lives, with good and evil, pleaſure and pain, happineſs and miſery, that we may not become ſo attached to this world, as to be unwilling to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for another. He has ſent us here as gueſts to an entertainment, in which there are nouriſhing and poiſonous ingredients. He has taught us how to diſtinguiſh between them—has ſet before us the ſtrongeſt motives to improve the one, and to ſhun the other, and left us to exerciſe our own diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such was the caſe with Eve, and ſuch has been the caſe with all of her deſcendants. The forbidden fruit "was fair to look upon," and ſhe eat it; and by eating it, ſhe loſt paradiſe—tainted the whole of her deſcendants, and, from her, they inherit the ſame diſpoſition. They, like her, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about in purſuit of happineſs. She enjoyed it in paradiſe, and knew it not until it was forfeited. When forfeited, ſhe ſought in vain to find it on earth. She loſt it for her children, and they will, like her, ſeek it in vain, unleſs they purſue it in that road which will re-conduct them to paradiſe.</p>

               <p>The woman is commanded to obey the man, and the man ought to obey the woman; and yet there are not two obedients, but one obedient.</p>
               <p>For there is one dominion nominal of the huſband, and another dominion real of the wife.</p>
               <p>And yet there are not two dominions but one dominion.</p>
               <p>For, like as we are compelled by the chriſtian verity to acknowledge, that wives muſt ſubmit themſelves to their huſbands, and be ſubject to them in all things;</p>
               <p>So we are forbidden by the conjugal faith to ſay, that they ſhould be at all influenced by their wills, or pay regard to their commands.</p>
               <p>The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man;</p>
               <p>Yet the man ſhall be the ſlave of the woman, and the woman the tyrant of the man:</p>
               <p>So that in all things, as aforeſaid, the ſubjection of the ſuperior to the inferior is to be believed.</p>

               <p>For the right faith is, that we believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the wife is fallible and infallible;</p>
               <p>Perfectly fallible and perfectly infallible; of an erring ſoul and unerring mind ſubſiſting; fallible, as touching human nature; and infallible, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her female ſex.</p>

               <p>GAMING is the curſe that ſpreads the wideſt, and ſticks the cloſeſt to the preſent times: All ranks and degrees of people are infected with it; it is the livelihood of many, and ſo countenanced by all, that it is almoſt ſcandalous to forbear it, and eſteemed down-right ill-breeding to expoſe it. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, if cards are called for, let it be a ſignal for you to take your leave. Nor let the propoſal of a trifling ſtake be a bait to induce you to ſit

down: Adventurers heat themſelves by play, as cowards by wine; and he that began timorouſly, may, by degrees, ſurpaſs the whole party in raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and extravagance. Beſides, as avarice is one of our ſtrongeſt paſſions, ſo nothing flatters it more than play. Good ſucceſs has an almoſt irreſiſtable charm, and ill prompts us to put all to the hazard, to recover our loſſes; either way, nothing is more infatuating, or deſtructive.</p>
               <p>This is but a faint ſketch of the miſchiefs attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gaming, even upon the ſquare; but, where it is otherwiſe, which often happens, as numbers have found to their coſt, what can ſave the wretched bubble from imminent and inevitable ruin; or who can enumerate the ſnares, the blinds, the lures em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by ſharpers, to entrap their prey, and ratify the premeditated miſchief? To be ſafe, then, keep out of the poſſibility of danger. Strangers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dazzling their appearance, are always to be miſtruſted. Even perſons who prided themſelves on their birth, rank and fortune, have been found confederates with theſe ſplendid pick-pockets. And to play with your friends, is an infallible receipt to loſe them; for, if you plunder them, they'll aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you with reſentment: and, if they plunder you, they'll decline an interview, that muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſecret ill-will, if not open reproaches. To avoid all theſe hazards, play not at all; but, when you find yourſelf giving way to the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation, by caſting your eyes on thoſe who gain a livelihood by theſe execrable means, let their deteſted reputations, and the contempt always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them, deter you from the deteſtable ambition of making your way to fortune by the ſame infernal road; or, if that reflection proves ineffectual for your preſervation, look with horror on the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of meagre faces that haunt gaming houſes, as ghoſts are ſaid to do the places where their treaſure

               <head>THE POOR MAN's APOLOGY For marrying a <hi>POOR WOMAN.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MY lot was caſt among thoſe to whom fortune deals her favors ſparingly: nature, as if to make amends for the niggardlineſs of the capricious god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, made me heir to a conſtitution, though not the moſt robuſt, equal to the ſtation heaven had allotted to me; and I thought my condition enviable, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as I was with fortitude ſufficient to encounter poverty in wedlock. All my acquaintance cried ſhame on the man who had been ſo blind to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and in the moſt unreſerved terms cenſured me for ſhaking hands with beggary. The cuſtom of this thrifty age, indeed, and the oppreſſive tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the times, gave a color of juſtice to a cenſure apparently dictated by friendſhip. Nevertheleſs their remonſtrances made but a tranſient impreſſion on a mind like mine, which had armed itſelf againſt the viciſſitudes of the world by the following reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, previous to the ſolemn engagement into which I had entered.</p>
               <p>Every man who marries without a fortune, pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es himſelf to the ſtate for his induſtry; after having turned the matter in my mind, I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that my country has a ſimilar claim upon me. But ſhall I marry to gratify the inclinations of others, perhaps to humor their caprices? or indulge a wiſh of my own? Some friends I have, who are very importunate with me to be directed by them—one tells me, he has had in his eye for me, ever ſince my birth, a lady who is immenſely rich, but mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly hunchbacked withall, and arrived at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber age of ſixty—from her having been unſolicited
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034482_0007_0FFDE74A79564C88"/>
ſo long, I muſt needs ſuppoſe her to be the refuge of her whole ſex. Now, ſhould I, in a fit of inſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for nothing ſhort of a derangement of my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects could urge me to the raſh act, link myſelf to decrepidate, and her diſpoſition be as crooked as her perſon, where ſhould I hope for redreſs? Could this friend of mine diſſolve the tie, or I recal my words? No, the words are irrevocable, the bond indiſſoluble, "till death doth us part." To wiſh that death would ſtep in, to rid me of my incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, by ſummoning away my joke fellow, or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would be ſinful; beſides that ſuch a wiſh would be fruitleſs for ſhe might live long enough to break my heart. At her age, the turbulence of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is ſuppoſed to be calmed, it is true; but were the forty years younger, would that better my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Upon conſideration I think it would not; by the time a woman ſits down to ſerious houſewifery, her marriage portion is ſpent in the indulgencies, which ſhe expects forſooth in conſideration of her dower. Hence I conclude, that my friend, in his recommendation of a wife to me, is actuated by no other motive than his pride, which would be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his owning a poor relative. So help me God then, I will chuſe for myſelf, and woo happineſs in a perſon whoſe diſpoſition I think congenial to my own.</p>

               <p>"FOR every creature of God is good." "Rum is one of theſe creatures." To a man in his right mind it would only be neceſſary to ſay <hi>ergo;</hi>
but as this number may light upon ſome not in a ſituation to comprehend the whole meaning of <hi>ergo,</hi> I will put the inference in language ſuited to their capacities, <hi>ergo, Rum is good.</hi> If there is one of my readers who is not in perfect good humour on hearing this phraſe, it muſt be ſome churliſh old bachelor, too nigardly ever to buy rum enough to make himſelf happy. Theſe reaſonings are juſt, the firſt quotation is taken from the ſacred book, the ſecond is as undeniable as the firſt; and as to the inference, witneſs ye dram-drinkers who love a <hi>good ſuck</hi> in the morning—witneſs ye bucks and blades, who ſit in the tavern and drink rum nekus till your vociferous brawls ſet the houſe in an uproar —witneſs ye tavern hunters, who ſpend your time and your eſtates in defence of this great, but ſimple truth that rum is good. Rum is good, and ſo is Arſenic, and a man who prefers a ſudden death to a lingering one would ſooner ſwallow the latter than the former. I ſpeak of the immoderate uſe of rum. Rum is good—for a wound—a diſlocated limb—and a thouſand other things; but ſwallowed in large draughts, is as certain death as arſenic.— To depict the whole catalogue of evils which attend the free uſe of rum, is beyond my abilities, and would do no good. It has been done a thouſand times to no purpoſe. There are men who drink too much rum: There are others who do not drink enough—at each of theſe I ſhall grumble. As I have taken a parſon's text, I may as well take his mode too, and divide my work into firſtlys and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlys: And</p>

No ſooner do I ſeat myſelf in my neighbour's houſe, than he brings out his bottle of rum, orders a picher of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I muſt drink a little of his old ſpirits and water—If it is winter, it will warm my ſtomach and cure my head ache,—if it is ſummer, 'its a fine cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, and as good for the head-ache as any thing in the world. The next thing is to viſit me and taſte my old ſpirits. Your common ſix ſhilling rum does not anſwer, it muſt be old ſpirit. Now as I cannot but juſt ſuport my family with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life, this needleſs expence is irkſome, and complied with, only from a falſe delicacy.

                  </gap>o thoſe who do not drink enough— A neighbour called on me a few days ſince before breakfaſt on buſineſs; the effluvia from a half point of rum met me as ſoon as he opened his mouth. He is a clever fellow, and a man of ſome intereſt; but if he had drank a quart that morning, inſtead of a half point, his family might have been worth ten times more ten years hence, than they will if he lives ten years. The young "daſher," who has drank enough to make him miſchievous, who gets a rail to break open windows, and finds the rail has got him down and will not get off, ought to have drank more; for then he would have fallen before he touch'd the rail, and it eaſier lying alone than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a rail. Young gentlemen of good fortunes and proſpects, who are apt to get high, as they call it, are unpardonable in not drinking more rum.— They can afford it. A little rum or brandy makes

The rich man may pride in deſtroying the only comfort, the virtuous ſolace of the indigent—his reputation—but let him alſo remember that the day of retribution will come when all his boaſted millions ſhall not purchaſe him one moment of the poor man's happineſs.

Malicious ſlander conſiſts in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reports againſt a perſon with a deſign to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure him. This is the height of malevolence. Such ſlanderers regard not whether they utter truth or falſehood; for to create miſery is the ſole object they have in view, their guilt is therefore leſſened but in a ſmall degree by the conſideration that what they report concerning another is truth. "Truth may be made inſtrumental to the ſucceſs of malicious deſigns, as well as falſehood; and if the end be bad, the means cannot be innocent."

"And it is no juſtification to ſay that they entertained no bad deſign." The truth is, we ought always to be actuated by a wiſh to promote the happineſs of others.

               <p>WHAT do folks ſay? is the queſtion—a queſtion that has more influence on the manners of mankind, than all the laws of ſociety. Folks muſt talk—the more they talk the better. Who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the influence of what folks ſays? When I hear a man ſay he does not care a farthing what folks talk about him, I can't believe him.</p>
               <p>Moſt people believe that the good order of ſociety depends wholly on conſtruction of the laws; I do not: the good opinion of our neighbours, and the people within the circle of our acquaintance has ten times more influence on our conduct and department in life, than all the laws that have been enacted from the day of Solomon to the preſent time.— How ſhall we obtain this opinion if folks don't talk? and talk a great deal too. I always feel uneaſy when I hear people finding fault with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for talking about folks. It is, as neceſſary to good order in ſociety, as winds and ſtorms to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſalubrious atmoſphere. We may curſe folks for talking, and curſe again, ſo much the better;

this diſcovers the good effect it has. At firſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the injury; but folks talk again; we then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conſider whether we have given occaſion for the obſervations; if ſo, we ſhall reform, at leaſt be more circumſpect in our behaviour. Few of us are ſuch veterans, as to move on in defiance of the good opinion of the people among whom we live. But folks that talk a great deal, tell falſe ſtories, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten injure the reputation of our neighbours; this is a temporary evil; winds and rain often do great miſchief: no argument that they are unneceſſary: it is not at all ſurpriſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in our great zeal in a good cauſe, we ſhould ſometimes treſpaſs, and paſs bounds of rigid truth. What great injury is done? our neighbour perceives that we are watching and talking about his conduct in life, and will ſet a guard over all his actions, leſt he give occaſion for folks to talk in future. Talk away may friends, and keep talking; enjoy ſecrecy if you pleaſe; no matter; your friend has always his boſom friend to whom he can entruſt the ſecret; and you may be ſure it will not fail coming to the ears of the perſon talked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: it all tends directly to the formations of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſurely muſt be the only reaſon why there is ſo much talking about each other.</p>

I had paſſed the afternoon, in what is called modiſh company, and yet could not avoid remarking that the extreme ſelfiſhneſs of men and women <hi>of the world,</hi> led them, even at a moment, when they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled for oſtentatious civility, to behave diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly. If ſuch rudeneſs, I murmured to myſelf, be in a refined age, let me view the behaviour of thoſe of old time, before dancing maſters were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and when the meſſage cards were not ſent by one Patriarch's lady to another. I found as I expected, that even herdſmen and ſhepherds had as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034482_0015_0FFDE76695FD12F8"/>
much genuine politeneſs as Lord Cheſterfield, and that a country maiden, the daughter of Bethuel, the ſon of Milcah, could behave with as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, as though ſhe had been educated in a boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſchool. The ſtory of this paſtoral girl's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct I wiſh to tell at large, and with that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of faſhionable readers would allow me, on this occaſion, ſo much pedantry as to quote the original. But, as a whole chapter in Geneſis might appear too long, and diſproportionate for a ſhort ſermon, I will attempt to narrate in my own words.</p>
               <p>Abraham a moſt affectionate parent, perceiving that his life declined, and zealous with the anxiety of old age, for an eſtabliſhment for Iſaac, intreats a confidential ſteward of the houſehold, that he would not ſuffer the inexperienced heart of his ſon to be captivated by the Canaanitiſh beauties. At the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt of the patriarch, the ſervant binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſolicit for Iſaac a wife of his own rank, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and country. After ſanctioning this promiſe by one of the moſt tremendeous oaths among the Jewiſh uſages, he harneſſes his camels, and departs for Meſopotamia. On his arrival at the ſuburbs of Nahor, a city of that country, fatigued with a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious journey, and tender of his drudging camels, he makes them kneel by a well of water, to take their neceſſary refreſhment. In this weary moment, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah appears; and the firſt accents that fall from the parched tongue of the traveller, were to ſolicit a little water from the pitcher, which ſhe carried, "<hi>And ſhe made haſte, and let down her pitcher from her ſhoulder and ſaid, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink alſo.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Let us now gaze earneſtly at theſe ſimple, yet beautiful features.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k abundantly reſpectable, for he was allied to Abraham, and her brother was the opulent Laban, whoſe cattle ſtrayed on a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hills. Engaged in domeſtic duty, ſhe meets a ſtranger, in the garb, probably of a hireling, as he is called, in the text "ſervant," be grimmed with duſt, and having no claim to her favor. She is aſked for water, which ſhe cheerfully gives, and the careleſs reader will not be aware of the extent of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, if he had not ſurveyed a map of Paleſtine, and adverted to the ſandineſs and thirſt of the ſoil. In that arid region, a brook was a more joyous ſight to a panting ſhepherd, than a bumper would be now to the votary of wine. The invaluable well ſpring eagerly ſought, and abſtinately contended for, by different tribes, was, from the nature of the earth, at ſuch a diſtance below the ſurface, that to obtain water was a work both of toil and time. But, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting her home, forgetting herſelf, and "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining little delicacies," ſhe thinks only of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the way-faring ſtranger, and with that "<hi>kind charity</hi>" which the Apoſtle emphaſizes, with that genuine, diſintereſted civility, <hi>beyond</hi> the court of Verſailles, the tedious deſcent of the well ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly tries, and the cooling pitcher imparts, not only to the man, but even to his unpetitioning beaſts. "Drink," ſays the generous girl, and, truſt me that I can feel likewiſe for your burdened companions, "for I will give thy camels drink alſo." This was benevolence ſuch as is not generally found. It was eminently diſintereſted, prompt and diffuſive. It was diſintereſted; for the tongue which ſhe cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was not that of a youthful gallant, trolling the oily phraſes of flattery. He who drained the pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which the aſſiduity of Rebekah filled, was an old man, a ſervant and a ſtranger. It was prompt; for ſhe "haſted," and ſhe "ran to do do good; and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034482_0016_0FFDE76A0312B670"/>
drew water for "all the camels," though the troop conſiſted of ten. It was diffuſive; for <hi>they</hi> were minutely regarded no leſs than their proprietor.</p>
               <p>I warmly wiſh that the manners of many, who deem themſelves poliſhed, were at the preſent day, as excellent as thoſe of this primitive well bred wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Frequenting no <hi>aſſemblies</hi> but thoſe of the next green, or meadow, receiving no leſſons of good breeding but thoſe which her own warm heart dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, we find her deportment graceful, though ſhe never paid a dancing maſter, we find her a <hi>maid of honor,</hi> though ſhe never ſaw a court! True polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unlike that of men of the mode, conſiſts in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually rendering little ſervices to our neighbor, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in the oſtentatious <hi>promiſe</hi> of great ones. Indifferent to its own eaſe, it thinks much of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, diſcerns the latent wiſh, and ſupercedes the neceſſity of aſking favors, by ſeaſonably beſtowing them.</p>

It was natural for Iſaac to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a ſeaſon to weep in, which would reſemble the color of his fate. The darkneſs, the ſolemnity, the ſtillneſs of eve were favorable to his melancholy purpoſe.

               <p>The Grecian and Roman Philoſophers firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that "the dead of midnight is the noon of thought."

               <p>But the night is not only propitious to ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but likewiſe to gay and ſocial men. Even the rigid Dr. Johnſon was ſo convinced that late hours were auxiliary to the <hi>feaſt of reaſon and the flow of ſoul,</hi> that he uſed to declare "no man, but a ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel went to bed before midnight." This expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was perhaps too ſtrong, and he would not have uſed it, had he lived in a farm houſe. But his love of the converſation of men of letters and his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that fancy is generally moſt wakeful, when dulneſs ſleeps, tempted him to employ a phraſe which muſt ſtartle every labourer, who, by mere laſſitude of limb is compelled early to retire.</p>
               <p>But night is friendly to playful no leſs than to met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphyſical, and abſtract thought, not only the author and ſtateſman watch, but likewiſe the ſons of ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and glee. Thoſe, who eat "the bread of carefulneſs," go ſoon to bed, to digeſt their meal, and leave the darkened hours to be enjoyed by men of genius, or waſted by men of pleaſure. St. Paul avers that they that be drunken are drunken in the night, and I know that its broad mantle is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed to cover exceſs from the world. Still, the arrival of night is greeted by many, who wiſh neither to ſleep nor drink it away.

               <p>IN every annual revolution there are certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, at which men indulge ideas of aſſociation, whence they may derive, either the pleaſant or the profitable. Thus, the gradual approach of cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpring, the youth of the year, naturally induces us to ſpeculate upon the youth of human life: The naked boughs and dropping leaf of the autumnal tree remind us of mortal decay.

               <p>Theſe periodical habits are of peculiar utility, and deſerve to be ſtudiouſly cheriſhed. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſerious reflection and communion with one's ſelf.

Many an anxious look is caſt up to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſky, leſt the former and latter rain ſhould too ſcantily, or too copiouſly deſcend, leſt the ſun ſhould too fiercely glow, or mildewing vapour float, on vegetation. But, when the graſs is dryed and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the mellow fruit of the orchards is melting into his caſks, and the <hi>harveſt</hi> moon lights his reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the laſt wheat ſheaf, then is ſolicitude appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he, exultingly, exclaims "I have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
               <p>The preſent, is the very period, in which harveſt that "conſummation" ſo "devoutly to be wiſhed" by every huſbandman, takes place. Of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who uſe themſelves to preach occaſional ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I percieve it is the practice, to paint, and to praiſe the benefits of that particular year, in which eulogium is compoſed. But although of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous good days which happy Americans have reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, thoſe, which compoſe the current year, have ſhone among the faireſt, yet, it is not the deſign of this diſcourſe to ſpeak only of the <hi>fruit baſket</hi> of the preſent ſeaſon. Our baſkets are always full, ours are thoſe regular alterations of heat and moiſture, which beget plenty to the huſbandman, for we have

"a ſouth land," and "ſprings of water," we have the "upper and the nether ſprings."</p>
               <p>At all times, America ſeems a privileged quarter of the globe. "Fruit" ever abounding, ſubject to no tithe, and eaten in tranquility marks our happy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. Theſe topicks being ſlightly conſidered, the patience of the reader ſhall be relieved by the cloſe of the ſermon.</p>
               <p>Whatever hiſtorical volumes, or ſyſtem of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography we peruſe, we find that moſt countries are expoſed either to baleful viciſſitudes of climate, or the capricious violence of tempeſt, drought, or inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. In the hallowed volume, almoſt every verſe alluſive to the natural hiſtory of Paleſtine, in old time, contains ſome memorial of the irregularity of its ſeaſons. Agreeably to modern travellers, the inhabitants of many parts of the Eaſt, ſtill ſmart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſcourge of the elements. In Syria, rain is not witneſſed, for months, and who has not heard of the ſcorching ſands of Arabia? The Nile, the grand fertilizer of Egypt, like an over fond parent, ſometimes ſmothers the object which it cheriſhes.— Cairo the mart of nations, ſometimes bemoans in duſt, her ſcanty harveſts.
<q>"And Mecca, ſaddens at their long delay."</q>
If we ſurvey regions of happier temperature, ſtill the journals of their weather mark extreme varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and, in many years, their "baſkets of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fruit" are not high piled. We can ſcarcely look at a paragraph of foreign news in our Gazetts, without remarking a melancholly narrative of the ſcarcity of corn, and of a famiſhed populace, clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for bread. But why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my countrymen do you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe calamities? What year is of ſuch Egyptian ſterility, that ye can be aſked the queſtion, propoſed to the prophet, in my text, and not anſwer, like him? The rains do not deſcend, nor the floods come

               <p>When the harveſts of America are ripe for the ſickle, the product is completely ours without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. According to Brydone, a lazy lording eats what the ſlaviſh Secillian peaſant has ſown. But here, no Melchizidek claims a tithe.

On his right hand he ſaw a grove, that ſeemed to wave its ſhades, as a ſign of invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he entered it, and found the coolneſs and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure irreſtibly pleaſant. He did not, however, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get whither he was travelling, but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appearing to have the ſame direction with the main road, he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite pleaſure with his buſineſs, and to gain the rewards of diligence, without ſuffering its fatigues. He, therefore, for a time ſtill continued to walk, without the leaſt remiſſion of his ardor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that he was ſometimes tempted to ſtop by the muſic of the birds, whom the heat had aſſembled in the ſhade; and ſometimes amuſed himſelf with plucking the flowers which grew on either ſide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At laſt the green path began to decline from its firſt direction, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with the falls of water.

every ſenſation that might ſooth, or divert him.— He liſtened to every echo, he mounted every hill for a freſh proſpect, he turned aſide to every caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, and pleaſed himſelf with tracing the courſe of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a large region with innumerable circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to ſafety or diſtruction. At length not fear but labour began to overcome him; his breath grew ſhort, and his knees trembled, and he was on the point of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down in reſignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light, and finding it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admiſſion. The old man ſet before him ſuch proviſions as he had collected for himſelf, on which Obidah fed with eagerneſs and gratitude.</p>
               <p>When the repaſt was over, 'Tell me, ſaid the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, by what chance you have been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderneſs, in which I never ſaw a man before.— Obidah then related all the occurrences of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without any palliation.</p>
               <p>'Son ſaid the hermit, let the errors and follies, the dangers and eſcape of this day, ſink deep into thine heart; remember, my ſon, that human life is the journey of a day. We riſe in the morning of youth, full of vigour, and full of expectation; we ſet forward with ſpirit and hope, with gaiety and diligence, and travel on a while in the ſtraight road of piety, towards the manſions of reſt. In a ſhort time we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find ſome mitigation of our duty, and ſome more eaſy means of obtaining the ſame end. we then relax our vigour, and reſolve no longer to be terrified at crimes at a diſtance, but rely upon our own conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and venture to approach what we reſolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of eaſe, and repoſe in the ſhades of ſecurity. Here the heart ſoftens, and vigilence ſubſides; we are then willing to enquire whether another advance cannot be made and whether we may not at laſt turn our eyes upon
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034482_0026_0FFDE7887379FA80"/>
the gardens of pleaſure; we approach them with ſcruple and heſitation, we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to paſs through them without loſing the road of virtue, which we, for a while, keep in our ſight, and to which we propoſe to return. But temptation ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time loſe the happineſs of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and ſolace our diſquiet with ſenſual gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational deſire. We entangle ourſelves in buſineſs, immerge ourſelves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconſtancy, till the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of old age begins to invade us, and diſeaſe and anxiety obſtruct our way. We then look back upon ourſelves with horror, with ſorrow, with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and wiſh, but too often vainly wiſh, that we had not forſaken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my ſon, who ſhall learn, from thy example, not to deſpair, but ſhall remember, that though the day is paſt, and their ſtrength is waſted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that reformation is never hopeleſs, nor ſincere endeavours ever unaſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but the wanderer may at laſt return after all his errors; and he who implores ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from above, ſhall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my ſon, to thy repoſe; commit thyſelf to the care of omnipotence, and when the morning calls again to toil, begin a new thy journey and thy life.'</p>

               <p>SOLOMON could hardly have written three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand proverbs and a madrigal to his love, with ſuch wiſdom and wit, if he had not by the air and ſcenery of the morning, corroborated his health and kindled his fancy.—Whether active as a king or indolent as a lover, he perceived that early hours were auxiliary both to buſineſs and pleaſure, and therefore judiciouſly adviſes to riſe with the lark.</p>
               <p>In our climate, a midſummer <hi>morning's</hi> dream not SHAKESPEARE himſelf ſhould be permitted to tell. Blankets and pillows look ſo dull and warm, and green graſs and trees ſo cheerful and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is wonderful the ſluggard cannot even with half ſhut eyes, diſcern ſuch wide extremes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſtrolling in the fields to tumbling in bed.</p>
               <p>But in the courſe of my parochial viſitations, my early tap at many a door is often anſwered by a voice, exclaiming from behind a curtain; it is the voice of the ſluggard. The cock has crowed thrice and certain robbins have ſung two hymns and a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad, before half my acquaintance have "girded their loins," buckled their ſhoes and combed their hair. Yet theſe creatures, not content with the naps of the night, ſwathe themſelves, like ſo many Egyptian mummies, in a ſheet, four hours after ſun riſe, and then have the impudence to riſe and talk about buſineſs, and the beauty of the day.</p>
               <p>The princely poet, author of our excellent text, when exhorting to ſummer enjoyments, points out to the night ſeaſon, nor to the "inner pavilion" of the palace, but informs us that his "bed is <hi>green,</hi>" and his love diſplayed in the open air.</p>

and give her his love, amidſt the dews of dawn. Well wert thou called wiſe, thou gallant prince, if it were only for thy knowledge of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male heart.

In our time the torpid admirer ſnores, amidſt the evening fog, the praiſes of his miſtreſs, while the ſprightly ſtrains of his ſerenade are obtruded by the thick miſts of midnight.</p>
               <p>In cloſe parlours and the long winter's eve, we may pore over rent rolls and engroſs marriage ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements.

               <p>MANY ſuppoſe the plain meaning of this text is, lay your earnings out in clothes; others have thought it referred to gamblers. They would do well to underſtand it literally. If you have been ſo unfortunate as to win money at the card table, I ſhould chooſe to ſee it ſparkling in a pair of paſte knee buckles, or dingling in a gold watch chain, or
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034482_0029_0FFDC58F8CAF3140"/>
pearl key, rather than truſted again to the diſpoſal of theſe fickle arbitrators, hearts, diamonds, clubs, and ſpades. Whatever may be your opinion of law deciſions, I verily believe thy money would ſtand a better chance with lawyer, judge and jury. If gamblers win gold let them wear it. I am inclined to think the ſage authors of good old Engliſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs intended ſomething more here than has been obſerved. Their adages are brim full of meaning; ſo full of good wholeſome every-day fare, that the ſickly ſtomachs of your Lord Cheſterfields, and your humble ſervant Smokeface, cannot digeſt them.— But the Prompter, whoſe writings have a much more conſpicuous place in the library of Common Senſe than my Lord Cheſterfield's, is not ſo ſqueam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; according to him, "they contain the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the wiſdom of nations and ages, compreſſed into the compaſs of a nut-ſhell." This, I hope, will be a ſufficient apology for my frequent uſe of thoſe old ſayings, homeſpun expreſſions, and coarſe ideas, ſo offenſive to thoſe, who are "more refined than refinement, more ſenſible than ſenſe:" or, as I underſtand it, juſt as fooliſh as folly. Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if we crack the ſhell of this nut I have ſent you wrapt up in this ſheet of paper, you will find no jeſt, that will burſt your ſides with laughter, but this wholeſome viand, "Earn induſtriouſly, and ſpend prudently," which will not only afford you nouriſhment from the firſt of January to the laſt of December, but prevent thee from taking a ſingle pill from the doctor, and keep you warm in the coldeſt winter day. As this is a large mouthful, and ſo full of nutriment, I adviſe thee, if thou haſt a good ſtore of laſt year's corn, meat and cider, to lay it by until next week; in the mean time, if I have an hour's leiſure, I will ſet down and pick it

               <p>THIS is the conſtruction Common Senſe is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put upon my laſt week's text. If the interpretation ſeems too rigid, and bears too hard upon your pride and vanity, it is only to qualify you to enter the "<hi>little end</hi> of the horn," with a good grace, that you may find the cornucopia at the other. Clerical method would divide my lecture into two heads; the diviſion is natural; I will follow it.— Firſt, Earn induſtriouſly. When the ſun has begun his daily taſk, expanded the flowers and ſet all the buſy agents of vegitation to work, if theſe do not afford you a ſufficient ſtimulus to induſtry, walk out to your bee hive: theſe little laborers ſhall preach you a better ſermon againſt indolence than you will often hear from the pulpit. If, after obſerving their activity and oeconomy fifteen minutes, you do not profit by the lecture, let them ſting you for a drone. "Spend prudently." Never lay out more at the tavern, after ſun ſet, than you have earned, before ſun riſe; nor even that, if your laſt year's taxes are not croſſed out from the collector's book. Dreſs in homeſpun three years, and if vanity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency require, you may wear ſuperfine the fourth.

               <head>"Then went Sampſon to Gaza, and ſaw there an harlot."</head>
               <p>STRONG as he was, ſuch a journey debilitated him. It was not the length of the way from Timnah; it was not the rugged road, nor the irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of a hard trotting mule; it was not a ſtroke of the ſun, nor a bleak air that ſhook the nerves, and proſtrated the life of Sampſon; for not one of theſe circumſtances is ever glanced at by the hiſtorian; no, he ſaw, in one of the ſtews of Gaza, a venal beauty and was undone. His wit evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his wiſdom turned babbler, he loſt his vigilance, his eyes and his life.</p>
               <p>One licentious indulgence excites to another. The blandiſhments of his courtezan allured to the cells of the whole ſiſterhood. He lays his head in the lap of voluptuouſneſs, and gives full ſcope to criminal deſire. For it came to paſs afterwards, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whoſe name was Delilah.</p>
               <p>Let us ponder a little the hiſtory of theſe unlucky amours. A ſketch of the wars and viciſſitudes of paſſion is of more intereſt than the narrative of a battle or ſiege, or the annals of an empire.</p>

it may be correct to view Sampſon, before he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gates of Gaza, and after his acquaintance with two bad women.</p>
               <p>His firſt was by no means a love adventure. It was in the ſtyle of chyvalry without a damſel. Lurking in the vines of rude territory, a lion roared againſt our juvenile hero, who as it is in a lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner expreſſed, rent his verocious adverſary, as he would have rent a kid. A bold encounter, but not half ſo dangerous as the ſmiles of the lady in the valley of Sorek. Mere brute force, however was not the ſole attribute of Sampſon. For ſeven days he tortures the ingenuity of thirty friends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve an enigma. He had the palm of wit and the chaplets of victory; by his art he deſtroys the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and by his arm the life of his enemies. Not only the family of his father, Manoah, but the whole circumjacent region muſt have rung with the praiſes of this youth of promiſe; and even indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men, and abſtract reaſons would alertly from ſuch impoſing premiſes draw the happieſt concluſion.</p>
               <p>But behold how, in one hour, ſo great riches come to nought. Thus far, what a tiſſue of brilliant atchievments do we admire! The next ſcene is madly mortifying. In the very ſummer of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing page of his ſtory what are the humiliating particulars of his downfall? Sampſon, the valiant, the witty and the wiſe, is the dupe of female jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers; is enticed; is overcome. In the arms of a "twining Lais" of the Philiſtines, his ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtrength melts away. He awakes out of his lethargy of pleaſure, and hopes to go out, as at other times, rejoicing in his might. But the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the ſoul is no more. He, whom once nothing could reſtrain, is bound. He grinds in the priſon houſe, and dwindled into a buffoon, is <hi>inveſted with his motley</hi> to amuſe the rabble.</p>

Hence an abundant crop of evil. It was not the Philiſtines, it was impure paſſion that extinguiſhed the diſcernment of Sampſon. He never ſaw any object clearly, after he went to Gaza, and ſaw an harlot. It is true, he ſaw Delilah, but probably, through the obſcurity of nocturnal hours.

               <p>Genius, ſaid the amiable clergyman, with whom I ſtudied divinity, is invariably connected with ſtrong paſſions. When men, exquiſitely organized, indulge pleaſure, it is with that ſpecies of fervour, noted in the oriental page—it is with all their hearts, and with all their ſoul, and with all their ſtrength, and with all their mind. The inſenſible lounger, the ſelf engroſſed coxcomb, may ſleep upon the knees of Delilah, and wake again to puny life. But of that opiate of joy, of that golden cup of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the harlot preſents, if you ſip, man, of feeling, you will "drain the chalice to the loweſt and fouleſt dregs."

               <p>HEALTH is ſo neceſſary to all the duties, as well as pleaſures of life, that the crime of ſquandering it is equal to the folly; and he that for a ſhort gratification brings weakneſs and diſeaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and for the pleaſure of a few years paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the tumults of diverſion and clamors of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, condemns the maturer and more experienced part of his life to the chamber and the couch, may be juſtly reproached, not only as a ſpendthrift of his own happineſs, but as a robber of the public; as a wretch that has voluntarily diſqualified himſelf for the buſineſs of his ſtation and refuſed that part which Providence aſſigns him, in the general taſk of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. There are very few conditions more to be pitied than that of an active and elevated mind, laboring under the weight of a diſtempered body; the time of ſuch a man is always ſpent in forming ſchemes, which a change of wind hinders from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, his powers fume away in projects and in hope, and the day of action never arrives. He lies down, delighted with the thoughts of to-morrow, pleaſes his ambition with the fame he ſhall acquire, on his benevolence with the good he ſhall beſtow.— But, in the night, the ſkies are overcaſt, the temper of the air is changed, he wakes in langour, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and diſtraction, and has no longer any wiſh, but for eaſe, nor any attention but for miſery. It may be ſaid that diſeaſe generally begins that equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which death completes; the diſtinctions, which ſet one man ſo much above another are very little perceived in the gloom of a ſick chamber, where it will be vain to expect entertainment from the gay, or inſtruction from the wiſe, where all human glory is obliterated, the wit is clouded, the reaſoner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and the hero ſubdued; when the higheſt and brighteſt of mortal beings finds nothing left him, but the conſciouſneſs of innocence.</p>

This being done, the parent vegetable, if of the <hi>herbaceous</hi> kind, either totally dies, or periſhes as far as it roſe above ground: if a <hi>tree</hi> or <hi>ſhrub,</hi> it loſes all its tender parts which the Spring and Summer had put forth. Seeds are ſcattered by the hand of nature in various manners. The winds which at this time ariſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe far and wide many ſeeds which are curiouſly furniſhed with feathers or wings for this purpoſe. Hence plants with ſuch ſeeds are, of all, the moſt univerſally to be met with; as dandelion, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ragwort, thiſtles, &amp;c. Other ſeeds by the means of hooks, lay hold of paſſing animals, and are thus carried to diſtant places. The common burs are examples of this contrivance. Many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in berries, which being eaten by birds, the ſeeds are diſcharged again uninjured, and grow where they happen to light. Thus carefully has nature provided for the diſtribution and propagation of plants.</p>

One Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being at breakfaſt, with the window open, they obſerved a very beautiful young woman in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with a child in her arms equally beautiful: ſhe paſſed them ſeveral times, ſedate and unobſerving, but at length her attractions becoming too irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſpoke to her, and with much earneſtneſs invited her to partake of their breakfaſt.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I AM convinced, that it is impoſſible for one perſon to pleaſe all mankind, for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034482_0045_0FFDE7BE518100B8"/>It is well known that many impoſitions have been inflicted upon mankind, by particular perſons in every country; and in the earlieſt periods of time, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occurrences took place, that much ſurpriſed the greater part of mankind, induced them to believe that ſuch wonderful phenomina could not take place, only by a ſupernatural power.</p>
            <p>Every perſon that is acquainted with human nature, or has ſtudied the diſpoſition of mankind, muſt be fully convinced of the deception of man, and certainly know, there are perſons, whoſe abilities, diſpoſition and genius, are in every reſpect, adequate to the profeſſion of deceivers. And many of their co-temporaries confide in their abilities, integrity and veracity, to that degree, that they will ſacrifice their property, through ignorance, to ſupport a vicious, ignoble, defrauder. Nor is this much to be wondered at, if we contemplate the avaricious diſpoſition of men, who are ever in ſearch of objects in futurity, eſpecially ſuch as have a tendency to produce gain, they will purſue with the greateſt alacrity, anticipating joys which, upon a near approach, elude the graſp. It is obvious, that ſome illiterate perſons have a genius adequate to prepoſſeſs themſelves in favor with many, and by an enegmatical behavior, induce ſome to form eminent opinions of their merit, at the ſame time it was paradoxical. And if we ſuppoſe that every generation grows wiſer, we muſt believe that ignorance has been gradually extinguiſhing for ſome hundred years paſt; and it is almoſt incredible to believe, that any impoſitions could be practiſed upon mankind at this enlightened period: but although knowledge is more diffuſe, human nature is ſtill the ſame, and Judas like, will perpetrate enormous deeds to ſatisfy an avaricious mind. And if we admit the ſame diſpoſition to reign predominent, in the deceived, as the deceiver then let the deceived pay their money to the deceiver, who has been at trouble and coſt in obtaining his art of extracting, for thoſe who go to the ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>The Morris-Town Ghoſt DELINEATED.</head>
            <p>A DIABOLICAL intrigue invaded the county of <hi>Morris,</hi> in the ſtate of <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> in the year 1788. This unequalled performance, has taken vent and is promulgated througout the continent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the attention of every perſon. But before I proceed any further, I think it requiſite to advert a few minutes to the general character of that place.</p>
            <p>It is very conſpicuous that many of the people in that county, are much attached to machinations, and will ſpend much time in inveſtigating curioſities. I don't ſay whether ſuch a turn of mind is to be imputed to indigence or owing to the operation of the climate: this I ſubmit to the candor of every perſon to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine within himſelf—it is obvious to all who are acquainted with the county of Morris, that the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena and capricious notions of witchcraft, has engaged the attention of many of its inhabitants for a number of years, and the exiſtence of witches is adopted by the generality of the people.</p>
            <p>I was once in Morriſtown, and happened to be in converſation with ſome gentlemen, who had, as it were, the faith of aſſurance it witchcraft. They informed me that there were ſeveral young women who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched; and they had been harraſed ſo much by witches for a long time, and all their experiments proved abortive, and the young women were ſo much debilitated they were fearful they would never recover their healths. They related ſeveral occurrences, that I think too ſimple to mention; but one inſtance was, "That an old lady was churning, and being much fatigued, and unable to obtain butter, ſhe at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the witches were in the churn, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034482_0046_0FFDE7C0F9AFDA50"/>
had recourſe to experiments, which were, that of heating ſeveral horſe-ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and putting them into the churn alternately—ſhe burnt the devil out, and immediately obtained butter."</p>
            <p>I perceived that the generality were apprehenſive of witches riding them, and the greateſt evidence of a witch was, if a woman had any deformity, or had lived to that age to cauſe wrinkles in her face, ſhe had the appella<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of a witch. There was another occurrence that happened on Sunday. They informed me, a man was driving his ſheep from his grain, and an accident happened as they were jumping ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a fence, one of the ſheep broke its leg. The man for ſome time before ſuppoſed that the ſame ſheep was bewitched. About the ſame time, an aged old lady returning from church, her horſe unfortunately ſtumbled, ſhe fell to the ground and broke her leg—This was received as an indication that ſhe was a witch: And in fact, if a horſe had the belly-ache, or any beaſt was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gony of pain and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved uncommon, the general opinion was, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was bewitched.</p>
            <p>It is my opinion, that perſons actuated by ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious notions, are pre-diſpoſed for the reception of marvelous curioſities whenever they occur.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to detail as near as poſſible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the tranſactions of that phenomena, <hi>Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> and <hi>Hobgoblins,</hi> that happened in Morriſtown, in the year 1788.</p>
            <p>This tranſaction has occupied the attention of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; cauſed great wondering through the ſtate, and every perſon is eager to acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re a thorough knowledge of the real tranſactions; and I hope this will have a tendency to eradicate ſuch capricious notions from every ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mind—The chief conductor of this deception, was <hi>Ransford Rogers,</hi> a native of Connecticut, in New-England. He was an illiterate perſon, but very aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, poſſeſſed of a genius adequate to prepoſſeſs himſelf into favor with many, and great facility to diſplay his abilities with the geateſt brilliancy. He reſided in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts for a number of years, and from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034482_0046_0FFDE7C0F9AFDA50"/>
thence to the ſtate of New-York. His place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, before he came to New Jerſey, was Smith's Clove, where he taught a ſchool. During his reſidence at Smith's Clove, two gentlemen from the county of Morris, who had been long in ſearch and digging of mines, but had always proved unſucceſsful for the want of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe knowledge deſcended into the bowels of the earth, and could reveal the ſecret things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There was alſo, a prevailing opinion, that there was money depoſited in the bowels of the earth, at Schooler's mountain, with an enchantment upon it— that it could not be obtained without a peculiar art in legerdemain, or to diſpel the hobgoblins &amp; apparitions. Theſe gentlemen, in purſuit of a man that could work miracles, accidentally found Rogers, and after a ſhort converſation, made known their buſineſs to him, and concluded that he was the man every way calculated to their wiſhes, for he was very fond of giving hints of his extenſive knowledge in every art and ſcience, but careful not to go ſo far as to demonſtrate his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. He had a pretended copious knowledge in chemiſtry; and could raiſe or diſpel good or evil ſpirits. He then agreed with thoſe gentlemen to ſupply them with whatever was requeſted—This was a noble man indeed! Now they concluded the man was found who could ſupply them with all things; and one who was endowed with power and ſagacity not to be exceeded by finite wiſdom!</p>
            <p>But altho' Rogers had engaged to exhibit miracles, knowing that he muſt ſeek inventions, he thinking it too great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n undertaking, began to regret, fearing that he was not able to perform: but after he had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and given hints of his knowledge and abilities, and being ſolicited by the gentlemen to proceed, he could not elude what he had advanced, but reſolved to have recourſe to experiments and ſtratagem to prove his aſſertions. He was then ſolicited to remove to Morriſtown. Thoſe gentlemen, with indifatigable pains, procured him a ſchool, three miles from Morriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. This was ſatisfactory to Rogers being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their integrity, and perceiving their flexibility

and readineſs to adminiſter to his relief, he thinking himſelf happy with ſuch noble concomitants, left Smith's Clove, with the greateſt alacrity, and took his ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>de about three miles from Morriſtown, where he preſided over a common Engliſh ſchool.

He then finding himſelf deficient, and perceiving it requiſite to have an aſſiſtant in order to carry on nocturnal performances, with the greateſt ſecrecy. He then obtained leave of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers, to abſent himſelf a few days and return to New England for his family and ſome other buſineſs, upon his promiſe to return as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
            <p>While he was in New-England, he contracted with a perſon, a ſchoolmaſter, to return with him, inſuring him a ſchool that would be very lucrative.—Rogers, agree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Rogers, after gathering information from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hearing the obſtructions that debarred them from obtaining immenſe riches, was now ſatisfied this was the time for him to fulfil his former aſſertions.</p>

            <p>Rogers informed them, that he ſhould have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views with the ſpirits; and as the apparitions knew all things, they muſt be careful to walk circumſpectly, and refrain from all immorality, or they would ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſpirits to withhold from them the treaſures.</p>
            <p>Theſe gentlemen now under apprehenſions of vaſt riches, began to propagate their intentions to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friends, and there was ſuch a proſpect of being rich, that many were anxious to become members; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were added unto it daily, of ſuch as expected great riches. The company convened almoſt every evening until their number increaſed to about forty. During this time, none had interviews with the ſpirits except Rogers, and he communicated their converſation to the ſociety, which was admitted as real facts.</p>
            <p>Now you will obſerve, that it is highly neceſſary, that Rogers would have aſſociates, in order to facilitate his manoeuvres and avoid detection. During this time, Rogers and his connections had recourſe to ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in compounding various ſubſtances, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrown into the air would break with ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as to indicate to the beholders to ariſe from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The company were all anxious to proceed and much elevated with ſuch uncommon curioſities A night was appointed for the whole company to convene, and it happened to be a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cy of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſufficient to extinguiſh health.</p>
            <p>At this interview they were all much aſton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

unto them the importance of their regular proceedings, or they could not obtain their deſire. The ſpirits informed them, that they muſt meet on ſuch a night, at a certain place, about half a mile from any houſe in a field, retired from travelling and noiſe: and they muſt form certain angles and circles, and they muſt proceed in drawing their lines and forming their circles as Rogers directed, and then be careful to keep within the circles, or they would provoke the ſpirits to that degree, they would finally extirpate them from the place.</p>
            <p>The night appointed for them to convene, being now arrived, they all with joy, fear and trembling, conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the appointed houſe, about half a mile from the field. This field was environed on the north and weſt by a thick wood. The circles and angles being drawn the preceding day, they all proceeded from the houſe about ten o'clock in the evening, with peculiar ſilence and decorum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and entered the circles with the greateſt ſolemnity, and being fully ſenſible they were ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by apparitions and hobgoblins.</p>
            <p>Upon one part of the circle was erected four poſts, in order to ſpread a cloth, and form a tent, where Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers could preſide, as governor of the ghaſtly proceſſion. The number that entered theſe circles were about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This number was walking alternately during the whole proceſſion. It is not to be wondered at, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were timorous in this place; for the candles illum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one part of the circle, cauſed a ghaſtly, melancholy, direful gloom, towards the woods, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The reader will obſerve one circumſtance in particular, that occaſioned the buſineſs to continue through the winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the money that the ſpirits requeſted, muſt be ſilver or gold, and the current money then in Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſey, was loan paper: This money did not circulate only in that ſtate, and no perſon would take it in lieu of ſilver and gold, only at one quarter diſcount. This therefore had a tendency to continue the buſineſs thro' the winter, as it was almoſt impoſſible for ſome of them to get ſilver or gold; but all of them were very

induſtrious ſeeking the ſum required. They would give almoſt any diſcount or intereſt that any man pleaſed to aſk. They would mortgage their farms and diſpoſe of their cattle at half price, rather than fail in obtaining the required ſum.</p>
            <p>It is very obvious why Rogers and his aſſociates, the ſuppoſed ſpirits, requeſted ſilver or gold, for they wanted to carry it out of the ſtate, and paper money would have been of but little ſervice.</p>
            <p>Sometime in March, the money being chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rogers fearing that ſomething might happen, pretended to have nocturnal interviews with the ſpirit, likewiſe ſeveral perſons, eſpecially thoſe who had the moſt faith and men of veracity were called out of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> beds in the night by the ſpirits, and directed how to proceed.</p>
            <p>Theſe gentlemen immediately made known to the company their interviews with the ſpirit; and when the company were convened in a private room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pretended ſpirits were out ſide of the houſe, gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They all returned with joy, fear and wondering, being very liberal, waiting impatiently for May to come.</p>
            <p>Now Rogers and his aſſociates have received the greater part of the money, and they are full of machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, how they ſhall poſtpone the buſineſs the next meeting, for all expected to proceed to Schooler's Mountain the next May, and receive the treaſure.</p>
            <p>The night appointed being now arrived, they all convened in a large circle in an open field, waiting for the ghoſts to appear and give them farther directions, and proceed with them to the place where the money was depoſited. Immediately the ghoſts appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the circle, with great choler, and hedious groanings, wreathing themſelves in various poſitions, that appeared moſt ghaſtly in the night—then upbraiding the company declaring they had not proceeded regular, and ſome

of them was faithleſs, and had devulged many things that ought to have been kept ſecret; and by their wicked diſpoſitions and animoſities that had taken place among them, debarred them at preſent, from obtaining the treaſures. The pretended ghoſts, raging to that degree at the miſconduct of the company, that Rogers, who appeared or pretended to be very much frightened with the reſt, with all his art and pleading was ſcarcely able to pacify the raging ghoſts!</p>
            <p>At this the company confiding in Rogers, looked to him for protection. The ghoſts informed them, they muſt wait patient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they thought but little about money, at length Rogers, after a variety of ceremonies by his art and power, diſpelled the frightful apparitions, and tranquility, once more, reſides within the circle.</p>
            <p>They now returned from the circle, ſtill retaining their belief, reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Had Rogers now halted, and not proceeded upon another project, he would have been feared and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; &amp; the capricious notions of witchcraft, hobgoblins, and the devil would have prevailed among them, with prejudice, fear and ignorance, until this day.

            <p>It is evident that Rogers did not intend to proceed any further upon ſuch diabolical intrigues; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the fall preceding the termination of the firſt ſcene, two young men from New England, took up their abode in the county of Morris: Some time the fore part of the winter, one of them took up his abode in Morris. Rogers at that time taught a ſchool three miles out of town, but ſoon quitting his ſchool there, removed to Morriſtown. Theſe young men ſoon became

This writing was ſo elegant, that they were much aſtoniſhed, thinking it a miracle, or ſuppoſing that the ſpirit entered the circle and wrote the contents, while they were on their faces at prayer.</p>

            <p>Rogers and two of his aſſociates were preſent and appeared to be aſtoniſhed with the reſt, but were not ſuſpected by any of the company.</p>
            <p>They all agreed, that as faſt as any of them could get the money, it ſhould be given to the ſpirit; but they muſt meet at ſuch a place, and give it up in a legal manner. A few days after this about twelve members convened, but only ſeven had the money ready to appropriate unto the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The manner of their proceeding was, they convened in a room, and after ſeveral ceremonies and prayer being ended, they aroſe, &amp; rotated the room, alternately, ſeveral times; then went with the greateſt decorum, into a meadow, about one hundred yards from the houſe and drawing a circle about twenty feet diameter, they ſtepped within it, waiting for the ſpirit to make its appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:034482_0053_0FFDE7D4F04F9D60"/>After a ſhort time, the ſpirit whiſtling at the diſtance of about ſixty yards from the circle, the commander then left the company and went to converſe with the ſpirit; he ſoon returned with orders from the ſpirit, that all thoſe who had the money, ſhould retire to a certain tree, about forty yards from the circle. Now thoſe who had the money went with the commander to the tree. The ſpirit appeared about twenty yards diſtant from the tree, with a ſheet around him, jumping and ſtamping, repeating theſe words, "<hi>Look to</hi> GOD!" Thoſe that ſtood by the tree made a ſhort complicated prayer, and laying the money at the root of the tree for the ſpirit to receive, they retired to the company. They all returned to the houſe, obſerving the greateſt order, trembling at every noiſe and gazing in every direction; ſuppoſing they were ſurrounded by hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins, apparitions, witches and the devil. Rogers and two of his aſſociates pretended to give up the money which was only blank paper.</p>
            <p>This pretended ſpirit was one of the aſſociates with a white ſheet around him, and a machine over his mouth that his voice might not be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>cted by any that knew him; and immediately after the ſpirit had depoſited his money, this ſpirit takes it to himſelf, which was about forty pounds.</p>
            <p>Previous to this, Rogers pulverized ſome bones and had given it to the commander, declaring that it was the duſt of their bodies, and each man muſt have ſome of this powder in a paper ſealed, as a token of the ſpirits approbation, &amp; that he was one of the company. This powder was to be kept ſecret, and no one to touch it upon his peril. A ſufficient quantity of liquor was alſo prepared, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Various ceremonies were performed that I ſhall omit as they are too ſimple to mention, but every means were taken in order to make the members uſe liquor freely, the ſpirits gave unto the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a compounded ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus the company had increaſed to about thirty-ſeven in number; and the greater part had given the money to the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was to be kept ſecret and no one to touch it. This man, leaving it accidently in his pocket one day in the houſe, his wife happened to find it, broke it open and perceiving the contents, feared to touch it ſuppoſing it to be witchcraft: She went immediate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to the prieſt for advice—He, not knowing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> compoſition was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to touch it for fear it might have ſome ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon him.</p>
            <p>When her huſband diſcovered what ſhe had done, he was much terrified, declaring that ſhe had ruined him forever, in breaking open that paper. This made her more ſolicitous to know the contents; and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring not to devulge any thing, he told her the whole of their proceedings; ſhe inſiſted on it, they were ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devil, and thought it her duty, to put an end to ſuch proceedings. This made great diſturbance in the company, and Rogers and his aſſociates were in diſguiſe every night, appearing to particular perſons as ſpirits, in order to confirm them in the faith and prevent a diſcovery. At laſt one evening Rogers having drank too much of the good creature, taking a ſheet with him rode to a houſe of a certain gentleman in order to converſe with him at a ſpirit; but making many blunders the woman thought it was a man, but after converſing with him ſome time, and going to prayer, Rogers departed declaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was the ſpirit of a juſt man.</p>
            <p>In the morning as ſoon as it was light, the man went out where the ſpirit appeared, and as there had been a heavy dew that night, he perceived the tracks of a man, and following him ſome diſtance to the fence where he perceived a horſe had been tied; he then tracking the horſe to the door where Rogers lived—But as Rogers was not within, he followed the ſame track to the houſe of a certain gentleman, about half a mile diſtant, where he found Rogers; and as the gentleman of the houſe had, the evening before, lent Rogers a horſe, together with many other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſufficient to convict him. The authority was
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034482_0055_0FFDE7DB9F3E69C0"/>
then conſulted, and judging him culpable, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately apprehended and committed to priſon.</p>
            <p>This detection greatly alarmed the whole company, as they were unwilling to believe that Rogers was the ſpirit, even when the cleareſt evidence demonſtrated the fact, but Rogers declaring his innocence, was in a few days bailed out, by a gentleman that I ſhall call by the name of compaſſion, and to this gentleman Rogers ought ever to pay a debt of gratitude and benevolence.</p>
            <p>After Rogers was clear of the gaol, he perceived he was among his enemies, he therefore made his flight, but being purſued and apprehended the ſecond time, he confeſſed his faults, and owned that for his conduct and the expreſſions he had uſed in his projects, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment; but fortune favored him, and he once more eluded their hands.</p>
            <p>Now many threatenings and horrid imprecations proceed from many after this man, who only a few days before, they revered and thought him a ſuperior being.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of theſe imprecations being caſt after him is very obvious, that is while he continued with them in parables, working miracles, he promiſed them vaſt riches, but now he is gone, their hopes are all eradicated. But ought not the county of M— to perpetuate and honor the name of Rogers for eradicating ignorance and cauſing the light of reaſon to illume the minds of many, where obſcurity had reigned for many years?</p>
            <p>There have been various reports propagated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſum that Rogers and his aſſociates ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the believers of witchcraft, but the whole amount was about five hundred pounds. But after Rogers had taken the veil from their eyes, and extracted money from their pockets, they were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that he ſhould have any compenſation, but inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould be brought to condign puniſhment, therefore Rogers is detected in his knavery, and his aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ciates are unknown to the world; but had Rogers perſevered, and avoided detection until all had given
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034482_0055_0FFDE7DB9F3E69C0"/>
in their money, he would have left them in ignorance waiting with patience, for the return of the ſpirit, as was the caſe with the former company; but his being detected, and confeſſion, demonſtrated to every perſon that there was neither witchcraft nor black art in any of his performances, which they thought to proceed from ſupernatural power. I am confident that this occurrence is ſufficient to exterpate all capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious notions of witchcraft, wizzards, hobgoblins, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions and frightful imaginations from the minde of rational beings.</p>
            <p>I am confident that there are many ſuch kinds of impoſitions tranſacted by particular perſons, and many illiterate and vulgar readily believe that they have power ſufficient to call into being the ſouls of thoſe dead bodies that have long ſlept dorment in the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But let reaſon be our guide, and we ſhall ſoon exclaim againſt ſuch capricious declarations—But one half of the world will not inveſtigate whether theſe things are either probable or poſſible, but proceed with alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon the affirmation of others. Again, there are ſome, that are as deſtitute of honeſty as the devil is of holineſs, and will perſevere in hopes of gain, and will graſp at every opportunity to take advantage, but when they are outwitted, they will exclaim againſt knavey and plead innocence.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to every perſon that it is among the moſt vulgar and illiterate part of the world, where the capricious notions of witchcraft and hobgoblins reſide. But in thoſe parts of the world where learning and ſcience has prevailed, every idea or pretenſion towards raiſing demons are excluded. The Laplanders the moſt ignorant beings on earth, pretend to work miracles, raiſe, demons, and predict future events, and many with weak intellects and tremulous readily adhere to their fantaſtical declarations; but nature is uniform in her courſe, and deviates not, and when ſuch wonderful phaenomena preſents, as I have been treating of, we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE charge of blaſphemy, which is put upon the record againſt the printer of this publication, is not an accuſation of the ſervants of the crown, but comes before you ſanctioned by the oaths of a grand jury of the country. It ſtood for trial upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day; but it happening, as it frequently does, without any imputation upon the gentlemen named in the pannel, that a ſufficient number did not appear to conſtitute a full ſpecial jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cauſe from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing myſelf to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I purſued this courſe, however, from no jealouſy of the common juries appointed by the laws for the ordinary ſervice of the court, ſince my whole life has been one continued experience of their virtues; but becauſe I thought it of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that thoſe who were to decide upon a cauſe ſo very momentous to the public, ſhould have the higheſt poſſible qualifications for the deciſion. That they ſhould not only be men capable from their educations of forming an enlightened judgment, but
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034482_0058_0FFDE7E31EB3FC40"/>
that their ſituations ſhould be ſuch as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to which in character and in eſtimation, they were in their own turns to be reſponſible.</p>
               <p>Not having the honour, gentlemen, to be ſworn for the king as one of his counſel, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for libels, than to aſſiſt in the proſecution of them. But I feel no embarraſſment from that recollection; ſince I ſhall not be found to-day to expreſs a ſentiment, or to utter an expreſſion inconſiſtent with thoſe inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable principles for which I have uniformly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever ſaid, either profeſſionally or perſonally for the Liberty of the Preſs, do I mean to-day to contrad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct or counteract. On the contrary, I deſire to preface the very ſhort diſcourſe I have to make, with reminding you, that it is your moſt ſolemn duty to take care that it ſuffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicenſed preſs <hi>(in the juſt and legal ſenſe of the expreſſion)</hi> has led to all the bleſſings both of religion and government, which Great Britain or any part of the world at this moment enjoys, and is calculated ſtill farther to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happineſs. But this freedom, like every other, muſt be limited to be enjoyed, and like every human ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, may be defeated by its abuſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen! the defendant ſtands indicted for having publiſhed this book, which I have only read from the obligations of profeſſionly duty, and which I aroſe from the reading of with aſtoniſhment and diſguſt. Standing here with all the privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the higheſt counſel for the crown, I ſhall be entitled to reply to any defence that ſhall be made for the publication. I ſhall wait with patience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the defence which I hear and read of, it would be defaming by
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034482_0058_0FFDE7E31EB3FC40"/>
anticipation, the learned counſel who is to make it. For if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the proſecutors in the courſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, I have to expect, that inſtead of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence conducted according to the rules and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Engliſh law and juſtice, the foundation of all our laws, and the ſanctions of all our juſtice, are to be ſtruck at and inſulted. What is the force of that juriſdiction which enables the court to ſit in judgment? What but the oath which his lordſhip, as well as yourſelves, have ſworn upon the goſpel to fulfil. Yet in the king's court, where his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is himſelf alſo ſworn to adminiſter the juſtice of England—in the king's court—which receives its high authority under a ſolemn oath to maintain the chriſtian religion, as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am nevertheleſs called upon as counſel for the proſecution to produce a certain book deſcribed in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man deſerves to be upon the rolls of the court, who dares, as an attorney, to put his name to ſuch a notice. It is an inſult to the authority and dignity of the court of which he is an officer; ſince it ſeems to call in queſtion the very foundation of its juriſdiction. If this is to be the ſpirit and temper of the defence; if, as I collect from that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray of books which are ſpread upon the benches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the chriſtian religion promulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that ſuch an argument was neither ſuggeſted nor juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by any thing ſaid by me on the part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacution. <hi>In this ſtage of the proceedings,</hi> I ſhall call for reverence to the Sacred Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Gentlemen, I have ever been deeply
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034482_0059_0FFDE7E6EDD57988"/>
devoted to the truths of Chriſtianity, and my firm belief in the Holy Goſpel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education, (though I was religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly educated by the beſt of parents) but ariſes from the fulleſt and moſt continued reflections of my ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years and underſtanding. It forms at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the great conſolation of a life, which, as a ſhadow, muſt paſs away; and without it, indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould conſider my long courſe of health and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity (perhaps too long and too uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the duſt which the wind ſcatters, and rather as a ſnare than as a bleſſing.— Much, however, as I wiſh to ſupport the authority of Scripture from a reaſoned conſideration of it, I ſhall repreſs that ſubject for the preſent.

The ſame principles, which vindicate civil conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions honeſtly directed, extend their protection to the ſharpeſt controverſies on religious faiths. This rational and legal courſe of improvement, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back with gratitude to the labors of the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as the fountains of our religious emancipation, and of the civil bleſſings that followed in their train. The Engliſh conſtitution, indeed, does not ſtop ſhort in the toleration of religious opinions, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally extends it to practice. It permits every man, <hi>even publicly,</hi> to worſhip God according to his own conſcience, though in marked diſſent from the national eſtabliſhment, ſo as he profeſſes the general faith, which is the ſanction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our ſubmiſſion to the ſyſtem which conſtitutes a ſtate. Is not this ſyſtem of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of controverſy, and freedom of worſhip, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all the purpoſes of human happineſs and improvement? And can it be neceſſary for either, that the law ſhould hold out indemnity to thoſe who wholly abjure and revile the government of their country, or the religion on which it reſts for its foundation? I expect to hear, in anſwer to what I am now ſaying, much that will offend me. My learned friend, from the difficulties of his ſituation, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very ſincerely, may be driven to advance propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which it may be my duty, with much freedom, to reply to; and the law will ſanction that freedom. But will not the ends of juſtice be completely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by that right, to point out the errors of his diſcourſe in terms that are decent and calculated to expoſe its defects; or will any arguments ſuffer, or will public juſtice be impeded, becauſe neither pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate honor and juſtice, nor public decorum, would induce my telling my learned friend, that he was a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034482_0060_0FFDE7E99CB49260"/>
fool, a liar, and ſcoundrel in the face of the court, becauſe I differed from him in argument or opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion? This is juſt the diſtinction between a book of free legal controverſy, and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to inveſtigate, with modeſty and decency, contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial points of the chriſtian religion; but no man, conſiſtently with a law, which only exiſts under its ſanctions, has a right, not only broadly to deny its very exiſtence, but to pour forth a ſhocking and inſulting invective, which the loweſt eſtabliſhments, in the gradations of civil authority, ought not to be permitted to ſuffer, and which ſoon would be borne down by inſolence and diſobedience, if they did.</p>
               <p>The ſame principle pervades the whole ſyſtem of the law, not merely in its abſtract theory, but in its daily and moſt applauded practice. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the ſexes and which, properly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, not only contiues but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thouſand romances, plays, and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every virtuous principle; others though with the ſame profeſſion, addreſs the imagination in a manner to lead the paſſions into dangerous exceſſes. But though the law does not nicely diſcriminate the various ſhades which diſtinguiſh theſe works from one another, ſo as that it ſuffers many to paſs through its liberal ſpirit, that upon principle might be ſuppreſſed, would it, or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to paſs by unpuniſhed, libels of the moſt ſhameleſs obſcenity, manifeſtly pointed to debauch innocence, and to blaſt and poiſon the morals of the riſing generation? This is only another illuſtration to demonſtrate the obvious diſtinction between the work of an author, who fairly exerciſes the powers of his mind, in inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating doctrinal points in the religion of any country,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034482_0061_0FFDE7EB77047518"/>
and him who attacks the rational exiſtence of every religion, and brands with abſurdity and folly the ſtate which ſanctions, and the obedient tools who cheriſh the deluſion. But this publication appears to me to be as miſchievous and cruel in its probable effects, as it is manifeſtly illegal in its principles; becauſe it ſtrikes at the beſt, ſometimes, alas! the only refuge and conſolation amidſt the diſtreſſes and afflictions of the world. The poor and humble, whom it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to pity, may be ſtabbed to the heart by it.— They have more occaſion for firm hopes beyond the grave, than thoſe who have greater comforts to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der life delightful. I can conceive a diſtreſſed but virtuous man, ſurrounded by children looking up to him for bread, when he has none to give them, ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the laſt day's labor, and unequal to the next, yet ſtill looking up with confidence to the hour when all tears ſhall be wiped from the eyes of affliction, bearing the burden laid upon him by a myſterious Providence which he adores, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward with exaltation to the revealed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of his Creator, when he ſhall be greater than the greateſt, and happier than the happieſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

enumerate the other paſſages within the ſcope of the indictment. How any man can rationally vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the publication of ſuch a book, in a country where the Chriſtian Religion is the very foundation of the law of the land, I am totally at a loſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and have no ideas for the diſcuſſion of! How is a tribunal, whoſe whole juriſdiction is founded upon the ſolemn belief and practice of what is denied as falſehood, and reprobated as impiety to deal with ſuch an anomolous defence? Upon what principle is it even offered to the court, whoſe authority is contemned and mocked at? If the religion propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be called in queſtion, is not previouſly adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in belief and ſolemnly acted upon, what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has the court to paſs any judgment at all of acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or condemnation? Why am I now, or upon any other occaſion, to ſubmit to your Lordſhip's author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity? Why am I now, or at any time, to addreſs twelve of my equals, as I am now addreſſing you, with reverence and ſubmiſſion! Under what ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the witneſſes to give their evidence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be no trial? Under what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations can I call upon you, the jury repreſenting your country, to adminiſter juſtice? Surely upon no other than that you are ſworn to adminiſter it under the oaths you have taken. The whole judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial fabric from the king's ſovereign authority to the loweſt office of magiſtracy, has no other foundation. The whole is built, both in form and ſubſtance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame oath of every one of its miniſters to do juſtice <hi>as God ſhall help them hereafter.</hi> What God? And what hereafter? That God undoubtedly who has commanded kings to rule, and judges to decree with juſtice, who has ſaid to witneſs, not by the voice of nature, but in revealed commandments— <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe teſtimony againſt thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor;</hi> and who has enforced obedience to them by the revelation of the unutterable bleſſings which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034482_0062_0FFDE7F034DE0AD8"/>
ſhall attend their obſervances, and the awful pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments which ſhall await upon their tranſgreſſions. But it ſeems, this is an age of reaſon, and the time and perſon are at laſt arrived, that are to diſſipate the errors which have overſpread the paſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ignorance. The believers in Chriſtianity are many, but it belongs to the few that are wiſe to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of reaſon, and ſuperior reaſon may, therefore, dictate to the weak. In running the mind along the long liſt of ſincere and devout Chriſtians, I cannot help lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Newton had not lived to this day, to have had his <hi>ſhallowneſs</hi> filled up with this <hi>new flood</hi> of <hi>light.</hi>—But the ſubject is too awful for irony. I will ſpeak plainly and directly. Newton was a Chriſtian—Newton, whoſe mind burſt forth from the fetters caſt by nature upon our finite concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—Newton whoſe ſcience was truth, and the foundation of whoſe knowledge of it was philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Not thoſe viſionary and arrogant preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which too often uſurp its name, but philoſophy reſting upon the baſis of mathematics, which, like figures, cannot lie. Newton, who carried the line and rule to the uttermoſt barriers of creation, and explored the principles by which, no doubt, all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated matter is held together and exiſts. But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a minuter inveſtigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him, of the eſſence of his Creator. What ſhall then be ſaid of the great Mr. Boyle, who locked into the Organic ſtructure of all matter, even to the brute inanimate ſubſtances, which the foot treads on. Such a man may be ſuppoſed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine to look up through nature to nature's God. Yet the reſult of all his contemplation was the moſt confirmed and devout belief in all which the other holds in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034482_0062_0FFDE7F034DE0AD8"/>
as deſpicable and driveling ſuperſtition.— But this error might, perhaps, ariſe from a want of due attention to the foundations of human judgment and the ſtructure of that underſtanding which God has given us for the inveſtigation of truth—Let that queſtion be anſwered by Mr. Locke, who was, to the higheſt pitch of devotion and adoration, a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Mr. Locke, whoſe office was to detect the errors of thinking, by going up to the fountains of thought, and to direct into the proper track of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, the devious mind of man, by ſhewing him its whole proceſs, from the firſt perceptions of ſenſe to the laſt concluſions of ratiocination, putting a rein beſides upon falſe opinion, by practical rules for the conduct of human judgment. But theſe men were only deep thinkers, and lived in their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, unaccuſtomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws which practically regulate mankind.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen! in the place where we now ſit to adminiſter the juſtice of this great country, above a century ago, the never to be forgotten Sir Matthew Hale preſided; whoſe faith in chriſtianity is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted commentary upon its truth and reaſon, and whoſe life was a glorious example of its fruits in man, adminiſtering human juſtice with wiſdom and purity drawn from the pure fountain of the chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a ſubject of the higheſt reverence and admiration. But it is ſaid by the author, that the chriſtian fable is but the tale of the more ancient ſuperſtitions of the world, and may be eaſily detected by a proper underſtanding of the mythologies of the heathens. Did Milton underſtand thoſe Mythologies? Was <hi>he</hi> leſs verſed than Mr. Paine in the ſuperſtitions of the world? No, they were the ſubject of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſong; and though ſhut out from all recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them, he poured them forth from the ſtores of a memory rich with all that man ever knew,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034482_0063_0FFDE7F3010496F0"/>
and laid them in their order as the illuſtration of that real and exalted faith, the unqueſtionable ſource of that fervid genius, which caſt a ſort of ſhade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the other works of man—
<q>
                     <l>He paſſed the bounds of flaming ſpace</l>
                     <l>Where angels tremble while they gaze;</l>
                     <l>He ſaw, till blaſted with exceſs of light,</l>
                     <l>He cloſed his eyes in endleſs night.</l>
                  </q>
But it was the light of the BODY only that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; "The celeſtial light ſhone inward, and enabled him to juſtify the ways of God to man." The reſult of his thinking was nevertheleſs not the ſame as the author's. The myſterious incarnation of our Bleſſed Saviour (which this work blaſphemes in words ſo wholly unfit for the mouth of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, or for the ear of a court of juſtice, that I dare not, and will not, give them utterance) Milton made the grand concluſion of the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> the reſt from his finiſhed labors and the ultimate hope, expectation, and glory of the world.</p>

               <p>Thus you find all that is great, or wiſe, or ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, or illuſtrious, amongſt created beings; all the minds gifted beyond ordinary nature, if not inſpired by its univerſal author for the advancement and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the world, though divided by diſtant ages, and by the claſhing opinions, diſtinguiſhing them from one another, yet joining as it were in one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime chorus, to celebrate the truths of Chriſtianity, and laying upon its holy alters the neverfading of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of their immortal wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Againſt all its concurring teſtimony, we find ſuddenly, from the author of this book, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teaches nothing but "lies, obſcenity, cruelty, and injuſtice." Had he ever read our Saviour's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount? Againſt all this concurring teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, we find ſuddenly, from this publication, that the Bible teaches nothing but lies, obſcenity, cruelty, and injuſtice. Had the author or publiſher ever read the ſermon of <hi>Chriſt upon the Mount,</hi> in which the great principles of our faith and duty are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned up?—Let us all but read and practiſe it, and lies, obſcenity, cruelty, and injuſtice, and all human wickedneſs would be baniſhed from the world!"</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is but one conſideration more, which I cannot poſſibly omit, becauſe I confeſs it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034482_0064_0FFDE7F6E2B4EEF8"/>
affects me very deeply. The author of this book has written largely on public liberty and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this laſt performance has, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, been more widely circulated, and principally among thoſe who attached themſelves from principle to his former works. This circumſtance renders a public attack <hi>upon all revealed religion</hi> from ſuch a writer, infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral ſenſe of the people of Great-Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the veſſel of the ſtate amidſt the ſtorms which agitate the world; and if I could believe for a moment, that the maſs of the people were to be debauched from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, which form the true baſis of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been ſo long the national characteriſtic, inſtead of mixing myſelf, as I ſometimes have done, in political refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, I would rather retire to the uttermoſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth to avoid their agitation; and would bear, not only the imperfections and abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of in our own wiſe eſtabliſhment, but even the worſt government that ever exiſted in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude ſet free from all the charities of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who had no ſenſe of God's exiſtence, but from Mr. Paine's obſervation of nature, which the maſs of mankind have no leiſure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and puniſhments to animate the good in the glorious purſuit of human happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to deter the wicked from deſtroying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They are a religious people, and with the bleſſing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them ſo. I have no objections to the freeſt and moſt extended diſcuſſions upon doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinel points of the chriſtian religion, and <hi>though the law of England does not permit it,</hi> I do not dread the reaſoned arguments of Deiſts againſt the exiſtence
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034482_0064_0FFDE7F6E2B4EEF8"/>
of chriſtianity itſelf, becauſe, as was ſaid by its Divine Author, if it is of God, it will ſtand. An intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual book, however erroneous, addreſſed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual world upon ſo profound and complicated a ſubject, can never work the miſchief which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment is calculated to repreſs.—Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by ſtudy, to a deeper inveſtigation of a ſubject well worthy of their deepeſt and continued contemplation. The powers of the mind are given for human improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the progreſs of human exiſtence. The changes produced by ſuch reciprocations of lights and intelligences are certain in their progreſſions, and make their way imperceptably, as conviction comes upon the world, by the final and irreſiſtible power of truth. If chriſtianity be founded in falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, let us become Deiſts in this manner, and I am contented. But this book has no ſuch object, and no ſuch capacity: it preſents no arguments to the wiſe and enlightened. On the contrary, it treats the faith and opinions of the wiſeſt with the moſt ſhocking contempt, and ſtirs up men, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of learning, or ſober thinking, to a total diſbelief of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing hitherto held ſacred; and conſequently to a rejection of all the laws and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the ſtate, which ſtand only upon the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their truth.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen! I cannot conclude without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the deepeſt regret at all attacks upon the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion by authors who profeſs to promote the civil liberties of the world. For under what other auſpices than chriſtianity have the loſt and ſubverted liberties of mankind in former ages been reaſſerted? By what zeal, but the warm zeal of devout chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have Engliſh liberties been redeemed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated? Under what other ſanctions, even in our own day, have liberty and happineſs been extending and ſpreading to the uttermoſt corners of the earth?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034482_0065_0FFDE7FA01D7BDA0"/>
What work of civilization, what commonwealth of greatneſs, has this bold religion of nature ever eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed? We ſee, on the contrary, the nations that have no other light than that of nature to direct them, ſunk in barbariſm or ſlaves to arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whilſt, ſince the chriſtian aera, the great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of the world has been ſlowly, but clearly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, lighter at every ſtep, from the awful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the goſpel, and leading, I truſt, in the end to univerſal and eternal happineſs. Each generation of mankind can ſee but a few revolving links of this mighty and myſterious chain, but by doing our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties in our allotted ſtations, we are ſure that we are fulfilling the purpoſes of our exiſtence. You, I truſt, will fulfil yours this day!"</p>
               <p>A Mr. Fleming, one of the Clerks of the Bank, was the only witneſs called on the part of the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He ſaid, he purchaſed the book in queſtion, of the defendant, at his ſhop, on the 7th of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt.</p>
               <p>The Notice which Mr. Erſkine mentioned in his ſpeech was here read, and Mr. John Martin, the attorney for the defendant, readily admitted that he had ſent it to thoſe who were concerned for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kyd made a very learned and ingenious ſpeech for the defendant. He ſaid he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to diſcharge the important duty which he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his client, in a manner, that was conſiſtent with the dignity of that court, and with that decency and ſolemnity which, he felt, belonged to the ſubject. The queſtion was, whether the author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he felt. He humbly ſubmitted, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which Mr. Paine had drawn from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, were ſuch as he might have drawn with a fair and honeſt intention. Whether thoſe inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were juſt or not, was totally a different queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034482_0065_0FFDE7FA01D7BDA0"/>
But, if his lordſhip and the gentlemen of the jury could diſcover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not puniſh a man for a mere error in judgment. If the jury could collect no wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected under the right which he and every other man had to exerciſe the powers of his mind in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing any controverſial points of religion. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then the book had been written innocently, he might infer, as a general propoſition, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo publiſhed with an innocent intention. At the ſame time he admitted, that what was ſo written, might be publiſhed from a malicious motive, for which the publiſher would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned council next ſelected ſeveral paſſages from this performance, to ſhew, that the author felt the moſt profound reverence and veneration for the ſupreme being, and denied the truth of revelation only becauſe he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was ſtated in that publication, that the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his creator from a contemplation of his works. Mr. Kyd next endeavored to juſtify the charges made upon the Bible by the author, by a variety of paſſages which he ſelected, but which, at the deſire of his lordſhip and the jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if thoſe paſſages were found in any other book, they would be conſidered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the writings of Dr. Lairdner, Dr. Bentley, and other eminent divines in ſupport of the right of free diſcuſſion, upon all ſubjects of a controverſial nature. He then ſpoke in ſevere terms of this proſecution, which he ſaid, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been inſtituted, had it not been for Biſhop
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034482_0066_0FFDE7FCABCEE7A0"/>
Watſon's Apology, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a curioſity to read the book, to which it was an anſwer; and to gratify that public curioſity, it was that this book, which, he believed, had been firſt publiſhed at Paris, was afterwards publiſhed in this country. Mr. Kyd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, at a great length, upon the freedom of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a free preſs, and gave the reformation and revolution as two inſtances of the ineſtimable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which had reſulted from them to this country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erſkine made a moſt eloquent reply. He ſaid, he was bound, in reſpect to his learned friend, as a member of a moſt honorable profeſſion, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he was placed in a very irkſome ſituation, to be called for on a defence ſo exceedingly difficult to make and ſo extremely delicate to manage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating that common decency that was due to a court of juſtice. He could not therefore help con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him as entitled to a conſiderable degree of indulgence. Mr. Erſkine here adverted to ſeveral of the paſſages ſelected from the Old Teſtament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the reaſon of the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the ſacred writings. The hiſtory of man, he ſaid, was the hiſtory of man's vices and paſſions, which could not be cenſured without adverting to their exiſtence, and many of the inſtances that had been referred to were recorded as memorable warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and examples for the inſtruction of mankind.— Mr. E. next entered moſt forcibly and deeply into the evidences of chriſtianity, particularly thoſe that were founded on that ſtupendous ſcheme of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which formed one of the moſt unanſwerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the truth of the chriſtian religion.— "It was not," he ſaid, the purpoſe of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irreſiſtable light, and conviction of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illuſtrated in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034482_0066_0FFDE7FCABCEE7A0"/>
of the divine promiſes of the goſpel. Bred as he was to the conſideration of evidence, he declared he conſidered the prophecy concerning the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewiſh nation, if there was nothing elſe to ſupport chriſtianity, abſolutely irreſiſtable. The diviſion of the Jews into tribes, to preſerve the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ealogy of Chriſt, the diſtinction of the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, from which he was to come; the loſs of this diſtinction when that end was accompliſhed; the predicted departure of the ſceptre from Iſrael; the deſtruction of the temple of Jeruſalem, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial munificence in vain attempted to re-build to diſgrace the prophecy; the diſperſion of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the face of the whole earth, the ſpreading of the goſpel throughout the world; the perſecution of its true miniſters, and the foretold ſuperſtitions which for ages had defiled its worſhip—theſe were topics upon which Mr. Erſkine expatiated with great eloquence, and produced a moſt powerful effect on every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this proſecution. He ſaid, they were men of the higheſt character and greateſt conſideration in the country. Many of them were charged with the offices of religion, others of them were cloathed with the robes of magiſtracy; moſt of them were men of deep learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thinking; and all of them juſtly entitled to the thanks of the public for their noble exertions in the cauſe of religion and virtue.</p>

               <p>Being now in poſſeſſion of all the facts of this eaſe, and convinced, in my own mind, what conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ought to be drawn from them, I am not ſure, that it is neceſſary to ſay any thing at all to you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject. Gentlemen, before you proceed to decide on the merits of this, or any other cauſe, it is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034482_0067_0FFDE7FE3AFC8E30"/>
proper to ſee whether the parties litigating ſtand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned Counſel for the defendant thought fit to ſtate to you, with very conſiderable emphaſis, and a very determined tone of voice, that this was a ſcandalous proſecution. I cannot help wiſhing that this ſentence had not been uttered.—Who commenced this proſecution, I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Counſel who juſt ſat down, I am inclined to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it proceeded from a ſociety of gentlemen inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the moſt important of all purpoſes, for preſerving the morals of the people; a ſociety com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Clergymen, and Laymen of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable characters in the kingdom, who, feeling how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedneſs, which boldly raiſe their heads in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the law of the land, were determined to ſee whether, in the firſt place, by admonition and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they could not ſtop the torrent of vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality; and ſecondly, if that ſhould fail, to try what could be done by puniſhment. If people with the very beſt intentions carry on proſecutions that are oppreſſive, the end may not always perhaps ſanctify the means. But the manner in which this proſecution has been conducted, is certainly not oppreſſive; for inſtead of proceeding in the more expenſive mode, the proſecutors went before a Grand Jury of the country: and it was neceſſary to obtain the opinion of that Grand Jury before the party could be put in proceſs.—Gentlemen! we ſit here in a Chriſtian Aſſembly to adminiſter the laws of the land, and I am to take my knowledge of what the law is from that which has been ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by a great variety of legal deciſion. I am bound to ſtate to you, what my predeceſſors in Mr. Woolſton's caſe (2 Strange, 834) ſtated half a century ago, in this Court of which I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034482_0067_0FFDE7FE3AFC8E30"/>
am an humble member, namely, that the chriſtian religion is part of the law of the land. Chriſtianity from its earlieſt inſtitution met with its oppoſers. Its profeſſors were very ſoon called upon to publiſh their apologies for the doctrines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, &amp; whether they had the advantage of their adverſaries, or ſunk under the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of their arguments mankind for near two thouſand years have had an opportunity of judging. They have ſeen that Julian, Juſtin Martyr, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apologiſts have written, and have been of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion the argument was in favour of thoſe very publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The world has lately been favoured with another apology from a moſt learned and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prelate, who calls his work <hi>An Apology for the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> I ſhall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications themſelves are in the hands of the world: and I ſincerely wiſh in the concluding language of the work to which I have juſt referred (I do not affect to uſe the very words) I ſincerely wiſh that the author of the work in queſtion may become a partaker of that faith in revealed religion, which he has ſo groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that diſorder which he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to the utmoſt of his power to introduce into ſociety. We have heard to-day, that the light of Nature, and the contemplation of the works of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation are ſufficient, without any other revelation of the Divine Will. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—each of them in their turns profeſſed they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other lights; and knowing and confeſſing that God was good, they took it for granted that the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked as it were through a cloud, darkly, they hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their poſterity would almoſt ſee God face to face. —This condition of mankind has met with repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034482_0068_0FFDE8020CC62440"/>
to-day. But I ſhall not purſue this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fully impreſſed with the great truths of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which, thank God, I was taught in my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly years to believe, and of which the hour of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inquiry, inſtead of producing any doubt has fully confirmed me in. I expected the learned Counſel for the Defendant would have differed the caſe of the publiſher from that of the author of this work; that he would have endeavored to convince you that whatever guilt might belong to the author, nothing was imputable to the publiſher. He has, however to my utter ſurpriſe, exactly reverſed the caſe. He tells you it was originally publiſhed at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great meaſure forgotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the publiſher, who has brought forth a ſtill-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works to ſend it forth among the inhabitants of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Unleſs it was for the moſt malignant purpoſes, I cannot conceive how it was publiſhed. It is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for you to judge of it, and to do juſtice between the public and the defendant."</p>

            </head>
            <p>THIS auſpicious day, my fellow citizens, is the epoch from which we date our national exiſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to mirth and feſtive joy. The birth-day of kings, their acceſſions to their thrones, and the periods of their victories, when thouſands of their fellow men have fallen, conſtitute, in general, the great feſtivals of the earth; but in the view of reaſon and philoſophy theſe are days of ſorrow not of joy. We, on the contrary, aſſemble to celebrate a day,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034482_0071_0FFDE80BE986BCC0"/>
the firſt in the annals of time, which gave to a kind equal rights and equal privileges—How ſtriking the contraſt! the one ſinks and degrades, the other exalts and ennobles the human charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—How auguſt the contemplation! that through the various changes and national revolutions which the hiſtoric page unfolds, this ſhould be the firſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>d of time, when in truth and reality man became re-inveſted with that equal liberty, which the God of nature gave him. It is right therefore, that we commemorate this joyous day; and in the commemoration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, what contemplations, my fellow citizens, more uſeful &amp; inſtructive, than the cauſes from whence reſulted this our great revolution. The principles on which it was defended and ſupported—the diſtinguiſhed rank it takes among the other revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the earth, and the conduct of its brave defenders in the days of danger and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>A Britiſh political writer obſerves, that the
<q>American war originated in parliamentary job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and its great purpoſe was to transfer enormous maſſes of Engliſh property into loans, funds and taxes, to form that corrupt miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial phalanx called the friends of government; while this faction, like a malignant diſeaſe, was
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034482_0071_0FFDE80BE986BCC0"/>
draining the vital ſubſtances of Britain, and even armies and navies were meerly its ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If this repreſentation of the cauſe of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war be true, and ſuch a faction, or ſuch a parliament, could obtain ſuch an aſcendency in Britain as to draw forth the vital ſubſtances of that nation to effect ſuch purpoſes, how awfully wretched muſt have been our ſituation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had they been enabled to rear and eſtabliſh the ſtandard of corruption on our Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhores—inſtead of rejoicing this day, we ſhould have been mourning—inſtead of celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the triumphs of freedom, we ſhould have been languiſhing in the ſhackles of deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>The frequent repreſentations which were made in England of the wealth of the Americans by the Britiſh officers, who had ſerved here againſt the French, and who had fared ſumptuouſly at the American tables, rouſed into action the contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which had long been entertained by the government, to raiſe a revenue in America.</p>
            <p>Early in 1764, the queſtion of right to tax was brought forward in the houſe of commons, and ſo ſtrong was the impulſe of avarice, and ſuch the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034482_0072_0FFDE80EC8246190"/>
influence which a corrupt adminiſtration had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at this period, that not a perſon in the houſe ventured to controvert the right. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards however, many illuſtrious characters came forward in the oppoſition; and the names of thoſe whoſe motives were pure and uncorrupt will ever brighten and adorn the page of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can freedom. They improved us in the knowledge of our political rights, and confirmed us in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them. The firſt, the foremoſt, and I may add, the moſt ſincere, was the celebrated Colonel Barre, for whoſe noble defence of virtue, and America, in oppoſition to the whole houſe; "May recorded honors gather round his monument and thicken over him."</p>
            <p>Subſequent to the revolution of 1688, the moſt prominent features in the Britiſh ſyſtem of politics was "That taxation could only reſult from repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation," or, in other words, that the property of the ſubject could never be taken without his conſent. But the influence of corruption and the anxiety to draw reſources from America to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its ſooted ſtream, in all its branches, from the king on the throne down to the loweſt miniſterial hireling, had opperated ſuch an entire dereliction of principles, that when the queſtion of right, as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034482_0072_0FFDE80EC8246190"/>
before obſerved, firſt came forward, there was not an advocate in its favor; and they conſidered the future oppoſition as merely the petulance of diſcontent and not the voice of reaſon.</p>
            <p>From hence, my fellow citizens, we have this inſtructive leſſon, never to permit a departure from a political principle of freedom, known, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed and felt to be right—it augurs corruption in the government, and will never be attempted from motives pure and virtuous.</p>
            <p>To ſupply the priviledged and pampered orders of ſtate, the heart of poverty in Britain had been probed, from every quarter, for many years, and for new ſources they turned their baleful eyes acroſs the atlantic.</p>
            <p>America was ſeen like a fair flower riſing in the wilderneſs, untouched and unblighted by the breath of corruption. The hierarchy of that country ever cloſely united with the miniſtry and with hands equally impure, as anxiouſly deſired to graſp and enjoy the flower—it was as ſtrongly inculcated that the eſtabliſhment and ſupport of a Biſhopric in America, with its deſirable append<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, was as eſſential to the ſupport and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mother church, as the obtaining a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034482_0073_0FFDE8106D8C89A8"/>
revenue was eſſential to the ſupport of the ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus united with theſe views and theſe deſires, they commenced the operation from whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the glorious revolution which we this day celebrate.</p>
            <p>But let us turn, my countrymen, from that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren waſte "in which no ſalutary plant takes root, no verdure quickens," to a ſoil, as I willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, pure as the limped ſtream, and fertile in every great and good qualification.</p>
            <p>It is the obſervation of an elegant writer, "That the Americans, diſperſed throughout an immenſe continent, free as the wilds of nature which ſurrounded them; amidſt their rocks, their mountains, the vaſt plains of their deſerts, on the confines of thoſe foreſts, in which all is ſtill in its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ſtate, and where there are no traces of either the ſlavery or the tyranny of man; ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from every natural object a leſſon of liberty and independence—as far removed from riches as from poverty, they were not corrupted either by the exceſs of luxury or the exceſs of want. Feed us with food convenient for us, leſt we be full and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord, or leſt we be poor and ſteal and take the name of our God in vain," was their united prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:034482_0073_0FFDE8106D8C89A8"/>From this natural equality in which man is more jealous of his rights than perhaps in any other ſtate of ſociety, flowed a greater effuſion of knowledge than falls to the lot of mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as they better underſtood their rights, ſo were they more ready to repel every unjuſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them.</p>
            <p>The principle, that repreſentation and taxation muſt go together, was well underſtood in America; there were comparatively few, ſo illiterate, but knew it to be a political axiom; none ſo inſenſible but felt it as their only ſecurity againſt the graſp of oppreſſion—this principle individuals in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica oppoſed in their public prints to the repeated attempts making in Britain to bring forward bills to tax them; and illuſtrated it with a ſtrength of argument that ſunk beneath contempt the vile and ſlaviſh yell of the minions of deſpotiſm, that all oppoſition to government was rebellion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion treaſon.</p>
            <p>The plan however progreſſed in Britain, and when matured, was brought into action; it was like putting fire to the train; the noble ſentiment of <hi>Freedom or Death</hi> ſpread quick as the electric flame from one extreme of our continent to the other, and rouſed, as it were, inſtantaneouſly, three millions of people in ſupport of their right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:034482_0074_0FFDE81213FA1320"/>The forming a Congreſs by a repreſentation from the then different Colonies, circumſtanced as they were, is a phenominon in political ſcience, and the ſtrongeſt evidence of the happy effects reſulting from a general diffuſion of knowledge among the people; ſpread over an immenſe tract of territory, ſtrangers to each other, with different cuſtoms, manners and local prejudices, under ſtrong colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of intereſt, flowing from commercial rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and diſputed boundaries of territory, reaſon and policy required their union under one head, to render effectual the defence of their freedom.

of opinion, as to the means of obtaining it, was diſcuſſed with the calmneſs of reaſon, ſeeking for truth, and not with the keen perſonal invective only aiming at party ſuperiority. And to the honor of our country would it be, could we in truth paſs this eulogium from the Congreſs of '75 to every ſubſequent Congreſs of America. Their compoſitions united a manlineſs of ſentiment with an elegance of ſtile that ſeemed inſpired by the pure ſpirit of the cauſe in which they were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and will go down to poſterity as illuſtrious monuments of American genius.</p>
            <p>To ſhow to you, my countrymen, the character of theſe our youthful politicians in the mind of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced in Europe; permit me to repeat the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the firſt ſtateſman and orator of Britain: "The repreſentatives of America (ſaid he) meet with the ſentiments and temper, and ſpeak the ſenſe of the continent. For genuine ſagacity, for ſingular moderation, for ſolid wiſdom, manly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſublime ſentiments and ſimplicity of language, for every thing reſpectable and honorable, the Congreſs of Philadelphia ſhine unrivalled. They are viewed as the northern conſtellation of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worthies illuminating and warming the New World." Theſe eulogiums reſulted from that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034482_0075_0FFDE81703DC4BE8"/>
policy, ſpirit and union, which they exerciſed in the ſupport of their grand principle, that no Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican could be taxed without his conſent, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by himſelf or repreſentative, which right they contended, our anceſtors derived both from nature and the Britiſh conſtitution, and tranſmitted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marred, to their poſterity; and to the honor of our country be it remembered, that this principle, as their leading ſtar, was unremittingly purſued from the gloom of unſucceſsful ſupplication to the ſplendor of victory and acknowledged ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>But let us paſs to a comparative view of this our glorious revolution, with the other revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth, having <hi>Liberty</hi> for their object. In one reſpect, my countrymen, there is a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing difference which gives luſtre to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican character. The revolution of this country proceeded from a well digeſted knowledge of civil rights, the reſult of philoſophical reflection, and ſpeculative enquiry. The other revolutions, which have preceded it, have been cauſed either by a ſeries of oppreſſions which could no longer be endured, or have ſprung from the impulſe of the moment, occaſioned by ſome unexpected and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent act of deſpotiſm that tortured human nature into action—the one pourtrays the reaſon and reflection of man, the other the limits of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034482_0075_0FFDE81703DC4BE8"/>
and the keenneſs of his ſenſations. The Romans, ſo celebrated in hiſtory for their patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic virtues, were rouſed from ſlavery to freedom by the ſight of the poignard reeking with the blood of the virtuous Lucretia.</p>
            <p>The death of the chaſte Virginia, by the hand of her father to ſave her honor from the tyrannic Decimvir, and her body expoſed to the public view, impelled that people again to revolt and to annihilate the order of the Decimvirs, which had violated the rights of the Roman citizens.</p>
            <p>And to come down to more modern times—the introduction of the inquiſition into the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands by the deſpotic Philip,—The terrible ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles daily preſented by that awful inſtitution of men periſhing in the flames on account of their religion; and the ignomineous death of Egmont and Horn, two popular favorites, at length tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the people into that oppoſition which, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, iſſued in the emancipation of the ſeven united provinces. Even the hardy robuſt inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Alps, ſince ſo famous for the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetic confederacy, for a long time, bore the moſt degrading oppreſſions until the manly virtues of a TELL excited them to reſiſtance. Nor is the important revolution in France, ſo juſtly celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034482_0076_0FFDC59269025E08"/>
for the magnitude of its object, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant brilliancy of execution, an exception; thoſe heroic and unconquerable republicans had borne the hard hand of deſpotiſm, till forced by its oppreſſive weight to avenge their wrongs.</p>
            <p>The guardian genius of America, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, would never permit the fangs of deſpotiſm to faſten on our hallowed ſoil. And may it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be our great characteriſtic to foreſee danger at a diſtance, and to repel its approach on principle and rational enquiry.</p>
            <p>Where are the liberties of the republics which have preceded us; except the Swis Cantons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know of no republican ſtate at this day but has returned to the dark glooms of deſpotiſm, and the name of <hi>Republic</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> is, with them, meer ſounding braſs and tinkling cimbal. The cauſe of this awful relapſe from freedom to ſlavery is well worth the enquiry of every American. And the great ſource from whence it has proceeded, my countrymen, is the want of general inſtruction and information among the people. This forms an unſurmountable barrier againſt their inveſtigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their political rights, renders them inattentive thereto, and obliges them to intruſt the ſacred depoſit in the hands of a few individuals, whoſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034482_0076_0FFDC59269025E08"/>
conduct they are unable to ſcrutinize, and ſubjects them to be carried away credulous victims to the artifice of every deſigning demagogue.</p>
            <p>But it is time we turn to a ſummary conſideration of the conduct of the brave defenders of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in its days of danger and diſtreſs. "And what hand withholds the lawrel ſo juſtly due to the virtues of our patriotic warriors," called from the peaceful walks of private life by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's danger—from citizens they became ſoldiers. What hardſhips, incident to that ſituation, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven long years did they not endure? Where is the example in hiſtory of equal gallantry and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in every difficulty and danger unſupplied and unpaid, owing to the impoveriſhed ſtate of their country. In the dark ſeaſons of the war when the genius of liberty ſeemed to languiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſſure of deſpotiſm, and many of her ſons, in moments of deſpondency, ſought protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the relentleſs foe; who ſaw the army diſcover ſimptoms of deſpair, or heard from them the language of ſubmiſſion?</p>
            <p>Permit me here, my fellow citizens, to pay the tribute of praiſe to the patriotic ſoldier who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on the banks of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

enliſtments, and with whom he was enabled to recroſs that river &amp; turn the tide of the war by his victories at Trenton and at Princeton. But why do I particularize? Scarcely a town in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try but where have been diſplayed acts which ſound their panegyric—when the cauſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was finally triumphant, and the minions of deſpotiſm obliged to withdraw from its ſhores, which they had ſo long ſtained with the blood of its citizens, theſe patriotic warriors gave to the world an example of the love of country ever to be admired and imitated. Unſatisfied and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited for their long laborious toils and ſervices, the moment their country ceaſed to call, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the inſignia of <hi>War</hi> for the mantle of <hi>Peace,</hi> and returned to the boſom of that country whoſe rights they had ſo nobly defended.</p>
            <p>And here they have purſued the various occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of civil life with an induſtry which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes them in ſociety; and at this day are, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unexceptionably, conſpicuous examples of attachment to the <hi>Rights of Man</hi> and the cauſe of <hi>Liberty</hi> in general, in oppoſition to all arbitrary power—ſentiments that were ſo ſtrongly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the courſe of their illuſtrious ſervice. The pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſe, the reſpect and affection due to diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

merit, is the only compenſation they can now receive. Theſe will never be withheld while gratitude is an American virtue; and when time ſhall ceaſe with them and us, let their monumenal inſcription be "HE FOUGHT AND CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUERED IN HIS COUNTRY's CAUSE." It will ſerve both for Epitaph and Elegy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear their memory with poſterity.</p>
            <p>The brilliant exploits of the militia of our country ought never, on an occaſion like this, to be paſſed over in ſilence. They have ever been conſidered as the grand defence of every land of freedom, and in the courſe of our ſtruggle for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, they proved themſelves eminently worthy of the ſacred charge. The ſcenes of Bunker's hill, of Bennington and the Sarratoga heights, will ſtand to the lateſt time, illuſtrious examples of their prowes and intripidity. But to enumerate all the glorious deeds of our warring yeomanry would require time far beyond my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent limits. Permit me only to add, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of New-Jerſey acquired lawrels which will ever be conſpicuous in the volums of American hiſtory.</p>
            <p>I will not lead you on this occaſion to the tombs of our illuſtrious warriors who fell in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034482_0078_0FFDE81E8BBDA550"/>
cauſe—it would touch the ſprings of grief in the heart of ſenſibility, and draw the ſympathetic tear from many an eye. The renumeration of their names without the annexation of their ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtues, would be too melancholy a detail— and to give to each his characteriſtic glory is the pleaſing taſk of the hiſtorian. The memory of every ſon and daughter of liberty will embalm them as long as time and recollection ſhall exiſt.</p>
            <p>And now permit me to cloſe this addreſs, my countrymen, in reminding you that the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that liberty, which you have ſo gloriouſly obtained, depends on your own knowledge and the right inſtruction and education of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for you and they can only be thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to guard the avenues to the temple of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the firſt approaches of tyranny, and to detect both oppreſſion and anarchy, which are equal evils in all their variety of ſhapes—guard with anxious care your preſent free and glorious Conſtitution, and afford at all times your ready exertions to ſupport it in its purity againſt either its deſtroyer or corrupter; for by either its deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction or corruption you looſe your all; <hi>in vain you fought—in vain you conquered.</hi>
