            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Independence of the North-American Colonies, is a matter of great importance, and has been the ſubject of much diſpute and ſpeculation in times paſt. The debate is now cloſed, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this grand point; for, after mature deliberation, the American Congreſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated thereto by the wanton, cruel, and unprovoked conduct of the king and parliament of Great-Britain, have declared theſe Colonies totally Independent on, and unconnected with that State, and now mean to conſider and treat them like other
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015710_0006_0F99DDA66B54E158"/>
nations and ſtates, as "enemies in war, in peace; friends,"</p>
            <p>THE words of my text are peculiarly ſuitable for the ſubject of diſcourſe upon ſuch an event. The ſtory of which, what I have read, is but a part, we have at large in the preceeding part of this chapter. The ſum of it is this; Rehoboam reigned in the ſtead of Solomon, his Father, king over all Iſrael. Upon his acceſſion to the throne, the people by the repreſentatives of their ſeveral tribes, petition the king for redreſs of their grievances, they complain of the laſt reign; they addreſs Rehoboam for relief, and upon condition of its being granted, they will continue their allegiance to the houſe of David. Rehoboam conſulted with them about him; the grave experienced men of his council adviſed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by all means, to give the petitioners a kind anſwer, and this would ſecure them in <hi>his</hi> intereſt, "They will be thy ſervants for ever," ſay theſe wiſe counſellors. But this counſel of the old man he regards not, he forſakes, and takes advice of the "young men who were grown up with him, and who
<pb n="9"
                   facs="unknown:015710_0007_0F99DDA72A3177C8"

ſtood before him," to <hi>them</hi> he adhered, who urged harſh and rigorous meaſures, and adviſed to the impoſition of far hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier taxes. He anſwered the people agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch weak and fooliſh counſels. He threatned not only to ſqueze them by heavy taxes, but to chaſtiſe them with cruel laws, and ſevere executions thereof. Thus was Rehoboam infatuated in his counſels and meaſures, and hereby the righteous deſigns of the Supreme Ruler of the world were fulfilled. "It was from the Lord." He left Rehoboam to his own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hid from his eyes the things which belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him, agreeable to God's threatning, related in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter. God often ſerves his own wiſe and righteous purpoſes, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence and wickedneſs of men, and ſnares ſinners in the works of their own hands. When the ten tribes of Iſrael were thus roughly anſwered, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they all as one <hi>declare</hi> a revolt from Rehoboam, and the two tribes who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to him, and ſet up a ſeparate king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and independent ſtate, as the text teaches us. They highly reſented the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015710_0008_0F99DDA84EDE6198"/>
provocation which Rehoboam gave them, were incenſed at his menaces, concluded that <hi>that</hi> government, in its progreſs, would be intolerably grievous, which, in the beginning, was ſo very imperious and haughty, and therefore reſolve no longer to yield allegiance and ſubmiſſion to ſuch a Tyrant. By the way, we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the ten tribes of Iſrael fall off from the houſe of David, if the houſe of David fall away from the great end of their advancement to rule and authority which was "to be miniſters of God, for good to the people."</p>
            <p>My view, in further diſcourſing upon this ſcrap of ſacred ſtory, is to apply the revolt of the ten tribes of Iſrael from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam, (as far as it will apply) to the Thirteen Colonies of North-America, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing "all allegiance to the Britiſh crown, and totally diſſolving all political connection between them and the ſtate of Great-Britain, and declaring themſelves Free and Independent States, veſted with the full powers, privileges and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives belonging to ſeperate ſtates, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to juſtify this meaſure to the world. It is not to be ſuppoſed that
<pb n="11"
                   facs="unknown:015710_0009_0F99DDA8CC670898"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe two caſes are exactly parallel; it is ſufficient if they are ſo in the main points.</p>
            <p>Let it then be obſerved, in the firſt place, that this fooliſh and wicked Rhehoboam was the <hi>third</hi> king of that houſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. When the people of Iſrael fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impiouſly aſked God to give them a king, hereby rejecting the kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt high, God condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gratify their deſire, after previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warning them of what would be the certain conſequences of their unhappy choice; they would be ſuch as, if they had any reaſon left, and would conſult their own intereſt, they would withdraw their petition, and deſire rather to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as they were. They notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perſiſted in their demand, and God gave them a king, but in his anger, and as a great ſcourge and curſe to them. The firſt king of Iſrael was Saul, the ſon of Kiſh, a Benjamite. He was a ſilly prince, infatuated in his councils, invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his neghbours, deſerted by his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, diſordered in his own ſpirit, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeing in confuſion, and rejected of God from being king. After this, God directs Samuel to anoint David king, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015710_0010_0F99DDA9767C3A18"/>
ſon of Jeſſe, of another family. David was in the main a good king, though he had his faults.</p>
            <p>SOLOMON, his ſon by Bathſheba, the wife of Uriah, reigned over Iſrael, after the death of David. He was a wiſe and good king, and in general ruled well. Indeed he was led away, by his wives, from God, for which he threatned to rend ten tribes from him, and give to his ſervant Jeroboam, though not in his day, And further, it ſeems probable, there were ſome things in his reign greivous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive to the people; for when Rehoboam ſon of Solomon, came to the throne of Iſrael upon his father's death, the people petition him to relax ſomewhat the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice of the former reign. "Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous ſervice of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter, and we will ſerve thee." But Rehoboam hearkned not unto the people, but threatned them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable burdens and impoſitions.</p>
            <p>Let us apply this:</p>
            <p>THE preſent king of Great-Britain is the <hi>third</hi> prince of the houſe of Hanover.

for our rightful ſovereign. For, as the people, at firſt emigrated chiefly from Great-Britain and Ireland, they ever (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til now) held under the crown thereof, and acknowledged the ſame king, with the other tribes beyond the atlantic. But ſoon after he came to the throne of his anceſtors, he diſcovered an haughty and deſpotic ſpirit and behaviour. He, like Rehoboam, forſook the counſel of the old men, and followed the impolitic advice of his young mates, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor. In the reign of George the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Britiſh empire was carried to its height and perfection in glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, wealth, grandeur, and extent of dominion, through the wiſe counſels, and prudent management of that able ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and counſellor, Mr. PITT, now Earl of Chatham, of immortal memory. He had the whole conducting of the laſt war, and by his ſound judgment and ſkill, and uncorruptible patriotiſm, under God, enabled Great-Britain to conquer the united powers of France and Spain, to ſpread terror through the world, and add to her dominions an immenſe extent of territory in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015710_0013_0F99DDABA72C9C38"/>
in North-America. He put it into the power of Britain to make the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and gainful peace, at the cloſe of the laſt war; but Lord Bute, the king's preceptor, ſent plenipotentiary to the treaty at Paris, conſents to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious terms.</p>
            <p>THE kingdom was a long time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that pitch of grandeur and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which, in divine providence, it was exalted at the acceſſion of the preſent king: but it ſoon began to decline. The old men, the able counſellors who ſtood before <hi>his</hi> grandfather, and to whom the nation was greatly indebted, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded, neglected. Though they have ever given their beſt advice to the king, urging ſuch mild, conciliatory meaſures as would have ſecured to him the allegiance and affection of all his ſubjects, yet their counſels were reprobated, while the young, inexperienced men, who grew up with him, he has ever conſulted, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he has ſteadily followed through the whole of his reign. The people of England and America have had conſtant cauſe for complaints and petitions; for his reign has been one continued ſeries of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015710_0014_0F99DDAD028D9080"/>
and uſurpations. Bute, Hillſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and North, with their deteſtable Junto, have adviſed to oppreſſive meaſures of taxation, in America, and when we have petitioned for redreſs, they have urged fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harſh and vigorous methods, and when we have attempted to defeat the operation of their acts they have adviſed to the moſt wanton and cruel puniſhments: So that we have had juſt cauſe of complaint; to ſhow which we need only mention what he and his parliament have done, leaving an impartial world to judge whether we have not ſufficient reaſons to reject him, as our king, and to ſet up as free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſtates, ſaying, "What portion have we in George? neither have we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the houſe of Hanover; to your tents O Americans, and now ſee to thine own houſe George." "He has refuſed his aſſent to laws, the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>

            <p>Theſe are ſome of the acts and doings of George the third, and the Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: but theſe are not all, neither can the baleful influence, and cruel ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe be painted in full and

proper color. Theſe are all facts, not to be denied by any, neither do any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deny, that <hi>he</hi> and his venal mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and corrupt parliament have done, or, at leaſt, attempted to do all theſe things.</p>
            <p>BUT ſome pretend to juſtify the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration in Great-Britain, with ſaying, we have, by our abuſive treatment of the king's ſervants, provoked government to treat us with ſuch unexampled ſeverity: Our troubles, ſay they, we have brought upon ourſelves, and the various acts of king and parliament aroſe from our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to government. To this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let me anſwer, That, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain acts of trade which were griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and oppreſſive, the people preſerved due decorum, and were peaceable and ſubmiſſive until 1764. The Britiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration began its attacks on our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties with a ſtamp-act, but meeting with ſtrong oppoſition, they thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal it. This act threw the colonies into ſtrong convulſions, and we rejoiced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly on its repeal, fondly hoping we ſhould enjoy future tranquility. But we were miſtaken. They never intended to relinquiſh their deſign, but only to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015710_0020_0F99DDB8807E4FF0"/>
change their ground, that, which they firſt pitched upon, not ſeeming tenable. An American revenue granted by a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh parliament was the object, and they never loſt ſight of it: for ſoon renewed their attacks, upon principles which they thought more favourable to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but they met with as little ſucceſs in this as in their former attempt. If the Americans, in ſome inſtances, carried their reſentment too far againſt ſome among us, whom they, not without reaſon, thought to be inſtrumental of ſuch oppreſſive acts, they ſhould remember the provocation given, pity and overlook any indecencies and lawleſs meaſures ſome few run into, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, "Oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad." Admitting that ſome wrong ſteps were taken by ſome in certain places, in oppoſing revenue laws, this can never juſtify their puniſhing the innocent with the guilty, and attempting to deprive a whole province of its chartered rights, for the follies and freaks of individuals. But further, if thoſe revenue laws were unjuſt, cruel and oppreſſive, and inconſiſtent with liberty, and the enjoyment of our property, it was the duty of this people to oppoſe them: and if this oppoſition
<pb n="23"
                   facs="unknown:015710_0021_0F99DDB9B6A85328"

could not be made in what ſome call, a regular way, we muſt take ſuch meaſures as we could, and it was certainly wrong in them to puniſh us for oppoſing their acts, big with ſuch fatal conſequences to America. There was no oppugnation of government <hi>here</hi> until it became grievous, oppreſſive and intollerable, and then it was, and ought to be, oppoſed. Our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was miſrepreſented by our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and other crown officers, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an impatience of any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or reſtraint: every little riot or diſturbance was magnified beyond all the poſſibilities of truth, and repreſented as the doing of vaſt multitudes. Thus, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was firſt oppreſſed, and for ſtruggling and groaning under her oppreſſions, ſhe was calumniated and loaded with more intollerable burdens.</p>
            <p>But, ſay ſome, if theſe acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, meaſures of adminiſtration were grievous and oppreſſive, we did not take the right courſe for redreſs: we ſhould have petitioned therefor in a regular way, by the three branches of the legiſlatures. This, I would anſwer, was always attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but never could be obtained; for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015710_0022_0F99DDB9E5DB73B8"/>
when governors found the two houſes of aſſembly ripening petitions to the king, they were immediately adjourned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, or diſſolved. Whenever the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral houſes of aſſembly, in their ſeparate capacity, ſent petitions and remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then they were rejected, becauſe they were not proper acts of the court. At this time the aſſemblies found they had not ſuitable agents at the court of Great-Britain; the governors would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the choice of ſuch as the two houſes could confide in as friendly to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and rights; from that time they had ſeparate agents. Our agents could not be heard, becauſe they were not the agent of the <hi>whole</hi> court, and governors were inſtructed not to conſent to any grants for their ſervices. Thus there be no petitioning in what ſome affect to call, <hi>the regular way.</hi> When the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of this ſtate wrote circular let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the other ſtates, ſoliciting a union in remonſtrating and petitioning againſt ſome late acts of parliament, this and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other aſſemblies were diſſolved. Thus things went on until 1774, when the colonies choſe delegates to repreſent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015710_0023_0F99DDBACFB9B9F0"/>
them in one grand Congreſs, who, being met, drew up a moſt humble and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful petition to the king, wherein they ſay, "From this deſtructive ſyſtem of colony adminiſtration adopted ſince the concluſion of the late war have flowed thoſe diſtreſſes, dangers, fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that overwhelm your majeſties duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful coloniſts with affliction; and we defy our moſt ſubtil and inveterate adverſaries to trace the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and theſe colonies, from an earlier period, or from other cauſes, than we have aſſigned, had they proceeded, on our part, from reſtleſs levity of temper unjuſt impulſers of ambition or artful ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of ſeditious perſons, we ſhould merit the approbrious terms frequently beſtowed on us by thoſe we revere. But ſo far from promoting innovations, we have only oppoſed them, and can be charged with no offence, unleſs it be one to receive injuries and be ſenſible of them. —We aſk but for peace, liberty and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We wiſh not a diminution of the prerogative, nor do we ſolicit the grant of any new right in our favor. Your royal authority over us, and our connection

In the ſecond addreſs of the Congreſs to the king, the laſt year, they ſay, "Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your majeſty's perſon, family and government, with all the devotion that principle, and affection can inſpire; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with Great-Britain by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ties that can unite ſocieties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring every event that tends in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to weaken them, we ſolemnly aſſure your majeſty, that we not only deſire the former harmony between her, and theſe colonies may be reſtored, but that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord may be eſtabliſhed between them upon ſo firm a baſis, as to perpetuate its bleſſings, uninterrupted by any future diſſentions, to ſucceeding generations in both countries." After mentioning the new ſyſtem of ſtatutes and regulations adopted with reſpect to the colonies, they add, "We therefore beſeech your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015710_0025_0F99DDBC30EDB220"/>
that your royal authority and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be graciouſly interpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us relief from our afflicting fears and jealouſies, occaſioned by the ſyſtem before mentioned, and to ſettle peace through every part of your dominions, with all humility ſubmitting to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's wiſe conſideration, whether it may not be expedient for facilitating thoſe important purpoſes, that your majeſty be pleaſed to direct ſome mode by which the united applications of your faithful colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to the throne, in preſence of their common councils, may be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation: and that, in the mean time, meaſures may be taken for preventing the further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the lives of your majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that ſuch ſtatutes as more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſtreſs any of your majeſty's colonies may be repealed." Thus theſe colonies have, by their repreſentatives in Congreſs, unitedly and in the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, reſpectful manner, repeatedly peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the king, for redreſs of grievances. They have aſked only for relief from cruel and oppreſſive acts made ſince 1763. But the king's ear has been deaf to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and humble ſuits.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:015710_0026_0F99DDBD015E72D8"/>I know it is ſaid by ſome among us, that thoſe petitions could not be heard, becauſe they came not from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional body. But I would reply, that every way of remonſtrating, and petitioning was tried, before this, but was ineffectual, or was attempted, but was fruſtrated; neceſſity therefore, if nothing elſe, would juſtify this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of petitioning by a general Congreſs. But beſides, what method could have been taken to obtain the ſenſe of all the colonies, and collect the whole force and ſtrength thereof united in humble, earneſt petitions for relief, but this, of chooſing men in all the colonies, by their reſpective aſſemblies, to ſit in one grand Council, to conſult, and deliberate upon matters reſpecting their common ſafety and happineſs. To me, it appears, no aſſembly could be more conſtitutional, or abſolutely neceſſary, and no petitions could come with greater weight, or have, (all things conſidered) a more likely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to gain audience, than when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all the colonies united therein. But theſe have been trampled under foot: all our humble petitions every way, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015710_0027_0F99DDBDB30D7158"/>
from every quarter, have been anſwered only by a repetition of injurious abuſes and inſults. The king and miniſtry have been obſtinately bent upon carrying their deſign into effect, for taxing theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, overturning our free conſtitutions and eſtabling an abſolute tyranny over us, otherwiſe he would have heard us, when we have ſo often called for relief, for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for juſtice. The real truth appears to be this. They were determined not to hear us, if we called; accordingly they cut off all poſſibility of petitioning in what they pretend is the only regular, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional way, and then refuſe to hear us, becauſe we do not preſent our petitions in <hi>that</hi> way. The neceſſity therefore, we have been under, of throwing off our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with Great-Britain, renouncing king George, and his evil counſellors, and ſetting up as independent ſtates, plainly appears. We could get no relief: if we had ſubmitted to their uſurped juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt have been in a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery and wretchedneſs; and becauſe we <hi>could</hi> not ſubmit, we are threatned to be devoured with the ſword. We have not been raſh and haſty in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

ourſelves independent; as the ten tribes were in their revolt from Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am; but we have waited even unto long ſuffering. Theſe thirteen years have we been ſuffering from the cruel hands of tyrants, and mercileſs oppreſſors; "in every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have petitioned," entreated, <hi>cried</hi> for relief, but they have made their hearts as an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſtone, that they might not hear us. When ſuch a long train of abuſes, and uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame object evinces a deſign to reduce us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abſolute deſpotiſm, it is our right, it is our duty to throw off ſuch government, and provide new guards for our future ſecurity. The king, miniſtry, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Great-Britain have by their fooliſh, mad, and infatuated meaſures, loſt by far the greateſt part of the Britiſh dominions, and that which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſource of wealth and ſtrength to them. He ſurely muſt be either a very weak or a very wicked prince, who could perſevereingly conduct in this manner. If he has been <hi>led</hi> by his miniſters and counſellors, contrary to his own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt be very fooliſh and weak.

And we may here apply the ſaying of a much wiſer king,<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtes, 10.16.</note> "Wo to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eat in the morning."

Either of theſe characters is not very honorable. They muſt both, in ſome degree, belong to George the third: we therefore chearfully renounce him, as totally unfit and unworthy to be our king and head: let them who like him, take him, and make the beſt of him. It is pity, that ſome way could not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, whereby the few in theſe ſtates, who appear peculiarly fond of ſuch a king, might be tranſplanted to Great-Britain, <hi>there</hi> to participate in the fruits

It is a natural remark we may here make, that it had been eaſy for George to have retained theſe ſtates in allegiance to his crown, and hearty affection to his perſon.

To this I reply in the words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in their firſt addreſs to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Great-Britain. Be aſſured that theſe are not facts, but calumnies. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to be as free as yourſelves, and we ſhall ever eſteem a union with you our greateſt glory, and our greateſt happineſs: we ſhall ever be ready to contribute, all in our power, to the welfare of the empire: we ſhall conſider your enemies as our enemies, and your intereſt as our own." In the laſt addreſs to the inhabitants of Great-Britain they ſay. "It has been ſaid that we refuſe to ſubmit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions on our commerce.

"That America is unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in reſiſting the power of taxing them by the Britiſh parliament where they have no repreſentatives: that they will never yield this point: that in caſe they were made eaſy on this point, and ſecure as to their charter, on which their property de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, they would immediately return to their duty and obedience. This, I aver to be the univerſal report and opinion of men, with whom I have converſed, from America. If any one diſputes the truth of my aſſertions, I now defy him to bring any evidence to contradict me, and I now undertake to bring men of the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in ſupport of what I aver.—I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the ſenſe of the beſt and wiſeſt men, in this country, is on the ſide of the Americans: three to one, in Ireland, are on their ſide: the greateſt characters in this country conſider them as contending in the glorious cauſe of preſerving thoſe inſtitutions which are neceſſary to the happineſs, ſecurity, and elevation of the human mind." I add, if certain indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals were zealous advocates for American independency, it was by no means the voice of the Congreſs, nor of the body of

the people, in any of the colonies, until all hope of a reconciliation with Great-Britain was entirely cut off, but upon the terms of aſking pardon for crimes we had never committed, and abſolute unconditional ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, we have dared Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to fight us, have bid them a challenge, and now complain of their cruelty and inhumanity becauſe they accept it. Now this, if from any thing, muſt be collected from the <hi>public</hi> petitions and addreſſes of the Congreſs. I have attentively and impartially reviewed them all, and I find nothing bearing ſuch an aſpect. They have mentioned our grievances, and petitioned for redreſs. They have ſtated our rights, and declare their firm reſolution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them to the laſt, and if Britain means, by force, to attempt to compel us to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to her unrighteous edicts we ſhall endeavor to repel force by force. This is the moſt we have ſaid, and does this look like a challenge? ſurely no. The Congreſs in their declaration ſetting forth the cauſes and neceſſity of taking up arms, ſay. "We are reduced to the alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of chooſing an unconditional ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

to the tyranny of imitated miniſters, or reſiſtance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the coſt of this conteſt, and find nothing ſo dreadful as voluntary ſlavery. Honor, juſtice, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity forbid us tamely to ſurrender that freedom which we received from our gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant anceſtors, and which our innocent poſterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of reſigning ſucceeding generations to that wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits them, if we baſely entail hereditary bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage upon them. Leſt this declaration ſhould diſquiet the minds of our friends and fellow ſubjects in any part of the empire, we aſſure them, that we mean not to diſſolve that union which has ſo long, and ſo happily ſubſiſted between us, and which we ſincerely wiſh to ſee reſtored. Neceſſity has not yet driven us into that deſperate meaſure, or induced us to excite any other nation to war againſt them. We have not raiſed armies with ambitious deſigns of ſeparating from Great-Britain, and eſtabliſhing independent States. We fight not for glory or for conqueſt. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle

of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation, or even ſuſpicion of offence. They boaſt of their privileges, and civiligation, and yet prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no milder conditions than ſervitude or death. In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and which we ever enjoyed, till the late violation of it, for the protection of our property acquired ſolely by the honeſt induſtry of our forefathers, and ourſelves, againſt violence, actually offered, we have taken up arms. We ſhall lay them down when hoſtilities ſhall ceaſe on the part of the aggreſſors, and all danger of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed, ſhall be removed and not before." Thus we have bid no challenge; we have only declared we will maintain our rights; we only fight in our own defence: ſome among us indeed indeavor to perſuade themſelves, and others, that the oath of allegiance which many have taken, bind them to ſubmit to thoſe acts of adminiſtration we complain of, or by no means to reſiſt them:—That if they reſiſt they are guilty of perjury, and the moſt awful violation of their oath.

objection, I beg leave to reply; that allegiance and protection are reciprocal duties, is due to rulers from their ſubjects while <hi>they</hi> are protected and ſecured in the enjoyment of their juſt rights, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, property and lives (which was the only deſign of the inſtitution of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) but if rulers, inſtead of thus protecting and defending their ſubjects, uſe their power, influence and authority, to enſlave, ruin and deſtroy their fellow-ſubjects; allegiance is no longer due, whither men have expreſsly, or only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly taken the oath of allegiance and ſubmiſſion to the government. Between rulers and their ſubjects, there is always a covenant expreſſed or ſuppoſed, and rulers are under oath to govern according to the conſtitution, and fundamental laws of this State; and the people even where they have taken expreſs oaths of allegiance to their rulers, are thereby bound to obey them, no further than they govern and rule agreeable to the ſettled conſtitution. But when rulers, by leaping the bounds of conſtitution, violate the covenant or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, between them, and the people; the people are diſcharged from their oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015710_0038_0F99DDCB2773DE68"/>
and it then is their <hi>right,</hi> their <hi>duty</hi> to oppoſe and reſiſt them. In all covenants, contracts or compacts, where one party violates them, the other party is no longer held thereto, or bound thereby. For this reaſon is it, that although the government is under obligation to ſecure to every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the enjoyment of property, liberty and life; yet when ſubjects rebel againſt lawful authority, are guilty of treaſonable practices againſt good rulers, or the ſtate, they are no longer entitled to protection, they have forfeited property, liberty or life, and the government may lawfully take either away, according to the nature and degree of their offences. Beſides, this objection, if it has any weight in it, would at once ſupport thoſe juſtly exploded doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; doctrines directly contrary to the practice of the apoſtles, who yet preached up all <hi>due</hi> ſubmiſſion to civil government. For, if the oath of allegiance, which many actually take, and all are ſuppoſed to be under to their rulers (bind as they pretend) there muſt be ready ſubmiſſion yielded to all their commands, there muſt be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance offered to them in any caſes, even
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015710_0039_0F99DDCBE945F6B8"/>
where they enjoin and require things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the conſtitution, to the nature and reaſon of things, inconſiſtent with the deſign of government, the well-being of the State, or repugnant to the expreſs will of God. Whereas, "we are bound to God rather than men." I further add, this objection, if it proves any thing in the preſent caſe, proves too much; it proves that GEORGE the third, has no <hi>right</hi> to the Britiſh crown, but that <hi>that</hi> is the right, the inheritance of the immediate heir of JAMES the ſecond, or ſomebody elſe, no mortal can tell who.—But after all it is impoſſible to ſatisfy ſome people.</p>
            <p>There are among us, men who profeſſed to be friends to their country, and who <hi>ſay,</hi> they look upon the acts of the Britiſh parliament, we complain of, as cruel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional and oppreſſive, and yet find fault with every ſtep we take, with every meaſure we purſue, and endeavor to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage people from attempting deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therefrom. But how can ſuch men reconcile their profeſſion and their conduct? They point out no other way wherein to look for, or expect relief. If they muſt find fault let them ſuggeſt ſome ſteps and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

for public conſideration, which they think adviſeable to take. But it is not a little vain and arrogant for men, totally unacquainted with public affairs, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the State, and with the world, and who ſeldom go beyond the ſmoak of their own chimnies, to pretend to arraign the wiſdom of the Congreſs, the wiſdom of the Continent. We are remarkably united in the meaſures taken: We have petitioned, we have remonſtrated: We have tried every way for relief: We have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to arms: We have been forced to an independency. Still the men cry out; nothing is conducted as it ought to be: We are all undone! "Doubtleſs they are the men, and wiſdom will die with them." I grant all men have a right to canvaſs public meaſures, and to ſpeak their minds. But then there is a deference due to the public judgment. Individuals, who diſſent, ſhould do it with modeſty and ſelf-diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as not being certain but others may know <hi>as well,</hi> if not <hi>much better</hi> than they.

            <p>But not to enlarge. From what has been ſaid above, from plain undeniable

facts, it is evident theſe colonies <hi>will</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> be juſtified, by the whole candid and impartial world in declaring themſelves free and independent States, abſolved from all allegiance to the Britiſh crown, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſconnected with the Britiſh empire.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now make a few reflections upon, and inference from what has been offered.</p>
            <p>It is a natural inference from ſacred ſtory, and from what has been ſaid above, that kingly government is not agreeable to the divine will, and is often a very great evil. The will of God as made known by Gideon; and the prophet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel expreſsly diſapproves of government by kings. "Near three thouſand years paſſed away from the Moſaic account of the creation, <hi>before</hi> the Jews under a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional deluſion, aſked a king,—'Till then their form of government (except in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes where the Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed) was a kind of republic adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by a judge, and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it was held ſinful to acknowledge any being under that title but the Lord of hoſts. And when a man ſeriouſly reflects on the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015710_0042_0F99DDCE2A5163A8"/>
idolatrous homage paid to the perſons of kings, we need not wonder that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, ever jealous of his honor, ſhould diſapprove of a form of government which ſo impiouſly invades the prerogative of heaven." No form of government but kingly or monarchial, is an invaſion of God's prerogative; this is. It will be vain to alledge, in proofs of the divine approbation of kingly government, that we are commanded to <hi>pray</hi> for kings, and to <hi>ſubmit</hi> unto kings. For, when in their folly, and "ſtrong deluſion," a people fix upon kingly, monarchial government, they muſt make the beſt of it, <hi>pray</hi> that their king may reign in righteouſneſs and rule with judgment, and muſt ſubmit to his rule and authority, <hi>ſo long</hi> as it can be done conſiſtent with their duty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to poſterity, to mankind and to God. The moſt high over all the earth, gave kings at firſt, to the Jews (as he ſends war) in anger, and as a judgment, and it may be affirmed, that upon the whole, they have been a ſcourge to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth ever ſince. We in theſe States, are now evidently under the frowns of heaven for our many and great
<pb n="45"

tranſgreſſions: it is to be hoped we ſhall not "add to our ſins, this evil to aſk <hi>us</hi> a king."<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be obſerved that new truths are often ſtruck out by the colliſion of parties, in the eagerneſs of controverſy, which otherwiſe would have lain hid. The divine diſapprobation of a form of government by kings, I take to be one of this ſort of truths. The times have led to a free inquiry into the origin, nature and deſign of civil government, and into the various forms which have obtained in the ſeveral ages of the world, and into the divine hereditary right of kings. And, I am fully convinced, the more this ſubject is controverſed and conſidered, the clearer it will appear to unprejudiced minds, that kingly government is in fact contrary to the mind and will of God.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we may infer that however faulty the king may be, and although he has forfeited the allegiance, and affection of this people, yet they who have adviſed him to ſuch acts, and to ſuch harſh and rigorous meaſures, as have divided the kingdom, and brought us into this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are veryly guilty in the ſight of God, and muſt, with the king, anſwer another day before God, for all the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their wicked advice, and raſh conduct, and eſpecially for that torrent of human blood with which our land is deluging. The acts of the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the meaſures taken againſt us, have been moſtly ſuggeſted, contrived, and urged by the notoriouſly infamous
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015710_0044_0F99DDCFBADFE640"/>
Hutchinſon (late governor of this province) and his minions of this country, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by men in place and power in Great-Britain. Leaving our <hi>other</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; the crimes of ſuch as are of this land, who have been plotting their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ruin, ſeem to purſue theſe bloody men, they are fallen into the pit they were digging for others, they are the moſt and <hi>greateſt</hi> of them baniſhed their native land, and fair inheritances; many of them deſtitute, afflicted, tormented, and the voice of their brethren's blood, ſhed greatly by their means, crieth unto God from the ground. Nor are they entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guiltleſs, let me here ſay, who, among ourſelves, ſeem to think the war in which we are engaged, not juſt, or the attempt impracticable, and therefore will not aſiſt in our defence when our <hi>all</hi> is at ſtake, but ſtand aloof from our troubles, and wiſh well to the cauſe of our adverſaries. They who decline the ſervice, and will not lend an helping hand, while we are ſtruggling for life, muſt expect to meet with ſome heavy judgment<note n="*" place="bottom">Judges v. 23.</note> "Curſe ye Meroz (ſaid the angel of the Lord) curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, becauſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015710_0045_0F99DDD08E054B60"/>
they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty." If our cauſe be good and juſt (and who can deny this) if heaven has conducted us to an independency, if this "cauſe is from God," as the revolt of the ten tribes was, if when the ſalvation of our country calls for our aid, we refuſe it, thro' oppoſition, cowardice, or any other cauſe, the curſe of God will purſue us. "Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully, and curſed be he that keepeth back his ſword from blood."<note n="†" place="bottom">Jeremiah XLVIII, 10,</note>
            </p>
            <p>Once more, As we have been neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to ſeparate from Great-Britain, we muſt make the beſt of a ſtate of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Notwithſtanding we give up that <hi>ſtate</hi> with reluctance; yet I am fully convinced that Independency is, in every view, the intereſt of America. If any among us are deſirous of being ſatisfied that this is our intereſt, and that we are able to ſupport ourſelves therein, under the patronage of that infinitely wiſe Being who has brought us hitherto, let them diveſt themſelves of prejudice and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and read that incomparable pam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phlet called <hi>"Common Senſe,"</hi> with its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

and they will have all the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they can reaſonably demand. Some among us think we do but dream, when we talk of ſupporting ourſelves as a ſeparate people:—They have thought ſo in other inſtances, and lived to ſee, what they called our dreams, come to paſs.</p>
            <p>Let me here ſubjoin, that ſince this mighty revolution has taken place in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, there muſt of neceſſity be a change in our modes of civil government; and this is a matter of the greateſt conſequence, as to this life, and ought to engage our cloſeſt attention. It will be unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in us to ſubmit to tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion within, when we are hazarding every thing dear to us, to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it from without. A plan of government will ſoon be laid before the people of this State, for their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Let us not haſtily adopt any one form; and while we reject the defects, let us preſerve the virtues and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our ancient mode. Let us cooly examine, and thoroughly weigh the plans already adopted by any ſiſter States, and improve upon them. And whatever form we fix upon, let us be peculiarly careful

that every part of the State is fully and freely repreſented in our legiſlative Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. A large and full repreſentation of a people, is of the greateſt importance to the State. The people ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their own hands a check upon the legiſlative powers, by having their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions very frequent, at leaſt, once in a year. This is a <hi>right</hi> we ſhould be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly tenacious of, nor <hi>ever</hi> upon <hi>any</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, give it up. Power is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating, to be committed for <hi>any</hi> great length of time, to the hands of <hi>any</hi> man, or <hi>any</hi> body of men, Long parliaments are fountains of corruption and venality, are totally inconſiſtent with liberty in the people, and in time, fail not to work the ruin of a State. Further, if the form of government we ſhall adopt, conſiſt of more than one branch, each ought to be entirely independent of, that it may not in the leaſt be influenced by the other. Hereditary ſucceſſion in legiſlatures, this people muſt be greatly deluded ever to admit of. In a word, the plan of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be noble and generous, ſecuring equal liberty and happineſs, both civil and religious, to every individual;

            <p>Finally, Since we are become indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on an earthly power, we eminently need the divine favor, ſmiles, protection and bleſſing, and ſhould be concerned, therefore to conduct in ſuch a manner as to ſecure the ſame. As our revolt is, undoubtedly, of God, he is ſaying to us this day, as he ſaid to Jeroboam and the ten tribes of Iſrael, "It ſhall be if you will hearken unto all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my ſight, to keep my ſtatutes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that I will be with you, and build you up." To eſtabliſh ourſelves in our Independency let us not take ways and meaſures which are ſinful, as Jeroboam and the ten tribes of Iſrael did.

That we may be ſupported, let us not too much countenance, and encourage ſuch neighbours and ſtates, as are enemies to the Proteſtant cauſe and intereſt; leſt, if we ſhould, we be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart from the living God. God has ever been the friend and patron of the American Iſrael, and he will continue ſo, if we act up to our character and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.

He will diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the devices of our enemies, and make them to be at peace with us." "If God be thus for us, who can be againſt us."

We are ready to anticipate thoſe happy times, when theſe days of tribulation ſhall be at an end; when our brethren ſhall return from the high places of the field, when we with them, ſhall ſet under our own vines and fig-trees quietly enjoying the inheritance our Anceſtors have left us, and the fruits of our own hard labor, and honeſt induſtry, and have none to make us afraid.
