            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Subject of the following Pages was as much diſputed in the laſt century, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps any one controverted point in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and very often, with too much warmth and uncharitableneſs. When it came in my way in the courſe of my public lectures, ſome time before the laſt winter vacation, I could not avoid conſidering it; but I determined to do it as briefly as would be conſiſtent with giving the Students of the College any tolerable view of the arguments and objections of the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And theſe I exhibited, in a great meaſure, tho' not always exactly, in their own words.</p>
            <p>SOON after delivering the laſt of my lectures upon the ſubject, I was very unexpectedly ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a requeſt from ſome of my hearers, who told me it was alſo the deſire of many others, that I would conſent to their being made public by the preſs. I put them off from time to time for ſeveral months, in hopes they would grow cool and drop the motion; but finding it quite otherwiſe, I at length yielded with reluctance to repeated ſolicitations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:009541_0003_0F768BC755162D98"/>I SHALL not wonder if I am cenſured by ſome of all parties, for offering but a very ſmall part of what <hi>they</hi> could have ſaid for themſelves. It would have been eaſy to have heaped up much more on every ſide; but I was unwilling to tire my audience with the length of a difficult argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, for the ſake of ſome, into whoſe hands it may now fall, I have made much ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was delivered in the college: For I am ſenſible that controverſial tracts ſoon become tedious to perſons who have not been uſed to cloſe and long attention.</p>
            <p>AS I was far from expecting that I ſhould ever be deſired to publiſh what is here emitted, I was not careful, when writing, to note in the margin from whom I made extracts; and I have not been able now, at ſix months diſtance, to recollect ſome of them, and give them credit for what was taken from them.</p>
            <p>IF a view of the difficulty of the ſubject here conſidered, may be improved to promote charity between ſuch as differ in their ſentiments about it; or if any ſerious enquirers for truth, ſhall find aſſiſtance in their ſearch after it, from what is here put into their hands; I ſhall be humbly thankful to God for it, and not be ſorry that I conſented to permit, what at the time of doing it, I had much rather have forborn.</p>

                  <p>FOR there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>HAVING ſpoken largely of the doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> in ſeveral late diſcourſes; I muſt now proceed to conſider the doctrine of <hi>Reprobation</hi> alſo, and ſee what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſcriptures give us of it. And I do this the rather, becauſe I believe it is very much owing to miſapprehenſions, or want of due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what the ſcriptures teach us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>latter</hi> of theſe points; that ſo many prejudices have ariſen in the minds of men againſt the whole doctrine of the divine decrees.—Now the words which have been read at this time, may ſerve well enough as an <hi>Introduction</hi> to the ſcripture account of <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009541_0005_0F768BC8E47E29C0"/>IN the preceding verſe the apoſtle tells thoſe to whom he directs his epiſtle, that <hi>it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to write unto them, and exhort them, that they ſhould contend earneſtly for the faith which was once delivered to the ſaints.</hi> The reaſon why this exhortation was ſo neceſſary, we have in the words before us, <hi>For there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men crept in unawares—ungodly men—deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Lord God, &amp;c.</hi> There were certain men, ungodly in life, and damnably heretical in doctrine, who had craftily ſlipt into the church unobſerved. And there was great danger leſt by the wicked practices and damnable hereſies, which <hi>theſe brought in privily; others</hi> alſo ſhould be induced to <hi>put away a good conſcience,</hi> and <hi>make ſhipwreck of their faith.</hi> And leſt any ſhould think it was <hi>only a chance which had happened unto them</hi> that the church was at this time ſo infeſted with theſe <hi>deceitful workers,</hi> and <hi>ſons of perdition;</hi> the apoſtle therefore aſſures them, that this whole matter came to paſs <hi>by the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God;</hi> that theſe very men <hi>were before of old ordained to this condemnation.</hi> Nor need any wonder to hear him ſay ſo, for it was nothing but what had <hi>been ſpoken of before by the apoſtles of our Lord;</hi> v. 14. And even <hi>Enoch, the ſeventh from Adam, had propheſied of them.</hi> v. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BY the condemnation to which theſe men were before of old ordained—</hi>ſome underſtand, <hi>that reprobate mind</hi> to which God gave them over to do thoſe things which are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and to corrupt and pervert the doctrines
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009541_0006_0F768BC9B8AAC278"/>
of the goſpel.—Others underſtand <hi>the juſt dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of God,</hi> by which they were permitted, for their former ſins, to make ſhipwreck of their <hi>own faith,</hi> and to become the authors of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error and hereſy in <hi>others,</hi> and at laſt to be condemned themſelves forever.—In fine, <hi>by this condemnation,</hi> ſome underſtand <hi>eternal damnation itſelf.</hi> For ſo the original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is often uſed elſewhere in the New Teſtament.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Matt. XXIII. 14. Mark XII. 40. Luke XX. 47. Rom. III. 8. 1 Tim. III. 6.</note> And it is certain from the whole progreſs of <hi>this epiſtle,</hi> that the apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> is here ſpeaking of thoſe very perſons, as <hi>already crept</hi> into the church, whom the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had foretold <hi>would creep into it;</hi> and concerning whom he ſays, that <hi>their judgment now of a long time lingreth not, and their damnation ſlumbreth not.</hi> 2 Pet. II. 3. Upon the whole, in whichever of theſe ſenſes we take the expreſſion, it will amount to much the ſame thing. For if by <hi>this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> we underſtand, either only the <hi>divine dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction,</hi> or only <hi>that reprobate mind</hi> conſequent upon it; yet we muſt underſtand it of <hi>ſuch a reprobate mind,</hi> or <hi>ſuch a dereliction,</hi> as will certainly end in <hi>the damnation of hell;</hi> becauſe the apoſtle expreſsly tells us, [ver. 13.] that <hi>to the perſons under this condemnation is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>to this condemnation,</hi> he ſays, they were <hi>before of old ordained,</hi> or, as it is in the original, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>before of old written.</hi> That is, ſay ſome, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>concerning whom it was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009541_0007_0F768BCA4E1E8468"/>
before written.</hi> Thus they ſuppoſe it was in thoſe remarkable words of the apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Theſ. II. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>And then ſhall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming: Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, in them that periſh; becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved. And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> The ſame perſons they ſuppoſe to have been written of before by <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, when he ſays, 2 Pet. II. 1, 2, 3. <hi>There ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And many ſhall follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of. And through covetouſneſs ſhall they with feigned words make merchandiſe of you: whoſe judgment now of a long time lingreth not, and their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſlumbreth not.—</hi>Others again ſuppoſe, that the expreſſion refers to the words of our bleſſed Saviour recorded Matt. XXIV. 4, 5, 10, 11, 14. <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt: and ſhall deceive many. And then ſhall many be offended, and ſhall betray one another, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009541_0008_0F768BCC8B948DC8"/>
ſhall hate one another. And many falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall deceive many.—And this goſpel of the kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world, for a witneſs unto all nations, and then ſhall the end come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW tho' it be certain, that <hi>Peter</hi> (at leſt) had written before of theſe very perſons, and of their condemnation to eternal puniſhment; who are here ſaid to be <hi>before of old written to this condemnation:</hi> Yet I cannot perſwade myſelf, that they are ſaid to be before <hi>of old</hi> written to this condemnation, upon account of them and their condemnation's having been written of before by <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>any other apoſtle.</hi> For what had been written by <hi>Peter,</hi> or poſſibly by <hi>any other apoſtle,</hi> concerning theſe perſons, could not be ſaid to have been written <hi>of old,</hi> but <hi>of late,</hi> when <hi>Jude</hi> wrote this epiſtle.—More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>the propheſies which went before</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe perſons, and their condemnation, are manifeſtly ſpoken of as a thing diſtinct from their being <hi>before of old ordained</hi> or written <hi>to condemnation.</hi> For after the apoſtle hath ſaid, that the men who were <hi>crept in unawares, were before of old ordained to condemnation;</hi> he goes on to ſay, v. 14. <hi>And Enoch alſo the ſeventh from Adam propheſied of theſe.</hi> And then he proceeds, v. 17, 18, to put his <hi>beloved in remembrance of the words which were ſpoken before by the apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: How that they told them there ſhould be mockers in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly luſts. Theſe be they who ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009541_0009_0F768BCC955AA4F0"/>
—not having the ſpirit.</hi>—From all which it appears to me that their being <hi>before of old ordained</hi> or written <hi>to condemnation,</hi> muſt be underſtood according to the ſenſe, of perhaps the bigger and better part of proteſtant expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the laſt century, to refer, not to any thing which had been ſpoken or written about theſe perſons, either by prophets or apoſtles under the inſpiration of God; but to the determination of the divine mind concerning them, namely, to the decree of <hi>Reprobation</hi> (as it hath been called) which was <hi>before of old,</hi> even from the days of eternity.—This may ſuffice for the meaning of the <hi>Condemnation</hi> ſpoken of in my text; and of <hi>certain men's being before of old ordained to it.—</hi> The next thing to be conſidered is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE character of the perſons ordained to this condemnation.—</hi> And this is, <hi>ungodly men, turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> or as the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> propheſying of the ſame perſons expreſſes it, 2 Pet. ii. 1. <hi>Falſe teachers who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them.—</hi> The ſum of the matter then may be taken up in the two following propoſitions, namely,—</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT there are certain men from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ordained of God to condemnation.—</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THAT theſe are men of wicked lives, or damnably heretical principles, or both.—</hi> The great controverſy between the <hi>Supralapſarian Calviniſts</hi> and the <hi>Arminians</hi> concerning the <hi>decree of Reprobation,</hi> will fall in moſt naturally

to be diſcuſſed under the ſecond of theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. However it may not be amiſs, before I proceed to that, to ſpeak ſomething briefly to the firſt, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT there are certain men from eternity ordained of God to condemnation.—The election</hi> (ſays the apoſtle) <hi>hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded,</hi> or hardned. Rom. xi. 7. And again, Rom. ix. 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deſtruction.—</hi> The propoſition before us may be illuſtrated and prov'd under three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT ſome of mankind are certainly ordain'd of God to condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT this divine ordination is from eternity.—</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THAT the perſons ſo ordained to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are determined.—</hi> What I intend by each of theſe, I think will be almoſt allowed me by all parties, except <hi>Socinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt THEN, <hi>Some of mankind are certainly ordained of God to condemnation.—</hi> By <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> I intend <hi>eternal damnation</hi> itſelf; or that miſery which will be the everlaſting portion of them, who die in their ſins. By being <hi>ordained</hi> to this miſery or condemnation, I intend, that <hi>there is a determination of the divine will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it;</hi> that none drop into perdition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of God, or without his antecedently determining (in ſome ſenſe) <hi>that</hi> they ſhould. Not that the determination of the divine will is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009541_0011_0F768BCE1F6F7088"/>
either the moral or the phyſical cauſe of mens ſin and miſery. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> generally reject ſuch a thought as this. And I here only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a determination of the will of God, is neceſſarily antecedent to the condemnation of men; that ſince <hi>the kingdom of God ruleth over all,</hi> ſo that <hi>not a ſparrow falleth to the ground without him;</hi> much leſs can any of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures periſh, without his determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, at leaſt to permit that they ſhould.</p>
            <p>NOW it is certain that ſome of mankind ſhall be miſerable forever, from the expreſs words of our bleſſed Lord, Matt. xxv. 46. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment:</hi> And if ſome of mankind ſhall be miſerable forever, we muſt ſuppoſe they are antecedently ordained of God to this condemnation; or elſe we muſt ſuppoſe that God don't know of it before it happens; or laſtly, that tho' he knows of it, yet he is not able to prevent it. For if God knows of mens falling into condemnation before it happens; and could prevent it, if he thought fit; we muſt certainly conclude, that he determines not to prevent, but ſuffer it (which is all I intend by ordaining or writing it) or elſe it could never happen. Now that God knows of mens falling into condemnation before it happens is certain, from his foretelling of it: And it is no leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he could prevent it, if (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd) he judg'd it wiſeſt and beſt ſo to do; for all things are poſſible with him; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the hearts of all men are in his hands, and he can turn them whitherſoever he pleaſes. And
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009541_0012_0F768BCEE7768DE8"/>
therefore, it cannot but be allowed, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines not to prevent it; or in other words, by which I intend the ſame thing, that they who fall into condemnation, are ordained of God to it, not by an <hi>effective,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> by a <hi>permiſſive</hi> decree.—I proceed to ſay</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT this divine ordination is from eternity. Or that God hath from eternity deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to permit ſome of mankind to fall into condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE truth of this will appear undeniably from conſidering the perfection of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and power of God. For it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe that he, <hi>whoſe kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> and who is able to prevent what he pleaſes, ſhould know that any thing will come to paſs, which he does not at the ſame time determine to permit, and not to hinder. And therefore, ſince God did from eternity know of the falling of ſome of mankind into everlaſting condemnation, he muſt from eternity have determined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THE very perſons ſo ordained or written to condemnation are determined.—</hi> This likewiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from the certainty and exactneſs of the foreknowledge of God. For whether we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the decree of God to be antecedent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature to his foreknowledge, or his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge antecedent to his decree, (which it would be beſide my purpoſe to diſpute here) yet ſince he knows beforehand the very perſons, who will fall into condemnation; he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine beforehand, at leaſt to permit thoſe very perſons ſo to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:009541_0013_0F768BCF8FAE2CE8"/>UPON the whole, if ſome of mankind are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ordained, or written of God to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; if this divine ordination is from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if the very perſons ſo ordained or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to condemnation are determined; then it is true that there are certain men from eternity or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained or written of God to condemnation; which was my firſt propoſition.—I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at preſent, with juſt obſerving, <hi>that this doctrine, as I have explained it, is far from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God the author of thoſe ſins which he hath determined to puniſh everlaſtingly.—</hi> For the dimmeſt eye may ſee, that <q>they who affirm, that God hath from eternity <hi>decreed</hi> to <hi>permit</hi> thoſe ſins to be committed, which he certainly knew would be committed if he prevented them not; and that he accordingly does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, do not hereby make him the <hi>author</hi> of ſin. God's ſuffering his creatures to ſin, when it is in his power to hinder them, is not to be the author of ſin, nor is God in <hi>juſtice,</hi> or in <hi>mercy</hi> obliged to exert his power in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring perſons (in a ſtate of trial) from ſinning, tho' he knows they will ſin if he does not, and that their ſinning will bring ruin upon them.</q> If it was inconſiſtent with the <hi>juſtice</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi> of God, to leave creatures in <hi>a ſtate of trial,</hi> to exerciſe the freedom of their own wills, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the foreſeen event may be; it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, ever to put any of his creatures in <hi>a ſtate of trial for eternity.</hi>

            <head>PART II.</head>
            <p>IN the former part I propoſed to conſider the two following propoſitions, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT there are certain men, from eternity, ordain'd of God to condemnation.—</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THAT theſe are men of wicked lives, or damnably heretical principles, or both.—</hi> The firſt of theſe propoſitions, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT there are certain men, from eternity, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd of God to condemnation,</hi> hath been diſpatch'd. —By <hi>the condemnation</hi> to which theſe men are <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> I have explained my ſelf to mean, <hi>eternal damnation</hi> itſelf, or that miſery which will be the everlaſting portion of thoſe, who die in their ſins. —For whether <hi>this</hi> be the primary intention, or not, of the condemnation ſpoken of in my text; yet it is, at leaſt, <hi>ſuch a condemnation,</hi> as will certainly end in <hi>this;</hi> ſince the apoſtle tells us v. 13. that to the perſons under this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY being <hi>ordained of God to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I have ſaid that I intend, not that the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the divine will, is either the moral, or phyſical cauſe of mens ſin and miſery; but only, that a determination of the will of God, is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009541_0015_0F768BD10E03A580"/>
neceſſarily antecedent to the condemnation of men; that ſince <hi>the kingdom of God ruleth over all; ſo that not a ſparrow falleth to the ground without him;</hi> much leſs can any of his reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures periſh, without God's determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, at leſt to permit that they ſhould. <note n="*" place="bottom">Bſhp. Burnet's Exp. P. 160.</note>
               <q>Things which happen thus, under a permiſſive and directing providence, are aſcrib'd in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the will and counſel of God. For a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive</hi> and directing will, is as really a will, as an <hi>effective</hi> one; tho' it be not alike cauſal.</q> And what comes to paſs according to it, may therefore, in ſome ſenſe, be ſaid to be <hi>ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>divine ordination,</hi> I have proved to be <hi>from eternity;</hi> and that it reaches to <hi>the very individual perſons,</hi> who ſhall <hi>go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment,</hi> upon the judicial ſentence of the great day.—I proceed now to the ſecond propoſition, which is</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THAT they who are thus ordained of God to condemnation, are men of wicked lives, or damnably heretical principles, or both.—</hi> My text calls them <hi>ungodly men, turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> propheſying of the ſame perſons, tells us, that <hi>they ſhall privily bring in damnable hereſies.</hi> 2 Pet. II. 1. So that the perſons, whom my text immediately refers to, were both ungodly in life, and damnably heretical in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And one, or the other, or both of theſe, is certainly the caſe of all, who were before of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009541_0016_0F768BD29C36C358"/>
old ordained of God to condemnation. But here the great queſtion ariſes, upon which the controverſy about the doctrine of reprobation very much turns, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether God hath ordained certain men to condemnation upon a foreſight of their ungodlineſs and infidelity? or whether the ungodlineſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of men are in conſequence of their having been before of old ordained to condemnation, and follow ſuch ordination neceſſarily?—</hi> The <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> maintain the former, the <hi>Supralapſarian Calviniſts</hi> the latter; and both of them go great lengths in the proſecution of their oppoſite ſchemes. The <hi>Sublapſarian Calviniſts</hi> take a middle way, which (to me at leaſt) appears to be much more agreeable to the ſcriptures, and to our natural notions of the divine perfections; and to be free from the principal difficulties, with which the two other ſchemes are encumbred.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> then affirm, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God is in order of nature antecedent to his foreknowledge, and that his foreknowledge is founded in it; that the will of God is <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally efficacious,</hi> and is the firſt cauſe of all things; that if the reaſon of the being of things be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up to the top, we ſhall find it in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; that there are a vaſt company of poſſible beings in the knowledge or underſtanding of God; and that the decree appoints which of them ſhall be; and therefore by the decree they paſs from poſſibility to futurition!<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Willard, p. 102, 103.</note>—And in conſequence of theſe poſitions they affirm, that God does by an efficacious power and influence
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009541_0017_0F768BD352F52A28"/>
move and praedetermine men, unto all their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions, even thoſe that have ſin inſeparably annexed to them; that he ſecretly, but effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inclines and applies the wills of men to the entative acts of ſuch things.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. GALE's Court of the Gentiles, Part 4th, p. 27, 73.</note> And to avoid the conſequence of making God the author of ſin, they make a diſtinction between <hi>the poſitive act of ſin,</hi> which they ſay is not evil; and <hi>the want of its conformity to the law of God,</hi> which being a negation, is no poſitive being; ſo that it is not produced. And thus, tho' the action is produced jointly by God as the firſt cauſe, and by the creature as the ſecond, yet God is not guilty of ſin, but only the creature.<note n="†" place="bottom">BURNET's Expoſi. p. 147.</note>— To this the <hi>Arminians</hi> reply,</p>
            <p>THAT as for that <hi>nicety</hi> of ſaying that the evil of ſin conſiſts in a negation, which is not a poſitive being, ſo that tho' God ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine men to the action which is ſinful; yet he is not concerned in the ſin of it: They think it is too metaphyſical, to put the honour of God and his attributes upon ſuch a ſubtlety. For in ſins againſt moral laws, there ſeems to be an antecedent immorality in the action itſelf, which is inſeparable from it.—But ſuppoſing that ſin conſiſted in a negative, yet that privation does immediately and neceſſarily reſult out of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any other thing whatſoever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. So that if God does infallibly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a ſinner to commit the action to which that guilt belongs, tho' that ſhould be a ſin, only by reaſon of a privation, which is dependent on it;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009541_0018_0F768BD412C3B600"/>
yet it does not appear but that he is really the author of ſin; ſince if he is the author of the ſinful action, on which the ſin depends as a ſhadow on its ſubſtance, he muſt be eſteemed (ſay they) the author of the ſin, if this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis be true.—And tho' it may be ſaid, that ſin being a violation of God's law, he himſelf, who is not bound by his law, cannot be guilty of ſin; yet an action which is immoral, is ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially oppoſite to infinite perfection, that God cannot be capable of it; as being a contradiction to his own nature. Nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that he can damn men for that, which is the neceſſary reſult of an action, to which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf determined them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. BURNET's Expoſi. p. 161.</note>—Thus the <hi>Arminians</hi> object to the hypotheſis of their adverſaries.</p>
            <p>And <hi>others,</hi> who are far from being <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> yet think, that the doctrines of <hi>efficacious permiſſion,</hi> and <hi>praedeterminative</hi> concourſe to actions intrinſically evil (which two notions ſeem inſeparably twiſted with the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> ſcheme) are both of them founded upon <hi>falſe principles,</hi> and attended with <hi>conſequences</hi> too ſhocking to be endured.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>true principles</hi> (ſay they) upon which theſe notions ſeem to be founded, are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT God cannot form a creature with a power of moving itſelf, and determining any of its own actions; without his efficacious power and influence, firſt moving and praedetermining it to the ſubſtrate matter of them.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THAT it is impoſſible he ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know any action of a free agent, but what he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009541_0019_0F768BD4CFD8A7E8"/>
hath determined ſecretly and effectually to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and apply its will to the performance of.—</hi> Now the <hi>former of theſe principles</hi> (ſay they) cannot be true, becauſe it deſtroys the diſtinction between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> agents; and brings all the operations of the <hi>latter,</hi> under laws of equal neceſſity with thoſe, according to which the motions of the <hi>former</hi> are excited.— Nor is <hi>the latter principle</hi> any more neceſſary to be admitted. For tho' it be readily granted, that God's praeſcience of things future is ſo far founded on his decree, as that it is impoſſible he ſhould know any thing as future, but what he hath determined either to effect or permit; yet it won't from hence follow, that he cannot foreknow any action of a free agent, but what he hath determined ſecretly and effectually to incline and apply its will to the performance of. For it is evident from the ſcriptures, that God not only knows what <hi>poſſibly might,</hi> but even what <hi>certainly would</hi> have been determined by free agents, if the antecedent courſe of things had been otherwiſe diſpoſed than it was. He anſwered <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Saul would come to Keilah,</hi> and that <hi>the men of Keilah would deliver him up.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. XXIII. 11.12.</note> And yet both the one and the other was upon condition of his ſtaying there; and he going from thence, neither the one nor the other ever happened. So God knew, that <hi>if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in Chorazin and Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida, they would have repented in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> And that, <hi>if the mighty works which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009541_0020_0F768BD5C92FCE80"/>
were done in Capernaum, had been done even in Sodom, it would have remained to our Saviour's day.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. XI. 21, 23.</note>—Now if his knowledge reaches to ſuch things as theſe, which never happen; it can't be thought ſtrange, that it ſhould reach to ſuch determinations as do happen, even where he don't exert his own power to lead men into them. And therefore, from God's foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and permiſſive decree, we can never infer, that he does by an <hi>efficacious influence</hi> move and determine men to all their actions; even to thoſe which have ſin inſeparably annexed to them.—But this may ſuffice for the <hi>principles</hi> upon which the doctrines of <hi>efficacious permiſſion</hi> and <hi>praedeterminative concourſe</hi> to evil actions are ſuppoſed to be founded.</p>
            <p>AS for the <hi>ſhocking conſequences,</hi> with which they are thought, by <hi>others beſide Arminians,</hi> to be chargeable, I ſhall repreſent ſome of them in the words of the learned and judicious Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. II. P. 501.</note> which are better than any of my own. Theſe ſentiments (ſays he) muſt, I conceive to an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial underſtanding, leave it no way ſufficiently explicable; how the influence and concurrence which the holy God hath to the worſt of actions, is to be diſtinguiſhed from that which he affords to the beſt; or wherein ſuch inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evil actions are leſs to be imputed to him, who forbids them; than to the malicious temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who prompts to them; or the actor who does them; or wherein not a great deal more. And they leave it undeniable, that the matter of his laws to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, was an utter
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009541_0021_0F768BD665A36FE0"/>
impoſſibility; nothing being more apparently ſo, than either not to do an action, whereto the agent is determined by an infinite power; or to ſeparate the malignity thereof, from an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically evil action. And this <hi>utter impoſſibility of not ſinning,</hi> was the ineluctable fate of his (at firſt) innocent creatures; who muſt alſo (upon this hypotheſis) be underſtood to be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverſibly condemned to the ſuffering of eternal puniſhment, for the doing of what it was (upon theſe terms) ſo abſolutely impoſſible to them to avoid.—Theſe conſequences (if juſtly drawn from the doctrines abovementioned, as I think they are) muſt be ſufficient to ſatisfy any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man, that thoſe doctrines cannot be true. Indeed, I know very well, that the maintainers of the doctrines reject and abhor theſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; but the queſtion is, whether they have ever yet been able, with all the nice diſtinctions, and metaphyſical ſubtleties, which they make uſe of upon this occaſion, ſatisfactorily to clear themſelves from them. For fear, as it ſeems, of theſe difficulties in the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> ſcheme, the <hi>Arminians</hi> go into extremes on the other hand, which I ſhall give ſome account of in the next part.</p>

I have expreſſed it moſtly in their own words, as it is ſet down by the learned and catholic-ſpirited Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> who was in the main on their ſide of the queſtion; and therefore may very well be ſuppoſed to have ſtated their notions truely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009541_0024_0F768BD893399D98"/>I SHALL now go on to collect pretty much from the ſame learned writer, the objections of the <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> to theſe things. For it muſt be allowed, that he hath ſet forth the principles, arguments and objections of the <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> as well as <hi>Arminians,</hi> with great clearneſs, and ſtrength, and ſpirit.— However, I cannot help remarking, that (by what means ſoever it came to paſs) he hath not done the like juſtice to the <hi>Sublapſarian ſcheme;</hi> but hath ſet <hi>that</hi> in a weak imperfect light, and placed the maintainers of it between the two other contending parties, as well-meaning men, who have but very little to ſay for themſelves. Whether this be their caſe will appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> then reply to the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> above, that there can be no certain preſcience of future contingencies; that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction, that things which are not certainly to be, ſhould be certainly foreſeen; for if they are certainly foreſeen, they muſt certainly be: So while they are ſuppoſed to be contingent, they are yet affirmed to be certain, by ſaying that they are certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. When God decrees that any thing ſhall be, it hath from that a certain futurition, and as ſuch it is certainly foreſeen by him. An uncertain foreſight is an act in its nature imperfect, becauſe it may be a miſtake, and ſo is inconſiſtent with the divine perfections. And it ſeems to imply a contradiction to ſay that a thing happens freely, that is, may be, or
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009541_0025_0F768BD954B65288"/>
may not be, and yet that it is certainly foreſeen by God. God (ſay they) cannot foreſee things, but as he decrees them, and ſo gives them a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, and therefore this preſcience antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his decree, muſt be rejected as a thing impoſſible.</p>
            <p>THEY ſay further, that decrees upon a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of what men will do, if they did not involve any contradictions are yet imperfect in their nature, and ſubject the will and acts of God to a creature, and ſo are inconſiſtent with the independency of the nature and will of God. And that ſuch a conditionate decree is an act in ſuſpenſe, whether it ſhall be or not, and therefore inconſiſtent with infinite perfection.</p>
            <p>AND as to what the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inefficacy and reſiſtibleneſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, they object, that the ſcriptures teach us every where to offer up all praiſe and glory to God; to acknowledge that all is of him, and to humble ourſelves, as being nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Now if we were elected, not by a free act of his, but by what he foreſaw that we would be; ſo that his grace is not effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious by its own force, but by the good uſe that we make of it; then the glory and praiſe of all the good we do, and of God's kind pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to us, were due to ourſelves. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, according to the other doctrine, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well to all men; and all the difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them will ariſe neither from God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to them, nor from his aſſiſtances; but
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009541_0026_0F768BDA106FD708"/>
from the good uſe that he foreſaw they would make of theſe favours, which he was to give in common to all mankind. Man ſhould have whereof to glory, and he might ſay, that <hi>he made himſelf to differ from others.</hi> The whole ſtrain of the ſcripture in aſcribing all good things to God, and in charging us to offer up the Honour of all to him, ſeems very expreſsly againſt ſuch doctrine; ſince if all our good is from God, and is particularly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his grace; then good men have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from God, which bad men have not, for which they ought to praiſe him. The ſtyle of all the prayers that are uſed, or direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be uſed in the ſcriptures, is for a grace that <hi>opens our eyes,</hi> that <hi>turns our hearts,</hi> that <hi>makes us to go,</hi> that <hi>leads us not into temptation, but delivers us from evil:</hi> All theſe phraſes do plainly import, that we deſire more than ſuch a power or capacity to act, as is given to <hi>all men;</hi> and ſuch, as after we have received it, may ſtill be ineffectual to us. For to pray for ſuch aſſiſtances, as are always given to all men, and are ſuch that the whole good of them ſhall wholly depend upon ourſelves, would ſound very odly; whereas in truth we pray for <hi>ſomething that is ſpecial,</hi> and <hi>that we hope ſhall be effectual.</hi> We do not, we cannot pray in earneſt for that, which we know all men, as well as we ourſelves, have at all times. Humility and earneſtneſs in prayer ſeem to be among the chief means of working in us the image of Chriſt, and of deriving to us all
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009541_0027_0F768BDAE61BDC00"/>
the bleſſings of heaven. That doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which blaſts both, which ſwells us up with an opinion, that all which is <hi>peculiar</hi> comes from ourſelves, and that we receive nothing from God, but what is given in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us to all the world, is certainly contrary both to the ſpirit and deſign of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>THE grace of God in ſcripture is ſet forth by ſuch figures and expreſſions, as do plainly intimate its <hi>efficacy;</hi> and that it does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on us to uſe it, or not to uſe it, at our pleaſure. It is ſaid to be a creation, <hi>We are created unto good works,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. II. 10.</note> and <hi>we become new creatures.</hi>

            <p>AFTER all, they think, that if a debate falls to be between the ſovereignty, acts and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009541_0028_0F768BDBF93D8C98"/>
purpoſes of God, and the freedom of man's will; it is modeſt and decent, rather to make the abatement on man's part, than on God's; but they think there is no need of this. They maintain, that beſide the outward enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a man by knowledge, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enlightning of the mind, and a ſecret forcible conviction ſtamped on it. Otherwiſe what can be meant by the prayer of <hi>Paul</hi> for the Epheſians, who had already heard the goſpel preached, and were inſtructed in it; <hi>That the eyes of their underſtanding being enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they might know what was the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the ſaints: and what was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of his power towards them that believe.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. I. 17, 18, 19.</note> This ſeems to be ſomewhat that is both internal and efficacious.</p>
            <p>IN fine, Chriſt compares the union and influence that he communicates to believers, to the union of an head with its members, and of a root with its branches; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an internal, a vital, and an efficacious influence. And tho' the outward means that are offered, may be, and always are rejected, when not accompanied with this overcoming grace; yet <hi>this</hi> never returns empty. Theſe outward means coming from God, the reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them is ſaid to be a <hi>reſiſting God;</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts VII. 51.</note> and <hi>grieving</hi> or <hi>quenching his ſpirit;</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. IV. 30.</note> and ſo in that ſenſe we may reſiſt the grace or favour of God; but we can never withſtand him when he intends to overcome us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:009541_0029_0F768BDC4EC324F0"/>BUT this may ſuffice for the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> objections againſt that part of the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſcheme which relates to the queſtion under conſideration.</p>
            <p>AND now upon a view of each ſcheme, and the objections which lie againſt it, it is obvious to remark,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT the Objections of both ſides againſt ſome part of the ſcheme of their opponents, are difficult, if not impoſſible to be anſwered; which is at leaſt a ſtrong preſumption, that there are ſome things amiſs in both ſchemes.</hi> The <hi>Supralap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarian</hi> objections againſt an election upon a foreſight of faith and good works; and their arguments for the freedom, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of divine grace (at leaſt in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) ſeem to be of great force, if not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible. Nor is there leſs weight, on the other hand, in what the <hi>Arminians</hi> and others object, againſt God's concurring immediately by a determinative influence to the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of intrinſically evil actions. And this leads me to obſerve what ſeems to me to be the fundamental miſtake of both parties in the point before us, which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they are both agreed in joining ſome things together, which have no connection with each other in the nature of them, and which the ſcriptures have ſet far aſunder.</hi> Or in other words, They are both agreed that <hi>election</hi> and <hi>reprobation</hi> muſt be ſet upon much the ſame foot. And that men muſt be much alike free, or much
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009541_0030_0F768BDD0ECFC368"/>
alike determined, to all their actions, whether good or evil. And their agreement in theſe two points, neceſſarily keeps them at ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſagreement in almoſt all others. Thus for inſtance, the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it to be impoſſible, that the <hi>elect</hi> ſhould be <hi>choſen of God</hi> upon a foreſight of their <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>good works;</hi> and partly for that reaſon thinks it to be impoſſible alſo, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſhould be <hi>ordained to condemnation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a foreſight of their <hi>wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>infidelity.</hi> Whereas, on the other ſide, the <hi>Arminian</hi> can never perſuade himſelf, that God would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain <hi>any to condemnation</hi> otherwiſe than upon a foreſight of their <hi>wickedneſs</hi> or <hi>infidelity;</hi> and therefore he concludes, that neither does he <hi>elect any to everlaſting life,</hi> but upon a foreſight of their <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> And ſo again, the <hi>Supralapſarian,</hi> that he may the more effectually maintain the <hi>determining efficacy of divine grace,</hi> affirms that <hi>men are</hi> determined to the ſubſtrate matter of all <hi>their actions, even thoſe that are intrinſically evil.</hi> This the <hi>Arminian</hi> thinks is to <hi>make God the author of ſin,</hi> and yet ſeems to allow it to be true upon a ſuppoſition of <hi>the determinative efficacy of grace,</hi> and therefore is forced to <hi>deny that,</hi> and to maintain what the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> thinks equivalent to ſaying, that it is <hi>not God,</hi> but <hi>men,</hi> that <hi>make themſelves to differ.</hi> And thus from an unhappy agreement in a falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal or two, they are led into an endleſs oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to each other in many other points.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009541_0031_0F768BDE8DE92070"/>BUT now the ſcriptures take a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe in treating of the moral good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which is in us, or done by us; aſcribing the one to God, and imputing the other to ourſelves; teaching us to aſcribe the honour of all that is good to God, and to caſt the blame of all that is evil on ourſelves; from whence we have the higheſt reaſon to conclude, that God hath not the ſame influence and cauſality in the one, which he hath in the other.</p>

            <head>PART IV.</head>
            <p>THE very oppoſite ſchemes of the <hi>Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> have both been conſidered in the foregoing parts, together with ſome of the difficulties wherewith the two contending parties mutually preſs each other. My buſineſs will now be to exhibit the hypotheſis of the <hi>Sublapſarians,</hi> ſo far as it relates to the queſtion under conſideration, and examine how far it eſcapes the difficulties which attend and perplex either one or t'other of the other ſchemes.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> then maintain,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Supralapſarian doctrine of God's concurring immediately, by a determinative influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the production of all the actions of men, whether good or evil, ought not to be admitted.—</hi> For, they ſay, this doctrine ſuppoſes, that God cannot form a creature with a power of moving itſelf, and determining any of its own
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009541_0032_0F768BDFD189DA58"/>
actions, without his efficacious power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence firſt moving and predetermining it to the matter of them; that this highly reflects on the wiſdom and power of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely takes away the very poſſibility of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing divine juſtice; it being utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that any creature ſhould be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of rewards and puniſhments, which neither hath, nor ever had, or could have, a power of determining any of its own actions. That this doctrine alſo deſtroys the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> agents, and brings all the operations of the <hi>latter,</hi> under laws of equal neceſſity with thoſe, according to which the motions of the <hi>former</hi> are exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if what we call voluntary agents are efficaciouſly determined by God to all their operations, then they can no more refrain from doing what they do, than the fire can ceaſe from burning, when it is ſupplied with proper fewel, and fanned with ſufficient air.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sublapſarian Calviniſts</hi> farther alledge, <hi>that this doctrine of being determined by God to all our actions is</hi> AN UTTER STRANGER TO ANTIQUITY. That it was firſt ſtarted by <hi>Aquinas</hi> in the thirteenth century. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was in general held, that the <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of God extended itſelf to all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: <hi>He thought</hi> this was done by God's <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring immediately</hi> to the production of every thought, action, motion, or mode; ſo that God was the firſt and immediate cauſe of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009541_0033_0F768BE013FFA4E8"/>
every thing that was done. And in order to the explaining of the joint production of every thing by God as the FIRST, and by the creatures as the <hi>ſecond cauſe,</hi> he taught (at leaſt ſo his followers have underſtood him) that by a phyſical influence the will was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by God to all things whether good or bad; ſo that the will could not be ſaid to be free in that particular inſtance <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> tho' it was in general ſtill free in all its actions <hi>in ſenſu diviſo:</hi> A diſtinction ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and ſo much uſed among them (as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> obſerves) that I chuſe to give it in their own terms, rather than tranſlate, or attempt to explain them. This paſſed down among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> who were of <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s own order; and hath ſince been received by the <hi>Supralapſarian Calviniſts</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but neither one nor t'other can pretend to any earlier author for it than <hi>Aquinas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR do the SCRIPTURES know any more of this doctrine than the <hi>Fathers</hi> do. Indeed the ſcriptures teach us, that <hi>in God we live and move, Acts</hi> 17.28. But this can't intend, that God <hi>excites</hi> and <hi>determines</hi> all our motions; for that would make <hi>Him</hi> much more the author of the worſt of our actions, than <hi>we</hi> ourſelves are: And therefore the meaning can only be, that as God at firſt gives us a power of mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo he continually ſupports and preſerves that power in all its exerciſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009541_0034_0F768BE0D6FB0E80"/>TO conclude,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> Vol. II. p. 531.</note> the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> aſſert more to be neceſſary to actions, to which men are wickedly diſinclined; but that leſs will ſuffice for their doing of actions, to which they have inclination more than enough. They reckon it ſufficient to the production of actions of this latter ſort, that a man's powers be actually habile, and apt for any ſuch action in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as is con-natural to them, ſuppoſing there be not a peccant averſion; as there is to all thoſe actions, which are holy and ſpiritual; which averſion a more potent (even a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative) influence, may be often neceſſary to overcome. They explain themſelves by inſtance thus,</p>
            <p>A MAN hath from God the powers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his nature, by which he is capable of loving or hating any apprehended good or evil. Theſe powers being by a preſent divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence rendered habile, and apt for action, he can now love a good name, health, eaſe, life; and hate diſgrace, ſickneſs, pain, death; but he does alſo by theſe powers thus habilitated for action, love wickedneſs and hate God. They ſay now, that to <hi>theſe former acts</hi> God ſhould over and beſides determine him, is not abſolutely and always neceſſary; and to the <hi>latter</hi> it is impoſſible. But that to hate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>univerſally,</hi> and <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and to love God, the depravedneſs of his nature by the apoſtacy, hath made the determinative influence of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009541_0035_0F768BE1B4A1ADB8"/>
grace often, if not always neceſſary; which therefore he hath indiſpenſable obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (nor is deſtitute of ſufficient encouragement) moſt earneſtly to implore and pray for.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Sublapſarians,</hi> while with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> they utterly deny any <hi>determinative</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence to evil actions, do at the ſame time with the <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> earneſtly maintain the <hi>efficacy</hi> of divine grace, whenever God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the neceſſity of its influence in order to our being and doing good. And in this way they think they ſecure the holineſs, juſtice, and goodneſs of God from the leaſt imputation; and yet render all due honour to the freedom and efficacy of his grace. Nor do they at all exempt man hereby, from his dependence on the will and providence of God.

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009541_0036_0F768BE26501C140"/>TO conclude, by maintaining always the neceſſity, and whenever God pleaſes, the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his grace,</hi> and denying a <hi>determinative</hi> influence to evil actions, the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend they avoid the difficulties with which both the other ſchemes are preſſed, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining both, or denying both.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to ſay, that in conſequence of the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> denying that men are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly determined by God to all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even thoſe which have ſin inſeparably annexed to them, they are obliged to maintain,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT God foreknows what rational a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents will do, <hi>when he thinks fit to leave them entirely to the freedom of their own wills, without interpoſing his own power to determine them one way or the other.</hi> This principle neceſſarily follows from the former; for if God does not determine men to their ſinful actions, he muſt either foreknow what they will do, when he don't determine them, or elſe he muſt be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant beforehand of a great part of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mankind.</p>
            <p>'TIS true it is not eaſy to ſhew how thoſe future contingencies, which depend upon the free choice of the will, ſhould be certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Expoſition, p. 158.</note> but we are from ſufficient evidence perſwaded that it is ſo. For we ſee thro' the whole ſcriptures a thread of very poſitive propheſies, the accompliſhment whereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the free will of men; and theſe predictions, as they were made very preciſely,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009541_0037_0F768BE351738F50"/>
ſo they were no leſs punctually accompliſhed. Not to mention any other propheſies, all thoſe which relate to the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, were fulfilled by the <hi>free acts</hi> of the prieſts and people of the <hi>Jews:</hi> They ſinned in doing it, which proves that they acted in it with their natural liberty. By theſe, and all the other propheſies, which are in both teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it muſt be confeſſed, that theſe things were certainly foreknown, but where to found that certainty, cannot eaſily be reſolved. Nor is it of any importance, whether we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, or no. The infinite perfection of the divine mind ought here to ſilence all objections. A clear idea by which we apprehend a thing to be plainly contrary to the attributes of God, is indeed ſufficient ground to reject it. And therefore they think they are in the right to deny that God efficaciouſly determines men to ſinful actions, becauſe they apprehend it to be plainly contrary to juſtice, goodneſs and holineſs: But if the objection againſt any thing ſuppoſed to be in God, lies only againſt the manner, and the unconceivableneſs of it, there the infinite perfection of God anſwers all.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Howe,</hi> Vol. II. p. 504.</note> It cannot therefore be ſo frightful a thing, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God's foreknowledge of the moſt contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent future actions, well to conſiſt with our ignorance how he foreknows them; as that we ſhould think it neceſſary to over turn and mingle heaven and earth, rather than admit it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:009541_0038_0F768BE3CF71B470"/>IT is further to be conſidered, <note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Expoſition, p. 159.</note> that this preſcience does not make the effects certain, becauſe they are foreſeen; but they are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen becauſe that they are to be: So that the certainty of the preſcience is not antecedent or cauſal, but ſubſequent and eventual.— Whatſoever happens was future before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; and ſince it happened, it was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly future from all eternity; not by a certainty of fate; but by a certainty which ariſes out of its being once; from which this truth, that it was future, was eternally certain: Therefore the divine preſcience being only the knowing all things which were to come, it does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a neceſſity of cauſality.</p>
            <p>THE ſcripture plainly ſhews on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>a conditionate preſcience,</hi> as in the caſe of the men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> of <hi>Tire and Sidan, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Since then this preſcience may be ſo certain, that it never can be miſtaken, nor miſguide the deſigns and providence of God; and ſince by this, both the attributes of God are vindicated, and the undetermined freedom of the will of man to ſin is aſſerted, all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſeem to be eaſily cleared this way.</p>
            <p>THEY further add, that God having made man a free creature, his governing him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and making his own adminiſtration of the world ſuitable to it, is no diminution of his own authority; it is only carrying on of his own creation, according to the ſeveral natures which he hath put in that variety of beings,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009541_0039_0F768BE56141A818"/>
of which this world is compoſed, and with which it is diverſified. Therefore if ſome of the acts of God, with relation to man, are not ſo abſolute as his other acts are, and as the <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> ſuppoſe neceſſary to the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate perfection of an independent being; this ariſes not from any defect in the acts of God; but becauſe the nature of the creature, which he intended to make free, is inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch acts.</p>
            <p>THE divine omnipotence is not leſſened when we obſerve ſome of God's works to be more beautiful and uſeful than others are: And the irregular productions of nature do not derogate from the order in which all things appear lovely to the divine mind. So if that liberty with which God intended to endue thinking beings, is incompatible with ſuch poſitive acts, and ſo poſitive a providence as governs natural things, and this material world; then this is no way derogatory to the ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his mind. This alſo gives ſuch an account of the evil which is in the world, as does no way accuſe or leſſen the purity and holineſs of God: Since he only ſuffers his creatures to go on in the free uſe of the powers which he hath given them; about which he exerciſes a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence, making ſome men's ſins to be the immediate puniſhment of their own, or of other men's ſins; and reſtraining them often in a great deal of that evil which they do deſign, and bringing out of it a great deal of good,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009541_0040_0F768BE622CA1508"/>
which they did not deſign; but never effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly determining them to deſign or act ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.<note n="*" place="bottom">N. B. Moſt of what is above extracted from Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> is by him urged in the name of the <hi>Arminians.</hi> But forasmuch as the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> (at leaſt the more moderate of them) agree in theſe things with the <hi>Arminians;</hi> what is here alleged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſerved <hi>them,</hi> and accordingly I have ſo improved it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THUS far the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> evidently both admit and reject ſomething of the ſchemes of both the other parties, and think that by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo they come nearer to the truth than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, and avoid the principal difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which attend them both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THEY <hi>maintain that God's foreknowledge of futurities is always ſubſequent to his decree; but that his decree does not give a futurition to many things that come to paſs.</hi> They readily grant to the <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> that there are a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>poſſible beings</hi> in the knowledge or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God; and that the decree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points which of them ſhall be, and which ſhall not: for ſince the kingdom of God ruleth over all, ſo that not a ſparrow falleth to the ground without him; it is impoſſible that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhould ever come to paſs, but what God is pleaſed, if not to <hi>effect,</hi> yet at leaſt to <hi>permit.</hi> And if nothing can come to paſs without the divine <hi>permiſſion,</hi> then nothing can be known <hi>as future,</hi> but what God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, at leaſt <hi>to permit to be ſo,</hi> and ſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God will in all caſes be founded either in his <hi>effective</hi> or <hi>permiſſive</hi> decree, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009541_0041_0F768BE6D1186B48"/>
be ſubſequent unto it: For it is impoſſible, that he who is able to prevent what he pleaſes, ſhould know a thing will <hi>actually</hi> come to paſs, without having firſt determined, at leaſt, not to prevent it. And yet this is far from proving, that his decree gives a futurition to whatſoever comes to paſs. For if the knowledge of God reaches to what rational agents will do, when he thinks fit to leave them entirely to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their own wills, without interpoſing <hi>his</hi> power to determine them one way or other; then there will be no need to ſuppoſe, that the decree of God gives futurition to all things whatſoever, becauſe the certainty of the futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of many things, may then be reſolved into the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the knowledge of God, and not into the <hi>efficacy</hi> of his decree.— Again, if God often does think fit to leave rational a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents entirely to the freedom of their own wills, and be ſure never interpoſes his power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them to intrinſically evil actions; then we muſt ſuppoſe, that many things come to paſs, which the decree does not give futurition to. For the <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> themſelves don't ſuppoſe the decree to be the cauſe of the futurition of any thing, but what God in conſequence of his decree, <hi>efficaciouſly determines</hi> his creatures to, in the courſe of his providence.</p>
            <p>IN a word, both <hi>Supra</hi> and <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> are agreed, to diſtinguiſh the decrees of God into <hi>effective</hi> and <hi>permiſſive.</hi> The <hi>effective</hi> decree (ſay the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi>) puts a certain futurition
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009541_0042_0F768BE7A758B160"/>
into things; but the <hi>permiſſive</hi> does not ſo. The <hi>effective</hi> decree may reſpect both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral good;</hi> the <hi>permiſſive</hi> decree principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>moral evil,</hi> which God does not, either immediately or mediately, <hi>effect</hi> by his own power; but only <hi>permits</hi> to the power of his creatures: having thought fit, for wiſe reaſons, not always to hinder them (tho' many times he does) from abuſing the powers he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for better purpoſes, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it.—This diſtinction between an <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> and <hi>permiſſive</hi> decree, they think, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>a diſtinction without a difference,</hi> by the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pralapſarian</hi> doctrines of <hi>efficacious permiſſion,</hi> and <hi>predeterminative concourſe</hi> to actions intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally evil; that God does by an efficacious power and influence move and predetermine men unto all their actions, even to ſuch as have ſin inſeparably annexed to them; that he does ſecretly, but effectually, incline and apply the wills of men to the entative acts of ſuch things. For if theſe doctrines be true, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians</hi> think it will follow, that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God are <hi>alike abſolute and effective.</hi> Not to repeat here, that they think theſe doctrines to be founded upon <hi>falſe principles,</hi> and to be neceſſarily attended with <hi>conſequences too ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be endured;</hi> their reaſons for both which I have given before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THEY <hi>maintain, that the ordaining of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men from eternity to condemnation was upon a foreſight of their ungodlineſs and infidelity; tho'
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009541_0043_0F768BE84FDF00E8"/>
on the other hand, they deny that any were elected to everlaſting life, upon a foreſight of their faith and obedience.</hi> Theſe two things they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in their own nature to ſtand upon as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent a foo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as poſſible; and to be every-where ſo repreſented in the ſcriptures. They think the ſcriptures all along repreſent the deſtruction of man to be of himſelf; and never intimate his being determined by divine influence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil action. And they think it clear from ſcripture, that God knows what men will do, when left entirely to the freedom of their own wills: from whence they conclude, that God foreſaw the apoſtaſy of man, if left to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own will, and thought fit ſo to leave him; and that he foreſaw the corruption which would follow upon the apoſtaſy, that the wickedneſs of man would be great in the earth, and every imagination of the tho'ts of his heart evil, and determin'd not to hinder it: but ordained certain men to that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which he foreſaw they would deſerve by their ſins.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS of his meer good pleaſure he elected others, whom he foreſaw would be alike involv'd in ſin and guilt, to eternal life; and entered into a covenant of grace, to deliver them out of that ſtate of ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and to bring them into a ſtate of ſalvation by a redeemer. Now forasmuch as they who are thus elected to everlaſting life, are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be really involved in ſin and guilt with
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009541_0044_0F768BE9197C75B8"/>
the reſt; and forasmuch as the ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent eternal life itſelf, and all the things which <hi>immediately</hi> qualify and prepare men for it, ſuch as <hi>faith, repentance</hi> and <hi>new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to be not of men themſelves, but the Gifts of God: therefore the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> think it impoſſible that any ſhould be elected to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, upon a foreſight of their faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. For (ſay they) men cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected upon a foreſight of thoſe things, which they would never have, if God had not tho't fit of his good pleaſure to beſtow them on them. So that while the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> maintain, that certain men are ordained to condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a foreſight of their wickedneſs and unbelief, they at the ſame time reſolve the election of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers principally into the good pleaſure of the divine will. And in keeping this middle-way, they think they both follow the guidance of the ſcriptures, which always teach us to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate no good to ourſelves, and do impute no moral evil to God; and that they alſo ſecure the honor of all the divine attributes. For, on the one hand, no man can reaſonably complain, either that he is left to the freedom of his own will, or that he is ordained to ſuch condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as God foreſaw he would deſerve, by his abuſe of that freedom. Nor ought any man's eye to be evil, becauſe God's eye is good. For may he not do what he pleaſes with his own? And, if he thinks fit, may he not beſtow <hi>that</hi> grace and favor upon ſome, which none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009541_0045_0F768BE9D5330C38"/>
and which he might juſtly have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from all?—And again, on the other hand, what man can glory in the preſence of the Lord, when the great things in which he is not as other men, are not of himſelf; but are the gifts of God?</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to ſay in the laſt place, that tho' the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> hold, that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained certain men to condemnation upon a foreſight of their ungodlineſs and infidelity, yet they maintain,</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT <hi>ungodlineſs and infidelity foreſeen are not the proper cauſes, but only the antecedent conditions of reprobation.</hi> Thus the celebrated <hi>Turrettine</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. p 422</note> repreſents their ſentiments, <hi>Si obſolutè conſideratur reprobatio rectè adſcribitur corruptioni hominis nativae, quae eum effecit juſtè reprobabilem: ſi verò comparatè, ad ſolum Dei beneplacitum,</hi> &amp;c. <q>If (ſays he) Reprobation be conſidered <hi>abſolutely,</hi> it is juſtly aſcribed to man's native corruption, which hath rendered him a proper object of it; but if it be conſidered <hi>comparatively,</hi> it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved entirely into the good pleaſure of God, who according to his ſovereign right and freedom, chooſes whom he will and paſſes by the reſt.

all muſt have been reprobated, who were alike ſinners; but it is a condition or antecedent quality, by which a man becomes a proper object of reprobation: Or it is a cauſe <hi>ſine qua non;</hi> for if a man had not been a ſinner, he had not been reprobated of God; tho' every one be not neceſſarily reprobated, who is a ſinner. But when the enquiry is, <hi>why God hath reprobated this man, rather than the other,</hi> when they were both equally ſinners, and ſo alike proper objects of reprobation? <hi>Here ſin cannot be alledged,</hi> becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both; and what is common to them both, cannot (ſo far as we can ſee) cauſe a difference to be made between the one and the other.</q> And therefore no reaſon can be rendered by us for it in many caſes, beſides the mere ſovereign pleaſure of God, <hi>even ſo Father, for ſo it hath ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> I ſay in many caſes, becauſe it appears in fact from many inſtances, that ſuch perſons as ſeemed to men the moſt unlikely, nevertheleſs belonged to the election of grace. For there have been not a few Inſtances of very profligate ſinners, who like <hi>Manaſſah have wrought much evil in the ſight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger;</hi> and yet, thro' the mercy and grace of God, have been ſtopped in their carreer, to their own deſtruction, and made to all appearance, ſincere penitents, and ſound believers.</p>
