            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAVING laboured nearly ſix years to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to perſuade the citizens of Philadelphia that the yellow fever is of domeſtic origin, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to deſiſt from all further attempts to produce conviction upon this ſubject; but a retroſpect of the ſcenes of diſtreſs which I have witneſſed from that terrible diſeaſe, and the dread of ſeeing them ſpeedily renewed, with aggravated circumſtances, have induced me to make one more effort to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them, by pointing out their cauſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. I anticipate from it, a renewal of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies to which my opinion of the origin of our annual calamity has expoſed me; but theſe will be leſs difficult to bear, than the ſuppreſſion of truths which involve in their conſequences the proſperity of our city, and the lives of many thouſand people, whom poverty and deſpair will finally compel to

               <head>Of the Remote Cauſes of the Yellow Fever.</head>
               <p>This diſeaſe is the offspring of putrid vegetable and animal exhalations in all countries.—It prevails only in hot climates and ſeaſons.—The ſources of it in Philadelphia are chiefly the following—</p>
               <p n="1">1. The docks; theſe contain a large quantity of filthy matters in a highly concentrated ſtate. They are firſt acted upon, by the heat of the ſun, and hence ſailors and the inhabitants of Water ſtreet, are generally the firſt perſons who are affected by the yellow fever every year. It is derived to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the docks in New York, that it has obtained there, the name of the <hi>dock</hi> fever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The foul air of ſhips.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The common ſewers. A yellow fever was produced by a large ſewer in Calcutta. It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards prevented by cloſing it up, and removing the filth of the city in another way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The gutters.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:036253_0004_1008A93C9250D3D8"/>5. Dirty cellars and yards.—Foul air is ſometimes generated in cellars which produces ſporadic caſes of fever in all ſeaſons of the year. Swen Warner died of a yellow fever on the 30th of January 1799, received by breathing the air of a cellar which had been ſhut up for ſeveral months.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Privies. An epidemic fever was once traced to this ſource in the city of Frankfort in Germany.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The putrefying maſſes of matter which lie in the neighbourhood of the city, and</p>
               <p n="8">8. Impure pump-water.</p>
               <p>All the phyſicians in our city agree in deriving the common bilious fever and dyſentery from theſe ſources; now as theſe diſeaſes have, we are told, by the College of Phyſicians, "lately very much diminiſhed,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Facts, and Obſervations, p. 24.</note> and as the putrid exhalations ſtill continue, the preſumption is, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our higher grade of bilious, which is the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever.</p>

               <head>Of the Cauſe of the Yellow Fever not occurring more frequently before the Year <hi>1793.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It has often been aſked, "Why did not the yellow fever prevail in Philadelphia before the year 1793, particularly in the year 1778, when it was left in a more filthy ſtate by the Britiſh army than it has been at any time ſince?" To this, I anſwer, that for the production of our peſtilential diſeaſe, three things are neceſſary, 1. Putrid exhalations, 2. An inflammatory conſtitution of the atmoſphere, and 3. An exciting cauſe, ſuch as great heat, cold, fatigue from riding, walking, ſwimming, gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or unuſual labour, intemperance in eating, or drinking, ice creams, indigeſtible aliment, or a violent emotion of the mind. The firſt cauſe acts but feebly without the concurrence of the ſecond, producing mild diſeaſes only, ſuch as common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and intermitting fevers. By the co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an inflammatory conſtitution of the air, we obſerve not only common bilious fevers, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come malignant, but all thoſe diſeaſes which are occaſioned by the ſenſible qualities of the air, have aſſumed a more violent character. This has been remarked by moſt of the phyſicians of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia for ſeveral years paſt. The pleuriſy, rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm, gout, hives and ſeveral other diſeaſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire remedies of twice as much force to ſubdue
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036253_0006_1008A949C52BC6B8"/>
them, as they did ten years ago. On what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances this change of the atmoſphere depends is not known. But the fact is certain. It was taken notice of by Hippocrates two thouſand years ago, and is mentioned over and over in the writings of Dr. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham. The records of medicine prove, that it has continued from one year, to fifty-two years in different countries. Dr. Sims has given along and intereſting account of theſe inflammatory conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the atmoſphere from the year 1590 to 1782, in the firſt volume of the Mancheſter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, from which it appears that they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times general over Europe, and at other times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to particular countries. The peſtilential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the air in the United States began in 1791. This I infer from the yellow fever making its appearance that year in New-York—It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in Charleſton in 1792, and it has been epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic in one or more of the cities and country towns<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been aſſerted, that this fever is confined exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to our ſea ports. This is an error. It has prevailed ſince the year 1793 in many of the villages of New England, and of the ſouthern ſtates. On the Geneſee river in the ſtate of New York, it has become to prevalent as to acquire the name of the <hi>Geneſee</hi> fever. The bilious fevers which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the above places before the year 1793, were of a mild nature, and ſeldom mortal. They have lately diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, or are very much "diminiſhed," and have been ſucceeded by a fever which frequently terminates in death in five days with a yellow ſkin and a black vomiting. Theſe facts have been communicated to me by letters, from phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and by other gentlemen, who have been eye witneſſes of them. To doubt of their truth, would lead to a diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in human teſtimony, upon all other ſubjects.</note> of the United States every year ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:036253_0007_1008A94B57D716A0"/>We obſerve the effects of changes in the qualities of the atmoſphere not only upon diſeaſes, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on animal and vegetable life. Inſects of different kinds have lately appeared and multiplied in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual manner, and the fruits of the earth have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and decayed in many inſtances ſooner than in common years. Theſe facts have been noticed by the farmers in every part of the United States. The uncommon mortality in the ſummer and autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal months, among horſes, cattle and the cats, for ſeveral years paſt, is an additional proof of a change in our atmoſphere. It has ariſen probably from the ſame cauſe which has increaſed the mortality of our annual epidemic. As a further anſwer to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under this head, it might be aſked, why was not the fever imported oftener before the year 1791? It is ſeldom abſent from the Weſt-India iſlands. It raged in moſt of them during the two wars previous to the preſent, and yet but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance occurred of it in the United States in thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036253_0008_1008A94FBA2B01A8"/>
two periods of ſeven years each, and that was in Philadelphia in the year 1762. The intercourſe between our cities and the iſlands during that time was extenſive and conſtant, particularly in the war between the years 1756 and 1763. (Quarantine laws then exiſted in but few of our cities, and where they did, they were feebly executed or eluded every day.</p>
               <p>It has been aſked,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why does not the yellow fever prevail</hi> every year in <hi>cities, where the filth is always the ſame in its quantity</hi> and <hi>quality.</hi> To this I anſwer, that filth may be in two ſtates in which it will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this diſeaſe, viz. a <hi>dry,</hi> and a <hi>liquid</hi> ſtate. From exceſſive heat or from heavy rains, it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in one of thoſe conditions in our cities. When this is the caſe, they eſcape a viſitation from this diſeaſe. It is only when filth is acted upon by a hot ſun in a <hi>moist</hi> ſtate that it produces fevers. The Neck below Philadelphia which has been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the bilious fever, time immemorial, was uncommonly healthy in the autumn of 1793; ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the low grounds there being completely dried by the hot weather of that ſeaſon. Fell's Point near Baltimore I have been informed eſcaped the yellow fever in 1798 from a ſimilar cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:036253_0009_1008A9522135F400"/>I ſhall illuſtrate the origin of the yellow fever by a familiar ſimile. The foul air of our city may be compared to gunpowder with which the bodies of our citizens are charged from the beginning of ſummer. The atmoſphere may be compared to ſparks of fire. Heat, cold, fatigue, intemperance and the other exciting cauſes which have been mentioned, may be compared to a <hi>hand,</hi> which combines theſe ſparks, with the gunpowder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated in our bodies. The concurrence of all theſe cauſes is neceſſary to produce a yellow fever. Putrid exhalations act but feebly upon the body, unleſs they are aided by the inflammatory activity of the atmoſphere. This atmoſphere in like manner, acts but feebly upon the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of putrid exhalations. Both of them for the moſt part, require the <hi>hand</hi> of an exciting cauſe to produce the diſeaſe. An exciting cauſe without them, is harmleſs, or induces only a tranſient indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If putrid exhalations produce the yellow fever, it has been aſked, why are thoſe neighbourhoods ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times healthy that are constantly expoſed to their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmell?</hi> This queſtion may be anſwered by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to the effects of habit upon the ſyſtem, which renders it inſenſible after a while, of irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſions. The noxious matter which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036253_0010_1008A955F6E58B08"/>
the yellow fever exiſts independently of ſmell, and is probably not formed till after that proceſs of fermentation is ended, which evolves the faetor from putrefying animal and vegetable ſubſtances. This faetor, like the rattle of the ſnake, ſeems to have been intended to give us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our danger, and to remove, or fly from the filth which emits it. It is poſſible it may in ſome caſes predominate ſo much in its action upon the ſyſtem over that matter which produces the fever, as to defend the body from its morbid effects. It is thus, the <hi>constant</hi> ſtimulus of ſpirituous liquors has been found effectual in ſome inſtances in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>habitual</hi> drunkards from the yellow fever.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Is the Yellow Fever a Contagious Diſeaſe?</head>
               <p>To anſwer this queſtion, it will be neceſſary to remark, that contagion is of two kinds.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. It is <hi>ſecreted</hi> as in the ſmall pox and meaſles, in which ſtate it acts uniformly and without the aid of exciting cauſes, upon perſons of all ages and conſtitutions who have not been previouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it, and is not controuled by the obvious changes in the weather.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:036253_0011_1008A9578C591E18"/>2dly. It is derived from certain matters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the body which afterwards by ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or confinement, undergo ſuch a change, as to partake of the ſame nature as the putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations which produce the fever. If the breath, perſpiration, and other excretions of a perſon in a yellow fever be confined in a ſmall cloſe room, they may produce a ſimilar diſeaſe, eſpecially when they act upon a body previouſly debilitated by grief, or fatigue. But they are generally inoffenſive, where the ſick are accommodated in open well ventilated ſituations. Out of upwards of one thouſand perſons who have carried this diſeaſe into the country from our cities, there are not more than three or four inſtances to be met with, of its having been propagated by contagion. In the city hoſpital of Philadelphia, there was no inſtance of this diſeaſe being contagious in 1793, 1797, and 1798. The fever of which Dr. Cooper died in the hoſpital laſt year, Dr. Phyſick aſſures me was derived from the exhalations of Water-ſtreet, which place he viſited a few days before he ſicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to examine the ſtate of the air in that unhealthy part of the city. The diſeaſe periſhed when carried from Fell's Point to Baltimore in 1794. The ſame fate attended it, when it was carried from the places in New York and Boſton
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036253_0012_1008A95C007C1988"/>
in which it was generated, to diſtant parts of thoſe cities. Clothes impregnated with the effluvia of a perſon who had died of the yellow fever might produce a ſimilar diſeaſe, but it would be only in conſequence of thoſe effluvia partaking of the nature of putrid matters derived from any other animal ſource.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the year 1793 I ſuppoſed many caſes of the yellow fever to be derived from contagion, which I now believe were produced by noxious exhalations. I did not at that time know, the diſtance to which thoſe exhalations might be conveyed. From my ignorance of this fact, I was miſled by thoſe authors who ſuppoſe the diſeaſe to ſpread in the Weſt Indies by contagion. Many late inquiries have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that this is not the caſe. There is a ſmell of a peculiar kind emitted by perſons in a yellow fever which ſometimes produces diſagreeable ſenſations in the attendants, but ſimilar effects are produced from a hundred other ſmells which do not occaſion a fever.</note> The ſame thing may be ſaid of the efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via emitted from a putrefying dead body.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſettlement of the Weſt India iſlands, pains were taken by ſeveral phyſicians, to prove that the yellow fever was imported from Siam into the Weſt Indies. I was educated in the belief of this opinion, but the teſtimony of many learned, and eminent modern phyſicians, has convinced me that it is a vulgar error, and that the diſeaſe is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036253_0013_1008A95E9A678580"/>
generated there as it is here, by putrid exhalations. To the names of Drs. Huck, Hillary, Hunter, Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, M'Lean, and Clark, I ſhall add thoſe of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Jackſon, Borland, Pinkard and Scott, phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to the Britiſh army in the Weſt Indies, who lately viſited this city. They all denied the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature of the yellow fever in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following extract from Dr. James Clark's hiſtory of the yellow fever in the iſland of Dominica, in the years 1793, 4, 5, 6, contains an epitome of the opinions of all the medical gentlemen whoſe names are mentioned with his, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the origin and noncontagious quality of this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>"According to Dr. Lining's account of this fever in Charleſton, South Carolina, communicated in the Eſſays Phyſical and Literary, Vol. 2, it appears to have broken out there in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748; he thinks it was always imported from the Weſt Indies; but gives no proof, nor even reaſon, in ſupport of this opinion, which does not ſeem to be well founded.</p>
                     <p>"At Fort Royal, in Martinique, where there is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of mephitic effluvia, ariſing from the marſhy ground at the back of the town, it generally broke out in the ſummer or autumnal ſeaſon, on the arrival of troops from France, or of a number of ſeamen, who had never been in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies before; and the ſame thing happened at Point a Petre, in Grand Terre, Gaudaloupe, almoſt annually, and from the ſame cauſe; but it was never looked upon <hi>as an infectious diſeaſe;</hi> nor did it ever ſpread among the natives of the towns nor among thoſe who were ſeaſoned to the climate; nor was it <hi>ever carried from thence</hi> to the other iſlands. In this iſland few caſes have occurred for theſe laſt twenty years; and theſe have chiefly been at Prince Rupert's Head, where from the <hi>ſtagnated water</hi> in a large moraſs near the town and fort, the <hi>marſh miaſma</hi> prevails in a high degree. Since the ſwampy places which were in the town Rouſeau have <hi>been filled up,</hi> this fever has been ſeldom obſerved; but previous to the year 1792, we had generally violent thunder ſtorms—heavy rains—or ſevere gales of wind, during the autumnal ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>"M. Deſportes, in his Hiſtoire des Maladies de St. Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, during the fourteen years that he kept a journal of the diſeaſes at Cape François and Fort Dauphin, ſound that this fever broke out conſtantly in thoſe towns upon the arrival of new-comers from France, and among theſe, only ſuch as had not been formerly in that climate. In and about theſe towns, during theſe fourteen years, viz. from the year 1732 till 1746, there were a great <hi>many inlets of the ſea,</hi> where the water continued long in a <hi>ſtagnated ſtate,</hi> which in ſo <hi>hot a place</hi> produced very <hi>offenſive exhalations;</hi> to theſe he attributes this fever, and the bilious and other diſeaſes that prevailed at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>"From a firm belief that this diſeaſe is by no <hi>means contagious</hi> in our iſland, the ſick are not abandoned by their friends, nor neglected by their attendants, which contributes much to the recovery of many, who would otherwiſe have been loſt for want of care." In Dr. Jackſon's treatiſe upon the fevers of Jamaica, he ſuppoſes the bilious and yellow fever to be different diſeaſes. Since his late return from the Weſt Indies, and this country, he has publiſhed the reſult of his obſervations upon the yellow fever, in which he retracts the opinion of its being a ſpecific diſeaſe, and proves it to be a high grade of bilious fever.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036253_0014_1008A962E2C96928"/>
ſpread by contagion in veſſels at a diſtance from the ſhore, Dr. Scott informed me that there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036253_0015_1008A96551E694A0"/>
reaſon to believe it to be the common ſhip fever which is every where admitted to be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious nature.—The ſhip, goal, and hoſpital fever mean one and the ſame diſeaſe. It is produced by exhalations from <hi>living</hi> bodies in a crouded, filthy, or debilitated ſtate. The fevers which have been imported into Philadelphia from Holland and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in paſſenger ſhips, were of this nature. It is ſometimes confounded with the yellow fever by writers, but it is materially different from it.</p>
               <p>The power which heavy rains, and froſt have of <hi>destroying</hi> our fever, clearly prove that it does not ſpread by contagion. We have ſeen it check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three times, in three different years by froſty nights. The cold in theſe caſes cannot act upon the diſeaſe in our houſes, and of courſe it does not alter the quality of the matters diſcharged from the bodies of the ſick. It acts only upon the putrid exhalations which float in the atmoſphere.</p>

Hundreds have periſhed by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſerted by their friends in ſituations in which the diſeaſe could not have been taken by contagion, and where there was no danger to the attendants from putrid exhalations, either from the ſick, or the adjacent neighbourhood. Many people have periſhed likewiſe in places expoſed to putrid exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, who have believed themſelves to be ſafe, becauſe they kept at a diſtance from the ſick.</p>

               <head>Can the Yellow Fever be Imported?</head>
               <p>I once thought it might, but the foregoing facts authoriſe me to aſſert, that it cannot, ſo as to become <hi>epidemic</hi> in any city or country. There are but two authorities on which the belief of this diſeaſe being imported, reſts. Theſe are Dr. Lining's and Dr. Lind's. The former ſays it was imported into Charleſton in 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748. The latter ſays it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into Philadelphia where it afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came epidemic, by means of the clothes of a young man who died in Barbadoes. No circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſhips, or names are mentioned with theſe aſſertions to entitle them to credit, and from the facility with which vague reports of the foreign ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this diſeaſe have been admitted and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036253_0017_1008A96BCF958080"/>
by phyſicians in other countries, there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe the aſſertions of thoſe two phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are altogether without foundation.—The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Phyſicians of Philadelphia after two weeks inveſtigation, were unable to diſcover any ſhips, clothes, or ſick perſon, that could have introduced the diſeaſe into Philadelphia in the year 1793. The Academy of Medicine have clearly proved, by many documents, that the diſeaſe was not imported in the years 1797 and 1798. The origin of a few caſes, reported by Dr. Griffitts and other members of the College of Phyſicians, which have lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our city, has in vain been ſought for from a prize ſloop of the Ganges. Two affidavits of Meſſieurs Hill and Ingerſol, prove that ſhe had been healthy in the Weſt Indies, and that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been ſick on board of her during her voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, nor after her arrival in our port. Equally unſucceſsful have been the attempts to derive thoſe caſes, from beds, and blankets infected by the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of laſt year. In Boſton, Connecticut, New York, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleſton, both phyſicians and citizens have long ago rejected the opinion of the importation of the fever. Some phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſuppoſe it poſſible for the contagion of this fever to adhere to the timbers of ſhips that have ſailed from Weſt India ports, and that it may be propagated from them to a whole neighbourhood,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036253_0018_1008A96F504C7470"/>
although houſes, and even ſtreets, interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. This opinion is too abſurd to ſtand in need of refutation. Indeed every thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the importation of this fever is contrary to reaſon and facts.—It is an error, ſubſtituted in the room of a belief that all peſtilential diſeaſes were derived from the planets.—The exiſtence of a health-law founded upon this error, in the cloſe of the eighteenth century, and in a city abounding with literary inſtitutions, will appear incredible to poſterity. Thinking men alone will diſcover its poſſibility, in their knowledge of the nature of the human mind. It is poſſible this law may in the courſe of many years be the means of preventing the diſeaſe being received, in a ſolitary inſtance.— To enforce it under this circumſtance, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of our commerce, is to imitate the conduct of the man, who in attempting to kill a fly upon his child's forehead with a hammer, knocked out its brains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It has been ſaid, if we admit the yellow fever to be of domestic origin, it will ruin the credit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of our city.</hi> The reverſe of this opinion is true; for by admitting that it is generated among ourſelves, we ſhall ſoon remove its cauſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by ſuppoſing that it may be imported, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accordingly, we ſhall naturally be led to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect

the removal of the ſources of putrid exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus after driving our commerce to other ports, we ſhall entail the diſeaſe upon future generations. Many of the cities of Europe, and of the Weſt-Indies, that once generated peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential diſeaſes, now enjoy an exemption from them by adopting meaſures for removing their cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The hereditary cleanlineſs of the Hollanders was impoſed upon them by the diſeaſes to which their country was formerly ſubject from putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations.—The town of Harriſburgh in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, loſt more of its inhabitants in proportion to their number, than the city of Philadelphia by the yellow fever in 1793. The cauſe of this great mortality was traced to a mill dam. It was ſoon afterwards removed, and the town has ever ſince been healthy. It is of the utmoſt conſequence for the cities of the middle and northern ſtates of America to adopt meaſures of ſtrict and univerſal cleanlineſs, inaſmuch as the diſeaſe may be taken as often as our inhabitants are expoſed to its ſourc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. In the Weſt-Indies, the conſtant action of the ſun and of putrid exhalations upon the bodies of the natives and old ſettlers, render them for the moſt part, inſenſible to any morbid impreſſions from them; hence the diſeaſe is never taken a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time except by perſons who have left the iſlands, and after ſpending two or three years in

a cold climate, have returned to them. New comers are the principal victims of the higheſt grade of their bilious fever. The winters in North America, by deſtroying the habit of inſenſibility to heat, and putrid exhalation induced by the previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſummers, place our citizens every year in the condition of new comers in the Weſt-Indies, or of perſons who have ſpent two or three years in a cold climate. This circumſtance increaſes the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of depopulation to our city from our annual epidemic, and ſhould produce correſponding exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prevent it.</p>

Let the docks be immediately cleaned, and let the accumulation of filth in them, be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in future, by conveying water into them by a paſſage under the wharves, or by paving them with large flag ſtones inclining in ſuch a manner towards the channel of the river, as that the filth of the ſtreets ſhall deſcend from them (after it falls into the docks) into the river. This method of paving docks has been uſed with ſucceſs in the city of Breſt. The ſtreet now known by the name of Dock-ſtreet once expoſed a large ſurface of filth to the action of the ſun. Its neighbourhood was
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036253_0021_1008A97615700598"/>
more ſickly at that time, than any other part of the city. By means of the preſent arch over that filth, Dock-ſtreet has been exempted from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual number of ſick people during the ſummer and autumnal months.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let every ſhip that belongs to our port be compelled by law to carry a ventilator. Let all ſuch ſhips as are diſcovered to contain foul air in their holds, be compelled to diſcharge their cargoes before they reach our city, and let the ſhips in port, be compelled to pump out their bilge water every day.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Many of the citizens of Philadelphia have deſerted the College of Phyſicians, by admitting the foul air of a ſhip to be the cauſe of a yellow fever. The College derive it wholly from a <hi>ſpecific</hi> contagion formed by a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the body ſimilar to that which takes place in the ſmall pox. The foul air produced by putrefaction, whether generated in the hold of a ſhip, or in docks, or common ſewers and gutters, is of the ſame nature, and acts in the ſame manner in producing the yellow fever.</p>
                     <p>A new hypotheſis has lately been broached to prove the importation of this diſeaſe. It makes foul air a neceſſary <hi>recipient</hi> for the contagion, before it can act upon the body. The ſmall pox and meaſles require no ſuch recipients to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to produce a fever. The foul air is ſufficient to induce all the effects that have been aſcribed to it, without calling to its aid a mixture with a ſuppoſed ſpecific conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

By frequently waſhing the ſtreets and pavements the heat of the city would be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, and thereby one of the prediſpoſing cauſes of the fever would in ſome meaſure be obviated. The uſe of water for the above purpoſes, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more neceſſary ſince the ſtreets and gutters have been ſo cloſely paved; for the filth which formerly ſoaked into the earth, is now confined, and emits its noxious vapors into the atmoſphere.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The utmoſt care ſhould be taken to remove the filth from the yards and cellars of every houſe in the city. Hog-ſtyes ſhould be forbidden in yards, and the walls of cellars ſhould be white-waſhed two or three times a year, and their floors ſhould be conſtantly covered with a thin layer of lime.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I attended two perſons in this city laſt year in one houſe with the yellow fever, in the yard of which, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the window of the back room was a barrel fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cucumber and melon rinds, which had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated there in the ſummer of 1797.

                     <p>Some of the beſt houſekeepers in our city, burn all their offal vegetable and animal matters in their kitchen fires. If this practice were univerſal, it would contribute much to the health of our city. Many years ago, houſekeepers in Amſterdam were reſtrained by law from throwing the offals of their kitchens into their canals.
