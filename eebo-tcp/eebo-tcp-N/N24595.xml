            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AN Act passed by the Legislature during the sitting at Albany last Winter, concerning the removal of Unhealthy Trades from the City of New-York, gave rise to the present <hi>PUBLICATION.</hi> After the frequent visitations of this place within a few years, by Pestilential Distempers, it certainly became an interesting object to detect the cause of the evil, and whence it originated. Although sick persons and unhealthy air, are frequently brought from sea into the harbour of this seat of Commerce by ships, yet an opinion is gaining an establishment among the citizens, that more dangerous sources of infected air exist among themselves on shore. The detection of this fact is important, and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of it by the people of America is very honorable to them. It being thus admitted that the American Epidemic Fevers were caused by exhalations from substances on shore, and in large Towns, chiefly from those, which the industry of man had collected for the purposes of Trade and Manufacture, it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily became an object of enquiry, <hi>which of the substances, so accumulated,</hi> emitted pestilential vapours. It will appear to the reader, that in one of the Laws, printed in this collection, the Tallow-Chandlers and Soap-makers, are considered as carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a business too noxious to be endured, and extremely detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the public health. Provision was accordingly made for prohibiting their manufactures within certain limits. They remonstrated against this regulation, as likely to be ruinous to some of their number, oppressive to all, and at the same time, not calculated to do the good expected from it.</p>
            <p>The desire to have the matter investigated upon its merits, without favor or partiality, gave rise to the following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in which both the principles of Science, and the practice
<pb facs="unknown:032564_0004_0FF37F2C30969940"/>
of the Arts, are brought forward to shew their business has been unreasonably complained of. They believe the discussion to be fair and conclusive; and as it involves an investigation, what the peculiar nature of pestilential air is, as well as its application to the Publishers' particular occupations, they have undertaken to get it printed and distributed about. They feel anxious for the propagation of the truth. They feel a concern for the persons of their trade in the other cities of the United States, who they fear may be crushed by a policy as cruel as that which lately threatened themselves with destruction. They flatter themselves this Pamphlet will do good; and, that this might be more certainly the case they have caused the Laws of New-York, preventive of the Introduction and Spreading of Infectious Diseases, to be exhibited in one view, and have added a few other matters, connected with the subject.</p>
            <p>It is useful now and then to revise the Laws; and they, at this time, have thought it proper to lay before the public, on the subject of Infection, the statutes at large. Like other citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, they feel a great desire to bring all matters connected with the healthiness of the Cities of America, and conducive to their better police, to a just understanding; and if the public can derive any substantial information or leading hint, from the contents of this Pamphlet, the compilers will have the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of believing their labour is not lost. The great principle they wish to establish, is, that the matter of Infection is the <hi>septic acid vapour,</hi> or <hi>volatile acid of putrefaction</hi>; that thereupon, and thereafter, regulations about Nuisances, Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettos, and Quarantines, may be made in an exact manner, and not by guess, as they heretofore have been; for they have no hesitation to believe, and the United States afford facts enough on the subject, that much of the present system of preventing and stopping infection, is equally disgraceful to Police, Physic, and Commerce; and though their late persecution roused their indignation against a few individuals, they have never ceased to respect decency, and to labour for the public good.</p>

                     <hi>And be it further enacted,</hi> That upon complaint being made in writing by the Health Officer, or either of the said Commissioners, to the Wardens of the port of New-York, charging any of the pilots of the said port with a breach of any of the rules and regulations, prescribed by or in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of this act, or of the act, entitled, "An act to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the introduction and spreading of Infectious diseases in this state," it shall be the duty of the said Wardens, forthwith to suspend such pilot or pilots from piloting any vessel, until he shall have entered into a recognizance in the sum of two hundred dollars, with sufficient security before a magistrate, to appear and answer to the offence, at the then next Court of General Sessions of the peace, to be held in and for the City and County of New-York.</p>

into, and ascertain the reasonable compensation which should be made to such owners or proprietors, for such taking down, removal and replacing, as aforesaid, which said jury being first duly sworn faithfully and impartially to enquire into and ascertain such compensation, shall proceed to ascertain the same; and the sum found by their verdict, shall be paid by the said Mayor, Aldermen and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the said City of New-York, to the said owners or proprietors, and shall be deemed as part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent expences of the said City, to be raised and levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and collected, as the other contingent expences of the said City, are levied, collected and paid. <hi>Provided always,</hi> that after such decision by the jury, it shall be optional with the said Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, either to pay the amount of the compensation found by the jury, or within one month thereafter, at their proper expence, to take down, remove and replace, such vessels and fixtures in such place as the owners and proprietors thereof shall direct, and in such part of the said city, as by this act, such manufactories or trades as aforesaid may be established.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS it is represented to the Legislature that there are certain manufactures of Soap and Candles in the City of New-York, whose works are so situated, and whose business is so carefully managed, as neither to endanger the health nor be offensive to their neighbors, Therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BE it enacted by the People of the State of New-York, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in Senate and Assembly,</hi> That the person administer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the government of this State, with any two of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Health-Office, may in writing under their hands, permit all such manufacturers of Soap and Candles to remain and exercise their said trades, within the City of New-York, to the southward of the bounds, or line desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the fifth section of the act entitled, "An act to amend the act, entitled an act to prevent the bringing in and spreading of infectious diseases in this State," any thing in the act to the contrary notwithstanding. <hi>Provided nevertheless,</hi> that such permits may, in the discretion of the persons having authority to give the same, be granted to such Starch-makers whose manufactories are not situated to the southward of fresh water, which certificate shall remain in force until the person administering the government of this State, and any two of the said commissioners shall by writing under their hands, supercede the same, on its appearing to them that such permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been abused, and ought to be withdrawn; and until notice in writing, that the same is superceded, hath been served on the person in whose favor the certificate was granted, or left at his or her dwelling house, and a copy of such notice fixed up in the clerk's office of the said city: <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nevertheless,</hi> that no Tallow shall be rendered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the said limits, prescribed by the act above mentioned, from the fifteenth day of May, to the first day of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in each year.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Respectfully Sheweth,</hi>
                     <lb/>
THAT your Memorialists feel all that respect for the Representatives of the People in the Legislature, and for the resolves and bills that are passed, which as good citizens and firm supporters of government it becomes them to possess.</p>
                  <p>That when grievances beset themselves and their fellow-citizens, of a nature susceptible of legislative remedy, they conceive they have a right of presenting memorials and petitions, exhibiting the grounds and causes of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and praying for relief.</p>
                  <p>That your Memorialists have read with great concern and alarm, the act, entitled, an act to amend the act, entitled an act to prevent the bringing in and spreading of infectious diseases in this State, passed the tenth day of February, one thousand seven hundred and ninety seven, whereby Soap-boilers and Tallow-chandlers are prohibited, after the first day of July next, from carrying on any processes or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their trades; and the trying and melting of fat or tallow, and the boiling of soap within the limits mentioned in the said act, interdicted under a severe penalty.</p>
                  <p>That by the provisions of the said act, the Manufacturers of Soap and Candles are reduced to the hard necessity of either discontinuing their business, or of removing beyond
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032564_0024_0FF39C8B47741C90"/>
Grand and Mulberry Streets; a forlorn dilemma, which in one case terminates in certain distress, and in the other, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the compensation contemplated in the act, will be attended with the ruin of the greater part of your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists, and with great difficulty and embarrassment to the rest.</p>
                  <p>That convinced as your Memorialists are, that private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est should not be set in opposition to public good, they would meet the impending calamity with firmness, and bear it with fortitude, were it true that their occupations were productive of sickness or diffused pestilence through the air of their neighbourhood. Nay, if this was the case, so far are your Memorialists from wishing to continue as they are from selfish motives, that rather than poison a street or a neighbourhood, they would of their own accord either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or shut up their works.</p>
                  <p>That believing there is a misconception concerning the nature of the vapours of their manufactories, and that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some remote analogies, these exhalations, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, have been classed with others which are indeed noxious in a high degree; and confident at the same time, that the Legislature are willing to investigate the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the bottom, and search out the <hi>whole</hi> truth; your Memorialists crave permission to be heard on the merits of their application by a candid enquiry into facts.</p>
                  <p>That as by reason of the remoteness of the Legislature from their place of residence, they were not apprised of what was doing soon enough to make opposition to the bill during its progress, they are desirous of exhibiting at this time such evidence, to shew the harmless nature of their occupation, as if, had it been possible to have produced in due season, would, they trust, have satisfied the Legislature that it was superfluous o<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>LIKE a calm observer, their Counsel said he had beheld on several occasions, the legislature engaged on subjects of a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical nature. The most important of all these, the prevention of infectious and contagious distempers had again and again been agitated by the Representatives of the People. Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation had succeeded to regulation, and project given way to project in such rapid succession, that he hoped before this time, by the joint efforts of those who were engaged in the reforms, a system of rules well-digested and complete in their more material parts, would have been elaborated. He was afraid, however, that a great deal was yet necessary to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032564_0026_0FF37F8C4E6BD948"/>
be done. He was also apprehensive there had been some things done, which it had been better to have left undone.</p>
                  <p>He alluded to the Act passed during the present Session, entitled, "an act to amend an act, entitled, 'an act to prevent the introduction and spreading of infectious distempers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this State," which, as the Memorials, Remonstrances and Petitions presented to the Legislature, sufficiently express, is considered in some of its parts as bearing extremely and unnecessarily hard upon a valuable and industrious body of Citizens.</p>
                  <p>The Petitioners for relief from the oppression of that Law, as well as himself, were inhabitants of the City of New-York. He trusted they were all guided, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the same desire of rendering their place of abode comfortable and wholesome. The respirable quality of the atmosphere they lived in, was a matter of eminent concern to them all.</p>
                  <p>From vitiated air, had it of old been believed, that epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic distempers derived their origin; though in the times of rudeness and superstition, it had been considered as a mark of piety to refer all visitations and calamities of this sort to the anger of the gods, or at least to the displeasure of Heaven. This short way of philosophising was in no wise calculated to satisfy the curiosity of an enlarged mind. By degrees however, after a series of observations, extended from the 400th year before the Christian Aera, quite to the present day, it had become established as a settled fact, that those wide wasting diseases, the plagues of ancient times, by which several sea-ports and country places in the United States, <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To comprehend how the wholesomeness of the atmosphere should be destroyed, either by a privation of that portion of it, which ministers incessantly to the support of life, or by letting loose vapors and exhalations of a nature noxious

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n it, required an extent of experimental research, which all the accumulated industry of the past ages, had never until ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately accomplished. It now was admitted on all hands, that though something of an unfriendly composition, might be formed in the clouds, by the association of the particles of one kind of air with those of another, yet the principal mischief arose in the form of steam from substances <hi>on or near the surface of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since then the explosion of the astrological motion of the malign aspect and influence of the stars, and other bodies above their heads, the eyes of mankind were turned down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in search of the cause of the inconvenience they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, from some source beneath their feet. After a course of various observations and experiments, it had been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that the greatest degree of vitiation which the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere manifested by its operation upon the human frame, proceeded not from <hi>earthy or metallic bodies,</hi> but was a somewhat emitted <hi>from certain animal and vegetable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances during putrefaction, and floating about in a volatile form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What the nature of these <hi>new</hi> aërial fluids was, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for a long time utterly unknown. Since, however, the dead body of an animal or plant, disappeared almost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely by exposure to wind and weather, and left but small traces of its former existence behind, doubts had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning the vulgar notion of their return to <hi>earth,</hi> as they seemed rather to be resolved into <hi>air.</hi> The perfect transparency of such a fluid, as it reflected no light, put it out of the power of the Eye to examine what it was, even when assisted by the most perfect glasses. Its yielding and impalpable nature evaded examination by feeling and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and eluded the nicest exercise of the sense of touch. Thus its want of visible and tangible properties had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an examination of its peculiar nature, for a great while, very imperfect. And even since the introduction of vessels of glass into laboratories, it had not been possible to investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032564_0028_0FF39C97431DAF08"/>
thoroughly their history, in any other way <hi>than by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to their combinations with other bodies by means of Chemical Attraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In attending to the changes which plants and animals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent after death, it at an early day had become apparent that the air into which they were converted was not <hi>always</hi> of a hurtful kind; that some species of both classes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would rot without causing any mischief at all, while other individuals of either sort, while they underwent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, were, though not always, yet frequently noxious; and at best, of a suspicious character. Mankind, by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the subject, in all possible ways, had discovered at last, <hi>that some putrifying substances would afford no pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial air at all, and others that were capable of yielding it, would only do so under certain circumstances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before the human mind had progressed far enough, to come to any definite conclusion on the subject, camps had been desolated, armies cut off, and cities depopulated by pestilence. In contemplating these distressing events, though it was obvious enough, the morbid cause must have originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>locally,</hi> or have been generated on the spot, both in the field and garrison; still so great had been the reluctance of mankind in settled and domestic life, to allow their city or place of residence to be unhealthy, that in the history of all ancient and modern plagues, a belief has almost univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally prevailed, of their introduction from some <hi>foreign place.</hi> The Yellow-fever of New-York, and the other commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial cities of America, for instance, if you might give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a multitude of testimony, had been always imported from some distant parts, commonly from the West-Indies; the inhabitants of those Islands agreed among themselves in disclaiming its origin there; but differed whether it was of Asiatic descent, from the climate of Siam, or of African production in the latitudes of Guinea. Had the Malays or the negroes the custom of reading our performances, and writing books of their own, they would doubtless feel an equal desire to wipe away these aspersions, and contrive
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032564_0029_0FF39C99278EB580"/>
stories as plausible as many of ours, to countenance its intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction by some infected Traveller from Ethiopia, or sickly Sailor from the Philippine Islands—In like manner, the Athenians of old, though surrounded on the land side by their Peloponnesian foes, and grievously incommoded on a thousand accounts, as they were cooped up within their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel and walls, flattered themselves the plague they suffered was imported into their harbour from Egypt. A late sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Traveller had observed that it never arises in Cairo spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously, and affirms it is always introduced from Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. The people of this Turkish capital, comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves it did not spring up originally there, but was brought from the northward, by certain foggy or unwholesome winds that had blown across the morasses in the neighbourhood of the Euxine.—These prejudices which had been fostered and cherished in most sea-port towns, by the spirit of commerce, were at this hour, happily wearing away. It redounded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressibly to the honour Americans to be the first to cast them off. Those pestilential out-casts, whom nobody would own, but whom every body sent as vagrants and vagabonds from country to country, were beginning to obtain an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and legal settlement. They were the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous offspring of our vices. Deformed and hideous as they were, the parentage and filiation was ours, and as we begat them, we should not refuse to own them. If the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which, until a few years, had invariably prevailed, were traced there could not be found a spot or corner of the civilized globe, which gave birth to them. If on the other hand, attention was given to facts, there was not a city or town in the United States, whether sea-port or mid-land, nor a house or habitation in either, wherein Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential Diseases might not arise. The truth is, <hi>they might and did arise in most places, where corruption and nastiness abounded, and of course were generally, not of foreign deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of domestic origin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus pestilential vapours might be produced from some of the bodies of plants and animals, or some parts of them,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032564_0030_0FF39C9AAF6C1B30"/>
undergoing disorganization, on the surface of the earth, which being made volatile under certain circumstances, so contaminated the atmosphere as to cause endemic and epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic distempers.</p>
                  <p>He remarked, that this offspring of putrefaction, though too attenuated to affect the sight, or the touch, was attracted by other bodies. This was particularly the case with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>ashes</hi> afforded by wood burned upon the hearths of dwelling houses, and by the <hi>plaister,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted their walls. Long ago had it been known, that the scraping of the matters collected near doors, in ditches, yards, out-houses and stables, as well as the decayed walls and old rubbish of dwelling-houses, were exceedingly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the fabrication of salt-petre. This was so well known and understood, that under the administration of the late kingdom of France, the manufacturers of the article, were not only incorporated in the city of Paris by their sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, but were allowed to take away from demolished buildings, as much of the old mortar as they pleased, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the domestic production. And notwithstanding the fuel of that vast city was chiefly wood, such had been the accumulation of putrid vapours in the salt-petre-beds, that the Academy of Sciences, who were directed to examine and report on the subject, had recommended the mingling of imported pot-ash with the crude materials, as a means of procuring salt-petre in the most expeditious way, and in the most abundant quantity.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note A.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these alliances then, which <hi>putrid</hi> vapours form with alkaline salt and calcarious earth, they had been subjected to the most rigorous examination, and analized with scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing exactness. It had accordingly been proved by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als made on the effluvia steaming directly from corrupting substances, that they were arrested by chalk <note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note B.</note> and soda, as well as by the the substances enumerated; and thus, he

                  </p>
                  <p>The sum of the testimony from these three sources, was, that <hi>pot-ash</hi> and <hi>lime,</hi> saturated or neutralized the <hi>putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations</hi> they attracted; that being both of them of alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line nature, they shewed by their analysis, the material they had drawn from the air, was of an <hi>acid quality</hi>; and that this acid, which, with the saline ground, formed common nitre, and with the earthy basis, constituted calcarious ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, was <hi>the Acid of Putrefaction.</hi>

                  <p>As far as the almost innumerable mass of facts on these and similar subjects, had been stripped of foreign and advantitious circumstances, and generalized in a scientific and logical manner, there existed the most cogent evidence, that the production just named, and some of its modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, formed the pestilential poison; that under the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal names of <hi>Human Effluvia,</hi> and <hi>Marsh Miasmata,</hi> and he scarcely knew how many other titles, was commonly called in popular phrase, <hi>infection</hi> or <hi>contagion</hi>: the operation of which, occasioned such mortality and terror among the people, and which the Legislature had with such laudable solicitude, been engaged in guarding against.</p>
                  <p>He had judged it the more necessary to bring forward to notice, the facts tending to shew the exact and precise nature of pestilential fumes: because through the whole course of his reading and conversation, they appeared to be considered as unknown combinations of elementary atoms, equally unknown; mysterious and inexplicable things engendered from the chaos of organic dissolution; produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so equivocal, it was hard to know what to call them; surpassing, as some believed, all mortal comprehension, and lying far beyond the limits of human understanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:032564_0032_0FF39C9D19365880"/>If his attempt to state what it was, had been successful, then might we be considered as having caught nature in her work-shop, examined her collection of raw materials and discovered which of them she employed in this fearful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, which like the <hi>poisoned shirt of Hercules,</hi> enwraps the wearer too closely to be shaken off. Then both the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher and the statesman would have clews to guide them through the labyrinths of Science and Legislation.</p>
                  <p>From whatever substance, therefore, <hi>the acid of putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was produced, it would be killed in the egg by <hi>lime</hi>

They were the Ichneumons which destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unhatched and yet harmless Crocodile. If they were not at hand, the new-born Monster, fostered and nurtered by heat, acquired the fury of a Dragon, soon took wing, and flew about the Land.</p>
                  <p>It might, perhaps, be thought a digression from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under discussion, if he dwelt at large upon the trades, occupations and employments wherein sickly exhalations are generated. <hi>Rammazzini</hi> had written well on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before him. Instead, therefore, of going the round of a particular enumeration, he should just observe that this Septic Poison might be considered as experimentally prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exist in city and in country, in the houses where do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic animals, both birds and quadrupeds were kept, and discharged their dung and urine; in Privies and the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles of human ordure; in grave-yards, and the earth sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the buried Bodies of Men; in clothing, bedding and furniture impregnated with secreted matter and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; in the corrupted blood and offal of beasts slain for the market; in the skinny and lean parts of animals, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly rotten hides, beef and fish; in putrefied wheat, coffee, cabbages, and certain other vegetable substances; and in that mixture of these and other dangerous materials, which formed the evaporating, foulness of the New-York streets, and the dismal collection along the river-side.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:032564_0033_0FF39C9EC05A4D30"/>This <hi>pestilent acid</hi> is most easily disolved in water. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in company with this guide, it gradually soaked thro' the earth on which cities were built, insinuated itself into the recesses, whither this all-pervading fluid found its way, and took up its abode or gained admittance into cisterns, wells and fountains. Even here its alkaline foes attacked and seized it. They grappled with it, and held it fast, until the contending champions could be brought up to day-light, and viewed as they lay clenched in close encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. After the conflict and effervescence which always attended their meeting was over, the two friends for a while were commonly victorious; but exhausted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered at length, their salutary efforts were but of little avail, and poison predominated in the Reservoirs.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note D.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To an observing mind, the history of man presented an abundance of similar truths. He presumed almost every person had learned from the newspapers a description of the dungeon of Olmutz, where the unfortunate La Fayette lingered in captivity. The victim of a vindictive policy, he there received little consolation from human friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> still he was not without a friend. The <hi>lime</hi> which cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the stones of his dismal apartment, attracted the deadly vapours which threatened his life, and formed with them the <hi>nitrous efflorescence,</hi> which crept along the walls.</p>
                  <p>The bills of mortality shewed that large and crouded ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were unfriendly to the rearing of children to manhood. Was it wonderful? The infant inhaled pestilence with the air which first expanded his little lungs, absorbed it at every pore, swallowed it with the tainted milk of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's breast. The water which slaked his thirst, and the food that supported his strength, were contaminated with the same mischievous ingredient. And this operating in so many ways upon his tender frame, brought it to a premature dissolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless it should be hardy enough to become seasoned by degrees to the poison, and grow insensible of its
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032564_0034_0FF39CA306D64E20"/>
effects. What hapened to the child, happened also to the parents. The air, the earth, the water; food, clothing, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, all became more or less tinctured with <hi>septic matter,</hi> produced in a great degree from substances collected by their own hands, employed with the most perverse of possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble industry, in <hi>forming the tissue of this domestic manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Soap-Makers</hi> and <hi>Tallow-Chandlers</hi> of the City of New-York, were considered by the bill, which had been passed during the present sessions, as contributing largely to the mass of pestilential vapours. These useful citizens considered themselves aggrieved by the judgment the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature had passed upon the business they followed. They felt a confidence the effluvia from their manufactories, did not impair the health, far less destroy the lives of their fellow-citizens. If the occupation did, like THE UPAS-TREE, spread around the spot where Soap and Candles are made, desolation and death, they would not only submit to the imputation and its inconveniences without a murmur, but in a public-spirited manner, would applaud the justice of the statute.</p>
                  <p>He should examine the subject in two ways. First, Upon its Principles: and Secondly, Upon its actual operation; and he had little doubt it would appear upon discussion, to be a harmless occupation <hi>generally,</hi> and even capable sometimes, of counteracting the effects of contagious and infectious vapours.</p>
                  <p>From the facts heretofore adduced, he believed there would be little need of stating additional evidence to prove that <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Potash</hi> were constantly engaged in baffling the powers of pestilence, and fighting the battles of health. Those articles formed a large part of the materials with which the manufacturers alluded to, carry on their business. It would be a most remarkable discovery, that a law of nature, which acts uniformly in other instances, in making these exhalations submit to alkaline dominion, should fail to operate, or should suspend its efficacy as to this. But
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032564_0035_0FF37F7A4A0B5D88"/>
there was no such irregularity known to exist. The septic acid fumes which infected the air of the inland coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, oftentimes as much as of sea-ports, and made, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to numbers, as great havoc in interior towns, as in any place whatever, yielded to the coercion of <hi>Potash</hi> around the letch-tubs of Cobus's kill, as well as in the soap-works in our capital. Nor was the <hi>Lime,</hi> which was always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to give sharpness to the ley, inactive in other res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. So far from remaining idle, it had no sooner whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the weapons of its ally, than it prepared to attack, though with feebler powers, the common enemy both of themselves and of mankind. He might appeal to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which many of the members of the Legislature had of the method of managing Pot-ash-works, whether ever a pestilential distemper was generated there? There was no such thing known. The daemon of pestilence would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly arrested on shewing his face there, and so closely confined and guarded, that he never could escape and prowl about for human prey any more. The lixiviation of ashes then, and the extraction of its alkali, seemed to be excused on every consideration, from having any agency in this <hi>destructive work, both in town and country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, however, it had been alleged, that the <hi>Fat</hi> which constitutes the other part of the soap, and the whole of some sorts of candles, putrefied and emitted exhalations of a quality so deleterious, that a wise policy should prohibit the carrying on the processes, for which the oily parts of animals were collected, and by which these alarming vapors were supposed to be extricated. If this charge could be supported, then indeed ought the law to be carried forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with into execution. But he did not know any <hi>facts</hi> which countenanced such an opinion. The true interpretation of them led to an opposite conclusion. He then proceeded to examine them.</p>
                  <p>The distillation of animal fat in close vessels, saving the sebacic acid, gave no volatile salt at all; far less any fluid possessing the qualities complained of. Its constitution was
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032564_0036_0FF39CAC46C2E178"/>
such, that the peculiar ingredient which became the basis of noxious airs, and without which, the truly pestilential compositions could not be formed, resided not in it. Hence though it might become rancid and smell disagreeably, the effluvium was not poisonous. From the nature of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, every house-wife knew, that though the <hi>fat</hi> might smell as bad as the <hi>lean,</hi> it did not turn to rottenness in the same manner.</p>
                  <p>Again, repeated observation had assured us, that on the escape of the noxious ingredient from animal substances decaying in large heaps, as happened in the public burial ground of the city of Paris a few years ago, the residuary portion turned to lumps of <hi>fat,</hi> almost as firm as sperma-ceti. This fact was so well established, that economical projects had been formed to decompound the carcases of animals under water, in such a manner, that while the pestilential mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inherent in the blood, skin, brawn and muscles, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally escaped into the water, the residue of the lean parts turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fat. Need he dwell upon the statement of other facts of this sort, which the periodical publications of Europe for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years past, have announced to the world so often?</p>
                  <p>Further, it was in the power of art to imitate these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of nature. The operation was as easy as al<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ost any in chemistry, by driving off the specific portion, whence pestilential air was generated, to convert a bit of the leanest beef into fat or tallow. During the continuance of life, the harmless atoms, which by their binary union, constitute fat, restrained the disorganizing efforts of their partner; but when the partnership among the ingredients of a muscle was dissolved by death of the animal to whom it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, pestilence sallied forth, free from restraint, and disclaimed his <hi>greasy</hi> connection. It was to the gentle, but firm operation of this very fat, so much complained of, or of the elements from which it might be formed, that the pestilential matter of our bodies, is in a good degree, held in bondage during life, and prevented from exercising those destructive powers upon its own constitution, which
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032564_0037_0FF37F9C6740F340"/>
on its enlargement, act with deadly malignity upon others. The whole of the phenomena of the composition of living muscles, and the decomposition of dead ones, held forth this truth, <hi>that neither oily substances, nor the materials of them, contained pestilential poison, or its essential ingredients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, New-York afforded monuments enough of the efficacy of oil, even under the disadvantageous form of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with metallic bodies into paint, to evince its power of arresting infectious vapours. Look at them (continued he) in their filthy birth-places, the bottoms of the slips and docks. See them aim at the timber of the vessels, that at low water are grounded there in the mud. Behold the oil quit its union with the white-lead with which it had been mixed, and turn black by destroying the acid, which was endeavoring to eat through to the planks. View these pestilential steams as they rise and exert their destructive effects upon the neighbouring houses. Direct your eyes to the blackened sign-boards, where the oil has so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood their assaults,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note E.</note> that scarcely a letter of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant's name is legible. Enter the rooms, and see the vapors, which the oil has so firmly resisted, thicken, destroy the birds in their cages, and doom their owners to the grave. He added, that these facts, which were as public as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and obtruded themselves upon the notice of every passenger, would, if fairly interpreted, bear witness to the solidity of his argument.</p>
                  <p>Once more: it was well known that several acids, and particularly the <hi>acid of putrefaction,</hi> was decomposed very readily by <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>greasy</hi> bodies, and that so rapidly, as with many sorts of oils, to burst into flame. This capacity of acids, to combine with animal fats, was so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that <hi>acid soaps</hi> had been manufactured. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mankind had long ago shewn, that they were unfit for rendering substances clean. They had according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been discarded from the arts, through practical conviction,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032564_0038_0FF39CAFF35A4168"/>
not theoretical opinion. Could a soap, he asked, compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of fat and a pestilential acid, neuteralize and remove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from tainted clothes? What but an alkali could drag it from its retreat, entangled at was with the woof, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertwisted, as it were, with the filiaments of the cloth? It was the ultimate and irrefragable proof of a principle, when inferences and deductions from it, coincided with common sense and the experience of ages. The true reason why Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis are preferred as the bases of Soaps, was, that they deterged the excreted matters which stick to our garments, whose acid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity when accumulated and concentrated by extreme frowzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and long lying or wearing, first <hi>reduced the fabric to rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness and rags, and then turned to pestilence.</hi> He thought the history of prisons afforded ample confirmation of this conclusion.</p>
                  <p>These considerations led to the conviction that <hi>oils</hi> and <hi>fats</hi> were <hi>not</hi> capable, from their composition and nature, to afford pestilential air; that they either neutralized or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded acids, and <hi>thereby weakened or deadened the Power of Contagion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lime, Pot-Ash</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> thus were antidotes to contagion, in <hi>their distinct and separate forms.</hi>—The cleanliness and health attendant on the <hi>combination of them into Soap,</hi> was so evident to every body, that there was no need of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word on that part of the subject. Though he could not pass it over, without remarking, that it was a very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and singular event in the annals of Legislation, that a Manufacture, whose ingredients, whether considered sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately or in composition, were labouring with an effect, which almost exceeded calculation to diminish the causes and frequency and violence of epidemic fevers, should, in the present state of science, and near the close of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century, and in a American Republic too, be treated by a Legislature <hi>as an internal hot-bed of infection!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He proceeded in the second place, to enquire whether the reasoning he had used was bottomed on experience? In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032564_0039_0FF37F7D68A7D640"/>
to determine this, he exhibited a few examples to shew that men might deal in oil and fat in all their forms, both vegetable and animal, externally and internally, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to plague, yellow-fever, or any distemper that resembles them.</p>
                  <p>He said, the <hi>whale fishery</hi> afforded instructive evidence to this point. That industrious and enterprising body of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who sent from Nantucket, vessels and seamen to make war on the inhabitants of the ocean, knew that the effluvium of animal oil was not pernicious. They found their huge prey in all latitudes between the region where Disko bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the Arctic Circle, and that where in the opposite hemisphere, Georgia, the extreme of habitable land, stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es toward the South Pole; and in all longitudes betwixt the tract of Eastern Ocean which separates Madagascar from the African Coast, westward to the parallel where Juan Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, rises above the waves of the Pacific. Through this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive range, the Whalemen took on board their blubber, and either subjected it during the voyage to the operation of fire, whereby it might be separated from the skin and membranes, or brought it home barelled up in large junks, to be tried or melted in their houses on shore. Such a vessel was filled with the exhalations of oil, putrefying in the casks and smoking from the boilers. The men, their cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the oars of their boats, yea, the deck they tread upon, seemed to be penetrated through and through with them. Yet strange as it might appear, these voyages were among the most healthy which are performed. It was a rare thing to lose a man during a run of eighteen months or two years, by sickness. However common distempers might be in the navy, in the transport, and in the merchant-service, there was no instance known of a putrid or malignant fever, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by stinking oil or its vapours, sweeping off the crew of a whaleman.</p>
                  <p>He observed that <hi>the customs of the Caffrarians,</hi> nasty and disgusting as they were, afforded, among many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive particulars, an example of the harmlessness of <hi>fat</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:032564_0040_0FF39CB192C61760"/>
and <hi>oil.</hi> The rank and horrible grease with which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared their bodies, never excited fevers, nor pestilential distempers. On considering the poisonous atmosphere of Java, which the young civilized Hottentot, mentioned by Rousseau, had been accustomed to breathe, our wonder at his determination to rejoin his countrymen, at the Cape of Good Hope, ought almost to turn to a sentiment of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we reflect, that as he had long lived with his naked skin exposed to the corroding vapours of Batavia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he longed to be once more a member of a society, whose customs would permit him, <hi>to shield himself from Pestilence by Unction with Grease.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jewish rites, which were detailed with so much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteness in the book of Leviticus, were quoted as perfectly conformable to the principle under consideration. Their <hi>sin-offering of ignorance</hi> was made by taking
<q>all the fat of a bullock, the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks and the cawl above the liver;</q>—this was ordered to be burned by the priest upon the altar, and might be done amidst the people;
<q>but the skin of the bullock and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, even <hi>the whole bullock</hi> shall he carry forth WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT THE CAMP, into a clean place, WHERE THE ASHES ARE POURED OUT; and burn him on the wood with fire; WHERE THE ASHES ARE POURED OUT, there shall he be burnt.</q>
Such were the regulations of MOSES for atonement of the <hi>sin of ignorance</hi> in <hi>priests</hi>; and with varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>young</hi> bullocks, <hi>kids of the goats,</hi> and <hi>lambs,</hi> was conducted in much the same manner for the same sin in the <hi>congregation,</hi> the <hi>rulers</hi> and the <hi>people.</hi> He knew not of any mention of pestilential diseases caused by the effluvia of <hi>burning fat,</hi> in any of these and other numerous sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this pe<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>liar people, though it was probable the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences arising from the consumption of the other parts at, or near the altar, might have brought the Jews to the <hi>practice of carrying them among the ashes without the camp.</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:032564_0041_0FF37F813357C0C8"/>
Had the fumes from the fat, been of a destructive nature, the priests must have soon expired beside the victims. It was not probable that under a theocracy, where the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of religion were held in such high reverence, a duty would have been assigned them, the performance of which was unavoidably attended with the inhalation of noxious and deadly air. So far from it was the practice reckoned, that it was called "a sweet savour." He believed it would be sound policy to let the Manufacturers of Soap and Candles remain where they are; and while they were happy in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>peace-offerings</hi> and trespass-offerings with their fat, and labouring to purify and illuminate the city, the RULERS might order what processes upon the <hi>other</hi> parts of animals, the PEOPLE should carry on WITHOUT THE CAMP.</p>
                  <p>The fumes of animal oils, were thus (he continued) harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in their operation, while they were putrefying, boiling in kettles, and burning in the open fire; and so were the <hi>fats</hi> themselves, when in either their mild or rancid state, they were daubed upon the human skin.</p>
                  <p>Nor were their effects less remarkable when considered as articles of diet. There was an ancient story that the gift of the Olive was judged more beneficial to mankind, than that of the Horse. The oily product of this vegetable and of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, entered very largely into the food of the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations. The Esquimaux of the North regaled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self when hungry, with a draught of the oil of a Sea-Dog or a Whale, and this without detriment, even when it was in a mok rank and offensive state. These examples might suffice to give an idea of the operation of fatty and oily substances upon the stomach and bowels. He must omit the regular Dietetic consideration of them, as such a discussion would lead him too far from his purpose.</p>
                  <p>Yet it had been urged, after all this, that if these Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not pestilential, they were intolerable <hi>nusances;</hi> that they generated <hi>impure</hi> air, and ought to be turned out of town.</p>
                  <p>It was true, he allowed, that in the sense of the word <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance</hi> as a term at common law, these Manufactures might be
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032564_0042_0FF39CB386861EC8"/>
so badly conducted as degenerate to <hi>nusances.</hi> This had been frequently the case in England, and indictments had been brought and proved against them. But the application of this term and the meaning commonly annexed to it, shewed that there must be something capable of being <hi>seen</hi> or <hi>smelled,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> in the air, according to common acceptation, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon in a complaint of nusance. If the <hi>Eyes</hi> and the <hi>Nose</hi> were not offended by <hi>smoke</hi> and <hi>stench,</hi> then it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed that things go on well enough. He believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there were few or no instances of indictments found, where the transparency of the air was complete, and where the nostrils were not saluted by bad odours. Yet, so the thing was, and it was of great importance to be understood, <hi>that an effluvium of a most fetid nature might exist, without a particle of infection:</hi> And, on the other hand, as the history of most epidemics evinced, <hi>an exceedingly virulent and destructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the atmosphere did exist, with scarcely any sensible qualites at all.</hi> The former were the <hi>nusances</hi> which had usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been contemplated in common law. The latter in which the interests of society were infinitely more concerned, had been passed over as of no moment whatever. He wished this matter was understood by Grand Juries. It would be their duty to present a <hi>pestilential state of the air, however free from opacity and odour,</hi> as the greatest of <hi>nusances,</hi> and find bills against all places and things which produced it. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably would never happen until they should be convinced that though a pestilence might be accompanied <hi>accidentally</hi> with <hi>haze</hi> or <hi>stench,</hi> yet its most formidable effects were felt when neither the <hi>sight</hi> nor the <hi>smell</hi> gave any evidence of its presence. It went about unseen, and approached like a thief in the night. It was, however, within the jurisdiction of our Courts, and ought to be treated with the rigour of stern justice. Then should we not be
<q>afraid for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waiteth at noon-day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If still, while the great sources of mischief and misery were left unregarded, a few Manufacturers and Tradesmen must be selected from the rest and offered up as a sacrifice to such
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032564_0043_0FF37F8A849468B8"/>
undiscriminating policy, why proscribe them by statute? If their occupations are nusances, they must be either of a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> or of a <hi>private</hi> nature. On proof of their being <hi>public nusances,</hi> the common law provides that the sheriff may enter with his Posse Comitatus and abate them. If an individual offends by erecting or continuing a <hi>private nusance,</hi> the aggrieved neighbour has his remedy in a civil action for the recovery of damages. By this innovation, the trial of fact, nusance or no nusance, by a Jury of the vicinage, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and a new tribunal instituted to decide upon the rights, properties and privileges of freemen. The citizens asked if this was done in the spirit of deliberate and careful Legislation? They were importunate to know what deep researches their Representatives had made in these inquiries, beyond the Magistrates of the cities of Europe, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers of both hemispheres?</p>
                  <p>All this, it would be said, was true in theory, but not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being reduced to practice. On complaints made, Grand Juries were slow in finding bills, and traverse Juries reluctant to bring in a verdict to their neighbours' detriment. That, however true the doctrine was in the abstract, there was vast difficulty, often an impossibility, of carrying the principle into effect. Therefore, there grew a necessity to adopt some other mode of managing these matters. In short, Jurors, it was alledged, would not do their duty, and some other persons must be got who would. Suppose jurors as delinquent as they are stated to be, and that <hi>Commissioners of Nusances</hi> have in some instances their use, there was no need of them in the present case. It had been proved already, and there were certificates and opinions enough, besides, if there was any need of them, to satisfy every mind, that the Manufacture of Soap and Candles might be carried on in the City without endangering the Health of the People. And as to the offensive and suspicious part of their business, these Tradesmen would voluntarily, without murmuring, and without public expence, render their <hi>crude tallow and butcher's Fat,</hi> in some remote place, where nobody would be annoyed by the vapours they emit.</p>

                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:032564_0044_0FF39CB77A78A890"/>He was aware it had been alledged, the vapours these substances emit rendered the air <hi>impure,</hi> and processes afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>impure</hi> air ought to be prohibited, lest the health of the Citizens be injured by it. The meaning of this word, (one of the words of the act) he said was so vague and general, that it was hard to find out its particular application. It might signify air loaded with <hi>smoke</hi> or <hi>dust,</hi> or any thing which spoils its clearness, and mingles with it foreign mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. These, indeed, rendered the atmosphere <hi>sooty</hi> and <hi>dirty.</hi> It might be interpreted to express the exhaustion of the respirable part of the atmospherical mass, <hi>the empyreal or pure air,</hi> and consequently leaving the residue deprived of its vital portion; and in this sense of the word, the burning of all fuel, the calcining of metals, the formation of vinegar and all acids, were processes exceedingly productive of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure air.</hi> Or it might intend that <hi>odorous</hi> bodies made air <hi>impure</hi> by diffusion of their particles abroad, and then cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor and tallow, ambergris and rotten eggs, the rose and the tan-vat, the tar-pot and the solutions of sulphur and phosphorus, all contributed to the <hi>impurity</hi> of the air. Or it might mean, lastly, that something of a destructive nature, not to be smelled or seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was diffused through the air, and rendered it <hi>impure;</hi> then the formation of <hi>fixed air, ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal air, inflammable air, phlogisticated air, dephlogisticat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nitrous air,</hi> and <hi>septic acid air,</hi> and of every other sort of air, except empyreal air, was a process, whereby <hi>impure,</hi> that is <hi>non-respirable air,</hi> is evolved. Each of these aerial productions was constantly mingled, in a greater or less quantity, with the common atmosphere, especially that of cities, and every one of them in its pure and unmixed state, was either directly noxious, or at best, possessed no life-exciting power.</p>
                  <p>The truth was, that <hi>vital air</hi> in its <hi>pure form,</hi> was found by sufficient experiments, to be too keen and stimulant for the purposes of health and longevity. To guard against this exhausting effect of an atmosphere <hi>too pure,</hi> the Author of Nature had tempered it so that to about one fourth of air of a vivifying quality, there were added three fourths of an air
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032564_0045_0FF39CBA6DF97478"/>
possessing no properties of a kind adapted to regenerate the pulmonic blood, and keep the heart in motion. <hi>Three fourths</hi> of the air we are obliged always to breath, was <hi>impure</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and mankind lived the longer for it. Less than <hi>one fourth</hi> of vital air would answer the purposes of life very well. When the <hi>purity</hi> of air was talked of then, if it meant mere and undiluted vital air, it meant a condition of things inconsistent with the natural constitution of this world; if it meant the ordinary atmospheric mixture, then it meant that salubrious state of it, wherein three quarters were already <hi>phlogisticated</hi> or <hi>foul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, considerably less, he concluded, than a quarter-part of <hi>pure</hi> air in the atmosphere, would answer the wants of animals. There were only certain processes in nature and the arts, and they were very well understood, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the respirability of the atmosphere. There were a thousand things of the volatile and odorous kind, which though diffused through the air, and thickly too, seemed not to lessen its respirability in the least, or in any measure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree, nor to possess any thing hurtful. There were other things of a volatile, though not odorous nature, that might do vast mischief by inducing fevers, without render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the atmosphere unfit for breathing; and some that might at once possess qualities directly deleterious to man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to vital air. The <hi>septic acid exhalations,</hi> rising from certain putrefying bodies, were of this latter kind. Though their pestilent qualities were so dismally known by their effects, yet as their transparency, tenuity, and want of obviously sensible properties, rendered it difficult to catch and analyze them, so they have scarcely ever been taken into the account, in estimating the <hi>impurity of air.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Note F.</note> To make language precise, that constitution of the atmosphere which brings on plagues, and other distempers of a similar nature, ought to be designated by the term "pestilential<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" rather than "impure."</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:032564_0046_0FF37F9AA5375BE8"/>He did not pretend to doubt that the Legislature might wholly forbid and prohibit particular manufactures. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently they might limit, modify and direct the method of carrying them on. The power of regulating trades and mechanic arts, among other things, unquestionably resided with these representatives of the sovereignty of the people. But, he believed, it was equally clear, that though the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature possessed this power, they were under a high and solemn obligation to employ <hi>discretion</hi> in the use it. It was was a great misfortune, when Legislatures meddled with what they had better let alone. It lessened respect for the laws, and disposed the citizens to neglect or break them. The spirit of a free government made a voluminous statute book necessary. A complicated mass of laws, was one of the consequences of complete civil liberty. Where little or nothing was left to the <hi>will</hi> of individuals, <hi>legal</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions must be very minute, and extend to the detail of things. On no pretence whatever then, should the code be swelled needlessly, or laws enacted upon wrong princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>There was proof before the Legislature of the laborers at manufactories of Soap and Candles, having a remarkable exemption from the Plague of Philadelphia in 1793. The same sort of evidence was afforded by three several manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories of similar articles, within the limits of the Plagues of New-York, in 1795 and 1796. It had been remarked with surprize, and talked of as an unaccountable thing, in Great Britain and Ireland, that during the rage of Epidemic fevers, the people who followed these branches of business generally escaped, and oftentimes many of their neighbours also. Accordingly the police of the best regulated cities of Europe, had not treated these manufacturers as stirrers up of pestilence in their municipal regulations. He thought it might be collected from the relations of travellers, that the pestilential distempers in some parts of the Turkish dominions, were connected with a scanty supply or total want of Soap. The detection of the composition and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pestilential vapors had explained these facts, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032564_0047_0FF39CAE31025F18"/>
furnished a principle which cleared up the doubt and mystery of the whole subject.<note place="bottom">See Appendix, Note H</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He called upon those whom it concerned, to see now what had been done. Notwithstanding all this testimony the Legislature had pronounced against these artists, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden their manufactures to be carried on, but beyond certain limits, because they were <hi>nusances</hi> and generated <hi>impure</hi> air. This savored a little of legislating upon words; while the great body of facts, and the principle which pervaded the whole evidence, and the true interpretation of the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, seemed to be overlooked. A public regulation which was wrong in principle, could not be expected to command universal respect. It was an unhappy occurrence when the People complained of the Laws; but it was likewise unhappy, that they should ever have reason to complain.</p>

Tho' they know little of the use of putrefaction, they take care to promote this process, by drenching them with urine, or muck-water; and frequently turning them over, by which means they are brought to maturity, much sooner than the larger nitre-beds. These materials, with the <hi>wood-ashes their hearths supply,</hi> (if the latter are not added before) are thrown into a large tub, and water is poured upon them, which runs out thro' a hole stuffed with straw at the bottom of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.

So great is their attraction for the principle of acidity, that they decompound vital air with great rapidity, whenever they meet with it, attracting to themselves its oxygen, and setting loose its caloric, or matter of heat. From the greediness with which they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorb the <hi>base of pure air,</hi> they very soon become highly oxygenated, and turn to <hi>septic acid</hi> or <hi>septic acid vapour,</hi> pale, colourless, and in its sparse or dilute form, affecting the smell in a very small degree, or not at all. Availing
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032564_0055_0FF39CC571EB4430"/>
themselves of this tendency of <hi>nitrous gas, to become septic acid on its union with oxygen,</hi> the Chemists have invented the <hi>Eudiometer,</hi> an instrument calculated to measure what proportion of vital air is destroyed by a given quantity of nitrous gas mixed with it. <hi>The process going on in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diometer, is the very one by which infected air is formed</hi>; and nothing but an additional quantity of it is wanting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate the air of the experimenter's chamber, and make him sick or kill him. If now the <hi>matter of pestilence,</hi> or <hi>volatile septic acid,</hi> already exists in the atmosphere, and constitutes a portion of the air taken into the Eudiometer for trial, in sickly seasons, it is impossible that nitrous gas should enable us to detect it there. Pestilential air is nitrous gas saturat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with oxygen and volatilized by heat; that is to say, the same sort of fluid which is produced in the Eudiometrical experiment; and as nitrous gas only measures the quantity of oxygen air decompounded, pestilential air will remain untouched and unchanged by it; seeming to lie quite beyond its reach. Hence we may understand why, upon principle, the Eudiometer should be incapable of ascertaining a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential condition of the atmosphere, or giving any notices about it; and wherefore, in practice, experiments with that instrument, have never advanced our knowledge or enlarged our ideas on this point. The difficulty which has attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inquiry into the true history of the fluids which have azote (septon) for their basis, seems to have arisen thus: a parcel of salt-petre was taken and decompounded by a stronger acid in a close vessel; an acid called thence the <hi>nitrous,</hi> came over into the receiver, and separated itself into two portions, a quantity of oxigene gas, which was suffered to escape, and a portion of smoking acid which was condensed and stopped up for use. Its production, thus, was <hi>artificial,</hi> and it was always kept bottled up in a forced and unnatural manner. All this time, so strong was its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction for oxygen, that the greatest care was necessary to prevent by the closest stoppers, any communication between them. From this fuming acid, the nitrous gas for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was usually obtained; a production more artificial

than the former, and incapable of existing so long a time in the open air. Now it is remarkable, that the attention phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers has in a great degree been directed to these <hi>artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial productions,</hi> while the <hi>natural compounds of septon and oxygene</hi> have received but a moderate share of attention.</p>
               <p>These natural compounds are <hi>septic oxyd</hi> and <hi>septic acid;</hi> the former of which, <hi>always,</hi> and the latter <hi>very often</hi> exists in an aerial or volatile form.

               <head>NOTE H. Efficacy of Pot-ash to destroy putrid vapours.</head>
               <p>The eye of an observer frequently meets with facts which illustrate and confirm this principle.—In Mr. Gaine's Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac for 1797, (a compilation containing much prudential and economical matter) there is a GOOD FAMILY RECEIPT, by which any meat, ever so stinking, may be made as sweet and wholesome in a few minutes, as any meat at all. The receipt is as follows:
<q>Take some white ley, that is, boil some clean ashes in water; let it stand till it settles; pour this off as clear as rock-water; boil your meat in this three or four minutes, or till it is sweet, then wash it and dress it in any way, and no person could discover it had ever been fetid, or stinking.—This will be found a useful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to the army and navy, where a <hi>solution of pot-ash</hi> may be used, instead of the white ley.</q>
—I have learned, that some of the hucksters in the city of New-York, make a practice of buying up stinking beef, and tainted meat of all sorts, at the public sales, (our buyers and sellers do not

                  <head>Extract of a Letter from professor <hi>MITCHILL,</hi> to Sir <hi>JOHN SINCLAIR,</hi> dated New-York, <hi>28</hi>th Nov. <hi>1796,</hi> on Manures.</head>
                  <p>IF septic fluids are so very abundant in the air as they are proved to be, especially in large cities, situated and regulated as many of those in the United States are, and at the same time, if they were so easily absorbed as experience shews they may be, that their bad effects should not be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently felt, and mortality greater than that which prevails at present be the consequence?</p>
                  <p>It soon appeared to me, that the pot-ash thrown into the streets with the dissolved soap which had been employed in washing, was possessed of qualities, enabling it to attract and attach these vapors, and existed in quantity sufficient to take a vast volume of them out of circulation. My ideas were reduced to a sort of system on the subject, by the following estimate of my friend Mr. SAMUEL RUSSEL of this City.</p>
                  <p>The city of New-York contains 60,000 inhabitants. One pound of hard or bar-soap is required to wash the clothes of ten persons for one week. The consumption of soap, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the citizens, will be 10÷60,000=6,000 pounds a week. Strangers, sailors and other transient persons may be supposed, on an average, to amount to 5000, which will make the weekly consumption 500 pounds more. The quantity
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032564_0059_0FF37FC2728332B8"/>
used up for cleaning houses, furniture, &amp;c. and by barbers, scourers, &amp;c. may be estimated as an additional 500. The whole weekly consumption thus amounts to 6,000+500 +500=7,000lbs. The yearly consumption will conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be 7,000×52=364,000lbs. One third of the whole weight of soap is alkaline salt, consequently the quantity of pot-ash expended and thrown away in the city of New-York, is 3÷7000=2,333 ⅓lbs. every week, or 121,333 ⅓lbs. upwards of 54 tons per annum.</p>
                  <p>Such an amount of pot-ash is capable of counteracting the effect of an exceedingly great bulk of pestilential fluids, by attracting them to itself, destroying their aerial form, and thereby constituting salt-petre. If, as CHAPTAL computes, (Elements of Chimistry, &amp;c.) one hundred grains of pure nitre contain thirty parts of septic acid, joined to sixty-three of pot-ash<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and seven of the water of christallization, then, upon the supposition that the whole of the alkali thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the streets is converted to nitre, there must be an addition of septic acid, equal to 30/100th parts of the whole, to neutral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize the salt; that is to say, 121,333 ⅓+30÷100=36,400lbs. or more than 16 tons of sceptic acid, requisite to turn such a mass of alkali to salt-petre; and in the same proportion for any smaller quantity.</p>
                  <p>In the foregoing estimate, the whole quantity of soap is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to hard soap for the following reason. Soft soap is sold at a much lower rate than hard, because it is much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. It is therefore used in families more extravagantly, and it is presumable, that the same quantity of alkali is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended as there would be if hard soap, and none else, was used.</p>
                  <p>But the solutions of soap poured into the gutters are not the only sources whence the pot-ash is derived; for the wood ashes of hearths, exposed, as it is, in yards, cellars, and ash-holes, or cast into the streets, furnish a large additional portion of alkali. The fact I am about to mention shews at
<pb n="61"
                         facs="unknown:032564_0060_0FF37FCA6335B3D0"

once, the reality of such a process, and the existence of sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic acid in our houses. On the lower floor of a rear build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the city of New-York, the back part of a closet was a thin brick wall. On the outside of this wall, in the yard, the ash house was built. The only separation between the ashes put there and the closet, was the narrow partition of bricks. Their substance was so porous, that, in the course of time, a saline effloresence was observed on the bricks within the closet near the floor. On examination, the pot-ash, which had apparently penetrated through the wall, in a state of solution, was found to be changed to nitre, by a combination with septic acid, which it had doubtless attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the air of the room.</p>
                  <p>In these ways does it seem, that a considerable proportion of the mischief is prevented which would be caused by such noxious steams, if left to float about at large. If the scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of this city were employed in the manufacture of salt-petre, they would unquestionably afford a large quantity of it. But, as they are generally sold to the farmers for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, it is worth the while to examine.</p>
