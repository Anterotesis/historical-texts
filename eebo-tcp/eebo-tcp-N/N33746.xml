         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SINCE the laſt meeting of a General Aſſembly, the good People of this State have not only felt the common Calamities of War, but, from the wanton and ſavage Manner in which it has been proſecuted, they have experienced ſuch Severities as are unpractiſed, and will ſcarcely be credited by civilized Nations.</p>
            <p>THE Enemy, unable to make any impreſſion on the Northern States, the Number of whoſe Inhabitants, and the ſtrength of whoſe Country, had baffled their repeated Efforts, turned their Views to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Southern, which, a difference of Circumſtances afforded ſome Expectation of conquering, or at leaſt of greatly diſtreſſing.— After a long Reſiſtance, the Reduction of Charles Town was effected, by the vaſt ſuperiority of Force with which it had been beſieged.— The loſs of that Garriſon, as it conſiſted of the Continental Troops of Virginia and the Carolinas, and of a number of Militia, facilitated the Enemy's march into the Country, and their Eſtabliſhment of ſtrong Poſts, in the upper and interior Parts of it; And, the unfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Iſſue of the Action near Camden, induced them vainly to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that no other Army could be collected, which they might not eaſily defeat.—The Militia, commanded by the Brigadiers Sumpter and Maſion, whoſe enterpriſing Spirit and unremitted Perſeverance under many difficulties, are deſerving of great Applauſe, harraſſed and often defeated large Parties, but, the Numbers of thoſe Militia were too few to contend effectually with the collected Strength of the Enemy—Regardleſs therefore of the ſacred <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

of the Feelings of Humanity, and determined to extinguiſh, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, every Spark of Freedom in this Country, They, with the inſolent Pride of Conquerors, gave unbounded ſcope to the Exerciſe of their Tyrannical diſpoſition, infringed their public Engagements, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the moſt ſolemn Capitulations—many of our worthieſt Citizens, were, without cauſe, long, and cloſely confined—ſome on Board of Priſon Ships, and others in the Town and Caſtle of St. Auguſtine —their Properties diſpoſed of, at the Will and Caprice of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and their Families ſent to a different and diſtant Part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, without the Means of Support—many who had ſurrendered as Priſoners of War were killed in cold Blood, ſeveral ſuffered Death in the moſt ignominious Manner, and others were delivered up to Savages, and put to Tortures, under which they expired—Thus, the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the People were dependent, ſolely, on the pleaſure of Britiſh Officers, who deprived them of Either or all, on the moſt frivolous Pretences—Indians, Slaves and a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Banditti of the moſt profligate Characters, were careſſed and employed by the Enemy to execute their infamous Purpoſes—De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation and Ruin marked their Progreſs, and that of their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, nor were their Violences reſtrained by the Charms or Influence of Beauty and Innocence—Even the fair Sex, whom it is the duty of all, and the pleaſure and pride of the Brave, to protect,—they, and their tender Offſpring, were Victims to the inveterate Malice of an unrelenting Foe—neither the Tears of Mothers, nor the Cries of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, could excite, in their Breaſts, Pity or Compaſſion—not only the peaceful Habitations of the Widow, the aged, and the infirm, but, the holy Temples of the moſt High were conſumed, in Flames, kindled by their ſacrilegious Hands—They have tarniſhed the Glory of the Britiſh Arms, diſgraced the Profeſſion of a Britiſh Soldier, and

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on the Britiſh Name.—But I can now congratulate you, and I do ſo moſt cordially, on the pleaſing Change of Affairs, which, under the Bleſſing of GOD, the Wiſdom Prudence Addreſs and Bravery of the great and gallant General GREENE, and the Intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the Officers and Men under his Command, have happily effected—a General who is juſtly intitled, from his many ſignal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to honorable and ſingular Marks of your Approbation and Gratitude—His Succeſſes have been more rapid and compleat, than the moſt ſanguine could have expected—The Enemy, compelled to ſurrender or evacuate every Poſt which they held in the Country, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently defeated, and driven from Place to Place, are obliged to ſeek Refuge under the Walls of Charles Town, and on Iſlands in its Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity— We have now the full and abſolute Poſſeſſion of every other part of the State, and the Legiſlative, Executive and Judicial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are in the free Exerciſe of their reſpective Authorities.</p>
            <p>I alſo moſt heartily congratulate you, on the glorious Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the combined Forces of America and France, over their common Enemy— when the very General, who was ſecond in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at the Reduction of Charles Town, and to whoſe boaſted Proweſs, and highly extolled Abilities, the Conqueſt of no leſs than three States had been arrogantly committed, was ſpeedily compelled, to accept of the ſame mortifying Terms, which had been impoſed on that brave but unfortunate Garriſon; to ſurrender an Army of many thouſand Regulars, and to abandon his wretched followers, whom he had artfully ſeduced from their Allegiance, by ſpecious Promiſes of Protection, which he could never have hoped to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

in itſelf ſo decided, and in its Conſequences ſo extenſive, as muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ſoon oblige the Enemy to yield, to Us, the only Poſt which they occupy in this State—on the reiterated Proofs of the ſincereſt Friendſhip, and on the great Support, which America has received from that powerful Monarch—a Monarch whoſe Magnanimity is univerſally acknowledged and admired, and, on whoſe Royal Word, We may confidently rely, for every neceſſary Aſſiſtance—on the perfect Harmony which ſubſiſts between France and America—on the Stability which her Independence has acquired, and, on the Certainty that it is too deeply rooted, ever to be ſhaken—for, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated as they are, by National Honor, and united by one common Intereſt, it muſt and will be maintained.</p>
            <p>WHAT may be the immediate Effects, on the Britiſh Nation, of the Events which I have mentioned, of their Loſs of Territory in other parts of the World, and, of their well ſounded Apprehenſions from the powers of France, Spain and Holland, it is impoſſible to foretell—If Experience can teach Wiſdom, to a haughty and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated People, and, if they will now be governed by Reaſon, they will have learnt, that they can have no ſolid Ground of Hope, to conquer any State in the Union, for, tho' their Armies have obtained temporary Advantages over our Troops, yet the Citizens of theſe States, firmly reſolved, as they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and juſtly renounced, cannot be ſubdued—and, They muſt now be convinced, that it is the Height of Folly and Madneſs to perſiſt in ſo ruinous a War—If, however, We judge, as We ought, of their future by their paſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, We may preſume, that they will, not only endeavour to keep poſſeſſion of our Capital, but make another Attempt, howſoever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:044266_0005_101DE27CF4A85CA8"/>
the Succeſs of it may appear, to ſubjugate this Country— It is therefore highly incumbent on Us, to uſe our moſt ſtrenuous Efforts, to fruſtrate ſo fatal a Deſign, And, I earneſtly conjure you, by the Duty which you owe, and the ſacred Love which you bear, to your Country, by the conſtant Remembrance of her bitter Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by the juſt Deteſtation of Britiſh Government, which you and your Poſterity, muſt for Ever, poſſeſs, to exert your utmoſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, for that purpoſe, by raiſing and equipping, with all poſſible Expedition, a reſpectable permanent Force, and by making ample Proviſion for their comfortable Subſiſtence—I am ſenſible the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence will be great, but, a Meaſure ſo indiſpenſable to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Freedom, is above every pecuniary Conſideration.</p>
            <p>THE Organization of our Militia is likewiſe a Subject of infinite Importance—a clear and conciſe Law, by which the Burdens of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will be equally ſuſtained, and a competent Number of Men brought forth, and kept in the Field, when their Aſſiſtance may be required, is eſſential to our Security, and therefore, juſtly claims your immediate and ſerious Attention—Certain it is, that ſome of our Militia have, upon ſeveral Occaſions, exhibited Inſtances of Valour which would have reflected Honor on veteran Troops—The Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct of the Generals whom I have mentioned, the cool and determined Bravery repeatedly diſplayed by Brigadier Pickens, and, indeed, the Behaviour of many Officers and Men in every Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, are unqueſtionable Teſtimonies of the Truth of this Aſſertion —But, ſuch Behaviour cannot be expected from Militia in General, without good order and ſtrict diſcipline, nor can that order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline be eſtabliſhed, but by a ſalutary Law, ſteadily executed.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER important Matter for your Deliberation, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch of our Citizens as voluntarily avowing their Allegiance,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044266_0006_101DE2816C2335A8"/>
and even glorying in their proſeſſions of Loyalty and Attachment to his Britannick Majeſty, have offered their Congratulations on the Succeſs of his Arms, prayed to be embodied as Royal Militia, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Commiſſions in his Service, or, endeavoured to ſubvert our Conſtitution, and eſtabliſh his power, in its ſtead, of thoſe who have returned to this State, in Defiance of a Law by which ſuch return was declared to be a Capital Offence, and have abetted the Britiſh Intereſt; and of ſuch, whoſe Behaviour has been ſo reprehenſible, that Juſtice and Policy forbid their free Re-admiſſion to the Rights and Privileges of Citizens.</p>
            <p>THE extraordinary Lenity of this State, has been remarkably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous—other States have thought it juſt and expedient to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate the Property of Britiſh Subjects to the public Uſe, But, We have forborne to take even the Profits of the Eſtates of our moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies—It is with you to determine, whether the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture and Appropriation of their Property ſhould now take Place —If ſuch ſhall be your Determination, tho', many of our firmeſt Friends have been reduced, for their inflexible Attachment to the Cauſe of their Country, from Opulence to inconceivable Diſtreſs, and, if the Enemy's Will and Power had prevailed, would have been doomed to Indigence and Beggary, yet it will redound to the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this State, to provide a becoming Support, for the Families of thoſe whom you may deprive of their Property.</p>
            <p>THE Value of Paper Currency became, of late, ſo much depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that it was requiſite, under the Powers veſted in the Executive during the Receſs of the General Aſſembly, to ſuſpend the Laws by which it was made a Tender—You will now conſider whether it may not be proper to repeal thoſe Laws, and fix ſome equitable Mode, for the diſcharge of Debts, contracted whilſt Paper Money was in Circulation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:044266_0007_101DE2830C7E49B8"/>IN the preſent Scarcity of Specie, it would be difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, to levy a Tax, to any conſiderable Amount, towards ſinking the public Debt, nor will the Creditors of the State expect that ſuch a Tax ſhould, at this Time, be impoſed; But, it is juſt and reaſonable, that all unſettled Demands ſhould be liquidated, and ſatisfactory Aſſurances of Payment given, to the public Creditors.</p>
            <p>THE Intereſt and Honor, the Safety and Happineſs of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try depend, ſo much, on the Reſult of your Deliberations, that I flatter myſelf you will proceed, in the weighty Buſineſs before you, with Firmneſs and Temper, with Vigour, Unanimity and Diſpatch.</p>

            <p>WE reflect with pleaſure on the ſteady Reſolution with which Charles Town was defended, by a ſmall body of brave Men, againſt ſuch a vaſt ſuperiority of Force, and we gratefully acknowledge the meritorious Conduct, and important Services of the Officers and Privates of the Militia, who ſtood ſorth in the hour of Danger, and whoſe coolneſs, perſeverance and ardour under a complication of Difficulties, moſt juſtly entitle them to the applauſe of their Country.</p>
            <p>WE flatter ourſelves, that the Blood which the Enemy has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly ſpilt, the wanton Devaſtation which has marked their progreſs, and the tyrannical Syſtem that they have invariably purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which your Excellency hath ſo juſtly and pathetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us, will rouſe the good People of this State, and will animate them with a Spirit to protect their Country, to ſave their Rights and Liberties, and to maintain, at all hazards, their Independency.</p>
            <p>IT is with inexpreſſible Pleaſure, that we receive your Excellency's Congratulations upon the great and glorious Events of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, on the happy change of Affairs, and on the pleaſing Proſpect before us; And, We aſſure your Excellency, that we concur moſt ſincerely with you, in acknowledging and applauding the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Zeal, and the very important Services which have been rendered to this State, by the great and galiant General GREENE, and the brave and intrepid Officers and Men under his Command, and to whom we ſhall be happy to give the moſt honorable and ſingular

            <p>WE are truly ſenſible of the immenſe Advantage, which the United States derive from the magnanimous Prince their Ally: We have the moſt perfect Confidence on his Royal Word, and on the ſincerity of his Friendſhip, and, We think ourſelves much indebted to that illuſtrious Monarch, for the great and effectual Aſſiſtance, which he hath been pleaſed to give the Confederated States, and by whoſe means they have been enabled to humble the Pride of Britain, and to eſtabliſh their Independency upon the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Baſis.</p>
            <p>THE Importance of the ſeveral Matters which your Excellency hath recommended to our Conſideration, is ſo evident, that we ſhall proceed to deliberate upon them, with all poſſible Diſpatch, and we flatter ourſelves, that our Buſineſs will be carried on with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Firmneſs and Unanimity.</p>

            <p>I ſincerely thank you for this Addreſs—The Approbation which you are pleaſed to declare of my Conduct affords me much Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion— Bound by the ſtrongeſt Ties, and the deepeſt Gratitude, to promote the Happineſs of this Country, I have only to regret that my Endeavours for that purpoſe have not, as yet, produced all the good Effects which I anxiouſly ſtrove to obtain—Your Sentiments of public Affairs are ſo perfectly juſt, that I foreſee the happieſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences muſt reſult from the diſpoſition which you profeſs.</p>

            <head>THE ADDRESS of the HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES in Anſwer to the Governor's SPEECH.</head>
            <p>WE the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the State of South-Carolina, in General Aſſembly met, return your Excellency our moſt cordial Thanks, for your very intereſting Speech to both Houſes, at the opening of this Seſſion, the Language of which, evidently beſpeaks a Heart glowing with ardent Zeal for the Intereſt and Welfare of our common Country.</p>
            <p>WE want Words to expreſs our heart-felt Exuitation, on the pleaſing reverſe in our Affairs: On this Spot, but a few Months paſt, a military Deſpotiſm prevailed, and Tyranny, with lawleſs Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, was deſolating our fair Poſſeſſions; But, We now, with extacy, behold, a free Government re-eſtabliſhed, Liberty, that greateſt of temporal Bleſſings, reſtored, and every Citizen ſecured in the poſſeſſion of his Property by the firm barrier of the Law of his Country—This auſpicious Change, is in a great degree owing to the Prudence, Firmneſs and good Conduct of your Excellency.</p>
            <p>IF any thing can add to the ſublime and refined Enjoyment, which muſt ariſe from your Excellency's own reflections on your perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unabated and ſucceſsful Exertions towards reſcuing your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the Iron Hand of Oppreſſion, be pleaſed, Sir, to accept the moſt ſincere and unfeigned Thanks of your grateful fellow-Citizens.</p>
            <p>THE black Catalogue which your Excellency has given of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Barbarities, forms but a ſmall part of the Whole—When ever the hiſtoric Page ſhall be ſtained with their Story, it will exhibit a Nation devoid of Faith, with whom Oaths, Treaties and the moſt ſolemn Compacts were conſidered as trifles, who, without Scruple or Remorſe, had abandoned all regard to Humanity, Honor, Juſtice and every ennobling Sentiment of the human Breaſt. It is hardly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044266_0011_101DE29358E1DB98"/>
poſſible to conceive any circumſtance that could aggravate the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wickedneſs of their Conduct. There is not left a Step in the degradation of National Character, to which they can <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>WE ſhould betray a great degree of Inſenſibility, and be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Juſtice to his Merit, ſhould we omit this occaſion of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, with the warmeſt Gratitude, our Obligations to the great and gallant General GREENE: His Atchievements in this State, while they rank him with the greateſt Commanders of ancient or modern Date, will engrave his Name in indelible Characters on the Heart of every Friend to this Country. Our Acknowledgments are alſo due to all the brave Officers and Men, under his command, who have ſo often Fought, Bled and Conquered for us. The Generals Sumpter, Marion and Pickens, with the brave Militia, under their commands, thoſe virtuous Citizens who did not deſpair of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in her greateſt Extremity, are deſerving of the higheſt Commendation. The friendly, ſeaſonable and effectual Aid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently afforded us, by our great and illuſtrious Ally, by means of which, the General, on whom the Britiſh nation ſeemed moſt to have placed their dependence, has been compelled to ſurrender the Flower of the Britiſh Army, to our immortal Commander in Chief, muſt greatly encreaſe the flame of Gratitude, which had been before kindled in the Breaſt of every American, and which it will not be in the power of Time or Accident to extinguiſh. We perfectly concur in Sentiment with your Excellency, that from our Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this powerful and wiſe Monarch, we may expect, with well grounded Confidence, that our Independence will be ſhortly eſtabliſhed upon an immovable Baſis, nor need we harbour a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
