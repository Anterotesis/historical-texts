            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RISING GENERATION. A SERMON, PREACHED At the Deſire of the SELECTMEN, and the COMMITTEE for inſpecting the Town Schools: OCCASIONED BY THE DEDICATION Of a new and very commodious GRAMMAR SCHOOL HOUSE, lately erected in the First Pariſh of the Town of GLOUCESTER, ON THE 5th OF MARCH, 1795, BY ELI FORBES, A. M. AND PASTOR OF THE FIRST CHURCH OF CHRIST IN SAID TOWN. And now made public at the Deſire of the Hearers in general.</p>
            <q>The father of the righteous ſhall greatly rejoice; and he who begetteth a wiſe child ſhall have joy of him. Thy father and thy mother ſhall be glad, and ſhe who beareth thee ſhall rejoice. My ſon, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes obſerve my way.

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM xlv. 16.</bibl>
               <q>INSTEAD OF THY FATHERS SHALL BE THY CHILDREN, WHOM THOU MAYEST MAKE PRINCES IN ALL THE EARTH.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS pſalm is an illuſtration of many other prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which relate to the Meſſiah, the Prince, and points him out more expreſſly than any other chapter or pſalm in the Old Teſtament. It ſpeaks of the royalty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his perſon; the extenſiveneſs of his victories; the righteouſneſs of his government, of which there would be no end: for his kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and his dominion ruleth over all.</p>
            <p>And, that though in this world his ſubjects would be continually moving off the ſtage, increaſing the number of the dead; yet, that they would be ſucceeded by riſing generations, who ſhould come in their room; who, by making greater improvements in knowledge and virtue, under better advantages for light, truth and grace, may riſe to honour in the preſent, and arrive to the dignity of kings, and the ſanctity of prieſts, in the future world; ſo, in the ſenſe of our text, be made princes in all the earth. So, we may conſider our text as a prophecy, containing a promiſe which aſcertains the increaſing glory of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Redeemer among men; for it implies, that, by improving clearer light and richer privileges of grace, and the bleſſings of the goſpel, the ſucceeding generations of men may arive to greater purity of morals, and dignity of character, and be made princes in all the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028687_0004_0FDA526F8C85AC58"/>
Our text alſo implies, that there will be a ſucceſſion of men, who ſhall reſtore the waſtes of mortality; that the earth ſhall not want inhabitants: but the various depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tments, both in civil and ſocial life, ſhall be filled with hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and fidelity; and not only ſo, but that there ſhall be a ſucceſſion of good men; for both the prophecy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our text reſpect the future happy reign of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> when he ſhall have, as the reward of his ſufferings, a ſeed to ſerve him, who ſhall be accounted unto the Lord for a generation of the righteous; and opens to the eye of faith, an extenſive ſpread of religion to unborn nations; when the ſublime maxims of piety and morality ſhall be generally received, and operate as univerſal principles of true virtue, which ſhall raiſe the dignity of human nature; that, in however high or low offices they may be called to act, they will fill their ſtations with honour; that, in the language of our text, they may be princes in all the earth; that it may be ſaid of all the earth, as it was of Tyre, "Her merchants ſhall be princes and her traffickers or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks ſhall be the honourable of the earth, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxiii. 8.</p>
            <p>When we reflect upon the time, the manner and the views, with which our pious anceſtors left the land of their nativity, and ſought a retreat from the iron hand of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and oppreſſion in theſe wilds of America, which, from time immemorial, had been overſpread with moral dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, heathen barbarity, and Indian idolatry; and as they brought the goſpel and the means of knowledge with them, and were influenced by its ſacred maxims, the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt was ſoon ſpread—the worſhip of God eſtabliſhed—ſchools were erected—ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries planted—colleges founded by them; but as they were not allowed to "continue by reaſon of death," in the room of theſe pious fathers were their children, who piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained theſe inſtitutions: being nurſed in thoſe ſeminar<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> they became "plants of renown," who being tranſplanted into the church and ſtate, where they ſhone with honor; ſome in the higher and more public offices of life; and others, being inſtructed in the lower and more common branches of literature, have been bred to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028687_0005_0FDA527370ED11F8"/>
navigation, and the mechanical arts, and moving in a humbler yet not leſs uſeful ſphere; but whenever either the higher or the lower departments have been uniformly influenced, directed and reſtrained by the nobler principles of true virtue, they have appeared princely in all the earth: ſo that at the diſtance of more than two thouſand years from the publication of this prophecy and promiſe, we have ſeen them fulfilling, down to the preſent day; ſo that we are living witneſſes of their truth and importance; for we are in the room of our fathers, and here we ſee our children forming, and by the various grades of education riſing into reſpectability, and will ſoon take our places, and we muſt leave them our room, and deſcend to the bed of duſt—"when our ſons may riſe to honour, and we ſhall know it not; or they may be brought low, and we ſhall not perceive it of them." But if we are not wanting to ourſelves, to our children, or to ſociety, we may hope that this ſcripture will be more completely fulfilled, and the kingdom of the Redeemer will ſoon have a more extenſive ſpread than it ever yet has had; and that in the room of the fathers there will be children, who may ſucceſſively ariſe and declare his righteouſneſs unto thoſe who may be born of them.</p>
            <p>But prophecies and promiſes do not prevent or ſuperſede human endeavours; but they are deſigned to encourage duty, to ſtimulate noble exertions, and ſupport and brighten future hopes. Therefore, animated by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and promiſe, that God will have a ſeed to ſerve him, and that in the room of the fathers ſhall be the children, who, by the improvement of clearer light and more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed priveleges, may appear in their ſeveral ſtations to advantage, <hi>princes in all the earth,</hi> let us do what we can to promote the education of our children. Particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould be paid to youth, the riſing generation, that they be well inſtructed, religiouſly educated, and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and wiſely governed. The education of children was always the firſt thing our pious forefathers attended to; after they had got a ſettlement in this land, they, like Abram, firſt built an altar, fixed on a place for public
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028687_0006_0FDA5276434C7B80"/>
worſhip, and then erected ſchools for the education of their children.</p>
            <p>So long ago as in 1633, the firſt ſettlers of this town conſecrated a houſe for public worſhip, and ſoon after made proviſion for a ſchool, as being in their view of importance to ſociety, next to that of worſhipping God in a public and ſocial manner, placing the duty we owe to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren next to that we owe to our God: therefore, when new townſhips were laid out or incorporated, care was taken that lands were ſequeſtrated firſt for the encouragement and benefit of the goſpel miniſtry, and then ſchool lots for the benefit and ſupport of free ſchools:—ſo alſo particular care was taken that all inſtructors of ſchools were men of capacity, piety, and good morals. Thus it is evident that the idea that our forefathers had of a ſchool education, was that it ſhould be <hi>religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed without the heart is well eſtabliſhed on the principles of religion, the moſt enlightened head will be of little uſe to ſociety, and of leſs advantage to the perſons themſelves; they will not be princes in the earth, will not fill the ſtations they are called to occupy with honour;—men of learning, without the balance of virtuous principles, will be likely to prove peſts to ſociety, and accumulate to themſelves infamy and ruin. Suffer me then, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to recommend it to all whoſe buſineſs it is, or may be, to provide inſtructors and governors of ſchools, that they employ none but thoſe who are equal to the truſt, and of ſober lives and converſation; men of principle, and who in the judgment of charity are good men. And I would recommend to all maſters and inſtructors of ſchools, that they pay particular attention to the morals of the ſchools, over which they preſide; that they inform the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and impreſs the heart; for though without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the heart cannot be good, yet the moſt extenſive knowledge, without the regulating principles of religion, will not make the heart better, nor reform the life. It is of the laſt importance then, that a religious caſt ſhould be given to all ſchool education; and this importance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes out of the nature and reaſon of things, and it is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028687_0007_0FD9BBD4A8CC6988"/>
to us from the words of our text; for the children are to come in the room of their fathers, and to act a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part—<hi>princes in all the earth;</hi> adopt a line of conduct in whatever department they ſhall be called to act in, that may be an honour to themſelves, ſupport the dignity of the human character, be, and appear to be, the ſons of God, the diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and friends to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and ſo, in the ſenſe of our text, be made princes in all the earth.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to add—it is of importance that youth be religiouſly inſtructed; for it is through them that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and good morals are to be tranſmitted to poſterity: they are our hopes, and we expect to live in them. Now to ſupport theſe pleaſing hopes, it is neceſſary that they ſhould come upon the ſtage with their minds well informed in all the various branches of uſeful knowledge, and their hearts well eſtabliſhed by the operation of the principles of true virtue.</p>
            <p>We all love to have our children wiſe and good. Thoſe who are vicious themſelves, love to have their children ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the world under every advantage, and to act an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable part in the ſphere where Providence ſhall place them, and ever approve themſelves wiſe, virtuous and good; good members of the ſociety to which they may belong.</p>
            <p>And I do not think that any one of us can reliſh the thought with pleaſure, that religion, good order and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both civil and religious, ſhall die in the hands of our children; that the cauſe for which our anceſtors left their native country, and for which our late fathers and breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren have fought, bled and died, ſhould be loſt in the hands of the next generation: and without they are well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well governed, their heads well furniſhed with uſeful knowledge, and their hearts under the regulating princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of piety and morality, we ſhall have no ſecurity of the cauſe in their hands. No one can well conceive how much, under God, depends upon the character of our children, both with reſpect to themſelves and to ſociety at large: and we can ſcarcely realize the refined pleaſure it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028687_0008_0FDA527C2B47B640"/>
muſt afford a tender and well diſpoſed parent, when they can look forward, and on good grounds hope, that their children will riſe up and take their places and fill them with honour, and, in the ſtyle of our text, be made princes in all the earth. With ſuch a proſpect the parental heart leaps for joy, for they have no "greater joy than that of ſeeing their children walk in the truth." When they ſee them formed to this amiable temper, to this honourable and uſeful character, they can leave the world in peace; or like that pious father of old, who called his children round about his dying pillow, and ſaid, behold I die; but God ſhall be with you, and make you princes in all the earth, ornaments to ſociety, an honour to themſelves, and the glory of future generations.</p>
            <p>I think we may, in the faithful diſcharge of the duties incumbent upon us to the preſent generation, ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in the prophecy and promiſe of God, that in our room ſhall be our children, who, by a better improvement of the privileges and advantages they do, or they may enjoy, in this day of ſcience and land of liberty, may, under the transforming hand of knowledge and grace, be made, in the ſenſe of our text, princes in all the earth.</p>
            <p>We ſhall cloſe the preſent diſcourſe with addreſſes adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the preſent occaſion.</p>

                        <p>You have done well in the attention you have paid to, and the proviſion you have made for, the education of your children; and, agreeable to the votes of the reſpective bodies you repreſent, have erected houſes ſo reſpectable

and convenient, for that purpoſe: and I will aſſure you, that it gives me pleaſure to find that you have connected the idea of religion with the purpoſes for which you built thoſe houſes, therefore invited me to aſſiſt you in dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to God. It was at the deſire of the truſtees of the Proprietors' School, that we opened their houſe with a dedicatory prayer and a ſhort addreſs to the ſchool.</p>
                        <p>We have this day<note n="*" place="bottom">Fifth of March, 1795, and the order of proceſſion was as follows:—The Schools begun the proceſſion from the Meeting Houſe—firſt the Proprietors' School walked in claſſical order two and two, and their preceptor, Mr. Thomas Saunders, brought up their rear; next to him the Town Grammar School, in the ſame order; theſe were followed by their preceptor, Mr. Obadiah Parſons; who was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the gentlemen of the town—then the Truſtees of the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors' School—the Committee of Inſpection next—after them the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectmen; laſt of all the Clergy of the town. In this order the whole body moved on to the newly erected School Houſe, which was now finiſhed, ready to be improved. When the front of the Proprietors' School reached the door, the whole ſtopped, and, opening to the right and left, the Clergy moved on through the ranks, followed by the Selectmen, and ſo on, till the whole were placed in the moſt decent order in the School Houſe—then a dedicatory prayer was addreſſed to the Father of Lights—then all returned in the ſame order to the Houſe of God, where each one occupied the ſeat aſſigned him by mutual and previous agreement, exhibiting one of the moſt pleaſing ſcenes the mind of man can well imagine, and a very ſtriking contraſt with that diſmal day, the 5th of March, 1770, when Boſton ſtreets reeked with the blood and carnage of our fellow citizens, when every heart was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every face gathered blackneſs—now every heart was elate with joy, and every countenance teemed with hope.</note> met, and in ſolemn proceſſion went to the Town Grammar School Houſe, newly erected for the beneficent deſign of the religious education of our children, and in a ſolemn and religious manner conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to God, imploring the divine acceptance of it, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the divine preſence into it, and humbly aſked the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing upon it; that it may become a ſeminary of virtue as well as of the moſt uſeful learning; that plants of renown may be tranſplanted from hence, both into the Church and State, and be a ſeed who may ſerve the Lord, and continue to bring forth fruit even to old age, and be accounted unto the Lord for the generation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

                        <p>You are engaged in an arduous and important work. It is not without its honours and its pleaſures; it is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "to bend the twig, and to teach the ſhoot how to grow;" it is the higheſt honour to be the moſt extenſively uſeful.</p>
                        <p>This town, confiding in you, have committed to your charge and care their moſt precious treaſure; their future hopes, which reſpect the honour of their families, the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit of ſociety, and the public intereſt; theſe dear children are committed to your care, that you may make them princes in all the earth, i. e, that you may form them to knowledge, virtue and uſefulneſs;—make them good men and good members of ſociety.</p>
                        <p>If you are faithful, how far the happy influence of your inſtructions may extend, no one can tell. There is at leaſt a high probability, that you will ſucceed: for there is a divine proverb which implies a divine promiſe, "Train up a child in the way that he ſhould go, and when he is old he ſhall not depart from it."</p>
                        <p>It is evident that the propagation of religion, virtue and good order will depend, under God, very much upon the influence which your inſtructions will have upon the minds of youth, who are, or may be, under your care. It will in general form their future conduct, and give a caſt to their whole deportment through life, wherever they may be ſpread through all the earth:—not only ſo, but they will carry your principles of conduct into ſocial and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic

life. When they form families of their own, they will, moſt likely, make it their principal aim to form their families upon the ſame model; that a thouſand deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who never ſaw your faces, nor heard of your names, may owe their honour, their religion, and their happineſs, to the influence of your inſtructions, your counſels, your government and prayers;—God may ſucceed your honeſt and faithful endeavours, and by you tranſmit uſeful knowledge, and religion in its native purity, to the lateſt poſterity. But if, on the other hand, you ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to your truſt, and theſe dear children, or others who may ſucceed them, ſhould be neglected, and grow up in ignorance and vice, not ſubject to government and order, deſtitute of the principles of virtue; when they form ſocial connections, and enter upon the ſtage of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic or civil life, they will be likely to form upon the ſame model, that, inſtead of being princes in all the earth, they will be peſts to ſociety, and diſſeminate the ſeeds of infidelity and irreligion as far as their influence may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: and the ill conſequences, how far ſoever they may reach, may, in part, at leaſt, be charged to your account, for we are to be "rewarded according to the fruit of our doings." That your reward may be great, and your honeſt, prudent and faithful labours may be crowned with ſucceſs, ſuffer me, in the laſt place, to recommend it to you, that you pray with and for your ſchools; not only becauſe all ſucceſs depends upon the bleſſing of God, which is to be drawn down by ſerious, frequent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer, eſpecially where we have to do with the heart, but alſo becauſe prayer is one very important and eſſential branch of religious education, and which, therefore, never ſhould be omitted, either in families, where there are children and ſervants, or in ſchools, where there muſt be line upon line, and precept upon precept. When your children ſee and hear you in a ſerious and ſolemn manner addreſs their great Creator, as the ſupreme and moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world, and the fountain of goodneſs, they will learn to form right apprehenſions of his moral and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral character; their dependence upon him, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                        <p>Moſt of you have been publicly dedicated to God, and theſe hands of mine have adminiſtered the ſacred rite to you. I feel tenderly intereſted in your happineſs, as I have, I truſt, ſincerely conſecrated you to God under the form of his initiating ordinance, under which your parents alſo engaged to bring you up for him. In the diſcharge of thoſe engagements they have erected houſes with every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and have placed you under inſtructors who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028687_0014_0FDA528CBA0086A8"/>
may form you to knowledge and virtue, and make you princes in all the earth. You have now a price put into your hands, to get wiſdom; therefore get wiſdom, and with all thy getting get underſtanding. If you do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the advantage you now enjoy, you will offend God, injure your parents, and wrong your own ſouls. You have heard that you are our hopes—that you are riſing up in our ſtead; for we are moving off the ſtage, and muſt ſoon make our bed in the duſt; for behold we die, but God will be with you if ye be with him; but if you forſake him, he will forſake you. You muſt fear God, love and ſerve him, and cry unto God, and ſay, "My Father thou art the guide of my youth." He has ſaid, "I love thoſe who love me, and they who ſeek me early ſhall find me." Seek the Lord then while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. You muſt love too the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who firſt loved us, and died for us, and roſe again from the dead, and is gone to heaven, and ever lives, praying for us. And will you not love him in return for the great love wherewith he has loved us? And will you not accept of him for your Saviour, truſt in him that you may be ſaved by him? He was once here on the earth; and though he was the Son of God, the brightneſs of his Father's glory, and had all power both in heaven and in earth, yet he condeſcended to take particular notice of youth, of little children, and kindly took them into his arms, and bleſſed them, and ſaid, "<hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi>" Come then to him, and lodge the ſalvation of your ſouls in his hands. He has ſaid, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will come unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt him out. The bleſſed Redeemer now ſtands with open arms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, and to make you the children of God, and the heirs of glory. You muſt aſk of God, in the name of Chriſt, to give you his holy ſpirit, to change your hearts, and ſanctify your natures, and to adorn your ſouls with the chriſtian graces, that you may ſhine as lights in this dark world, and be made meet for the inheritance of the ſaints in light. And God is as ready to give his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to them who aſk him, as we your parents are ready to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028687_0015_0FDA528F05F22BC8"/>
give you bread, or any thing elſe that is good for you. But if you ſhould forget your God, neglect your Saviour, and miſimprove your time, and run heedleſs on, with the thoughtleſs, vain and vicious youth, in the paths of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and folly, you will make bitter work for repentance, and wound the hearts of your parents and bring down their grey hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</p>
                        <p>But if you ſhould now improve your time, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages you have in your hand, you will riſe into honour; and when you ſhall enter upon the ſtage of life, you will appear to advantage, as princes in all the earth, the ſons of God, without rebuke. And having ſerved God and your generation, according to the will of God, you will meet the approbation of your Lord and Maſter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the rewards of his grace in the kingdom of glory.</p>
