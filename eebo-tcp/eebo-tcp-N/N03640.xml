            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WHOEVER reads the Goſpel with a ſingle Eye, and ſincere Intention, will find, that our Bleſſed Lord took all Opportunities of reminding his Diſciples that his Kingdom was not of this World; that <hi>his</hi> Doctrine was a Doctrine of the Croſs; and that their profeſſing themſelves to be his Followers, would call them to a conſtant State of voluntary or Self-ſuffering and Self-denial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004449_0004_100D822944DE5E50"/>THE Words of the Text afford us one Inſtance, among many, of our Saviour's Behaviour in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; For having in the preceding Verſes revealed himſelf to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, to be <hi>The</hi> CHRIST <hi>of</hi> GOD; leſt they ſhould be too much elated with ſuch a peculiar Diſcovery of his Deity, or think that their Relation to ſo great a Perſonage would be attended with nothing but Pomp and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; He tells them, in the 22d Verſe, That the Son of Man was to ſuffer many Things in this World, though He was to be crowned with eternal Glory and Honour in the next: And that if any of them, or their Poſterity, would ſhare in the ſame Honour, they muſt bear a Part with him in his Self-denial and Sufferings. For <hi>He ſaid unto them all, If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM which Words I ſhall conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> Things;
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Nature of Self-denial recommended in the Text; and in how many Reſpects we muſt deny ourſelves, in order to come after JESUS CHRIST.</item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to prove the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality and Reaſonableneſs of this Duty of Self-denial.</item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, I ſhall offer ſome Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which may ſerve as ſo many Motives to reconcile us to, and quicken us in the Practice of this Doctrine of Self-denial.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004449_0005_100D9DC20A27EE08"/>I. AND <hi>Firſt,</hi> then, I am to ſhew the Nature of the Self-denial recommended in the Text; or in how many Reſpects we muſt deny ourſelves, in Order to follow JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>NOW as the Faculties of the Soul are diſtinguiſhed by the Underſtanding, Will, and Affections; ſo in all theſe muſt each of us deny himſelf. We muſt not <hi>lean to our own Underſtanding,</hi> being <hi>wiſe in our own Eyes, and prudent in our own Sight</hi>; but we muſt ſubmit our ſhort-ſighted Reaſon to the Light of Divine Revelation: For there are Myſteries in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which are above, though not contrary to, our natural Reaſon: and therefore we ſhall never become Chriſtians unleſs we caſt down <hi>Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the Knowledge of GOD, and bring into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of CHRIST.</hi> It is in this Reſpect, as well as others, that we muſt <hi>become Fools for CHRIST's Sake,</hi> and acknowledge we know nothing without Revelation, as we ought to know. We muſt then, with all Humility and Reverence, embrace the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Truths revealed to us <hi>in the Holy Scriptures,</hi> for thus only can we become truly Wiſe, even <hi>Wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> It was Matter of our Bleſſed Lord's Thankſgiving to his heavenly Father, that he had <hi>hid theſe Things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and had revealed them unto Babes.</hi> And in this Reſpect alſo we muſt <hi>be converted and become as little Children,</hi> teachable, and willing to follow the Lamb into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Myſteries he ſhall be pleaſed to lead us; and believe and practiſe all divine Truths, not becauſe we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004449_0006_100D9DC8A8AF40B0"/>
can demonſtrate them, but becauſe GOD, <hi>who cannot lie,</hi> has revealed them to us.</p>
            <p>HENCE then we may trace Infidelity to its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Head: For it is nothing elſe but a Pride of the Underſtanding, an Unwillingneſs to ſubmit to the <hi>Truth of GOD,</hi> that makes ſo many, profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wiſe, to become ſuch Fools as to deny <hi>the Lord who</hi> has ſo dearly <hi>bought them</hi>; and diſpute the Divinity of that Eternal Word, <hi>in whom they live, and move, and have their Being:</hi> Whereby, 'tis juſtly to be feared, they will bring upon themſelves ſure, if not ſwift, Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>BUT to return: As we muſt deny ourſelves in our Underſtandings, ſo muſt we deny, or, as it might be more properly rendered, renounce our Wills; that is, we muſt make our own Wills no Principle of Action, but <hi>whether we eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we do, we muſt do all,</hi> not merely to pleaſe ourſelves, <hi>but to the Glory of GOD.</hi> Not that we are therefore to imagine we are to have no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in any Thing we do, (Wiſdom's <hi>Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs</hi>) but pleaſing ourſelves muſt not be the principal, but only the ſubordinate End of our Actions.</p>
            <p>AND I cannot but particularly preſs this Doctrine upon you, becauſe it is the grand Secret of our Holy Religion. It is this, my Brethren, that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the True Chriſtian from the mere Moraliſt and formal Profeſſor; and which alone can render any of our Actions acceptable in GOD's Sight;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004449_0007_100D9DC64645FCD0"/>
For <hi>if thine Eye be ſingle,</hi> ſays our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, If thou aimeſt ſimply to pleaſe GOD <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> any Regard to thy own Will, <hi>thy whole <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> that is, all thy Actions, <hi>will be full of Light</hi>; agreeable to the Goſpel, which is called <hi>Light:</hi> But <hi>if thine Eye be evil,</hi> if thine Intention be diverted any other Way, <hi>thy whole Body,</hi> all thy Actions, <hi>will be full of Darkneſs,</hi> unprofitable, and capable of no Reward. For we muſt not only do the Will of GOD, but do it <hi>becauſe</hi> it is his Will; ſince we pray that GOD's <hi>Will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> And, no doubt, the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels not only do every Thing that GOD willeth, but do it chearfully, out of this Principle, becauſe GOD willeth it: And if we ſhould live as we pray, we muſt <hi>go and do likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT farther; as we muſt renounce our own Wills in <hi>doing,</hi> ſo likewiſe muſt we renounce them in <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> the Will of GOD. Whatſoever befalls us, we muſt ſay with good old <hi>Eli, It is the LORD, let him do what ſeemeth him good</hi>; or with one that was infinitely greater than <hi>Eli, Father, not my Will, but thine be done.</hi> 
               <q>O JESU, thine was an innocent Will, yet Thou renouncedſt it: Teach us, even us alſo, O our Saviour! to ſubmit our Wills to thine, in all <hi>the Evils</hi> which ſhall be <hi>brought upon us</hi>; and <hi>in every Thing</hi> enable us to <hi>give Thanks,</hi> ſince it <hi>is</hi> thy bleſſed <hi>Will concerning us!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY, and laſtly, we muſt deny ourſelves, as in our Underſtandings and Wills, ſo likewiſe in our Affections. More particularly, we muſt deny
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004449_0008_100D9DCBA4366A90"/>
ourſelves the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Indulgence and Self-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Riches: <hi>If any Man will come after me,</hi> ſays our bleſſed Lord, <hi>he muſt forſake all and follow me.</hi> And again (to ſhew the utter Inconſiſtency of the Love of the Things of this World with the Love of the Father) he tells us, that <hi>unleſs a Man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FAR be it from me to think that theſe Texts are to be taken in a literal Senſe, as though they obliged rich Perſons to go ſell all that they have, and give to the Poor, (for that would put it out of their Power to be ſerviceable to the Poor for the future) but, however, they certainly imply thus much, that we are to ſit looſe to, ſell, and forſake all in Affection, and be willing to part with every Thing, when GOD ſhall require it at our Hands: That is, as the Apoſtle obſerves, we muſt <hi>uſe the World, as though we uſed it not</hi>; and though we are <hi>in the World,</hi> we muſt not be <hi>of</hi> it. We muſt look upon ourſelves as Stewards, and not Proprietors of the manifold Gifts of GOD; provide firſt what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ourſelves and our Houſholds, and expend the reſt, not in Indulgences and ſuperfluous Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, forbidden by the Apoſtle, but in clothing, feeding, and relieving the naked, hungry, diſtreſſed Diſciples of JESUS CHRIST. This is what our Bleſſed Lord would have us underſtand by forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, and in this Senſe muſt each of us deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible that this will ſeem <hi>an hard Saying</hi> to many, who will be offended becauſe they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004449_0009_100D9DCDA365B0F8"/>
and <hi>Lovers of Pleaſure more than Lovers of God:</hi> But <hi>if I yet pleaſed</hi> ſuch <hi>Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt.</hi> No, we muſt not, like <hi>Ahab</hi>'s falſe Prophets, have a <hi>lying Spirit in our Mouths,</hi> nor fail to <hi>declare</hi> (with St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>the whole Will of GOD</hi>; and, like honeſt <hi>Micaiah,</hi> out of Pity and Compaſſion, tell Men the Truth, though they may falſely think <hi>we prophecy not Good, but Evil concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed: As we muſt renounce our Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Riches, ſo likewiſe our Affections for our Relations, when they ſtand in Oppoſition to our Love of and Duty to, GOD: For thus ſaith the Saviour of the World: <hi>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his father and Mother, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Brethren and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>—Strange Doctrine this! What, hate our own Fleſh? What, hate the Father that begat us, the Mother that bare us! <hi>How can theſe Things be?</hi> Can GOD contradict himſelf? Has he not bid us Honour our Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And yet we are here commanded to hate them. How muſt theſe Truths be reconciled? Why, by interpreting the Word <hi>hate,</hi> not in a rigorous and abſolute Senſe, but <hi>comparatively:</hi> not as imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a total Alienation, but a leſs Degree of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

of ſuch our Friends (as for our Trial they may be permitted to be) are contrary to the Will of GOD, we muſt ſay with <hi>Levi,</hi> we <hi>have not known</hi> them; or, agreeable to our Bleſſed Lord's Rebuke to <hi>Peter, Get you behind me,</hi> my Adverſaries; <hi>for</hi> you <hi>ſavour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Head: We muſt deny ourſelves in Things indifferent; For it might eaſily be ſhewn, that as many, if not more, periſh by an immoderate Uſe of Things in themſelves indifferent, as by any groſs Sin whatever. A prudent Chriſtian therefore will conſider not only what is <hi>lawful,</hi> but what is <hi>expedient</hi> alſo; not ſo much what Degrees of Self-denial beſt ſuit his Inclinations here, as what will moſt effectually break his Will, and fit him for greater Degrees of Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>BUT, is this the Doctrine of Chriſtianity? And is not the Chriſtian World then aſleep? If not, whence the Self-Indulgence? Whence the reigning Love of Riches which we every where meet with? Above all, whence that predominant Greedineſs of ſenſual Pleaſure, that has ſo over-run this ſinful Nation? that was a pious Stranger to come among us, he would be tempted to think ſome Heathen <hi>Venus</hi> was worſhipped here, and that Temples were dedicated to her Service. But we have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an inſpired Apoſtle to affirm that they who live in <hi>ſuch a Round of Pleaſure are dead while they live:</hi> Wherefore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and CHRIST ſhall give thee Light.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004449_0011_100D9DD3242B4318"/>
But the Power of raiſing the ſpiritually Dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only unto GOD.
<q>Do Thou therefore, O Holy JESUS, who by thy almighty Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> to come forth, though he had lain in the Grave <hi>ſo many</hi> Days, ſpeak alſo as effectually to theſe ſpiritually dead Souls, whom <hi>Satan</hi> for theſe many Years has ſo faſt bound by ſenſual Pleaſures, that they are not ſo much as able to lift up their Eyes or Hearts to Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. BUT I paſs on to the <hi>Second</hi> general Thing propoſed; <hi>viz.</hi> To conſider the univerſal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Reaſonableneſs of this Doctrine of Self-denial.</p>
            <p>WHEN our Bleſſed Maſter had been diſcourſing publickly concerning the Watchfulneſs of the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wiſe Steward,</hi> his Diſciples aſked him, <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou this Parable to all, or only to us?</hi> The ſame Queſtion, I am aware, has been, and will be, put concerning the foregoing Doctrine: For too many, unwilling to take CHRIST's eaſy Yoke upon them, in order to evade the Force of the Goſpel Precepts, would pretend, that all thoſe Commands concerning Self-denial, renouncing ourſelves and the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed only to our LORD's firſt and immediate Followers, and not <hi>to us or to our Children.</hi> But ſuch Perſons <hi>greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> nor the Power of Godlineſs in their Hearts. For the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST, like his Bleſſed Self, is <hi>the ſame Yeſterday, To-day, and for ever.</hi> What he ſaid unto <hi>one,</hi> he ſaid unto <hi>all,</hi> even unto the Ends of the World; <hi>If any Man will come after

me, let him deny himſelf:</hi> And in the Text it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned that <hi>He ſaid unto them all.</hi> And leſt we ſhould ſtill abſurdly imagine, that this Word <hi>all</hi> was to be confined to his Apoſtles, with whom he was then diſcourſing, it is ſaid in another Place, that JESUS turned unto the Multitude and ſaid, <hi>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, yea, and his own Life alſo, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</hi>
               <q>When our Bleſſed LORD had ſpoken a certain Parable, it is ſaid, the Scribes and Phariſees were offended, for they knew the Parable was ſpoken againſt them: And if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians can now read theſe plain and poſitive Texts of Scripture, and at the ſame Time not think they are ſpoken of them, they are more hardened than <hi>Jews,</hi> and more inſincere than Phariſees.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Law<hi>'s Chriſtian Perfection.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Former Part of this Diſcourſe, I obſerved, that the Precepts concerning forſaking and ſelling all did not oblige us in a literal Senſe, becauſe, the State of the Church does not demand it of us, as it did of the Primitive Chriſtians; but ſtill the ſame Deadneſs to the World, the ſame abſtemious Uſe of, and Readineſs to part with our Goods for CHRIST's Sake, is as abſolutely neceſſary for, and as obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory on us, as it was on them. For though the Church may differ as to the outward State of it, in different Ages, yet, as to the Purity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward State, it was, is, and always will be, invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the ſame. And all the Commands, which we meet with in the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> about mortifying our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004449_0013_100D9DD786DEC230"/>
Members which are upon the Earth, of ſetting our Affections on Things above, and of not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to this World; are but ſo many inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proofs that the ſame Holineſs, Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Deadneſs to the World, is as neceſſary for us as for our LORD's immediate Followers.</p>
            <p>BUT farther, as ſuch an Objection argues an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Scriptures, ſo it is a manifeſt Proof that ſuch as make it are Strangers to the Power of Godlineſs <hi>in their Hearts.</hi> For ſince the Sum and Subſtance of Religion conſiſts in our Recovery from our fallen Eſtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> by a New Birth in CHRIST JESUS, there is an abſolute Neceſſity for us to embrace and practiſe the Self-denial before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. Becauſe, we have not only a new Houſe to build, but an old one firſt to pull down; we muſt, neceſſarily, therefore be dead to the World, before we can <hi>live unto GOD.</hi> In ſhort, all Things belonging to the <hi>Old Man</hi> muſt die in us, before the Things belonging to the <hi>Spirit</hi> can live and grow in us.</p>
            <p>WHEN JESUS CHRIST was <hi>about</hi> to make his publick Appearance, and to preach the Glad Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Salvation to a benighted World, his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> was ſent <hi>to prepare his Way before him.</hi> In like Manner, when this ſame JESUS is about to take Poſſeſſion of a Converted Sinner's Heart, <hi>Self-denial,</hi> like <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Way before him: For we muſt mourn before we are capable of being comforted; we muſt undergo the <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> in order to be made meet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the <hi>Spirit of Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004449_0014_100D9DDAC373ED28"/>WERE we, indeed, in a State of Innocence, and had we, like <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, the Divine Image fully ſtamped upon our Souls, we then ſhould have no Need of Self-denial; but ſince we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, ſickly, diſordered Creatures, and this Self-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this Self-renunciation is the <hi>indiſpenſable Means</hi> of <hi>recovering</hi> our Primitive Glory; methinks, in that Caſe, to endeavour to ſhake off and reject ſuch a ſalutary Practice, on Account of the Difficulty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it at firſt, is but too like Obſtinacy of a perverſe ſick Child, who <hi>nauſeates</hi> and <hi>refuſes</hi> the Potion reached out to it by a ſkilful Phyſician or tender Parent, becauſe it is a little ungrateful to the Taſte.</p>
            <p>HAD any of us ſeen <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when <hi>he lay full of Sores, at the Rich Man's Gate</hi>; or <hi>Job,</hi> when <hi>he was ſmitten with Ulcers, from the Crown of his Head to the Sole of his Foot:</hi> And had we at the ſame Time preſcribed to them ſome healing <hi>Medicines,</hi> which, becauſe they would put them to Pain, they would not apply to their <hi>Wounds,</hi> ſhould we not moſt juſtly think, that they were either fond of a diſtempered Body, or were not ſenſible of their Diſtempers? But our Souls, by Nature, are in an infinitely more deplorable Condition than the Bodies of <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when full of Ulcers and Boils: For, alas! our <hi>whole Head is ſick,</hi> and our <hi>whole Heart is faint; from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, we are full of Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifying Sores, and there is no Health in us.</hi> And JESUS CHRIST, like a good Phyſician, in the Goſpel Doctrine of Self-denial, preſents us with a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004449_0015_100D9DDD24D4C1B8"/>
ſpiritual <hi>Medicine to heal our Sickneſs</hi>; but if we will neither receive nor apply it, 'tis a Sign we are not ſenſible of the <hi>Wretchedneſs</hi> of our State, or elſe that we are <hi>unwilling to be made whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVEN <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Servants could ſay, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, <hi>purſuant to Elijah</hi>'s <hi>Orders,</hi> to waſh in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he might cure his Leproſy, <hi>Father, if the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great Thing, would'ſt thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he ſaith unto thee, Waſh and be clean?</hi> And may not I, very properly, addreſs myſelf to you in the ſame Manner, my Brethren: If JESUS CHRIST, our Great Prophet, had bid you do ſome great and very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Thing, would you not have done it? much more then ſhould you do it, when he only bids you deny yourſelves, what would certainly hurt you, if enjoyed; and behold, you ſhall be <hi>made perfectly whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to illuſtrate this by another Compariſon; In the 12th Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we read that Saint <hi>Peter was kept in Priſon, and was ſleeping between two Soldiers, bound with Chains: And behold an Angel of the Lord came upon him, and ſmote Peter on the Side, ſaying, Ariſe up quickly: and his Chains fell off from his Hands.</hi> But had this great Apoſtle, inſtead of riſing up quickly, and doing as the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel commanded him, hugg'd his Chains, and begg'd that they might not be let fall from his Hands, would not any one think that he was in Love with Slavery, and deſerved to be <hi>executed</hi> next Morning? And does not the Perſon who refuſes to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004449_0016_100D9DDF8EC68820"/>
act as inconſiſtently as this Apoſtle would have done, if he had neglected the Means of his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? For our Souls, by Nature, are in a ſpiritual Dungeon, ſleeping and faſt bound between the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, not with Two, but Ten Thouſand Chains of Luſts and Corruptions. Now JESUS CHRIST, like St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s good Angel, by his Goſpel comes and opens the Priſon Door, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Self-denial, Mortification, and Renunciation of ourſelves and the World, as ſo many ſpiritual Keys which will unlock our <hi>Shackles,</hi> make them fall off from our Hearts, and ſo reſtore <hi>us</hi> to the <hi>Glorious Liberty of the Sons of GOD.</hi> But if we will not ariſe quickly, <hi>gird up the Loins of our Mind,</hi> and deny ourſelves, as he has commanded; Are we not in love with Bondage, and deſerve never to be <hi>delivered</hi> from it?</p>
            <p>INDEED, I will not affirm that this Doctrine of Self-denial appears in this juſt Light to every one. No, I am ſenſible that to the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> it is <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi>; and to the <hi>Young Convert, an hard Saying.</hi> But what ſays our Saviour? <hi>If any Man will do my Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of GOD, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf.</hi> This, my dear Friends, is the beſt, the only Way of Conviction: Let us up and be doing: Let us ariſe quickly and deny ourſelves, and the Lord JESUS will remove thoſe Scales from the Eyes of our Mind, which now like ſo many Veils, hinder <hi>us</hi> from ſeeing clearly the Reaſonableneſs, Neceſſity, and inexpreſſible Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Doctrine that has been now delivered. Let us but once thus <hi>ſhew ourſelves Men,</hi> and then
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004449_0017_100D9DE1C8155218"/>
the <hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> will <hi>move</hi> on the Face of our Souls, as he did once <hi>upon the Face of the</hi> great <hi>Deep</hi>; and cauſe them to emerge out of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Chaos, in which they are moſt certainly now involved, if we are Strangers and Enemies to <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>the Croſs of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding this Doctrine of <hi>Self-denial is,</hi> when rightly underſtood, ſo reaſonable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; yet many, it is to be feared, like the young Man in the Goſpel, are ready to go away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p n="3">III. PROCEED we, therefore, now to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> general Thing propoſed; <hi>viz.</hi> To offer ſome Conſiderations which may ſerve as ſo many Motives to reconcile us to, and <hi>quicken us</hi> in the Practice of this Duty of <hi>Self-denial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. AND the <hi>firſt</hi> Means I ſhall recommend to you, in order to reconcile you to this Doctrine, is, to meditate frequently on the Life of our Bleſſed Lord and Maſter JESUS CHRIST. Oh! may we <hi>often</hi> think on Him, our Grand Exemplar! follow him from his Cradle to his Croſs, and ſee what a <hi>ſelf-denying Life</hi> He lead! And ſhall not <hi>we drink of the Cup that He drank of, and be baptized with the Baptiſm that He was baptized with?</hi> Or think we, that JESUS CHRIST did and ſuffered every Thing in Order to have us excuſed, and exempted from Sufferings? No, far be it from any ſincere Chriſtian to judge after this Manner! For St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>He ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004449_0018_100D9DE447E20160"/>
that we ſhould follow his Steps.</hi> Had CHRIST, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, like <hi>thoſe that ſat in Moſes's Chair, laid heavy Burthens</hi> of <hi>Self-denial</hi> upon us (ſuppoſing they were heavy, which they are not) and refuſed to <hi>touch them himſelf with one of his Fingers</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we might have had ſome Pretence to complain; but ſince He has enjoined us nothing, but what he has firſt put in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice himſelf, <hi>Thou art inexcuſable,</hi> O Diſciple, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art,</hi> who wouldeſt be above thy perſecuted ſelf-denying Maſter: And thou art no good and faithful Servant, who art unwilling to ſuffer and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with thy mortified, heavenly-minded LQRD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. NEXT to the Pattern of our Bleſſed Maſter, think often on the Lives of the glorious Company of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the goodly Fellowſhip of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and the noble Army of <hi>Martyrs</hi>; who, by a conſtant <hi>looking to the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, have fought the good Fight, and are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us to inherit the Promiſes.</hi> View, again and again, how holily, how ſelf-denyingly, how unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably they lived: And if Self-denial was neceſſary for them, why not for us alſo? Are we not Men of like Paſſions <hi>with them?</hi> Do we not live in the ſame wicked World as they did? Have we not the ſame Good Spirit to aſſiſt, ſupport, and purify us, as they had? And is not the ſame Eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance reached out, as a Reward of our Self-denial and Renunciation of the World, as was offered to them? And if we have the ſame Nature to change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame wicked World to withſtand, the ſame Good Spirit to help, and the ſame Eternal Crown to reward our Obedience; why ſhould we not lead
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004449_0019_100D9DE75CE3D7F0"/>
the ſame Lives as they did? Do we think They did Works of Supererogation? If not, why don't we do as they did? Or why does the Church ſet apart Feſtivals to commemorate the Deaths and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Saints, but in order to excite us <hi>to follow them as they did CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THIRDLY, Think often on the Pains of Hell: Conſider whether it is not better to cut off a Right Hand or Foot, and pluck out a Right Eye, if they offend us (or cauſe us to ſin) <hi>rather than to be caſt into Hell, into the Fire that never ſhall be quenched; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi> Think how many Thouſands there are now reſerved, with damned Spirits, in Chains of Darkneſs unto the <hi>Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> for not complying with the Precept in the Text. And think withal that This, this muſt be our own Caſe ſhortly, unleſs we are wiſe in Time, and ſubmit to thoſe eaſy Conditions our Saviour has preſcribed us, in Order to avoid it. Think you they now imagine JESUS CHRIST to be an hard Maſter; or rather think you not they would give Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand Worlds, could they but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Life again, and take CHRIST's eaſy Yoke upon them? And can <hi>we</hi> dwell with everlaſting Burnings more than <hi>they?</hi> No; if we cannot bear this Precept, <hi>Come, deny yourſelves, take up your Croſſes,</hi> How ſhall we bear that irrevocable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Depart from me, ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels?</hi> But I hope thoſe, amongſt whom I am now preaching the Kingdom of GOD, are not ſo diſingenuous as to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004449_0020_100D9DE919B38760"/>
need to be driven to their Duty by the Terrors of the LORD, but rather deſire to be drawn by the Cords of Love.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, therefore, and to conclude,—Often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the Joys of Heaven: Think, think, with what unſpeakable Glory thoſe happy Souls are now incircled, who, when on Earth, were called to deny themſelves as well as we, and were not diſobedient to that Call: Lift up your Hearts frequently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Manſions of eternal Bliſs, and with an Eye of Faith, like the great Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſee the Heavens opened, and the Son of Man with his glorious Retinue of departed Saints, ſitting and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing themſelves in eternal Joys, and with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Comfort looking back on their paſt Sufferings and Self-denials, as ſo many glorious Means which exalted them to <hi>ſuch a Crown.</hi> Hark! methinks I hear them chanting forth their everlaſting <hi>Halelujahs,</hi> and ſpending an eternal Day in ecchoing forth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Songs of Joy. And do you not long, my Brethren, to join this heavenly Choir? Do not your Hearts burn within you? <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks,</hi> do not our Souls <hi>ſo long after</hi> the bleſſed Company of theſe <hi>Sons of GOD?</hi> Behold then a heavenly Ladder reached down to you, by which you may climb to this Holy Hill. <hi>If any Man will come after</hi> them, <hi>let him deny himſelf and follow</hi> them. It was this, my Brethren, exalted the Holy JESUS Himſelf, as Man, to ſit at the Right Hand of his adorable Father. By this alone every Saint that ever lived, <hi>aſcended into the Joy of their LORD:</hi> And by <hi>this</hi> we, even <hi>we</hi> alſo, may be
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004449_0021_100D9DEB54182658"/>
lifted up into the ſame moſt bliſsful Regions, there to enjoy an eternal Reſt with the People of GOD, and join with them in ſinging <hi>Doxologies</hi> and <hi>Songs of Praiſe,</hi> to the Everlaſting, Bleſſed, All-glorious, moſt Adorable Trinity, for ever and ever.</p>
