            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN apology for the appearance of theſe ſheets at the preſent period, may be conſidered as needleſs by ſome, whilſt others view them as an intruſion on the public, and declare them ill-timed and unneceſſary; but, to one who has the real good and proſperity of the Church at heart, their appearance <hi>at this time</hi> is deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indiſpenſibly requiſite, when it is undeniably true, that "by far the greater part of thoſe who enter into the miniſtry, do not preach agreeably to the articles which they have ſubſcribed;" perhaps without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or duly conſidering what are <hi>the doctrines of our excellent Church.</hi>

            <p>AND another inducement may be particulariſed, which ariſes from obſervation, that many well-meaning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, through want of inſtruction in <hi>theſe doctrines,</hi> miſtake the <hi>form</hi> of Godlineſs for Religion, and the <hi>works</hi> of the Law for the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the <hi>only</hi> way of life and ſalvation, to their own misfortune, and the injury of Chriſtianity.</p>

            <head>THE DOCTRINES <hi>of the</hi> CHURCH, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY is a pure, perfect, rational, conſiſtent ſyſtem; it is a revelation worthy of the God of Truth and Wiſdom to diſpenſe; its doctrines have a direct tendency to moralize the powers and faculties, and to ennoble and dignify the human nature; it ſets its true profeſſors free from ridiculous abſurdities and enthuſiaſtic deluſions; for its divine Author taught no doctrines, enjoined no precepts, but ſuch as will bear the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny, and muſt be owned, by every truly wiſe and judicious perſon, to be well adapted and nicely calculated, at once to diſplay the power and mercy of God, as well as to enrich, conſolate and make happy the mind of every true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But how an inſtitution, thus wiſely deſigned, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed, ſhould be ſo greatly miſtaken, ſo unhappily perverted, and ſo groſsly miſrepreſented <hi>at this day,</hi> is no leſs ſurpriſing than true; and therefore how much to be deplored and lamented! But why is this? How muſt we account for the many deluſive te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and deſtructive errors, which are induſtriouſly propagated by a ſet of <hi>modern teachers,</hi> and readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by ſo many profeſſors of Chriſtianity? How! why, as the Papiſts miſtakingly aſſert ignorance to be the mother of devotion, we may truly ſay, ignorance is the parent of error, folly and deluſion. But to what
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025405_0005_0FCD2670A44431E8"/>
kind of ignorance may we aſcribe the miſtakes of the teachers, and the folly of the people in being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Doubtleſs to an ignorance of the word of God, the Holy Scriptures, which are the only ſure guide, the beſt ſtandard, and the moſt certain criterion, whereby to diſcern truth from falſehood, right from wrong; but through neglect of ſearching thoſe ſacred pages, the poor people eaſily become a prey to every ignorant <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic preacher</hi> who comes in their way. Hence we ſee ſuch a plentiful production of novel doctrines, and ſuch an abundant fruitfulneſs of extravagant follies and deſtructive errors, which are ſo prevalent among us.</p>
            <p>Men, bretheren and fathers, ſee ye not what an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of error and deluſion hath broken in upon us? Obſerve ye not the overflowings of immorality and vice, which, like a torrent, is overſpreading our land? Can ye be unconcerned, when the dreadful effects, and baneful conſequences are ſo viſible and evident? Alas! <hi>Virtue</hi> reclines her fainting head; <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has loſt its powerful influence upon its profeſſors; and therefore the practice of morality and good works is ſo much neglected, ſo little attended to. Surely it is too plain to be denied, the true principles of the Goſpel are forſaken. O ye miniſters! ye profeſſed teachers and inſtructors of mankind! will <hi>ye</hi> not attempt to ſtem the rapid torrent, which threatens to carry all before it? There is no way left, but to <hi>retreat</hi> to the primitive doctrines of the Goſpel, the eſtabliſhed principles of the Reformation. Theſe, conſtantly inſiſted on and powerfully inculcated, will, nay, <hi>theſe</hi> only can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the happy effects of reclaiming the people from error, rectifying their principles, and effectually producing chriſtian practices. As for you, my bretheren, profeſſors of the ſame Goſpel, let me entreat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you, if you would be <hi>true proteſtants,</hi> againſt the fallacy and deceit of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as you would deſire to be proof againſt all doctrines of novelty, all
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025405_0006_0FCD2673EF44CCB0"/>
erroneous principles, all dangerous and deluſive tenets; would you perceive and detect, ſo as to beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving teachers, falſe prophets, hypocritical and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended miniſters: in one word, are ye ſolicitous to come to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jeſus, that ye may be ſaved? SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES; make this your conſtant practice; for be aſſured, ye are in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt danger of being miſled and deceived, never more ſo than at preſent. On the one hand, by the proud, ſelf-preſuming, God-reſiſting <hi>infidel;</hi> on the other, by the credulous, unſcriptural, unmeaning <hi>enthuſiaſt.</hi> While the former is an open enemy to the doctrines of the Goſpel, totally rejects every article of the chriſtian faith, acts as far wide from the moralizing precepts of the Goſpel, as from humility; the latter, <hi>the enthuſiaſt,</hi> deceives himſelf and others by his mere pretences to <hi>inſpiration;</hi> profeſſes to have received the gift of the Spirit, but gives <hi>no evidences</hi> to aſcertain the truth of it; makes ſolemn declarations of being <hi>inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> to preach to you, and only <hi>pretends</hi> to pray to God for ſpiritual operations, influences, and impreſſions; when after all, it is plain to the eye of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reaſon, he means nothing but to make gain of his pretenſions to Godlineſs; for, contrary to his moſt ſolemn pretenſions and profeſſions, <hi>he utterly denies any true, real, inward motive, operation, and influence of the Spirit:</hi> and hence do ſuch miniſters bewilder, perplex, and delude the ignorant and unwary, by teaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, unſcriptural doctrine.</p>
            <p>Take heed to yourſelves. Beware of ſuch pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teachers, for you are liable to be led by ſuch into a maze of anti-chriſtian errors, and a wilderneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural perplexities; ſo that your danger, through their means, may not eaſily be eſcaped, nor ever rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. It is not a trifling affair I am now addreſſing you about, but it is of the utmoſt concern, and of the greateſt importance: no leſs than your immortal ſouls
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025405_0007_0FCD26750C035528"/>
are at ſtake—nothing leſs than an eternity depends upon your being <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi> For your ſakes, and from a regard to your ſafety, ſuffer me here to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the truly ſcriptural orthodox articles of the eſtabliſhed Church of England, which, as they are a kind of epitome, or abridgement of the Goſpel, I ſhall ſelect ſuch of them as may beſt ſerve our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; namely, to try and examine doctrines and teachers by, to detect error and diſcover truth. By theſe let us determine our aſſent to, or diſſent from ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines as are propoſed to us, and I am verily perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we ſhall eſcape error, avoid deluſion, and be freed from miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a fond attachment to our excellent articles of the Church of England, may influence me rather to fix on this form of ſound words than any other of human compoſition. Be it ſo; I am (I think) herein juſtified, foraſmuch as theſe articles are ſupported by, and built upon the Holy Scriptures: therefore I am unconcerned what our <hi>modern</hi> teachers, and new-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended divines think or ſay of me; if they diſlike, and are aſhamed of our articles, I am not: for all our Chriſtian Biſhops, (God bleſs them!) and all our Church Parſons, (Lord have mercy on them!) <hi>they</hi> all own, or have owned them, and ſubſcribed to them; yes, and <hi>ſworn</hi> to them alſo; and they are printed in our Common-Prayer Books too;<note n="*" place="bottom">They are omitted in the laſt American edition. A commencement, the reſult of which I fear.</note> and for what uſe think ye but that we ſhould read them, know them, be inſtructed in them, and always abide by them? God grant, bretheren, that we may! for if we have any knowledge and experience of the great truths they contain, vain will be all the artful attempts, ſubtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and nefarious ſtratagems of men deſtitute of the truth, to miſlead, pervert, or delude us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now lay the articles before you—make ſome
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025405_0008_0FCD267687AAB908"/>
ſtrictures upon them, and draw ſome applications from them as I go along. God give us a right judgment. We begin with the doctrine <hi>of Original or Birth Sin,</hi> Art. IX.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Original ſin ſtandeth not in the following of <hi>Adam,</hi> (as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> do vainly talk) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man, that is gendered of the offspring of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby man is far gone from original righteouſneſs, and is of his own nature inclined to evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This the Pelagians of old denied, and this the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Pelagians,</hi> who pretend to great knowledge, while ignorant of themſelves, and ſtrangers to the corruption and depravity of their own hearts, <hi>diſown.</hi> Though, at the ſame time, they are ſtanding monuments of the truth of this doctrine, and whether they believe and confeſs it, or not, their outward actions plainly evince the inhering power of original ſin; their not ſeeing, not knowing, and not <hi>feeling</hi> it, is one of the ſtrongeſt proofs of their being under original blindneſs and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. And yet, many ſuch as theſe truly ſet up for guides and teachers of others. Know them, bretheren; diſcern them you may, you ought; and ſuch, for your ſoul's ſake avoid. Attend not to their ſweet ſiren ſongs, leſt you are thereby lulled aſleep upon the waves of deſtruction. Take theſe marks with you. Judge of their doctrines by them: for our articles plainly declare the miſerable ſtate and condition of every man that is born into the world; firſt, in the loſs of original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or the image of God; and ſecondly, as poſſeſſed with a contrary image; therefore is he of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inclined to evil. Here behold the true picture of the <hi>ſo much boaſted</hi> dignity of human nature! Thus is man pointed out by the article; thus is man deſcribed by the oracles of truth; and to this melancholy account doth every Chriſtian ſubſcribe, and every natural, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man's actions fully demonſtrate. Aye, but,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025405_0009_0FCD26781087C020"/>
ſay our <hi>new doctors</hi> and <hi>modern teachers,</hi> this is too dark a ſhade, too ſable a dreſs, too degrading to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore they tickle the ears, pleaſe the pride, and flatter the vanity of men, with <hi>their</hi> unedifying, unſcriptural harangues, and falſe encomiums on the moral rectitude, virtue, and <hi>dignity of man.</hi> But, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, would ye not avoid an unſkilful <hi>quack</hi> in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, who, inſtead of ſearching and probing a wound in order to procure the ſoundneſs and health of the body, ſhould ſlightly heal and ſkin over the parts aggrieved, while putrefaction and rottenneſs are at the bottom, whereby the life of the patient is deſtroyed? <hi>Quacks in divinity</hi> are much more to be dreaded, inaſmuch as the life of the ſoul is of infinitely more value than that of the body. I have heard our <hi>true, ſtaunch church mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> diſtinguiſh theſe flatterers of human nature by the appellations of <hi>merit-mongers, velvet-mouthed preachers,</hi> &amp;c. Significant indeed! <hi>St. Paul</hi> deſcribes ſuch, as thoſe who <hi>ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies,</hi> and with fine words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple: for as they don't preach agreeable to the articles, ſo neither do they uſe ſcripture language, nor apoſtolic diction, in their compoſitions.—Our article next declares—</p>

            <p>What a terrible harſh phraſe is here?

the doctrine of ſcripture, and thoſe venerable compilers ſpake as <hi>the oracles of God.</hi> And is it not better, far better, for ſinners to hear and be made ſenſible of their danger, and <hi>deſerving of God's wrath and damnation,</hi> ſo as to eſcape it <hi>now</hi> by flying to Jeſus, the only refuge for ſinners, than to be blinded by flattering deceivers, till they fall a ſacrifice to God's wrath and damnation in a dreadful eternity hereafter?

            <p>But our article further declares, "this infection of nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated." <hi>Regenerated!</hi> how?

            <p>As the former article ſhews the wretchedneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our eſtate by nature, the next (10) aſſerts the helpleſſneſs and inſufficiency of our condition.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The condition of man ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is ſuch, that he cannot turn and prepare himſelf by his own natural ſtrength and good works, to faith and calling upon God.

He is too polite to dictate the old ſcriptural anſwer, <hi>believe on the Lord Jeſus,</hi> but <q>practiſe morality, and do good works, and you are ſafe.</q>—And, was you to reply in the words of the article of our Church, Sir, I have no power to do good works, pleaſant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Chriſt—<q>Don't teaze me, (would very probably be the reply) don't tire me with your methodiſtical rant, and enthuſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical nonſenſe.</q>—Man's power, natural ability, and free-will, are his favourite themes, inſtead of free-grace, ſupernatural power, divine and ſpiritual aſſiſtance. Lord have mercy on the ſheep that are under the care of ſuch a ſhepherd! Now, whatever honour and reſpect is due to the miniſters of Chriſt, how much ſoever we are to eſteem ſuch highly in love for their <hi>works ſake;</hi> yet our Saviour points out to us, and cautions us againſt <hi>blind guides</hi> and <hi>falſe teachers.</hi> To the law and to the teſtimony then—And if miniſters <hi>ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſacred oracles of truth,</hi> we may fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they have no light in them. Therefore it is our greateſt wiſdom, to reject their doctrines as unſcriptural and erroneous.</p>
            <p>But, bretheren, let me plainly and briefly apply my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to you on the two foregoing articles. Do ye know yourſelves? Are ye ſenſible of your real eſtate? Are ye made acquainted with your true condition? Do ye know and feel your miſery and want as ſinners? Are ye made ſenſible of your own weakneſs and inſufficiency to turn and prepare yourſelves? Do you ſee your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and proneneſs to all evil and ſin, and your averſion and diſaffection to all holineſs and godlineſs, and conſequent need of a better righteouſneſs than your own to juſtify you in the ſight of God? If you do not, have not thus ſeen yourſelves ſtript of all good, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025405_0013_0FCD267E9A982AA0"/>
full of all evil, <hi>deſerving God's wrath and damnation,</hi> it is plain you are blind even unto this day; and further, have never prayed in all your life. Nay, don't ſtart; it is plain truth; you cannot, you dare not deny it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and your own conſcience; for prayer is a breathing out the deſires of the ſoul before God, under a ſenſe of diſtreſs, and the want of mercy, and an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dependence on God for relief and redreſs. But how could you pray to be delivered from ſin, evil, and danger, when you never ſaw it, never <hi>felt it,</hi> and was never ſenſible of it, and conſequently could have no deſires to be delivered from it?</p>
            <p>But you ſay you have gone to church, and prayed. That you have gone to church, and repeated the ſolemn words of our excellent liturgy, is not denied; but even then and there you offered the ſacrifice of fools, and ſolemnly mocked God, while you pretended to addreſs and worſhip him; elſe how could you dare to tell God you was a <hi>miſerable ſinner,</hi> deſire him to have mercy upon you, tell him there is <hi>no health in you,</hi> that you are <hi>tied and bound with the chain of your ſins,</hi> and <hi>that the remembrance of your ſins is grievous unto you, and the burden is intolerable,</hi> while you neither feel nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſuch a ſtate? Surely the moſt dreadful hypocriſy is this! the moſt fatal and dangerous deluſion poſſible!</p>
            <p>But, if not only your heads are enlightened, and your judgments informed, but your hearts alſo truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and humbled before the Lord, with a view of yourſelves as deſcribed by our ſcripture articles; bleſſed knowledge! happy ſenſibility! for this you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the divine grace and heavenly teachings of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> of whom you learn to <q>caſt away all human confidence, all dependence on the arm of fleſh only, and to fly to Chriſt for help and ſuccour— with a <hi>Lord ſave,</hi> or we periſh; for the heart of man, by nature eſtranged and alienated from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> would try every other means, and ſeek
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025405_0014_0FCD267F8F430B20"/>
for ſalvation in any way, rather than accept it as a <hi>free gift</hi> from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To caſt away all ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is grievous to the heart in its natural ſtate of pride, and affection of independency; man would ſtill be as God, ſtill work out, and merit for himſelf his own ſalvation; and he muſt be driven to the laſt extremity, ſee the inſufficiency of law and ſelf, of <hi>morality</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> before he <hi>can</hi> caſt away all <hi>other confidence,</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> with a <hi>Lord ſave,</hi> or <hi>I periſh.</hi> It is faith alone which can avail the ſoul, and thus we muſt apply, if we would obtain the gift of God in Chriſt, utterly renouncing all ſelf-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and perfectly aſſured, that he is able and willing to ſave to the uttermoſt.</q>

They will neither court the ſmiles, nor fear the frowns of the men of this world; neither will they be ſo afraid of the faces of men as to be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt; inaſmuch as they, by happy experience, know it is the power of God, to the ſalvation of their own ſouls: therefore, all ſuch as KNOW THE TRUTH, AS IT IS IN JESUS, will not ſhamefully retreat from, deny, or give it up, but boldly preach IT; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <q>We (all true believers) are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, by faith, and not for our own works or deſervings; wherefore, that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by FAITH ONLY, is a moſt wholeſome doctrine, and very full of comfort, as is more largely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Homily of juſtification.</q>

            <p>Here is <hi>true</hi> proteſtant, anti-romiſh doctrine. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the Miniſters of our Church that know and preach thus! Happy every ſoul that can ſet his ſeal to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025405_0015_0FCD2681C1DA74F0"/>
the truth of theſe words! God will ſuffer no fleſh to glory in his preſence; therefore, in the juſtification, pardon, and acceptance of a ſinner, he will magnify the riches of his free-grace; for, to be juſtified <hi>freely,</hi> through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, and to be accounted righteous through the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>only,</hi> is the only doctrine that can yield comfort and conſolation to penitent humble ſinners, and glory and praiſe to the God of Mercy and Grace. But <q>no, <hi>ſay our modern theologiſts,</hi> it is by our own good works and faith; Chriſt's blood, righteouſneſs and merits, are not ſufficient of themſelves to avert the wrath, procure the power, and recommend our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the acceptance of God.</q> Be aſtoniſhed, O heavens! be amazed, O ye ſons of God! be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, O ye enemies of true righteouſneſs! at the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, and pride of relying on, or joining the <hi>imperfect works,</hi> and ſullied obedience of fallen man, with the perfect righteouſneſs, all-atoning merits, and all-ſufficient ſacrifice of the infinitely divine and holy Jeſus! O how long will ye thus pervert the ways of the Lord! How long will ye trample on the precious blood, depreciate the only availing righteouſneſs, and ſet at nought the all-prevailing merits of the ſinner's friend, the dear and loving Jeſus! Be filled, O my ſoul! be warmed, O my friends! with a holy indignation at the daring inſult, and impious affronts that are offered to Jeſus, your Saviour, and your God, whoſe blood and righteouſneſs is your only plea!</p>
            <p>We don't preach juſtification by <hi>faith only,</hi> ſay the Papiſts. We are agreed with you, ſay their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in error, our <hi>pretended proteſtant,</hi> but <hi>ſeducing</hi> preachers. But why? becauſe it tends to deſtroy good works; ſay <hi>both.</hi> It is falſe, ſays our Church; we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the contrary, ſay all its <hi>true</hi> Chriſtian members. But truly the Papiſts teachers are honeſt, upright men, when compared with theſe modern deceivers: for it is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025405_0016_0FCD268439447DF0"/>
the avowed tenet of their Church, to deny and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the doctrine of juſtification, by the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt through faith only—but our only pretended <hi>proteſtant</hi> teachers aſſent to it, in the articles of our Church, <hi>as a moſt wholeſome doctrine, and very full of godly comfort,</hi> and yet afterwards publicly preach and inveigh againſt it, and brand and ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <hi>the CONTENDERS</hi> for this ſcripture-truth, as <hi>a ſet of madmen, enthuſiaſts, and deceivers.</hi> Surpriſing indeed is ſuch a ſhare of aſſurance! Amazing ſuch want of modeſty! Is this a ſpecimen of good works, reverend ſirs? Alas! alas! where is common honeſty, candid judgment, and impartial determination fled? O how can ſuch miniſters look on this article without being filled with ſhame and confuſion of face! The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are clear and expreſs, that ſinners are juſtified by the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, imputed to them through faith, and by no other means; therefore this is a moſt WHOLESOME DOCTRINE. And the glorious company of the Apoſtles, the noble army of Martyrs, and all true <hi>believers,</hi> in all ages, have found, by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py experience, that this doctrine is alſo VERY FULL OF GODLY COMFORT.</p>
            <p>But does our Church depreciate good works, or deny their uſefulneſs? No; neither do any of its <hi>true</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or members; they all aſſent to the doctrines of the XIIth Article, that</p>
            <p>
               <q>Good works are the fruits of faith, and follow after juſtification (not go before in order to procure juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they cannot put away our ſins, nor endure the ſeverity of God's judgment, yet are they pleaſing and acceptable to God in Chriſt, and do ſpring out neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily of a true faith, inaſmuch as by them a lively faith may be as evidently known, as a tree by its fruit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is the device of the devil to urge, and it ariſeth from ignorance of the nature of true chriſtian faith to object, that the doctrine of juſtification by faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025405_0017_0FCD26858D6BDE08"/>
the practice of morality and good works. Quite the contrary, for it is the peculiar property of true chriſtian faith to diſpoſe us to holineſs of heart, and to the practice of morality and good works.</p>
            <p>What a conſiſtency of doctrine! What a harmony of divine truth! What a chain of ſcripture-tenets do our excellent articles afford us! Thank God for <hi>ancient,</hi> orthodox, chriſtian compilers! From <hi>modern,</hi> hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, unchriſtian teachers, good Lord deliver us! and let all our Church members ſay, Amen!</p>
            <p>You ſee, bretheren, that good works are the fruits of faith. Have you received of God the gift of faith; faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby you are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified? Are your conſciences cleanſed from the guilt, and delivered from the condemnation of ſin? And do you poſſeſs pardon and peace from God? Then I am ſure you muſt love God; and love is the moſt powerful and availing principle to produce good works, <q>pleaſant and acceptable to God in Chriſt;</q> for only in Chriſt Jeſus is it our works are accepted. The beſt works we can perform cannot put away our ſins, and endure the ſeverity of God's judgment: <q>But good works ſpring out neceſſarily of a true faith:</q> they are true marks and evidences of a lively faith, as the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a tree is an unanſwerable proof of the life and ſoundneſs of the root. Hence we ſee by the plain ſenſe of the articles, that without faith in our Lord Jeſus no good works can be produced; and yet truly we find many, who pretend to be the only true orthodox teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Church, conſtantly exploding and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently denying the doctrine of <hi>juſtification by faith only.</hi> Therefore it is a plain conſequence and natural deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the only marks ſuch give of their <hi>orthodoxy</hi> is, that they have neither <hi>faith</hi> nor <hi>good works,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the noiſe they make about good works. And this is more fully proved by Article XIII. which aſſures us,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:025405_0018_0FCD268707FDCE90"/>All <q>works done before the grace of Chriſt, and the inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, foraſmuch as they ſpring not of faith in Jeſus Chriſt; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the ſchool-authors ſay) deſerve grace of congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; rather for that they are not done as God hath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of ſin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee what works are not good, not pleaſant in the ſight of God, even all ſuch as do not flow from right principles, namely, the grace of Chriſt, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of his Spirit,</hi> and faith. Ye pretended <hi>advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> for <hi>good works,</hi> what ſay ye to this? Deceive not yourſelves with ſpecious pretences; look to your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. As ſoon might we gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles, as to find chriſtian holineſs and good works flowing from unchriſtian principles.</p>
            <p>The grace of Chriſt and the <hi>inſpiration of the Spirit!</hi>— Why, this is the very mark and characteriſtic of an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt,</hi> to talk of being inſpired, ſay our <hi>modern teachers.</hi> But be aſſured, it is the only principle of true chriſtian knowledge and chriſtian practice: for <hi>the things of God knoweth no man, but by the Spirit of God, and if any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. Rom. viii. 9. Theſe are ſcriptural determinations. He is not <hi>a chriſtian</hi> who is not <hi>inſpired by the Spirit of God;</hi> neither are any works pleaſant and acceptable to God, but what ſpring from INSPIRATION, ſays our Church. INSPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATION ſignifies a breathing inward: What! Why, the vitality, power and graces of the Holy Spirit; and from this inward principle only, outward actions, good and pleaſant to God, and profitable to man, flow.</p>
            <p>But, to avoid prolixity, I ſhall not enlarge, as I find I have much exceeded my firſt intentions; but really our excellent articles afford ſuch a field of argument to ſupport truth, and detect error, that they are pleaſing and delightful themes to dwell on; though I do not

doubt but what I have advanced is ſufficient, in the judgment of <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>mere nominal</hi> Chriſtians, to determine me a <hi>Methodiſt</hi> and an <hi>Enthuſiaſt.</hi> Reader, let me appeal to thee: Have I ſtrained one ſentence of our articles from its natural ſenſe and plain meaning? Well, if for a ſteady adherence and firm attachment to the doctrines of the Church of England, I am account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Methodiſt,</hi> I am content; may I live and die A CHURCH OF ENGLAND METHODIST.—It is the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doctrines of our Church I am contending for; which, whoever does, will moſt aſſuredly have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Methodiſt.</p>
            <p>But let me expoſtulate a little on this head with <hi>our</hi> pretended Churchmen. You ſay, you profeſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I do the ſame: ſo far we agree. I believe the doctrines of her articles, which are eſſential to ſalvation, to be truly ſcriptural; therefore I own them, abide by them, and contend for them. Do you do the ſame? I fear not. Herein do we differ. Let us ſee; we will bring the matter to a ſhort iſſue: a few words will determine the point. I believe that <hi>man is very far gone from original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is of his own nature inclined to evil—That original ſin, in every perſon born into this world, deſerves</hi> GOD'S WRATH AND DAMNATION—<hi>That every man by nature is in this ſtate, without power to turn and prepare himſelf, to do good works acceptable to God.</hi> I believe, <hi>that it is only through the righteouſneſs of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that any are accounted righteous before God—That our own works and deſervings have no hand at all in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing God's favour, no cauſal influence upon a ſinner's juſtification in the ſight of God; but that we are juſtified, pardoned and accounted righteous through faith only, as apprehending and applying the merits and righteouſneſs of Jeſus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

be accepted:</hi> and that till a perſon <hi>is juſtified by faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually poſſeſſed of the grace of Chriſt, and really inſpired by the Holy Spirit, he doth not, he cannot pleaſe God.</hi> I believe <hi>the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt as neceſſary to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, as breath is to natural life; for as the body without breath is dead, ſo, whoever is not</hi> INSPIRED <hi>by the Spirit of Chriſt, is dead to God, and the things of God.</hi>

The happy privileges which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for, and doth enrich all true Chriſtians with, you are pleaſed to look on only as religious madneſs and deluſion. And yet, how amazingly inconſiſtent your principles! What a ſcene of abſurdity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is your practice! At church, in the words of our Church prayers, you aſk and beſeech God to beſtow thoſe very bleſſings upon you, which you only eſteem as the flights of phrenzy, and term inexplicable feelings, and the diſorders of a diſtempered brain. Alas, Sir, where is that ſober reaſon and cool argument you pretend to? Where that candour of judgment and juſt determination you talk of? Let who will be deceived, you are wrong: your <hi>public</hi> profeſſion and practice give full evidence againſt you; and by them you are condemned.</p>
            <p>What then, bretheren, avails all your contending for the <hi>Church,</hi> and calling yourſelves members thereof? Do you value yourſelves becauſe you have not <hi>left</hi> your pariſh church, changed your religion, and <hi>turned metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts?</hi>

Poor deluded profeſſors! not changed your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion you ſay? Alas, you have your religion ſtill to ſeek: you only profeſs—you know not what: you have only a name to live, while you are dead, dead to God and to the things that make for eternal peace. I wiſh you calmly to conſider theſe things. May the Lord, in mercy to your precious ſouls, open your eyes to ſee that hitherto you have aſſumed a name, which in no wiſe belongs to you, and reſted in the mere ſhadow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity <hi>only;</hi> while you to this day remain utterly ignorant of the truths of the Goſpel in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and deſtitute of the experience of any ſaving influences of them on your hearts and lives. Miſerable ſtate! unhappy deluſion! And yet, to treat with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt perſons who act a far wiſer and more conſiſtent part than yourſelves, is ſurely ſtrange and abſurd indeed!</p>
            <p>Would to God my friends, yea the worſt enemies I have, would for their own ſakes lay theſe things to heart <hi>now.</hi> Then would they no longer fight againſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the precious truths of the Goſpel, which the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious company of the Apoſtles taught, and the noble army of Martyrs ſealed with their blood; which the Church ſtill maintains, and every true Chriſtian is happy in the experience of. But whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, animated by <hi>theſe</hi> conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am in nothing terrified by adverſaries; I am content, yea I rejoice, that I am counted worthy to be a deſpiſed ſervant, and follower of a deſpiſed Lord and Saviour. To be owned and confeſſed by the King of Saints, the Lord of Life and Glory, the Judge of quick and dead, and at a time too when the eternal ſtate of every ſoul is ſuſpended upon the breath of his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; when thoſe who have been aſhamed of Chriſt denied him and his words—are calling for the rocks and mountains to fall upon them to cover them from eternal and inſupportable wrath; I ſay, <hi>then</hi> to be owned with approbation by God, before angels, men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;

ſurely this thought is enough, and it makes me ready to welcome reproach, and triumph in diſgrace for Chriſt and his Goſpel's ſake.</p>
            <p>The being branded with the ſo much dreaded name of a METHODIST, is to me but little. A <hi>Methodiſt!</hi> why, really, 'tis a ſimple, inoffenſive name, and I don't ſee any reaſon to be aſhamed of it; for I have often thought, (and it is well worth notice) that the world don't uſually fix this appellation upon perſons of an openly wicked and ſcandalouſly ſinful life. Hence a <hi>gaming, pleaſure-taking, playhouſe-frequenting perſon,</hi> one who lives in debauchery and exceſs of drinking, is ſure to eſcape the name.</p>
            <p>Nor has a miniſter that name given him, who (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſolemn declarations, ſubſcriptions, and oaths to aſſent to and abide by the articles of our Church) preaches contrary to them, contends for juſtification by works inſtead of faith, is an enemy to the doctrine of imputed righteouſneſs, and from whoſe ſermons you too ſeldom hear the name of Jeſus, or the agency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Holy Spirit, unleſs utterly to deny, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt and explode all <hi>ſpiritual inſpiration</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feelings:</hi> theſe, and ſuch ſort of preachers eſcape the imputation of <hi>methodiſm.</hi>

            <p>Well, ſince it is plain that to be in principle and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice contrary to the ignorant, formal, ſinful, antichriſtian miniſters and profeſſors of the age, and to abide by and contend for the orthodox articles of our Church, are thought ſufficient to conſtitute a perſon a <hi>methodiſt;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, reader, here to preſent thee with the juſt and plain deſcription of what the world mean by a <hi>methodiſt.</hi>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:025405_0025_0FCD269249566568"/>We now perceive that the doctrine of Election is fairly deducible from the Liturgy; let us ſee what the fathers ſay about it.</p>
            <p>Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> (who certainly had a principal hand in the reformation) in the preface to his book againſt Biſhop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> writes thus: <q>Our Saviour Chriſt, according to the will of his eternal Father, when the time thereof was fully accompliſhed, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our nature upon him, came into the world from the high throne of his Father, to give light to them that were in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to preach and give pardon and full remiſſion of ſins to all his <hi>elected.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> another of the reformers, is more expreſs on this point. His words will help to illuſtrate thoſe of <hi>Cranmer.</hi> 
               <q>If thou art deſirous to know whether thou art <hi>choſen</hi> to everlaſting life, begin with Chriſt, and learn to know Chriſt; and try thyſelf whether thou art in the book of life or not.</q>

            <p>In the ſame diſcourſe he ſays, <q>What need I to mortify my body with abſtaining from all ſin and wickedneſs? I perceive God hath <hi>choſen</hi> ſome, and ſome are rejected: Now, if I be in the number of the choſen, I cannot be damned; but if I be accounted among the condemned number, then I cannot be ſaved; for God's judgments are immutable. <hi>Such</hi> fooliſh and wicked reaſons ſome have, which bring them either to carnal liberty, or to deſperation.</q>— And in another diſcourſe he ſays, <q>We read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that when St. Paul had made a long ſermon at Antioch, there believed (ſaith the Evangeliſt) as many as were <hi>ordained</hi> to eternal life. With the which ſaying a great number of people have been offended, and have ſaid, We perceive that thoſe only ſhall come to believe, and ſo to everlaſting life, which are <hi>choſen</hi> of God unto it; and therefore
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025405_0026_0FCD26948FEB2A30"/>
it is no matter whatſoever we do; for if we be choſen to everlaſting life, we ſhall have it.—And ſo they have opened a door to themſelves of all wickedneſs and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty, againſt the true meaning of the ſcripture.</q>

            </p>
            <p>The doctrine of abſolute predeſtination to life is at preſent little underſtood—<q>It has been ſo groſsly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented, and loaded with ſuch horrid conſequences, that by far the greater part of profeſſing Chriſtians will not give it a patient hearing. The very mention of it will fill their hearts with indignation, and their mouths with harſh expreſſions; which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without conſideration, and being repeated often, are ſuppoſed to be true, and ſo paſs for ſolid, concluſive arguments. What! would you make God the author of ſin? Can you ſuppoſe an infinitely merciful Being made ſo many creatures to be damned? What does it ſignify then how we live? for if we are to be damned we ſhall be damned, let us live ever ſo well; and if we
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025405_0027_0FCD26961939A058"/>
are to be ſaved we ſhall be ſaved, let us live ever ſo vilely. Theſe, and the like abſurdities, are ever ready to be poured out againſt it. On the other hand, the article ſays, <hi>They which be endued with ſo excellent a benefit of God,</hi> viz. of being predeſtinated to everlaſting ſalvation, as veſſels made to honour; <hi>they be made like the image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt; they walk religiouſly in good works:</hi> So that they who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to ſalvation, are likewiſe predeſtinated to holineſs. The Apoſtle ſays, 'God hath choſen us in him (Chriſt), that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love.' <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 4. 'God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit.' 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 13. They therefore who do not walk religiouſly in good works, deceive themſelves, and wreſt the ſcriptures to their own deſtruction, if they ſuppoſe they are predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated to everlaſting life, choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world. And they who, through faith in Chriſt, do walk religiouſly in good works, have not the leaſt reaſon to imagine they are not predeſtinated, or ſhall be damned; becauſe they are walking in the way which God hath appointed that all ſhall walk in, whom he hath choſen to everlaſting ſalvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That there is an abſolute, unconditional predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination of certain perſons to eternal life, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evident from the ſcriptures, and ſufficiently proved by the paſſages lately mentioned. It may not, however, be improper to add a few more. 'To ſit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give; but it ſhall be given to them of whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of my father.' <hi>Matt.</hi> xx. 23. 'Fear not, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flock; for it is your father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom.' <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 32. 'I give unto them eternal life; and they ſhall never periſh; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any pluck them out of my hand.' <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:025405_0028_0FCD26978B800BC8"/>
x. 28. 'Having predeſtinated us unto the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.' <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 5, 6. 'Who hath ſaved us, and <hi>called</hi> us by an holy calling <hi>not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our works,</hi> but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.' 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 9. 'God hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy.' <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 4. 'As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.'</q> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 48.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if a <hi>proper</hi> attention be paid to the doctrines contained in the <hi>articles,</hi> we ſhall find that theſe things muſt be ſo.—<q>For if we bring into the world ſuch a corrupt nature, as deſerveth God's wrath and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (Art. IX.)—if the condition of man after the fall is ſuch that he cannot, in his own ſtrength, turn unto faith and calling upon God (Art. X.)—if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are juſtified and made partakers of that grace, which will aſſuredly end in eternal glory; all that we are apt to call good works, <hi>are not pleaſant and acceptable to God, do not make us meet to receive his grace, but have the nature of</hi> ſin." (Art. XIII.)— How is it poſſible that any man ſhould be ſaved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God had ordained him to eternal life? But if God hath predeſtinated ſome to eternal life and not others, is there not injuſtice with him? By no means; for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God. The depravity of our nature deſerveth God's wrath and damnation: ſo that if he had left the whole human race to periſh, there would have been no injuſtice in him, for all deſerved to periſh. An inſtance of which vindictive, unrelenting juſtice, we have in the caſe of the fallen angels—Not one of thoſe many myriads of once glorious beings will be ſaved—Not one of them <hi>ever had,</hi> or <hi>will have</hi> the diſcovery of mercy made to him. Inſtead, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025405_0029_0FCD26990CA7C2E8"/>
of arraigning the Almighty of ſeverity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in ſuffering perhaps the greater part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to periſh in their ſins; we ſhould extol that mercy by which he hath predeſtinated ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions to eternal life, to the adoption of children, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace; when he might juſtly have left them to periſh as well as others, ſince they had as juſtly deſerved it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This frightful doctrine then of predeſtination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this: All mankind are by nature children of wrath—without ſtrength—enmity againſt God. The Almighty, who foreſaw this would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the fall, decreed from everlaſting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from curſe and damnation thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt to everlaſting ſalvation, and to leave the reſt to periſh in their ſins. When a king has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued his rebellious ſubjects, he grants a free pardon to ſome, and orders others for execution. Can you conceive he is guilty of injuſtice in ordering ſome for death when they have deſerved it? Are you not rather inclined to commend his clemency in ſparing ſome who have deſerved to die? Conſider mankind as fallen in Adam, and the caſe is exactly parallel. Unleſs you chooſe to look upon this as an exception, that of all who have heard the Goſpel of Chriſt, none will be found in the number of thoſe who were not predeſtinated to eternal life, but ſuch as have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves.</q>

            <p>Ah! ſays a conſtant church-goer, <q>I heard one of <hi>theſe</hi> preachers at our Church lately, where he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a ſermon about converſion, the new-birth, juſtification by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, inſpiration, and ſanctification of the Spirit, and a heap of ſuch—I know not what!—aye, and he ſaid <hi>downright,</hi> that all unconverted people were in a ſtate of damnation, and that nothing could ſave them from <hi>hell,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the Lord Jeſus; he really turned the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025405_0033_0FCD26A01E26FA98"/>
upſide down, for we are never uſed to ſuch ſort of doctrine; no, not we. But in the afternoon, <hi>our parſon</hi> preached a ſermon againſt all ſuch doctrines, for he is an enemy to all ſuch preachers and their principles; and though he was but <hi>little more</hi> than a quarter of an hour in his ſermon, yet he paid them off about their inſpiration and faith, &amp;c. and made us all eaſy again too: O, he's a pleaſing man! He told us, <hi>We were in no danger of going to hell, and that there was no fear of our being damned, for we are all very good chriſtians, if we but pay every one their own, and do as we would be done by.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Surely at <hi>this</hi> day, is that word fulfilled, THE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHETS PROPHESY FALSELY, AND THE PEOPLE LOVE TO HAVE IT SO. For truly, reader, the preaching of too many who call themſelves miniſters of our Church, is more like heatheniſh morality than ſcriptural chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>If by an enthuſiaſt is meant a deceiver, one that <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> himſelf and <hi>pretends</hi> to be what in reality he is not; I declare to you, reader, I do not know a worſe ſort of enthuſiaſm, nor a more dangerous ſet of enthuſiaſts and deceivers (deceivers both of themſelves and others; let common ſenſe and right reaſon determine the point) than <hi>thoſe miniſters,</hi> who ſolemnly profeſs to be inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt; pretend to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit at their ordination; aſſent, ſubſcribe, and ſwear to the articles of our Church, in which the neceſſity of inſpirarion is ſo ſtrongly inſiſted on; uſe the moſt excellent form of our Church Liturgy; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly pray to God for the inſpiration, guidance, and operations of the Holy Spirit: and yet after all this, (O dreadful hypocriſy before God! O amazing ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion!) can jeſt, jeer at, and ridicule all ſpiritual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and <hi>inward operations;</hi> and contemn the honeſt, faithful miniſters of our Church; for what? Why, only becauſe they preach conſiſtent with the avowed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025405_0034_0FCD26A14BD9D428"/>
tenets of that Church they profeſs themſelves miniſters of, and plainly declare ſuch doctrines as their Articles, Homilies and Liturgy fully ſet forth. Surely an honeſt heathen would bluſh at ſuch behaviour. No wonder ſuch are ſo much deſpiſed and ſet at nought, who make themſelves by their abſurdity ſo contemptible in the ſight of men.</p>
            <p>But it is urged againſt our truly reverend and Goſpel-miniſters, <q>That they are not content with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary operations of the Spirit, but they talk of and contend for the extraordinary and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; therefore they are <hi>enthuſiaſts.</hi>
               </q> This is falſe; they neither expect, nor ſee any neceſſity for the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: But they contend (agreeable to ſcripture) for the promiſed inward gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, to enlighten, convince, <hi>convert,</hi> and make happy the true Chriſtian, by his indwelling witneſs and comfortable preſence to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Neither are their pretenſions to inſpiration <q>
                  <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded</hi> and <hi>unwarranted,</hi> (as ſome object) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they are enthuſiaſts.</q> This kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion may be reduced to two ſorts, for <hi>matter</hi> and for <hi>manner.</hi> For <hi>matter,</hi> when perſons pretend to inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God for things contrary to ſcripture, which God hath given us as a ſtanding rule to the world's end. But our miniſters pretend to no ſuch inſpiration; ſeeing they conſtantly inculcate the doctrines of our Church which are agreeable to ſcripture: yea they preach ſuch inſpiration <hi>only</hi> which the word of God promiſes to every true Chriſtian. Therefore they are not enthuſiaſts.— For <hi>manner,</hi> when inſpirations are expected to exclude and ſupercede the uſe of reaſon, ſcripture, and all divine ordinances. Such as pretend to theſe are proper enthuſiaſts. But other, our faithful and orthodox mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preach the rational ſcripture doctrines of the Goſpel <hi>only.</hi> They don't ſet up heathen morality inſtead
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025405_0035_0FCD26A2C9449EA0"/>
of chriſtian practices, nor do they teach man's <hi>natural ability,</hi> to the excluſion of God's divine grace, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the <hi>works</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of ſinful man, in order to ſupercede and ſet at nought the meritorious ſacrifice and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. No: but they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on the reaſonableneſs of being endued with ſpiritual life, and ſpiritual power, in order to produce ſpiritual actions; they ſcripturally teach, that faith, and every other good gift and grace is of the Spirit's <hi>inſpiration;</hi> and they therefore direct ſouls to diligent attendance, and conſtant waiting on the ordinances, and to eſteem them as channels whereby God is uſually pleaſed to inſpire the ſoul with freſh ſupplies of divine grace and ſpiritual influences. Therefore they are not <hi>enthuſiaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By men of corrupt minds, deſtitute of the truth, all theſe ancient doctrines of the Bible and our Church, are now deemed <hi>new doctrines;</hi> the preachers of them are railed againſt as innovators, and ſome are bold to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, <q>that they draw the people away from the Church and cauſe ſchiſm.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">A learned man of our Church, Mr. Hales of Eaton (England) was wont to ſay ſchiſm and hereſy are theological ſcarecrows, that is, they are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made uſe of to terrify people without a cauſe.

the word of God, compares the doctrines of our Church with the Bible, and obſerves the great and fundamental truths therein contained, either very ſeldom preached, not preached at all, or, what is worſe, openly inveighed againſt, denied, and exploded;<note n="*" place="bottom">CONVERSION has been particularly ridiculed, and the doctrines of FREE GRACE diſowned.</note> ſuch as the inſufficiency of <hi>works</hi> to juſtify the ſinner; the merits and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord Jeſus, and juſtification through the ſame by faith; the neceſſity of inward holineſs and ſanctification by the Holy Spirit, &amp;c.—I ſay, when a perſon ſees the weight and importance of theſe ſacred truths, it is the very delight of his ſoul to hear them <hi>preached;</hi> he abides by the doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not by profeſſion <hi>merely,</hi> but through princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>chiefly.</hi> And it is eaſy to be accounted for that he takes ſome pains to follow the <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to attend the <hi>ſound</hi> of her doctrines at <hi>other churches;</hi> and that he thinks it an unhappineſs he can't hear them preached at his <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Doctor, you ſay 'tis wrong, and you blame people for going away from their own pariſh churches; <hi>but is it not worſe for you to forſake your own Church doctrines?</hi> 'Tis true, there are many who <hi>forſake</hi> the <hi>ſtone walls</hi> and buildings of their old churches: But why?

Not thoſe miniſters who preach the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Church of England, thoſe who have been the means more particularly of their ability to diſtinguiſh between the pure and impure doctrines offered them, nor thoſe who are ſo attached to the ſame as to <hi>follow</hi> them; but thoſe who drive them away from their own pariſh churches by preaching contrary to the venerable ſcripture truths, and cannot be content with the religion

            <p>Therefore let Clericus, and his bretheren, who are ſo often haranguing <hi>againſt ſchiſm</hi> and ſeparation, know, that the <hi>ſchiſm</hi> reverberates, and the charge of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recoils back upon themſelves, while they are guilty of ſchiſm in doctrine, and cauſe diviſions in the Church by ſeparating from the precious truths, the avowed tenets of our excellent eſtabliſhment. Say, are theſe friends to the Church? rather, are they not its greateſt enemies? Yes, notwithſtanding their pretended zeal for the Church, 'tis from ſuch as theſe that ſhe is in danger.<note n="*" place="bottom">Of ſuch miniſters the judicious Dr. Edwards thus writes in his Preacher, part 2. page 155—<q>I know there is a great cry among ſome men of late, that the Church is in danger, that it is falling, that it, ruin and deſtruction are approaching. And I ſay ſo too: but not as theſe men underſtand it: My meaning is, that our Church is in great jeopardy, by reaſon of the preſent degeneracy in doctrines. The orthodox faith of the Church of England is diſreliſhed, its legally eſtabliſhed articles are vilified, our old Engliſh divinity is rejected, and all our old epiſcopal divines are diſregarded. But thoſe very men who make that out-cry about the Church's failing, are the authors of this rejection and this diſregard. THEY ARE THE MEN that renounce the articles and determinations of our Church, and thereby ſhe is apparently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, and her ruin ſeems not to be far off. But in the ſenſe they mean it, (if they have any ſenſe) it is a falſe alarm, and a groundleſs fear, and the danger they talk of is imaginary.</q>

            </p>
            <p>But, there is one expedient, which, from my hearty zeal for our Church, and warm affection to the Clergy, I would humbly recommend to them—(O that they may be influenced to put it in practice!)—It is this, to preach conſtantly, maintain ſteadily, and inculcate fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently the eſtabliſhed doctrines of our Church, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truths of the reformation. Now, who would think there could be any objection to this method?

ſo much conſcience as to think ſolemn promiſes, oaths, and ſubſcriptions are binding and obligatory upon them.</p>
            <p>O, may the Lord of the harveſt increaſe the number of ſuch faithful, conſcientious labourers! for from ſuch a practice, what bleſſed effects would follow! <hi>Ignorant</hi> profeſſors would be inſtructed in the ſaving doctrines of the Goſpel; the <hi>true</hi> members of our Church would be eſtabliſhed in <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and preſerved from being miſled by error and perverted by deluſion; a glorious ſpirit of reformation would ſoon overſpread our land, and true religion, and the practice of morality and good works, would much more abound.</p>
