            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WITH recent deep-felt ſenſibility, and the moſt reſpectful tokens of filial reverence, we relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed our ſecular concerns, to lament his ſudden, eventful death; ſummoned by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed knell, the funereal dirge, and agon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing peals from yonder celebrated eminence,<note n="*" place="bottom">WHERE the battle of <hi>June</hi> 17, 1775, was fought, and on which is a <hi>Monument,</hi> in memory of Gen.

            <p>SELDOM is the morning of life devoted to the engagements of our riper years; with pleaſing expectation we enter the alluring threſhold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the numerous intricate windings, which conduct us through the extenſive edifice, unmindful of an inevitable, uncertain exit; but different was the caſe before us; with a firm athletic conſtitution, a capacious, vigorous mind, aided by the advantages of a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, he was taught the uſeful arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, for which, he was ever after, a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed advocate; and acquiring unuſual habits of induſtry, method and perſeverance, had ſcarcely arrived at manhood, when deſignated by the government of his native province, for the execution of hazardous, important enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, where he diſcovered that vigilance, mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration and punctuality, which have ſince ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him the moſt conſpicuous character of the age, and excited the admiration of the world.</p>

The deliberate mind of the ſage civilian is rarely ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with martial ardor, while the ſucceſsful ſoldier, too often looſes the finer feelings of the citizen; but here the magiſtrate, legiſlator, and counſellor, are no leſs conſpicuous than the vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eran leader. In municipal offices, he was active, impartial, deciſive; as a delegate to the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental Congreſs, his ſervices were deſervedly eſtimated; in the Chair of that AUGUST ASSEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLY, which formed the Federal Conſtitution, his weight of character, accommodating talents, and unexampled influence, ſupported the tottering fabric; as PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, a novel, untried ſituation, with every thing at hazard, his integrity, vigilance, inflexibility and perſeverance, were ſo well adapted to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional exigencies, that nothing but his ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of a ſubordinate truſt<note n="*" place="bottom">SEE his letter to Preſident ADAMS, July 13, 1798.</note> from the hand of his ſucceſſor could increaſe his own celebrity, or the affections of his grateful countrymen.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC employments, with elevated rank, are often rendered ſubſervient to perſonal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and political tranquillity is frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by ambition or avarice; but by him,

the humble avocations of the huſbandman, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the allurements of domeſtic retirement, were courted with eager ſolicitude; and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant refuſal of pecuniary reward, is the beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſincere, diſintereſted ſervices.</p>
            <p>WE need not recur to the records of antiquity to eſtabliſh a belief, that patriotiſm or popular acquirements are not invariably connected with religion and morality; for it is a humiliating fact, that vice, with gigantic ſtrides, often boldly traverſes the ſplendid palace, while thoſe milder virtues, which adorn humanity, are found in the peaſant's cottage. Happy is that nation, where "examples move as precepts teach," great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the character, always influenced by that unerring guide, which looks beyond this chequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life for approbation and reward; ſuch is COLUMBIA'S BOAST, ſuch was our DEPARTED FRIEND. From education, and habit, he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the doctrines and ceremonies of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal church, which did not, however, prevent a liberal regard to every other denomination.<note n="*" place="bottom">SEE his Anſwers to the Addreſſes of the Clergy, on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occaſions.</note> He conſidered public worſhip as an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty, and was a ſtrict obſerver of the chriſtian ſabbath, whilſt his religion, equally free from bigotry or oſtentation, was the immoveable baſis of his morality and beneficence.</p>
