            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N making the tour of <hi>Europe</hi> I had the pleaſure of writing to you laſt from <hi>Belgrade</hi> the Capital of <hi>Hungary;</hi> I have ſince had the curioſity, (before I enter <hi>Poland</hi>) to viſit <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince formerly under the Dominion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> but now belonging to the <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Germany;</hi> and as its <note n="†" place="bottom">Waywode, the name given to the Prince or Governor.</note> 
               <hi>Waywode</hi> is almoſt independant of his Sovereign, he has peopled it with Perſons of all Nations, and of every profeſſion under Heaven.</p>
            <p>Having made a purchaſe of the ſoil from the Barbarians, who were the original Proprietors; he has alſo obtain'd a grant from the <hi>Emperor</hi> to him and his Heirs, for being perpetual <hi>Waywode</hi> of the Country: This enables him, together with his great diſtance from Court, to govern the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who flocked from all Quarters to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Country under the ſanction of a Charter of Privileges and immunities, granted for the preſervation of their Religion and Liberties, with an abſolute ſway.</p>
            <p>In ancient times the Natives and Foreigners lived in perfect friendſhip; but within theſe ten years paſt, there has been nothing but bloody Wars carried on between them.—The original cauſe of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009701_0003_0F7786A4784BED20"/>
which is ſaid to be, the <hi>Waywode's</hi> taking the advantage of the ſimplicity and ignorance of the Natives in purchaſing their Lands, with regard to their nature and ſituation, as well as deſcription; and cheating them out of ten times more than ever they ſold. This, (with the trade driven on among them by ſome Chriſtians, who firſt made them drunk, and then defrauded them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted their Females,—a Syſtem of religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them and their Forefathers) diſguſted them to ſuch a degree, that they immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared War. The <hi>Turks</hi> joining them, there was then a neceſſity for the <hi>Waywode</hi> and his Subjects to raiſe money. The Delegates being aſſembled to conſult the welfare of the Country; inſiſted that a Tax ſhou'd be laid upon all the Cow-kine in the Province. The <hi>Waywode</hi> agreed, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that all his own ſhou'd be exempted, as he had large flocks all over the Country— This, the Delegates refus'd, becauſe his Cows were as liable to be made a prey of by the Enemy, as their own. He then told them his Bulls were free from Taxes, as they could not come under the denomination of Cow-kine, but Bull-kine; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction however the Delegates wou'd not admit of. A long diſpute then enſued. His Excellency told them that if Bulls ſhou'd be taxed, which he cou'd not believe was juſt, yet certainly Heffers and Calves of all kinds were clear. The Delegates reply'd, they ſaw no reaſon why his Excellency's Bulls, Heffers and Calves ſhou'd be exempted and not their own. The Barbarians in the mean time, laid waſte the Frontiers with fire and ſword.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009701_0004_0F7786A511608838"/>
This inteſtine diſpute prov'd more fatal to the Province, than all the depredations of a foreign Enemy. Such was the cruel, unrelenting diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Lord of the ſoil, that he wou'd rather ſee a general Maſſacre of all the Inhabitants of the Land, than ſuffer one of his calves to be taxed towards protecting them from a foreign force.</p>
            <p>A few of the well affected Natives to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, threw themſelves under it's protection, and deliver'd up their Wives and Children as a pledge of their future Fidelity; Lands were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the maintainance of ſome, and others were ſupported at the public-expence near the Metrapolis. Such was the ſtate of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> upon my firſt arrival at the Capital.</p>
            <p>I waited upon his Excellency the <hi>Waywode,</hi> who receiv'd me very politely. He appear'd to be a middle-aged Man of ſmall ſtature; ſurrounded with half a Dozen boys who were called Prime Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State; four young Nymps of Circaſſian breed, and a Calidonian wry necked Muſician. The Room was filled with inſtruments of muſic. A Violin; a harpſichord; ſix Bagpipes, and one dozen of Jews Harps, He enquired if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Muſick; I anſwer'd, ſome few Italian Airs upon the Bagpipe. Joy then appear'd upon his countenance, and he immediately gave me a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral invitation to accompany him either to the chaſe (as he lov'd a bow and arrow) or concert, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day during my ſtay at <hi>Weiſſenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scarce had two days elapſed, when the City was all in arms, at the news of the Piſs—Brute— tarians (a bigotted, cruel and revengful ſect, ſprung
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009701_0005_0F7786A743D70840"/>
from the Turks, and Adorers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> as to abſolute Fate, but nominal Chriſtians in ſome other reſpects, having murder'd the innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Man Woman and Child, who were ſettled in the Country, were in full march to butcher thoſe under the protection of the City. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this intelligence, eight hundred men were put under arms, and ten pieces of cannon prepar'd. A Truce however enſued, and the <hi>Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode,</hi> not only put up with the inſult, but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtoop'd to carreſs the, rebels; nay, he promis'd them an act of Indemnity, and engag'd to take them into high favor, if they wou'd turn their reſentment upon the Delegates of the Province, inſtead of himſelf. This they agreed to. The Delegates had no way to ſave themſelves from deſtruction, and preſerve the Government from Anarchy; but by appealing to the <hi>Emperor</hi> to be taken under his own protection, and reſcued from the oppreſſions of the Piſs—Brute—tarians, and the Tyranny of the <hi>Waywode.</hi> By this ſtrange revolution at Court, all that were Rebels but a few days before, were now the Court Favorites; and thoſe, who had bravely and generouſly taken up arms to ſave his Excellency's wind-pipe from being ſever'd in a thouſand pieces, were look'd upon as Enemies to the Government. Such is the inſtability of Courts, and the wonderful Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Miniſters of State! It is ſaid his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's Muſical Inſtruments in the fray were all put out of tune, and that he has been diſconcerted ever ſince; be that as it will; a ſudden reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken to call a Council, wherein it was
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009701_0006_0F7786A7A9C54C60"/>
decreed, that there ſhou'd no Magiſtrates hold Commiſſions under the Government, who had ſhewn any Love for the <hi>Emperor;</hi> or was not a Piſs—Brute—tarian; or cou'd not play upon the Jew's harp.</p>
            <p>As I had the happineſs to be acquainted with Counſellor Wiſeman, a moſt accompliſh'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who had directed the Board for ten Years, with the greateſt integrity through all the political ſtorms and tempeſts that had threatened the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Province, during the whole time by reaſon of a bloody war that had been carried on with the grand <hi>Turk,</hi> he took the firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity after the Council broke up to communicate to me the ſubſtance of the debate upon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject.</p>
            <p>His Excellency the <hi>Waywode,</hi> inform'd the Board, that he wou'd not have one Aſſertorian in the Commiſſion of the peace or any other civil office throughout the Government, as they ſeem'd all tinctur'd with a rebellious diſpoſition towards him and his family, and had transferr'd their Loyalty to the Emperor himſelf. That by their late proceedings, in chooſing ſuch men to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, who were his bitter Enemies; and in complaining to the Emperor againſt him, by which means he wou'd be look'd upon with an evil Eye at the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and either oblig'd to reſign his Government, or throw himſelf under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the grand <hi>Turk;</hi> therefore as they had thus ſhewn their malicious intentions againſt his Adminiſtration they were no longer to be enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among the Number of his Friends. He alſo
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009701_0007_0F7786A868F29310"/>
added, that thoſe of the <hi>Emperors</hi>' Religion had behav'd in ſuch a cold indifferent manner (a few in Weiſſenburgh excepted) as plainly made it appear that they were as well affected to the <hi>Emperor</hi> as himſelf;—that their principles in Religion and the maxims by which they and their Anceſtors were govern'd for one Thouſand Years, were pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly adapted to ſupport the <hi>Emperial Family;</hi>— that theſe things being conſider'd, he cou'd not expect their firm attachment to his perſon, or their general concurrence to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and therefore in good policy they ought not to be truſted at ſuch a critical conjuncture. He therefore deſir'd the Council to give their opinions, whether any other Sect was to be truſted as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in the Government, beſides the Piſs— Brute—tarians, a Sect whoſe principles have ever been diametrically oppoſite to Monarchy; and not only <note n="*" place="bottom">This has reference to their ſolomn Leauge and Covenant.</note> 
               <hi>ſworn</hi> Enemies to the <hi>Emperial</hi> Family, but murder'd one of the <hi>Emperors</hi> before his own palace; and have always been the foremoſt in all the Rebellions that have been rais'd againſt his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ever ſince. He alſo ſaid, that there was a few of his Enemies, who have dared publickly to eſpouſe the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s cauſe, and whom he "mark'd" out for puniſhment; he wiſh'd it cou'd be with the loſs of their heads, inſtead of their Commiſſions. The Enemies were <hi>Pottonius, Paulinus, Mortonus,</hi> and <hi>Trumponius,</hi> the laſt he was ſomewhat ſorry for, as he ſuppos'd his Anceſtors were great Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians; for they had taken a name, to perpetuate their poſterity, by which, ſome Nations call a Jews-Harp.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009701_0008_0F7786A8D3E37610"/>The Generality for the Council heartily concurr'd with his Excellency the <hi>Waywode;</hi> but when it came to Counſellor <hi>Wiſeman</hi> to give his opinion, he beg'd leave to diſſent from the reſt of the board; and hoped his Excellency, wou'd, with that attention and deliberation for which he was remarkable, hearken to his reaſons.</p>
            <p>He told his Excellency, he hoped he wou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, if he differ'd with him in ſome of the Political Obſervations he had juſt now made; and unto which Meſſieurs <hi>Simpleton, Prigg, Beau,</hi> and <hi>Brainleſs</hi> his Brother Counſellors had ſignified their approbation. He told him that as he had been but a ſhort time <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of the province he ought to uſe every method in his power to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a good underſtanding with the people;— that as a ſpirit of Freedom had drawn them from all Nations to populate ſuch an extenſive province, ſtripping them of their rights and privileges, was not the way of either gaining the good opinion of thoſe who were wavering, or of bringing them back that were the moſt ſeditious; that tho' his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was ſenſible, how little either himſelf, or the Council troubled themſelves about what was called Religion, yet (as he very well knew] there was a neceſſity of keeping up external appearances, and that it was a uſeful engine to keep the Vulgar in awe;—that if therefore he abandoned the profeſſion of it, he wou'd be held in univerſal, diſeſteem by all its Profeſſors;—that if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard more zealous for one ſect than another, a general Jealouſy wou'd take place among the reſt, and perhaps unite them all againſt him; that if

this ſhou'd happen; the Piſs—Brute—tarians, were not the tenth of his Subjects, and conſequently cou'd not ſupport him againſt the other nine;—that if he made an impartial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of places of Profit and Honor in the Government, and eſtabliſh'd them in all their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable demands, the <hi>Emperor</hi> wou'd have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection towards the continuing of him in his <hi>Vice-Royality;</hi> no complaints cou'd have any weight againſt him, his Character wou'd appear fair at Court, and perhaps ſave him the expence and trouble of a long Journey to defend himſelf.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Aſſertorians,</hi> the taking them into his favor, in imitation of many of his worthy Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, wou'd perhaps, effectually regain their Friendſhip; make them drop the proſecution of their Appeal; and as they are above one fifth part of the Inhabitants, they are no contemptable body to diſoblige. <hi>Pottonius,</hi> (who appears to be particularly ſingled out) is a Gentleman, who has remarkably diſtinguiſh'd himſelf this twenty Years paſt, for his Integrity, in faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Office of a Magiſtrate; his fortune places him above the fear or affection of Mankind, in the deſtribution of Juſtice; and therefore he does your Excellency as much honor in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Commiſſion, as you can do him in giving it. As to thoſe of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Religion, it is well known that two of their Prieſts; and a number of their People, who either hold Offices in reality under you, or live in expectation of them, in this Metrapolis, have gone greater
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009701_0010_0F7786AA54A40EC0"/>
lengths to ſerve you, than any other Sect among us in ſome particulars.</p>
            <p>Have they not abandoned their former Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; violated every obligation that was either civil or ſacred, or that bound them by the ties of Conſcience or honor to be faithful to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in order to ſupport your Cauſe? Have they not proſtituted their Temple, (a place ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated for pious uſes) as an Amphitheatre for the Rabble to combat in? Has not their Altar been profaned by the unhallowed hands of Turks, Jews, Infidels and Piſs—Brute—tarians? And all this in favor of your Excellency.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Paulinus, Mortonus,</hi> and others of the <hi>Emperor's</hi> Profeſſion, whoſe characters have been irreproachable, and whoſe Virtues have made them rever'd by their Country, ſhall they become the objects of your Excellency's diſapprobation for no other reaſon, than that they ſtill continue to have a regard for the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conquer their old prejudices in favour of the Emperial Court?—Time might bring them over as well as others; but ſuch raſh and precipitate meaſures, will create a Jealouſy throughout all <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> as if your oppoſition to them was purely out of ſpite to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> for whom they wou'd be made a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Your Attachment to the Piſs—Brute—tarians is ſomewhat remarkable, as they have been the cauſe of all the trouble that has happen'd in the Government. Had there never been a Rebellion amongſt them here, your Excellency wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

have been brought into ſuch difficulties. Had the Traitors been puniſh'd according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, there never wou'd have been an Appeal to <hi>Vienna.</hi> How then can you place your chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in a ſect who have been the ſole cauſe of your misfortunes? Theſe invincible arguments ſtagger'd his Excellency; but being a Man of weak Intellects, and abandon'd (like <note n="*" place="bottom">
