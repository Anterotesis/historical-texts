            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVICE TO THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS. INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE French Revolution is at laſt not only accompliſhed, but its accompliſhment univerſally acknowledged, beyond contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abroad, or the power of retraction at home. It has finiſhed its work, by organizing a government, on principles approved by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; an object long contemplated by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent writers, but never before exhibited, in this quarter of the globe. The experiment now in operation will ſolve a queſtion of the firſt magnitude in human affairs: Whether <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> which always agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in things of ſlighter moment, are really to remain eternal enemies in the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of men?</p>
            <p>The change of government in France is, properly ſpeaking, a renovation of ſociety;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:024075_0005_0FC31B9D925D2C00"/>
an object peculiarly fitted to hurry the mind into a field of thought, which can ſcarcely be limited by the concerns of a nation, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of an age. As there is a tendency in human nature to imitation; and, as all the apparent cauſes exiſt in moſt of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, to induce the people to wiſh for a ſimilar change, it becomes intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cauſe of humanity, to take a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate view of the real nature and extent of this change, and find what are the advantages and diſadvantages to be expected from it.</p>
            <p>There is not that necromancy in politics, which prevents our foreſeeing, with tolerable certainty, what is to be the reſult of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo univerſal, in which all the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. Many truths are as perceptible when firſt preſented to the mind, as an age or a world of experience could make them; others require only an indirect and collateral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; ſome demand an experience direct and poſitive.</p>
            <p>It is happy for human nature, that in morals we have much to do with this firſt claſs of truths, leſs with the ſecond, and very little with the third; while in phyſics we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually driven to the ſlow proceſs of patient and poſitive experience.</p>
            <p>The Revolution in France certainly comes recommended to us under one aſpect which renders it at firſt view extremely inviting: it is the work of argument and rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:024075_0006_0FC31B9FC72C9FC8"/>
and not of the ſword. The <hi>ultima ratio regum</hi> had nothing to do with it. It was an operation deſigned for the benefit of the people; it originated in the people, and was conducted by the people. It had therefore a legitimate origin; and this circumſtance entitles it to our ſerious contemplation, on two accounts: becauſe there is ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable in the idea, and becauſe other nations, in ſimilar circumſtances, will certainly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to imitate it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore examine the nature and conſequences of a ſimilar revolution in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it will affect the following principal objects, which make up the affairs of nations in the preſent ſtate of Europe:
<list>
                  <item>I. The feudal Syſtem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. The Church,</item>
                  <item>III. The Military,</item>
                  <item>IV. The Adminiſtration of Juſtice,</item>
                  <item>V. Revenue and public Expenditure,</item>
                  <item>VI. The Means of Subſiſtence,</item>
                  <item>VII. Literature, Sciences and Arts,</item>
                  <item>VIII. War and Peace.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The intereſts of kings and hereditary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion will not be forgotten in this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they will be treated with the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged orders under the ſeveral heads to which their different claims belong.</p>
            <p>It muſt be of vaſt importance to all the claſſes of ſociety, as it now ſtands claſſed in Europe, to calculate before hand what they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024075_0007_0FC31BA823A2DD20"/>
are to gain or to loſe by the approaching change; that, like prudent ſtock-jobbers, they may buy in or ſell out, according as this great event ſhall affect them.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers and contemplative men, who may think themſelves diſintereſted ſpectators of ſo great a political drama, will do well to conſider how far the cataſtrophe is to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial or detrimental to the human race; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to determine whether in conſcience they ought to promote or diſcourage, accelerate or retard it, by the publication of their opinions. It is true, the work was ſet on foot by this fort of men; but they have not all been of the ſame opinion relative to the beſt organization of the governing power, nor how far the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of abuſes ought to extend. Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieu, Voltaire, and many other reſpectable authorities, have accreditted the principle, that republicaniſm is not convenient for a great ſtate. Roſſeau and others take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the diſtinction between great and ſmall ſtates, in deciding, that this is the only go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment proper to enſure the happineſs, and ſupport the dignity of man. Of the former opinion was a great majority of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting national aſſembly of France. Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not many years will paſs, before a third opinion will be univerſally adopted, never to be laid aſide: That the republican principle is not only proper and ſafe for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any people; but, that its propriety
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024075_0008_0FC31BAA5286C470"/>
and ſafety are in proportion to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſociety and the extent of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory.</p>
            <p>Among ſincere enquirers after truth, all general queſtions on this ſubject reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this: Whether men are to preform their duties by an eaſy choice or an expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cheat; or, whether our reaſon be given us to be improved or ſtifled, to render us greater or leſs than brutes, to increaſe our happineſs or aggravate our miſery.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe whoſe anxieties ariſe only from intereſt, the enquiry is, how their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges or their profeſſions are to be affected by the new order of things. Theſe form a claſs of men reſpectable both for their numbers and their ſenſibility; it is our duty to attend to their caſe. I ſincerely hope to adminiſter ſome conſolation to them in the courſe of this eſſay. And though I have a better opinion of their philanthropy, than political opponents generally entertain of each other, yet I do not altogether rely upon their preſumed ſympathy with their fellow-citizens, and their ſuppoſed willingneſs to ſacrifice to the public good; but I hope to convince them, that the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of general liberty will be leſs injurious to thoſe who now live by abuſes, than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagined; that protected induſtry will produce effects far more aſtoniſhing than have ever been calculated; that the increaſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments will be ſuch, as to ameliorate the condition of every human creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024075_0009_0FC31BB2A5CD98D8"/>To perſuade this claſs of mankind that it is neither their duty nor their intereſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to perpetuate the ancient forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, would be a high and holy office; it would be the greateſt act of charity to them, as it might teach them to avoid a danger that is otherwiſe unavoidable; it would preclude the occaſion of the people's indulging what is ſometimes called a ferocious diſpoſition, which is apt to grow upon the revenge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and render them leſs harmonious in their new ſtation of citizens; it would prevent the civil wars, which might attend the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the people, where there ſhould be a great want of unanimity,—for we are not to expect in every country that mildneſs and dignity which have uniformly characterized the French, even in their moſt tumultuous movements <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Whatever reaſon may be given for the fact, I believe all thoſe who have been witneſſes of what are called <hi>mobs</hi> in France (during the revolution) will join with me in opinion, that they were by no means to be compared with Engliſh mobs, in point of indiſcriminate ferocity and private plunder. A popular commotion in Paris was uniformly directed to a certain well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained object; from which it never was known to deviate. Whether this object were to hang a man, to arreſt the king, to intimidate the court, or to break the furniture of a hotel, all other perſons and all other property, that fell in the way of the mob, were perfectly ſafe.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, thoſe collections were compoſed of honeſt and induſtrious people, who had nothing in view but the public good. They believed that the cauſe of their country required an execution of juſtice more prompt than could be expected from any eſtabliſh tribunal. Beſides, they were in the criſis of a revolution, when they were ſenſible, that the crimes or their enemies would remain unpuniſhed, for want of a known rule by which they could be judged. Though a violation of <hi>right,</hi> is not always a violation of <hi>law</hi>; yet, in their opinion, occaſions might exiſt, when it would be dangerous to let it paſs with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed to be hoped, that, whenever mobs in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſhall be animated by the ſame cauſe, they will conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſame dignity; and that this ſingular pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon will be found not altogether attributable to national character.</p>
               </note>; it would remove every obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024075_0010_0FC31BB776C875B8"/>
and every danger that may ſeem to attend that rational ſyſtem of public felicity to which the nations of Europe are moving with rapid ſtrides, and which in proſpect is ſo conſoling to the enlightened friends of humanity.</p>
            <p>To induce the men who now govern the world to adopt theſe ideas, is the duty of thoſe who now poſſeſs them. I confeſs the taſk at firſt view appears more than Herculean; it will be thought an object from which the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the cloſet muſt ſhrink in deſpair, and which prudence would leave to the more powerful argument of events. But I believe at the ſame time that ſome ſucceſs may be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that though the haverſt be great, the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may not be few; that prejudice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt cannot always be relied on to garriſon the mind againſt the aſſaults of truth. This belief, ill-grounded as it may appear, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to annimate me in the cauſe; and to the venerable hoſt of republican writers, who have preceded me in the diſcuſſions occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the French revolution, this belief is my only apology for offering to join the fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024075_0011_0FC31BB9769E6818"/>
and for thus practically declaring my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that they have not exhauſted the ſubject.</p>
            <p>The very powerful weapons, the force of reaſon and the force of numbers, are in the hands of the political reformers. While the uſe of the firſt brings into action the ſecond, and enſures its co-operation, it remains a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred duty, impoſed on them by the God of reaſon, to wield with dexterity this mild and beneficent weapon, before recurring to the uſe of the other; which, though legitimate, may be leſs harmleſs; though infallible in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be leſs glorious in victory.</p>
            <p>The tyrannies of the world, whatever be the appellation of the government under which they are exerciſed, are all ariſtocratical tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. An ordinance to plunder and murder, whether it fulminate from the Vatican, or ſteal ſilently forth from the Harem; whether it come clothed in the <hi>certain ſcience</hi> of a Bed of Juſtice, or in the legal ſolemnities of a bench of lawyers; whether it be purchaſed by the careſſes of a woman, or the treaſures of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—never confines its effects to the benefit of a ſingle individual; it goes to enrich the whole combination of conſpirators, whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs it is to dupe and to govern the nation. It carries its own bribery with itſelf through all its progreſs and connexions,—in its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in its enaction, in its vindication, in its execution; it is a fertilizing ſtream, that waters and vivifies its happy plants in the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024075_0012_0FC31BBADAD12490"/>
numerous channels of its communication. Miniſters and ſecretaries, commanders of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, contractors, collectors and tide-waiters, intendants, judges and lawyers,—whoever is permitted to drink of the ſalutary ſtream,—are all intereſted in removing the obſtructions and in praiſing the fountain from whence it flows.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of human nature requires that this ſhould be the caſe. Among beings ſo nearly equal in power and capacity as men of the ſame community are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is impoſſible that a ſolitary tyrant ſhould exiſt. Laws that are deſigned to operate unequally on ſociety, muſt offer an excluſive intereſt to a conſiderable portion of its members, to enſure their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the reſt. Hence has ariſen the neceſſity of that ſtrange complication in the governing power, which has made of politics an inexplicable ſcience; hence the reaſon for arming one claſs of our fellow creatures with the weapons of bodily deſtruction, and another with the myſterious artillery of the vengeance of heaven; hence the cauſe of what in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is called the independence of the judges, and what on the continent has created a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary nobility, a ſet of men who purchaſe the privilege of being the profeſſional enemies of the people, of ſelling their deciſions to the rich, and of diſtributing individual oppreſſion; hence the ſource of thoſe Draconian codes of criminal juriſprudence which enſhrine the idol property in a bloody ſanctuary, and teach
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024075_0013_0FC31BBD11B88790"/>
the modern European, that his life is of leſs value than the ſhoes on his feet; hence the poſitive diſcouragements laid upon agriculture manufactures, commerce, and every method of improving the condition of men; for it is to be obſerved, that in every country the ſhackles impoſed upon induſtry are in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree of general deſpotiſm that reigns in the government. This ariſes not only from the greater debility and want of enterpriſe in the people, but from the ſuperior neceſſity that ſuch governments are under, to prevent their ſubjects from acquiring that eaſe and information, by which they could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the evil and apply the remedy.</p>
            <p>To the ſame fruitful ſource of calamities we are to trace that perverſity of reaſon, which, in governments where men are permitted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs political ſubjects, has given riſe to thoſe perpetual ſhifts of ſophiſtry by which they vindicate the prerogative of kings. In one age it is the <hi>right of conqueſt,</hi> in another <hi>the divine right,</hi> then it comes to be a <hi>compact between king and people,</hi> and laſt of all, it is ſaid to be founded on general convenience, <hi>the good of the whole community.</hi> In England theſe ſeveral arguments have all had their day; though it is aſtoniſhing that the two former could ever have been the ſubjects of rational debate: the firſt is the logic of the muſquet, and the ſecond of the chalice; the one was buried at Rennimede on the ſignature of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024075_0014_0FC31BC203B72FE8"/>
Charta, the other took its flight to the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinent with James the Second. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of king and people has lain dormant the greater part of the preſent century; till it was rouſed from ſlumber by the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and came into the ſervice of Mr. Burke.</p>
            <p>Haſty men diſcover their errors when it is too late. It had certainly been much more conſiſtent with the temperament of that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's mind, and quite as ſerviceable to his cauſe, to have recalled the fugitive claim of the divine right of kings. It would have given a myſtic force to his declamation, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him many new epithets, and furniſhed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects perfectly accordant with the copious charges of <hi>ſacrilege, atheiſm, murders, aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinations, rapes</hi> and <hi>plunders</hi> with which his three volumes abound. He then could not have diſappointed his friends by his total want of argument, as he now does in his two firſt eſſays; for on ſuch a ſubject no argument could be expected; and in his third, where it is patiently attempted, he would have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neceſſity of ſhowing that he has none, by giving a different title to his book; for the "appeal," inſtead of being "from the new to the old whigs," would have been <hi>from the new whigs to the old tories</hi>; and he might as well have appealed to Caeſar; he could have found at this day no court to take cognizance of his cauſe.</p>
            <p>But the great advantage of this mode of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024075_0015_0FC31BC3ECC97440"/>
handling the ſubject would have been, that it could have provoked no anſwers; the gauntlet might have been thrown, without a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion to have taken it up; and the laſt ſolitary admirer of chivalry have retired in negative triumph from the field.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burke, however, in his deſence of royalty, does not rely on this argument of the compact. Whether it be, that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its futility, or that in his rage he forgets that he has uſed it, he is perpetually recurring to the laſt ground that has yet been heard of, on which we are called upon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider kings even as a tolerable nuiſance, and to ſupport the exiſting forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: this ground is <hi>the general good of the community.</hi> It is ſaid to be dangerous to pull down ſyſtems that are already formed, or even to attempt to improve them; and it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaid, that, were they peaceably deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we had ſociety to build up anew, it would be beſt to create hereditary kings, hereditary orders, and excluſive privileges.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſober opinions, uniting a claſs of reaſoners too numerous and too reſpectable to be treated with contempt. I believe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that their number is every day dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, and I believe the example which France will ſoon be obliged to exhibit to the world on this ſubject, will induce every man to reject them, who is not perſonally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively intereſted in their ſupport.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:024075_0016_0FC31BC55EFEB140"/>The inconſiſtency of the conſtituting aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, in retaining an hereditary king, armed with an enormous civil liſt, to wage war with a popular government, has induced ſome perſons to predict the downfall of their conſtitution. But this meaſure had a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent origin from what is commonly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to it, and will probably have a different iſſue. It was the reſult rather of local and temporary circumſtances, than of any general belief in the utility of kings, under any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications or limitations that could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the office.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the French had a king upon their hands. This king had always been conſidered as a well-diſpoſed man; ſo that, by a fatality ſomewhat ſingular, though not unexampled in <hi>regal hiſtory,</hi> he gained the love of the people, almoſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the miſchief which he did them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> their king had very powerful family connexions, in the ſovereigns of Spain, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria, Naples and Sardinia; beſides his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the kingdom, whom it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to attach, if poſſible, to the intereſts of the community. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the revolution was conſidered by all Europe as a high and dangerous experiment. It was neceſſary to hide as much as poſſible the appearance of its magnitude from the eye of the diſtant obſerver. The reformers conſidered it as their duty to produce an internal regeneration of ſociety,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024075_0017_0FC31BCF992FF3C8"/>
rather than an external change in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the court; to ſet in order the count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe and the kitchen, before arranging the drawing-room. This would leave the ſovereigns of Europe totally without a pretext for interfering; while it would be conſoling to that claſs of philoſophers, who ſtill believed in the compatibility of royalty and liberty. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this decree, That <hi>France ſhould have a king,</hi> and that he <hi>could do no wrong,</hi> was paſſed at an early period of their operations; when the above reaſons were apparently more urgent than they were afterwards, or probably will ever be again.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that royalty is preſerved in France for reaſons which are fugitive; that a majority of the conſtituting aſſembly did not believe in it, as an abſtract principle; that a majority of the people will learn to be diſguſted with ſo unnatural and ponderous a deformity in their new edifice, and will ſoon hew it off.</p>
            <p>After this improvement ſhall have been made, a few years experience in the face of Europe, and on ſo great a theatre as that of France, will probably leave but one opinion in the minds of honeſt men relative to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican principle, or the great ſimplicity of nature applied to the organization of ſociety.</p>
            <p>The example of America would have had great weight in producing this conviction; but it is too little known to the European rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024075_0018_0FC31BD0B7FA69F0"/>
to be a ſubject of accurate inveſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides, the difference of circumſtances between that country and the ſtates of Europe has given occaſion for imagining many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions which exiſt not in fact, and has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the application of principles which are permanently founded in nature, and follow not the trifling variations in the ſtate of ſociety.</p>
            <p>But I have not preſcribed to myſelf the taſk of entering into arguments on the utility of kings, or of inveſtigating the meaning of Mr. Burke in order to compliment him with an additional refutation. My ſubject furniſhes a more extenſive ſcope. It depends not on me, or Mr. Burke, or any other writer, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of writers, to determine the queſtion, whether a change of government ſhall take place, and extend through Europe. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a much more important claſs of men, the claſs that cannot write; and in a great meaſure, on thoſe who cannot read. It is to be decided by men who reaſon better without books, than we do with all the books in the world. Taking it for granted, therefore, that a general revolution is at hand, whoſe progreſs is irreſiſtible, my object is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template its probable effects, and to comfort thoſe who are afflicted at the proſpect.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Feudal Syſtem.</head>
            <p>THE moſt prominent feature in the moral face of Europe, was imprinted upon it by conqueſt. It is the reſult of the ſubordination neceſſary among military ſavages, on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming cultivators of the ſoil which they had deſolated, and making an advantageous uſe of ſuch of the inhabitants as they did not chooſe to maſſacre, and could not ſell to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners for ſlaves.</p>
            <p>The relation thus eſtabliſhed between the officers and the ſoldiers, between the victors and the vanquiſhed, and between them all and the lands which they were to cultivate, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified by the experience of unlettered ages, has obtained the name of the Feudal Syſtem, and may be conſidered as the foundation of all the political inſtitutions in this quarter of the world. The claims reſulting to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar claſſes of men, under this modification of ſociety, are called Feudal Rights; and to the individual poſſeſſors they are either nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or real, conveying an empty title or a ſubſtantial profit.</p>
            <p>My intention is not to enter on the details of this ſyſtem, as a lawyer, or to trace its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024075_0020_0FC31BDA502D9230"/>
with the accuracy of an hiſtorian, and ſhow its peculiar fitneſs to the rude ages of ſociety which gave it birth. But, viewing it as an ancient edifice, whoſe foundation, worn away by the current of events, can no longer ſupport its weight, I would ſketch a few draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to ſhow the ſtyle of its architecture, and compare it with the model of the new build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be erected in its place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>philoſophy</hi> of the Feudal Syſtem, is all that remains of it worthy of our contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This I will attempt to trace in ſome of its leading points, leaving the practical part to fall, with its ancient founders and its modern admirers, into the peaceful gulph of oblivion; to which I wiſh it a ſpeedy and an unobſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſage.</p>
            <p>The original object of this inſtitution was undoubtedly, what it was alledged to be, the preſervation of turbulent ſocieties, in which men are held together but by feeble ties; and it effected its purpoſe by uniting the perſonal intereſt of the head of each family, with the perpetual ſafety of the ſtate. Thus far the purpoſe was laudable, and the means extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well calculated for the end. But it was the fortune of this ſyſtem to attach itſelf to thoſe paſſions of human nature which vary not with the change of circumſtances. While national motives ceaſed by degrees to require its continuance, family motives forbade to lay it aſide. The ſame progreſſive improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024075_0021_0FC31BDE12B0ED68"/>
in ſociety, which rendered military te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures and military titles firſt unneceſſary and then injurious to the general intereſt, at the ſame time ſharpened the avarice, and piqued the honor of thoſe who poſſeſſed them, to preſerve the excluſive privileges which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them thus diſtinguiſhed. And theſe privileges, united with the operations of the church, have founded and ſupported the deſpotiſms of Europe in all their diviſions, combinations and refinements.</p>
            <p>Feudal Rights are either <hi>territorial</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</hi> I ſhall divide them into theſe two claſſes, for the ſake of beſtowing a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon each.</p>
            <p>The pernicious effects of the ſyſtem on ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial tenures are inconceivably various and great. In a legal view, it has led to thoſe intricacies and vexations, which we find at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to every circumſtance of real property which have perplexed the ſcience of civil ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence, which have perpetuated the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the people, relative to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, rendered neceſſary the intervention of lawyers, and multiplied the means of oppreſſion. But, in a political view, its conſequences are ſtill more ſerious, and demand a particular conſideration.</p>
            <p>The firſt quality of the feudal tenure is to confine the deſcendible property to the <hi>eldeſt male iſſue.</hi> To ſay that this is contrary to nature, is but a feeble expreſſion. So abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024075_0022_0FC31BE7D48E38E8"/>
is its operation, that it has ſeduced and perverted nature; her voice is ſtifled: intereſt itſelf is laid aſleep, and nothing but the eloquence of an incomprehenſible pride is heard on the occaſion. You will hear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, younger brothers and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rejoice in this proviſion of the law; the former conſigning their daughters to the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my priſon of a convent, and their younger ſons to the church or the army, to enſure their celibacy; that no remnant of the family may remain but the heir of the eſtate entire; the latter congratulating each other, that the elder brother will tranſmit unimpaired the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and the property, while they themſelves are content to periſh in the obſcurity of their ſeveral deſtinations. It is probable that, in another age, a tale of this kind will ſcarcely gain credit, and that the tear of ſenſibility may be ſpared by a diſbelief of the fact. It is however no creature of the imagination; it happened every day in France previous to the revolution; I have ſeen it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears; it is now to be ſeen and heard in moſt other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic countries.</p>
            <p>But other points of view ſhow this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law to be ſtill more reprehenſible in the eye of political philoſophy. It ſwells the inequality of wealth, which, even in the beſt regulated ſociety, is but too conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it habituates the people to believe in an
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024075_0023_0FC31BEC06527C08"/>
unnatural inequality in the rights of men, and by this means prepares them for ſervility and oppreſſion; it prevents the improvement of lands, and impedes the progreſs of induſtry and cultivation, which are beſt promoted on ſmall eſtates, where proprietors cultivate for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; it diſcourages population, by inducing to a life of celibacy.—But I ſhall ſpeak of celibacy when I ſpeak of the church.</p>
            <p>Whether men are born to govern, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, or to enjoy equal liberty, depends not on the original capacity of the mind, but on the <hi>inſtinct of analogy,</hi> or the <hi>habit of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> When children of the ſame family are taught to believe in the unconquerable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of birth among themſelves, they are completely fitted for a feudal government; becauſe their minds are familiariſed with all the gradations and degradations that ſuch a government requires. The birth-right of domincering is not more readily claimed on the one hand, than it is acknowledged on the other; and the Jamaica planter is not more habitually convinced that an European is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to an African, than he is that a lord is better than himſelf.</p>
            <p>This ſubject deſerves to be placed in a light, in which no writer as far as I know, has yet conſidered it. When a perſon was repeating to Fontenelle the common adage <hi>l'habitude eſt la ſeconde nature,</hi> the philoſopher replied, <hi>Et ſaites moi la grace de me dire, quelle eſt la
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024075_0024_0FC31BF2F520E038"/>
premiere.</hi> When we aſſert that nature has eſtabliſhed <hi>inequalities</hi> among men, and has thus given to ſome the right of governing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or when we maintain the <hi>contrary</hi> of this poſition, we ſhould be careful to define what ſort of nature we mean, whether the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond nature</hi>; or whether we mean that there is but one. A mere ſavage, Colocolo <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Araucana of Ercilla.</note> for inſtance, would decide the queſtion of equality by a trial of bodily ſtrength, deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the man that could lift the heavieſt beam to be the legiſlator; and unleſs all men could lift the ſame beam, they could not be equal in their rights. Ariſtotle would give the preference to him that excelled in mental capacity. Ulyſſes would make the deciſion upon a compound ratio of both. But there appears to me another ſtep in this ladder, and that the <hi>habit of thinking</hi> is the only ſafe and univerſal criterion to which, in practice, the queſtion can be referred. Indeed, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is laid aſide, it is the only one to which, in civilized ages, it ever is referred. We never ſubmit to a king, becauſe he is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than we in bodily force, nor becauſe he is ſuperior in underſtandig or in information; but becauſe we believe him born to govern, or at leaſt, becauſe a majority of the ſociety believes it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>habit of thinking</hi> has ſo much of nature in it, it is ſo undiſtinguiſhable from the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024075_0025_0FC31BF400D9AE90"/>
marks of the man, that it is a perfectly ſafe foundation for any ſyſtem that we may chooſe to build upon it; indeed it is the <hi>only</hi> foundation, for it is the only point of contact by which men communicate as moral aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates. As a practical poſition therefore, and as relating to almoſt all places and almoſt all times, in which the experiment has yet been made. Ariſtotle was as right in teaching, <hi>That ſome are born to command, and others to be commanded,</hi> as the national aſſembly was in declaring, That <hi>men are born and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue free and equal in reſpect to their rights.</hi> The latter is as apparently falſe in the diet of Ratiſbon, as the former is in the hall of the Jacobins.</p>
            <p>Abſtractedly conſidered, there can be no doubt of the unchangeable truth of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's declaration; and they have taken the right method to make it a <hi>practical</hi> truth, by publiſhing it to the world for diſcuſſion. A general belief <hi>that it is a truth,</hi> makes it at once practical, confirms it in one nation, and extends it to others.</p>
            <p>A due attention to the aſtoniſhing effects that are wrought in the world by <hi>the habit of thinking,</hi> will ſerve many valuable purpoſes. I cannot therefore diſmiſs the ſubject ſo ſoon as I intended; but will mention one or two inſtances of theſe effects, and leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the reader to make the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a thouſand others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:024075_0026_0FC31BFB15192F20"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is evident that all the arbitrary ſyſtems in the world are founded and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on this <hi>ſecond nature</hi> of man, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraction of the <hi>firſt.</hi> Syſtems which diſtort and cruſh and ſubjugate every thing that we can ſuppoſe original and characteriſtic in man, as an undiſtorted being. It ſuſtains the moſt abſurd and abominable theories of religion, and honors them with as many martyrs as it does thoſe that are the moſt peaceful and beneficent.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> we find for our conſolation, that it will likewiſe ſupport ſyſtems of equal liberty and national happineſs. In the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States of America, the ſcience of liberty is univerſally underſtood, felt and practiſed, as much by the ſimple as the wiſe, the weak as the ſtrong. Their deep-rooted and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate habit of thinking is, that <hi>all men are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in their rights,</hi> that <hi>it is impoſſible to make them otherwiſe;</hi> and this being their undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed belief, they have no conception how any man in his ſenſes can entertain any other. This point once ſettled, every thing is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. Many operations, which in Europe have been conſidered as incredible tales or dangerous experiments, are but the infalible conſequences of this great principle. The firſt of theſe operations is <hi>the buſineſs of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which with that people is carried on with as much gravity as their daily labor. There is no jealouſy on the occaſion, nothing lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024075_0027_0FC31BFC290407D0"/>
in office; any man in ſocieiy may attain to any place in the government, and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe its functions. They believe that there is nothing more difficult in the management of the affairs of a nation, than the affairs of a family; that it only requires more hands. They believe that it is the juggle of keeping up impoſitions to blind the eyes of the vulgar, that conſtitutes the intricacy of ſtate. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the myſticiſm of inequality, and you ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh almoſt all the evils attendant on human nature.</p>
            <p>The people being habituated to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all kinds of officers, the <hi>magnitude</hi> of the office makes no difficulty in the caſe. The Preſident of the United States, who has more power while in office than ſome of the kings of Europe, is choſen with as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion as a churchwarden. There is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice to be performed, and the people ſay who ſhall do it. The ſervant feels honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the confidence repoſed in him, and generally expreſſes his gratitude by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance.</p>
            <p>Another of theſe operations is making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very citizen a ſoldier, and every ſoldier a citizen; not only <hi>permitting</hi> every man to arm, but <hi>obliging</hi> him to arm. This fact told in Europe previous to the French revolution, woule have gained little credit; or at leaſt it would have been regarded as a mark of an uncivilized people, extremely dangerous to

a well ordered ſociety. Men who build ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems on an inverſion of nature, are obliged to invert every thing that is to make part of that ſyſtem. It is <hi>becauſe the people are civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, that they are with ſafety armed.</hi> It is an effect of their conſcious dignity, as citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens enjoying equal rights, that they wiſh not to invade the rights of others. The danger (where there is any) from armed ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, is only to the <hi>government,</hi> not to the <hi>ſociety</hi>; and as long as they have nothing to revenge in the government (which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have while it is in their own hands) there are many advantages in their being accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uſe of arms, and no poſſible diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Power,</hi> habitually in the hands of a whole community, loſes all the ordinary aſſociated ideas of power. The exerciſe of power is a relative term; it ſuppoſes an oppoſition,— ſomething to operate upon. We perceive no exertion of power in the motion of the planetary ſyſtem, but a very ſtrong one in the movement of a whirlwind; it is becauſe we ſee obſtructions to the latter, but none to the former. Where the government is <hi>not</hi> in the hands of the people, there you find op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, you perceive two contending inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and get an idea of the exerciſe of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and whether this power be in the hands of the government or of the people, or whether it change from ſide to ſide, it is always to be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024075_0029_0FC31C0150B62320"/>
dreaded. But the word <hi>people</hi> in America, has a different meaning from what it has in Europe. It there means the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and comprehends every human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; here it means ſomething elſe more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to define.</p>
            <p>Another conſequence of the habitual idea of equality, is the <hi>facility of changing the ſtructure of their government</hi> whenever and as often as the ſociety ſhall think there is any thing in it to amend. As Mr. Burke has written no "reflections on the revolution" in America, the people there have never yet been told that they had no <hi>right</hi> "to frame a government for themſelves;" they have therefore done much of this buſineſs, without ever affixing to it the idea of "ſacrilege" or "uſurpation," or any other term of rant to be found in that gentleman's vocabulary.</p>
            <p>Within a few years the fifteen ſtates have not only framed each its own ſtate-conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and two ſucceſſive Federal conſtitutions; but ſince the ſettlement of the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government in the year 1789, three of the ſtates, Pennſylvania, South-Carolina and Georgia, have totally new modeled their own. And all this is done without the leaſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the operation being ſcarcely known beyond the limits of the ſtate where it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Thus they are in the habit of "<hi>chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own governors,</hi>" of "<hi>caſhiering them for miſconduct,</hi>" of "<hi>framing a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024075_0030_0FC31C03BB059A98"/>
for themſelves,</hi>" and all thoſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, the mere naming of which, in Mr. Burke's opinion, has polluted the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit in the Old Jury.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, Theſe things will do very well for America, where the people are leſs numerous, leſs indigent, and better inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but they will not apply to Europe. This objection deſerves a reply, not becauſe it is ſolid, but becauſe it is faſhionable. It may be anſwered, that ſome parts of Spain, much of Poland, and almoſt the whole of Ruſſia, are leſs peopled than the ſettled country in the United States; that poverty and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are <hi>effects</hi> of ſlavery rather than its <hi>cauſes</hi>; but the beſt anſwer to be given, is the example of France. To the event of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution I will truſt the argument. Let the people have time to become thoroughly and ſoberly grounded in the doctrine of <hi>equality,</hi> and there is no danger of oppreſſion either from government or from anarchy. Very little inſtruction is neceſſary to teach a man his rights; and there is no perſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intellects in the moſt ignorant corner of Europe, but receives leſſons enough, if they were of the proper kind. For writing and reading are not indiſpenſible to the object; it is <hi>thinking</hi> right which makes them act right. Every child is taught to repeat about fifty Latin prayers, which ſet up the Pope, the Biſhop, and the King, as the trinity of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024075_0031_0FC31C0B007510C0"/>
his adoration; he is taught that <hi>the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> and therefore the ſoldier quartered in the pariſh has a right to cut his throat. Half this inſtruction, upon oppoſite principles, would go a great way; in that caſe nature would be aſſiſted, while here ſhe is counteracted. Engrave it on the heart of a man, <hi>that all men are equal in rights,</hi> and that the <hi>government is their own,</hi> and then perſuade him to ſell his crucifix and buy a muſquet,—and you have made him a good citizen.</p>
            <p>Another conſequence of a ſettled belief in the equality of rights, is, that under this belief <hi>there is no danger from Anarchy.</hi> This word has likewiſe acquired a different mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in America from what we read of it in books. In Europe it means confuſion, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with mobs and carnage, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent periſh with the guilty. But it is very different where a country is <hi>uſed</hi> to a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative government, though it ſhould have an interval of no government at all. Where the people at large feel and know that they <hi>can do every thing</hi> by themſelves perſonally, they really do nothing by themſelves perſonally. In the heat of the American revolution, when the people in ſome ſtates were for a long time without the leaſt ſhadow of law or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they always acted by committees and repreſentation. This they muſt call anarchy for they know no other.</p>
            <p>Theſe are materials for the formation of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024075_0032_0FC31C0BF67066C0"/>
governments, which need not be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though disjointed and laid aſunder to make ſome repairs. They are deep-root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed habits of thinking, which almoſt change the moral nature of man; they are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as much unknown to the ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics as to the modern monarchies of Europe.</p>
            <p>We muſt not therefore rely upon ſyſtems drawn from the experimental reaſonings of Ariſtotle, when we find them contradicted by what we feel to be the eternal truth of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſee brought to the teſt of our own experience. Ariſtotle was certainly a great politician; and Claudius Ptolemy was a great geographer; but the latter has ſaid not a word of America, the largeſt quarter of the globe; nor the former of repreſentative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, the reſource of afflicted humanity.</p>
            <p>Since I have brought theſe two great lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of ſcience ſo near together, I will keep them in company a moment longer, to ſhow the ſtrange partiality that we may retain for one ſuperſtition after having laid aſide another, though they are built on ſimilar foundations. Ptolemy wrote a ſyſtem of aſtronomy; in which he taught, among other things, that the earth was the centre of the univerſe, and that the heavenly bodies moved round it. This ſyſtem is now taught (to the excluſion by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathama of all others) in Turkey, Arabia, Perſia, Paleſtine, Egypt, and wherever the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024075_0033_0FC31C0DD6069C60"/>
doctrines of Mahomet are taught; while at the ſame time, and with the ſame reverence, the politics of Ariſtotle are taught at the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Oxford. The ground which ſupports the one is, that the ſun ſtopt its courſe at the command of Joſhua, which it could not have done, had it not been in motion; and the other, that <hi>the powers that be are ordained of God.</hi> Mention to a Muſſulman the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernican ſyſtem, and you might as well ſpeak to Mr. Burke about the rights of man; they both call you an atheiſt.—But I will proceed with the feudal ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>The next quality of a feudal tenure is what is commonly called on the continent the right of <hi>ſubſtitution,</hi> in the Engliſh law, known by the name of <hi>entail.</hi> Of all the methods that have yet been diſcovered to prevent men from enjoying the advantages that nature has laid before them, this is the moſt extraordinary, and in many reſpects the moſt effectual. There have been ſuperſtitions entertained by many nations relative to property in lands; rendering them more difficult of alienation than other poſſeſſions, and conſequently, leſs productive. Such was the <hi>jus retractus</hi> of the Romans, the family-right of redemption, and the abſolute reſtoration once in fifty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, ſimilar regulations among the ancient Egyptians, and laws to the ſame purpoſe under the government of the Incas in Peru.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:024075_0034_0FC31C0ED51460A8"/>Theſe were all calculated to perpetuate family diſtinctions, and to temper the minds of men to an ariſtocratical ſubordination. But none of them were attended with the barbarous excluſion of younger brothers; nor had they the preſumption to put it into the power of a dying man, who could not regulate the diſpoſition of his ſandals for one hour, to ſay to all mankind thenceforward to the end of time, "Touch not my inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance! I will that this tract of country, on which I have taken my pleaſure, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the wild beaſts and to the fowls of heaven; that one man only of each genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall exiſt upon it; that all the reſt, even of my own poſterity, ſhall be driven out hence as ſoon as born; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor himſelf, ſhall not increaſe his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by alienating a part to ameliorate the reſt."</p>
            <p>There might have been individual mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in all ages, capable of <hi>expreſſing</hi> a deſire of this kind; but for whole nations, for many centuries together, to agree to <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>execute</hi> ſuch hoſtile teſtaments as theſe, comported not with the wiſdom of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; it is a ſuicide of ſociety, reſerved for the days of chivalry—to ſupport the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of modern Europe.</p>
            <p>Sir Edward Coke ſhould have ſpared his panegyric on the parliament of Edward the firſt as the fathers of the law of entailments.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024075_0035_0FC31C111800B2F8"/>
He quots with ſingular pleaſure the words of Sir William Herle, who informs us that
<q>King Edward I. was the wiſeſt king that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, and they were ſage men that made this ſtatute.</q>
Whatever wiſdom there is in the ſtatute, is of an elder growth. It is a plant of genuine feudal extraction brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England by the Normans or Saxons, or ſome other conquerors; and though ſettled as common law, it began to be diſregarded and diſpiſed by the judicial tribunals, as a ſenſe of good policy prevailed. But the progreſs of liberality was arreſted by that parliament, and the law of entailments paſſed into the ſtatute of Weſtminſter the ſecond.</p>
            <p>This was conſidered as law in America, previous to the revolution. But that epoch of light and liberty has freed one quarter of the world from this miſerable appendage of Gothiciſm; and France has now begun to break the ſhackles from another quarter, where they were more ſtrongly riveted. The ſimple deſtruction of theſe two laws, of <hi>entailment</hi> and <hi>primogeniture,</hi> if you add to it the <hi>freedom of the preſs,</hi> will enſure the continuance of liberty in any country where it is once eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Other territorial rights, peculiar to the feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal tenure, are leſs general in their operation, though almoſt infinite in their number and variety. Not a current of water, nor a mill-ſeat, nor a fiſh-pond, nor a foreſt, nor
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024075_0036_0FC31C19B92E7938"/>
the dividing line of a village or a farm, but gives name to and ſupports ſome ſeigneurial impoſition; beſides the numberleſs claims predicated upon all the poſſible actions and ceremonies that paſs, or are ſuppoſed to paſs, between the great lord and the little lord, and between the little lord and the leſs lord, and between him and the Lord knows whom. The national aſſembly in one decree ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed about one hundred and fifty of theſe taxes by name, beſides a general ſweeping clauſe in the act, which perhaps deſtroyed as many more, the names of which no man could report.</p>
            <p>One general character will apply to all theſe impoſitions: they are a diſcouragement to agriculture, an embaraſſment to commerce —they humiliate one part of the community, ſwell the pride of the other, and are a real pecuniary diſadvantage to both.</p>
            <p>But it is time to pay our reſpects to thoſe feudal claims that we call <hi>perſonal.</hi> The firſt of theſe is <hi>allegiance</hi>—in its genuine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic ſenſe, called <hi>perpetual allegiance.</hi> It is difficult to expreſs a ſuitable contempt for this idea, without deſcending to language below the dignity of philoſophy. On the firſt inveſtiture of a fief, the ſuperior lord (ſuppoſing he had any right to it himſelf) has doubtleſs the power of granting it on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever terms the vaſſal will agree to. It is an even bargain between the parties; and an
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024075_0037_0FC31C20F1D8C5D0"/>
unchangeable allegiance during the lives of theſe parties may be a condition of it. But for a man to be <hi>born</hi> to ſuch an allegiance to another man, is to have an evil ſtar indeed; it is to be born to unchangeable ſlavery.</p>
            <p>A nobleman of Tuſcany, at this moment, canot ſtep his foot over the limits of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy without leave from the Grand Duke, on pain of forfeiting his eſtate. Similar laws prevail in all feudal countries, where revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have not yet prevailed. They ſlee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſearching eye of liberty, and will ſoon flee from Europe.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have treated of claims, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſonal or territorial, that are confined to the eldeſt ſons of families; but there is one genuine feudal claim, which "ſpreads undivided" to all the children, runs in all collateral directions, and extends to every drop of noble blood, wherever found, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mixed or adultrated—it is the claim of <hi>idleneſs.</hi> In general it is ſuppoſed that all indigent noble children are to be provided for by the government. But alas! the ſwarm is too great to be eaſily hived. Though the army, the navy, and the church, with all their poſſible multiplication of places, are occupied only by them, yet, as celibacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them not of the means of propagation, the number continues ſo conſiderable, that many remain out of employment and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the means of ſupport.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:024075_0038_0FC31C224F376A90"/>In contemplating the peculiar deſtiny of this deſcription of men, we cannot but feel a mixture of emotions, in which compaſſion gets the better of contempt. in addition to the misfortunes incident to other claſſes of ſociety, their noble birth has entailed upon them a ſingular curſe; it has interdicted them every kind of buſineſs or occupation, even for procuring the neceſſaries of life. Other men may be found who have been deprived of their juſt inheritance by the barbarous laws of deſcent, who may have been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in youth and not educated to buſineſs, or who by averſion to induſtry are rendered incapable of any uſeful employment; but none but the offspring of a noble family can experience the ſuperadded fatality of being told, that to put his hand to the plough, or his foot into a counting-houſe, would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace an illuſtrious line of anceſtors, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a tree of genealogy, which takes its root in a groom of ſome fortunate robber, who perhaps was an archer of Charlemagne.</p>
            <p>Every capital in Europe, if you except London, throngs with this claſs of nobleſſe, who are really and literally tormented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their pride and their poverty. Indeed, ſuch is the prepoſterous tyranny of cuſtom, that thoſe who are rich, and take the lead in ſociety, have the cruelty to make <hi>idleneſs</hi> a <hi>criterion of nobleſſe.</hi> A proof of inoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a ticket of admiſſion into their houſes
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024075_0039_0FC31C27D4BAF220"/>
and an indiſpenſible badge of welcome to their parties.</p>
            <p>But in France their hands are at laſt untied; the charm is broken, and the feudal ſyſtem, with all its infamous idolatries, has fallen to the ground. Honor is reſtored to the heart of man, inſtead of being ſuſpended from his button-hole; and uſeful induſtry gives a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to reſpect. The men that were formerly dukes and marqiuſſes are now exalted to farmers, manufacturers and merchants; the riſing generation among all claſſes of people are forming their maxims on a juſt eſtimate of things; and ſociety is extracting the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned dagger which conqueſt had planted in her vitals.</p>

            <p>BUT it would have been impoſſible for the feudal ſyſtem, with all its powers of inverſion, to have held human nature ſo long debaſed, without the aid of an agent more powerful than an arm of fleſh, and without aſſailing the mind with other weapons than thoſe which are furniſhed from its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns. Mankind are by nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; the governors of nations, or thoſe perſons who contrive to live upon the labors of their fellow-creatures, muſt neceſſarily be few, in compariſon to thoſe who bear the burthens of the whole; their object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to dupe the community at large, to conceal the ſtrength of the many, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that of the few. An open arrangement of forces, whether phyſical or moral, muſt be artfully avoided; for men, however ignorant, are as naturally diſpoſed to calculation, as they are to religion; they perceive as readily that an hundred ſoldiers can deſtroy the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they have made, as that thunder and lightning can deſtroy a man. Recourſe muſt therefore be had to myſteries and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;

            <p>This engine, in all ages of the world, has been the Church <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>From that aſſociation of ideas, which uſually connects the <hi>church</hi> with <hi>religion,</hi> I may run the riſque of being miſunderſtood by ſome readers, unleſs I advertiſe them, that I conſider no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection as exiſting between theſe two ſubjects; and that where I ſpeak of church <hi>indefinitely,</hi> I mean the government of a ſtate, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the name of God, to govern by divine authority; or, in other words, <hi>darkening the conſciences of men, in order to oppreſs them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the United States of America, there is, ſtrictly ſpeaking, no ſuch thing as a Church; and yet in no country are the people more religious. All ſorts of religious opinions are entertained there, and yet no <hi>hereſy</hi> among them all; all modes of worſhip are practiſed, and yet there is no <hi>ſchiſm</hi>; men frequently change their creed and their worſhip, and yet there is no <hi>apoſtaſy</hi>; they have miniſters of religion, but no <hi>prieſts.</hi> In ſhort, religion is there a <hi>perſonal</hi> and not a <hi>corporate</hi> concern.</p>
               </note>. It has varied its appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, at different periods and in different countries, according to the circumſtances of nations; but has never changed its character; and it is difficult to ſay, under which of its names it has done the moſt miſchief, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated the greateſt number of the human race. Were it not for the danger of being milled by the want of information, we ſhould readily determine, that under the aſſumption of chriſtianity it has committed greater rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than under any other of its dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:024075_0042_0FC31C2E6ECD6E18"/>But we muſt not be haſty in deciding this queſtion; as, during the laſt fifteen centuries, in which we are able to trace with compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate indignation the frenzy of our anceſtors, and contemplate the wandering demon of carnage, conducted by the <hi>croſs</hi> of the Weſt, the lights of hiſtory fail us with regard to the reſt of the world—we cannot travel with the <hi>creſcent</hi> of the Eaſt, in its unmeaſurable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations from the Euxine to the Ganges; nor tell by what other incantations mankind have been inflamed with the luſt of ſlaughter, from thence to the north of Siberia or to the ſouth of Africa.</p>
            <p>Could we form an eſtimate of the lives loſt in the wars and perſecutions of the Chriſtian Church alone, it muſt be nearly equal to the number of ſouls now exiſting in Europe. But it is perhaps in mercy to mankind, that we are not able to calculate, with any accuracy, even this portion of human calamities. When Conſtantine ordered that the <hi>hierarchy</hi> ſhould aſſume the name of Chriſt, we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as forming a new weapon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; he only changed a name, which had grown into diſrepute, and would ſerve the purpoſe no longer, for one that was gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extenſive reputation; it being built on a faith that was likely to meet the aſſent of a conſiderable portion of mankind.

The Chriſtian doctors ſeized this occaſion to adminiſter to the wants of the emperor, on condition that he would adminiſter to theirs; the bargain was advantageous on both ſides; he declared himſelf a Chriſtian, and took the church under his protection, and they pronounce his pardon.</p>
                  <p>The fawning ſervility of the new church and the blunt ſeverity of the old, on that occaſion, mark the preciſe character of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical policy of all ages; and both examples have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in numerous inſtances. The manoevres of the Pope on the converſion of Clovis, on ſanctioning the uſurpation of Pepin, and on the coronation of Charlemagne, are among the imitations of the former; the ridiculous chaſtiſement of Henry the Second of England, and the numerous anathemas fulminated againſt whole kingdoms, are proofs of the latter, We may likewiſe remark, that the conduct of Conſtantine has been copied in all its eſſential points by Henry the Eighth.</p>

that his <hi>kingdom was not of this world,</hi> has deluged Europe in blood for a long ſucceſſion of ages, and carried occaſional ravages into all the other quarters of the globe. The pretence of extirpating the idolatries of ancient eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments and the innumerable hereſies of the new, has been the never-failing argument of princes as well as pontiffs, from the wars of Conſtantine, down to the pitiful, ſtill-borne rebellion of Calonne and the Count d'Artois.</p>
            <p>Fom the time of the converſion of Clovis, through all the Merovingian race, France and Germany groaned under the fury of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical monſters, hunting down the Druids, overturning the temples of the Roman Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, and drenching the plains with the blood of Arians<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Exterminating heretics was a principal object of national ambition. Childebert I. who died in 558, has the following epitaph on his tomb in the Abbey of St. Germaine des pres, at Paris.</p>

               </note>. The wars of Charlemagne againſt the Saxons, the Huns, the Lombards and the Moors, which deſolated Europe for forty years, had for their principal object the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and purifying of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>The Cruſades, which drained Europe of its young men at eight ſucceſſive periods, muſt have ſacrificed, including Aſiatics and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, at leaſt four millions of lives. The
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024075_0045_0FC31C3B1B71CD78"/>
wars of the Guelfs and Gibelins, or Pope and Anti-Pope, ravaged Italy, and involved half Europe in factions for two centuries together. The expulſion of the Moors from Spain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated that kingdom by a war of ſeven hundred years, and eſtabliſhed the Inquiſition to interdict the reſurrection of ſociety; while millions of the natives of South America have been deſtroyed by attempting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them.</p>
            <p>In this enumeration, we have taken no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that train of calamities which attended the reconverſion of the eaſtern empire, and attaching it to the faith of Mahomet; nor of the various havoc which followed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberment of the catholic church by that fortunate ſchiſm, which by ſome is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the Lutheran hereſy, and by others the Proteſtant reformation.</p>
            <p>But theſe, it will be ſaid, are only general traits of uncivilized-character, which we all contemplate with horror, and which, among enlightened nations, there can be no danger of being renewed. It is true, that in ſeveral countries, the glooms of intolerance ſeem to be pierced by the rays of philoſophy; and we may ſoon expect to ſee Europe univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclaiming the right of one man to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere in the religion of another. We may remark however, <hi>firſt,</hi> that this is far from being the caſe at this moment; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that it is a bleſſing which never can originate
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024075_0046_0FC31C3EEC3D68B0"/>
from any ſtate-eſtabliſhment of religion. For proofs of the former, we need not penetrate into Spain or Italy, nor recal the hiſtory of the late fanatical management of the war in Brabant, but look to the two moſt enlightened countries in Europe; ſee the riots at Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham, and the conduct of the refractory prieſts in France.</p>
            <p>With regard to the ſecond remark,—we may as well own the truth at firſt as at laſt, and have ſenſe this year as the next: <hi>The exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any kind of liberty is incompatible with the exiſtence of any kind of church.</hi> By <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> I mean the enjoyment of equal rights, and by <hi>church</hi> I mean any mode of worſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be national, or declared to have any preference in the eye of the law.</p>
            <p>To render this truth a little more familiar to the mind of any reader who ſhall find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtartled with it, we will take a view of the church in a different light from what we have yet conſidered it. We have noticed hitherto only its moſt ſtriking characteriſtics, in which it appears like a giant, ſtalking over ſociety, and wielding the ſword of ſlaughter; but it likewiſe performs the office of ſilent diſeaſe and of unperceived decay; where we may contemplate it as a canker, corroding the vitals of the moral world, and debaſing all that is noble in man.</p>
            <p>If I mention ſome traits which are rather peculiar to the Roman Catholic conſtitution,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024075_0047_0FC31C411435FB10"/>
it is becauſe that is the predominant church in thoſe parts of Europe, where revolutions are ſooneſt expected; and not becauſe it is any worſe or any better than any other that ever has or ever can exiſt. I hinted before, and it may not be amiſs to repeat, that the hierarchy is every where the ſame, ſo far as the circumſtances of ſociety will permit; for it borrows and lends, and interchanges its features in ſome meaſure with the age and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which it has to deal, without ever loſing ſight of its object. It is every where the ſame engine of ſtate; and whether it be guided by a Lama or a Muſti, by a Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex or a Pope, by a Bramin a Biſhop or a Druid, it is entitled to an equal ſhare of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>The firſt great object of the prieſt is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a belief in the minds of the people, that <hi>he himſelf is poſſeſt of ſupernatural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> and the church at all times has made its way in the world, in proportion as the prieſt has ſucceeded in this particular. This is the foundation of every thing—the life and ſoul of all that is ſubverſive and unaccountable in human affairs; it is introducing a new ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into ſociety; it is the rudder under the water, ſteering the ſhip almoſt directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wind that gives it motion.</p>
            <p>A belief in the ſupernatural powers of the prieſt has been inſpired by means, which in different nations have been known by different names,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024075_0048_0FC31C456C2F3BC8"/>
ſuch as aſtrologies, auguries, oracles or incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. This article once eſtabliſhed, its continuation is not a difficult taſk For as the church acquires wealth, it furniſhes itſelf with the neceſſary apparatus, and the trade is carried on to advantage. The impoſition too becomes more eaſy from the authority of precedent, by which the inquiſitive faculties of the mind are benumbed; men believe by preſcription, and orthodoxy is hereditary.</p>
            <p>In this manner every nation of antiquity received the poiſon in its infancy, and was rendered incapable of acquiring a vigorous manhood, of ſpeaking a national will, or of acting with that dignity and generoſity, which are natural to man in ſociety. The moment that Romulus conſulted the oracles for the building of his city, that moment he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted its future citizens the enjoyment of liberty among themſelves, as well as all ideas of juſtice towards their neighbors. Men never act their own opinions in company with thoſe who can give them the opinions of gods; and as long as governors have an eſtabliſhed mode of conſulting the auſpices, there is no neceſſity to eſtabliſh any mode of conſulting the people. <hi>Nihil publice ſine auſpiciis nec domi nec militioe gerebatur</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cicero de divinatione.</hi> Lib. I.</note>, was the Roman <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; and it ſtood in place of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the rights of man. There is ſomething extremely impoſing in a maxim of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024075_0049_0FC317735AF20688"/>
this kind. Nothing is more pious, peaceful and moderate in appearance; and nothing more ſavage and abominable in its operation. But it is a genuine <hi>church maxim,</hi> and, as ſuch, deſerves a further conſideration.</p>
            <p>One obvious tendency of this maxim is, like the feudal rights, to inculcate radical ideas of inequalities among men; and it does this in a much greater degree. The feudal diſtance between man and man is perceptible and definite; but the moment you give one member of ſociety a familiar intercourſe with God, you launch him into the region of infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inviſibilities; you unfit him and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern to live together on any terms but thoſe of ſtupid reverence and of inſolent abuſe.</p>
            <p>Another tendency is to make men cruel and ſavage in a preternatural degree. When a perſon believes that he is doing the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate work of God, he diveſts himſelf of the feelings of a man. And an ambitious Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who wiſhes to extirpate or to plunder a neighboring nation, has only to order the prieſt to do his duty and ſet the people at work by an oracle; they then know no other bounds to their frenzy than the will of their leader, pronounced by the prieſt; whoſe voice to them is the voice of God. In this caſe the leaſt attention to mercy or juſtice would be abhorred as a diſobedience to the divine command. This circumſtance alone is ſufficient to account for two-thirds of the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024075_0050_0FC3177494BB3C58"/>
cruelty of all wars—perhaps in a great meaſure for their exiſtence—and has given riſe to an opinion, that nations are cruel in proportion as they are religious. But the obſervation ought to ſtand thus, <hi>That nations are cruel in proportion as they are guided by prieſts</hi>; than which there is no axiom more undeniably without exception.</p>
            <p>Another tendency of governing men by oracles, is to make them factious and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the uſe of liberty, when they feel themſelves in poſſeſſion of it. In all ancient democracies, the great body of the people enjoyed no liberty at all; and thoſe who were called freemen exerciſed it only by ſtarts, for the purpoſe of <hi>revenging</hi> injuries —not in a regular conſtituted mode of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting</hi> them; the body politic uſed liberty as a medicine, and not as daily bread. Hence it has happened, that the hiſtory of ancient democracies and of modern inſurrections are quoted upon us, to the inſult of common ſenſe, to prove that a whole people is not capable of governing itſelf. The whole of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this ſubject, from the profound diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of Ariſtotle, down to the puny whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Dr. Tatham <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be neceſſary to inform the reader, that Dr. Tatham of Oxford has written a book in defence of Royalty and Mr. Burke. As this is the laſt as well as weakeſt thing againſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that I have met with, it is mentioned in the text for the ſake of widening the graſp of my aſſertion, as well as for height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the contraſt among all poſſible authors.</note>, are founded on a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024075_0051_0FC317821CAE50D0"/>
inverſion of hiſtorical fact. It is the <hi>want</hi> of liberty, and not the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of it which has occaſioned all the factions in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the beginning of time, and will do ſo to the end; it is becauſe the people are <hi>not</hi> habitually free from civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tyrants, that they are diſpoſed to exerciſe tyranny themſelves. Habitual freedom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces effects directly the reverſe in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For a proof of this, look into Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; or if that be too much trouble, look into human nature with the eyes of common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>When the Chriſtian religion was perverted and preſſed into the ſervice of Government, under the name of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> it became neceſſary that its prieſts ſhould ſet up for ſupernatural powers, and inveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame cloak of infalibility, of which they had ſtripped their predeceſſors, the Druids and the Augurs. This they effected by miracles; for which they gained ſo great a reputation, that they were canonized after death, and have furniſhed modern Europe with a much greater catalogue of ſaints, than could be found in any breviary of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. The polytheiſm of the Catholic Church is more ſplendid for the number of its divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than that of the Eleuſinian; and they are not inferior in point of attributes. The Denis of France is at leaſt equal to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter of Greece or the Apis of Egypt. As to ſupernatural powers, the caſe is preciſely the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024075_0052_0FC3178609753038"/>
ſame in both; and the portions of infalibility are dealt out from the Pope to the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prieſts, according to their rank, in ſuch a manner as to complete the harmony of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Cicero has written with as much judgment and erudition on the "corruptions" of the old Roman Church, as Dr. Prieſtly has on thoſe of the new. But it is not the <hi>church</hi> which is corrupted by men, it is <hi>men</hi> who are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the church; for the very exiſtence of a church, as I have before defined it, is founded on a lie; it ſets out with the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of giving to one claſs of men the attributes of God; and the practiſing of theſe ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by that claſs, and believing them by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, corrupts and vitiates the whole.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt admirable contrivances of the Chriſtian Church is the buſineſs of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</hi> It requires great reflection to give us an idea of the effects wrought on ſociety by this part of the machinery. It is a ſolemn recognition of the ſupernatural powers of the prieſt, repeated every day in the year by every human creature above the age of twelve years. Nothing is more natural than for men to judge of every thing around them, and even of themſelves, by <hi>compariſon;</hi> and in this caſe what opinion are the laity to form of their own dignity? When a poor, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, vicious mortal is ſet up for the <hi>God,</hi> what is to be the <hi>man?</hi> I cannot conceive of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024075_0053_0FC317875E441BA0"/>

            <p>Another contrivance of the ſame ſort, and little inferior in efficacy, is the law of <hi>celibacy</hi> impoſed on the prieſthood, both male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, in almoſt all church-eſtabliſhments that have hitherto exiſted. The prieſt in the firſt place armed with the weapons of moral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by which he is made the profeſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enemy of his fellow men; and then, for fear he ſhould neglect to uſe thoſe weapons—for fear he ſhould contract the feelings and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of rational beings, by mingling with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and becoming one of its members— for fear his impoſitions ſhould be diſcovered by the intimacy of family connections,— he is interdicted the moſt cordial endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life; he is ſevered from the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of his fellow-creatures, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024075_0054_0FC3179134958470"/>
to be with them; his affections are held in the <hi>mortmain</hi> of perpetual inactivity; and, like the dead men of Mezentius, he is laſhed to ſociety for tyranny and contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>The whole of this management, in ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preparing and organizing the members of the eccleſiaſtical body, is purſued with the ſame uniform, cold-blooded hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſocial harmonies of life. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are taken from the younger ſons of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble families, who from their birth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a nuiſance to the houſe, and an outcaſt from parental attachment. They are then cut off from all opportunities of forming fraternal affections, and educated in a cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; till they enter upon their public functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as diſconnected from the feelings of the community, as it is deſigned they ſhall ever remain from its intereſts.</p>
            <p>I will not mention the corruption of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which muſt reſult from the combined cauſes of the ardent paſſions of conſtrained celibacy, and the ſecret interviews of the prieſt with the women of his charge, for the purpoſe of confeſſions; I will draw no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the diſſentions ſown in families; the jealouſies and conſequent aberrations of huſband and wife, occaſioned by an intrigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtranger being in the ſecrets of both; the diſcouragements laid upon matrimony by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral dread of theſe conſequences in the minds
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024075_0055_0FC317954157FA98"/>
of men of reflection—effects which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in all catholic countries; but I will conclude this article by obſerving the direct influence that eccleſiaſtical celibacy alone has had on the population of Europe.</p>
            <p>This policy of the church muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at leaſt as great an effect, in thinning ſociety, as the whole of her wars and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. In Catholic Europe there muſt be near a million of eccleſiaſtics. This propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind continuing deducted from the agents of population for fifteen centuries, muſt have precluded the exiſtence of more than one hundred millions of the human ſpecies.</p>
            <p>Should the reader be diſpoſed on this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to liſten to the reply which is ſometimes made, that Europe is ſufficiently populous; I beg he would ſuſpend his deciſion, till he ſhall ſee what may be ſaid, in the courſe of this work, on protected induſtry; and until he ſhall well conſider the effects of liberty on the means of ſubſiſtence. That reply is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the axioms of tyranny, and is of kin to the famous wiſh of Caligula, that the whole Roman people had but one neck.</p>
            <p>The French have gone as far in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the hierarchy as could have been expected, conſidering the habits of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the preſent circumſtances of Europe. The church in that country was like royalty —the prejudices in its favor were too ſtrong
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024075_0056_0FC3179BBA9CEDB8"/>
to be vanquiſhed all at once. The moſt that could be done, was to tear the bandage from the eyes of mankind, break the charm of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, demoliſh ranks and infalibilities, and teach the people that mitres and crowns did not confer ſupernatural powers. As long as public teachers are choſen by the people, are ſalaried and removeable by the people, are born and married among the people, have families to be educated and protected from oppreſſion and from vice,—as long as they have all the common ſympathies of ſociety to bind them to the public intereſt, there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little danger of their becoming tyrants by force; and the liberty of the preſs will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being ſo by craft.</p>
            <p>In the United States of America there is no church; and this is one of the principal circumſtances which diſtinguiſh that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all others that ever exiſted; it enſures the un-embarraſſed exerciſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the continuation of public inſtruction in the ſcience of liberty and happineſs, and promiſes a long duration to a repreſentative government.</p>

            <p>THE church, in all modern Europe, may be conſidered as a kind of ſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; as the members of that community have been in every nation, the ſureſt ſupporters of arbitrary power, both for internal oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and for external violence. But this not being ſufficient of itſelf, an additional inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be known by the name of the <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſyſtem,</hi> became neceſſary; and it ſeems to have been expedient to call up another element of human nature, out of which this new inſtrument might be created and maintained. The church was in poſſeſſion of the ſtrongeſt ground that could be taken in the human mind, the <hi>principle of religion</hi>; a principle dealing with things inviſible; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the moſt capable of being itſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and then of perverting the whole mind, and ſubjecting it to any unreaſonable purſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:024075_0058_0FC3179F4B0D0E48"/>Next to that of religion, and ſimilar to it in moſt of its characteriſtics, is the principle of <hi>honor.</hi> Honor, like religion, is an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, indelible ſentiment of the mind, an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable ingredient in our nature. But its object is incapable of preciſe definition; and conſequently, though given us in aid of the more definable feelings of morality, it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of total perverſion, of loſing ſight of its own original nature, and ſtill retaining its name; of purſuing the deſtruction of moral ſentiments, inſtead of being their ornament; of debaſing, inſtead of ſupporting, the dignity of man.</p>
            <p>This camelion principle was therefore a proper element of impoſition, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to make an immenſe figure in the world, as the foundation and ſupport of the military ſyſtem of all unequal governments. We muſt look pretty far into human nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall diſcover the cauſe, why killing men in battle ſhould be deemed, <hi>in itſelf,</hi> an honorable employment. A hangman is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally deſpiſed; he exerciſes an office which not only the feelings but the policy of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have agreed to regard as infamous. What is it that ſhould make the difference of theſe two occupations in favor of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? Surely it is not becauſe the victims in the former caſe are <hi>innocent,</hi> and in the latter <hi>guilty.</hi> To aſſert this, would be a greater libel upon human ſociety than I can bring
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024075_0059_0FC317A620EFF608"/>
myſelf to utter; it would make the tyranny of opinion the moſt <hi>deteſtable,</hi> as well as the moſt ſovereign of all poſſible tyrannies. But what can it be? It is not, what is ſometimes alledged, that <hi>courage</hi> is the foundation of the buſineſs; that fighting is honorable becauſe is is dangerous; there is often as much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage diſplayed in highway-robbery, as in the warmeſt conflict of armies; and yet it does no honor to the party; a Robin Hood is as diſhonorable a character as a Jack Ketch. It is not becauſe there is any idea of <hi>juſtice</hi> or <hi>honeſty</hi> in the caſe; for to ſay the beſt that can be ſaid of war, it is impoſſible that more than one ſide can be juſt or honeſt; and yet both ſides of every conteſt are equally the road to ſame; where a diſtinguiſhed killer of men is ſure to gain immortal honor. It is not <hi>patriotiſm,</hi> even in that ſenſe of the word which deviates the moſt from general philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy; for a total ſtranger to both parties in a war, may enter into it on either ſide as a volunteer, perform more than a vulgar ſhare of the ſlaughter, and be for ever applauded, even by his enemies. Finally, it is not from any pecuniary advantages that are ordinarily attached to the profeſſion of arms; for ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are generally poor, though part of their buſineſs be to plunder.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I can ſee but one reaſon in nature, why the principle of honor ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from all human incentives, and relied
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024075_0060_0FC317A7A1D10F08"/>
on for the ſupport of the military ſyſtem: it is becauſe it was <hi>convenient for the governing power</hi>; that power being in the hands of a ſmall part of the community whoſe buſineſs was to ſupport it by impoſition. No princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a permanent nature, whoſe object is unequivocal, and whoſe ſlighteſt deviations are perceptible, would have anſwered the purpoſe. Juſtice, for inſtance, is a principle of common uſe, of which every man can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the application. Should the prince ſay it was <hi>juſt,</hi> to commence an unprovoked war with his weak neighbors and plunder their country, the falſhood would be too glaring; all men would judge for themſelves, and give him the lie; and no man would follow his ſtandard, unleſs bribed by his avarice. But honor is of another nature; it is what we all can feel, but no one can define; it is therefore whatever the prince may chooſe to name it; and ſo powerful is its operation, that all the uſeful ſentiments of life loſe their effect; morality is not only baniſhed from political cabinets, but generally and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally from the boſoms of men who purſue honor in the profeſſion of arms.</p>
            <p>It is common for a king, who wiſhes to make a thing faſhionable, to practiſe it himſelf; and in this he is ſure of general imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſucceſs. As this divice is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, and as the exiſtence of wars is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the exiſtence of kings;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024075_0061_0FC317A927AED040"/>
to give a faſhion to the trade muſt have been a conſiderable motive to the ancient kings, for expoſing themſelves ſo much as they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did in battle. They ſaid, <hi>let human ſlaughter be honorable,</hi> and honorable it was.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that warriors have been term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heroes; and the eulogy of heroes has been the conſtant buſineſs of hiſtorians and poets, from the days of Nimrod down to the preſent century. Homer, for his aſtoniſhing variety, animation, and ſublimity, has not a warmer admirer than myſelf; he has been for three thouſand years, like a reigning ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, applauded as a matter of courſe, whether from love or fear; for no man with ſafety to his own character can refuſe to join the chorus of his praiſe. I never can expreſs (and his other admirers have not done it for me) the pleaſure I receive from his poems; but in a view of philanthropy, I conſider his exiſtence as having been a ſerious misfortune to the human race. He has given to military life a charm which few men can reſiſt, a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which envelopes the ſcenes of carnage in a cloud of glory, which dazzles the eyes of every beholder, ſteals from us our natural ſenſibilities in exchange for the artificial, debaſes men to brutes under the pretext of exalting them to gods, and obliterates with the ſame irreſiſtable ſtroke the moral duties of life and the true policy of nations.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024075_0062_0FC317B2D41EFC58"/>
Alexander <note n="*" place="bottom">It is not unworthy of remark, that Ariſtotle was the tutor of Alexander, and the moſt ſplendid editor and commentator of Homer. As we muſt judge an author by his works, it is but fair to take into view the whole of his works. Conſidered therefore as a political ſchool-maſter to the world, the forming of his pupil and the illuſtrating of his poet are the greateſt fruits of the induſtry of that philoſopher, and have had much more influence on the affairs of nation than his treaitiſe that bears the name of <hi>politics.</hi>
               </note> is not the only human monſter that has been formed after the model of Achilles; nor Perſia and Egypt the only countries depopulated for no other reaſon than the deſire of rivalling predeceſſors in military fame.</p>
            <p>Another device of princes, to render ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable the profeſſion of arms, was to make it enviable, by depriving the loweſt orders of ſociety of the power of becoming ſoldiers. Excluding the helots of all nations from any part in the glory of butchering their fellow-creatures, has had the ſame effect as in Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta—it has ennobled the trade; and this is the true feudal eſtimation, in which this trade has deſcended to us from our Gothic anceſtors.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that the feudal ſyſtem was furniſhing Europe with a numerous body of nobleſſe, it became neceſſary, for various purpoſes of deſpotiſm, that they ſhould be prevented from mingling with the common maſs of ſociety, that they ſhould be held to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by what they call <hi>l'eſprit de corps,</hi> or the corporation ſpirit, and be furniſhed with occupations which ſhould leave them nothing
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024075_0063_0FC317B517406098"/>
in common with their fellow men. Theſe occupations were offered by the church and the army; and as the former was permanent, it was thought expedient to give permanency to the latter. Thus the military ſyſtem has created the nobleſſe, and the nobleſſe the military ſyſtem. They are mutually neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to each other's exiſtence—concurrent and reciprocal cauſes and effects, generating and generated, perpetuating each other by interchangeable wants, and both indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the governing power.</p>
            <p>Thoſe perſons therefore who undertake to defend the nobleſſe as a neceſſary order in the great community of men, ought to be appriſed of the extent of their undertaking. They muſt, in the firſt place, defend <hi>ſtanding armies,</hi> and that too upon principles, not of national prudence, as relative to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of neighbors, but of internal neceſſity, as relative only to the organization of ſociety. They muſt at the ſame time extend their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to the increaſe of thoſe armies; for they infallibly muſt increaſe to a degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our ordinary calculation, or they will not anſwer the purpoſe; both becauſe the number of the nobleſſe, or "the men of the ſword" (as they are properly ſtyled by their friend Burke) is conſtantly augmenting, and becauſe the influence of the church is on the decline. As the light of philoſophy illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the world, it ſhines in upon the ſecrets
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024075_0064_0FC317B69951A0E0"/>
of government; and it is neceſſary to make the blind as broad as the window, or the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers will ſee what is doing in the cabinet. The means of impoſition muſt be increaſed in the army, in proportion a they are loſt in the church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they muſt vindicate <hi>war,</hi> not merely as an occurrence of fatality, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable on the defenſive; but as a thing of choice, as being the moſt nutritious aliment of that kind of government which requires privileged orders and an army: for it is no great figure of ſpeech, to ſay that the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Europe are always fed upon human gore. They originated in war, they live by war, and without war it would be impoſſible to keep them from ſtarving. Or, to drop the figure entirely, if mankind were left to the peaceable purſuit of induſtry, the titled or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would loſe their diſtinctions, mingle with ſociety, and become reaſonable creatures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they muſt defend the <hi>honor</hi> of the occupation which is allotted to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe. For the age is becoming extremely ſceptical on this ſubject; there are heretics in the world (Mr. Burke calls them atheiſts) who affect to diſbelieve that men were made expreſly for the purpoſe of cutting each other's throats; and who ſay that it is not the higheſt honor that a man can arrive at, to ſell himſelf to another man for life at a certain daily price, and to hold himſelf in readineſs, night and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024075_0065_0FC317BD56B8A298"/>
day, to kill individuals or nations, at home or abroad, without ever enquiring the cauſe. Theſe men ſay, that it is no compliment to the judgment or humanity of a man, to lead ſuch a life; and they do not ſee why a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould not poſſeſs theſe qualities as well as other people.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they muſt prove that all occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which tend to <hi>life,</hi> and not to <hi>death,</hi> are diſhonorable and infamous. Agriculture, commerce, every method of augmenting the means of ſubſiſtence, and raiſing men from the ſavage ſtate, muſt be held ignoble; or elſe men of honor will forget themſelves ſo far as to engage in them; and then farewell to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions. The national aſſembly may then create orders as faſt as it has ever uncreated them; it is impoſſible for Nobility to exiſt, in France, or in any other country, unleſs the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove articles are firmly defended by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and fixed in the minds of mankind:</p>
            <p>It ſeems difficult for a man of reflection to write one page on the ſubject of government, without meeting with ſome old eſtabliſhed max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, which are not only falſe, but which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the reverſe of truth. Of this ſort is the opinion, That inevitable wars in modern times have given occaſion to the preſent military ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, and that ſtanding armies are the beſt means of preventing wars. This is what the people of Europe are commanded to believe. With all due deference, however, to their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024075_0066_0FC317C54CB73FC0"/>
I would propoſe a contrary belief, which I will venture to lay down as the true ſtate of the fact: <hi>That the preſent military ſyſtem has been the cauſe of the wars of modern times, and that ſtanding armies are the beſt, if not the only means of</hi> PROMOTING <hi>wars.</hi> This poſition has at leaſt one advantage over thoſe that are commonly eſtabliſhed by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is believed by him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it to the aſſent of others. Men who cannot command the power of the ſtate, ought to enforce their doctrines by the power of Reaſon, and to riſk on the ſea of opinion nothing more than what ſhe will take under her convoy.</p>
            <p>To apply this maxim to the caſe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; let us aſk, <hi>What is war?</hi> and on what propenſity in human nature does it reſt? for it is to MAN that we are to trace theſe queſtions, and not to <hi>princes</hi>; we muſt drive them up to <hi>principle,</hi> and not ſtop ſhort at <hi>precedent</hi>; and endeavor to uſe our ſenſe, inſtead of parading our learning. Among individual men, or ſavages acting in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultory manner, antecedent to the formation of great ſocieties, there may be many cauſes of quarrels and aſſaſſinations; ſuch as love, jealouſy, rapine, or the revenge of private injuries. But theſe do not amount to the idea of war. War ſuppoſes a vaſt aſſociation of men engaged in one cauſe, actuated by one ſpirit, and carrying on a bloody conteſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024075_0067_0FC317C98E94A698"/>
with another aſſociation in a ſimilar predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Few of the motives which actuate private men can apply at once to ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the greateſt part of which muſt be perſonal ſtrangers to each other. Indeed, where the motives are clearly explained and well underſtood by the community at large, ſo as to be really felt by the people, there is but one of the ordinary cauſes above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned which can actuate ſuch a body; it is <hi>rapine,</hi> or the hope of enriching themſelves by plunder. There can be then but two circumſtances under which a nation will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence an offenſive war: either the people at large muſt be thoroughly convinced that they ſhall be perſonally rewarded not only with conqueſt, but with a vaſt ſhare of wealth from the conquered nation, or elſe they muſt be duped into the war by thoſe who hold the reigns of government. All motives for nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal offences are reduced to theſe two, and there can be no more. The ſubject, like moſt others, becomes extremely ſimple, the moment it is conſidered.</p>
            <p>And how many of the wars of mankind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginate in the firſt of theſe motives? Among civilized nations, none. A people conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably numerous, approaching towards ideas of ſober policy, and beginning to taſte the fruits of induſtry, require but little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to convince themſelves of the following truths—that no benefit can be derived to the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024075_0068_0FC317CADC2D8428"/>
great body of individuals from conqueſt though it were certain—that this event is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doubtful, and the deciſion to be dreaded —that nine tenths of the loſſes in all wars are a <hi>clear</hi> loſs to both parties, being ſunk in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences—that the remaining tenth neceſſarily comes into the hands of the principal mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and produces a real misfortune even to the victorious party, by giving them maſters at home, inſtead of riches from abroad.</p>
            <p>The pitiful idea of feaſting ourſelves on a compariſon of ſuffering, and balancing our own loſſes by thoſe of the enemy, is a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of government, a calculation of cabinet arithmetic. Individuals reaſon not in this manner. A diſtreſſed mother in England, reduced from a full to a ſcanty diet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the loſs of her ſon, receives no conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from being told of a woman in France, whoſe ſon ſell in the ſame battle, and that the taxes are equally increaſed in both countries by the ſame war. But kings, and miniſters, and generals, and hiſtorians proclaim, as a glorious conteſt, every war which appears to have been as fatal to the enemy as to their own party, though one half of each nation are ſlaughtered in the field, and the other half reduced to ſlavery. This is one of the bare-faced impoſitions with which mankind are perpetually inſulted, and which call upon us, in the name of humanity, to purſue this enquiry into the cauſes of war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:024075_0069_0FC317CC545B3E20"/>The hiſtory of ancient Rome, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to end, under all its kings, conſuls and emperors, furniſhes not a ſingle inſtance, after the conqueſt of the Sabians, of what may properly be called a <hi>popular</hi> offenſive war; I mean a war that would have been underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the people, had they enjoyed a free government, ſo organized as to have enabled them to deliberate before they acted, and to ſuffer nothing to be carried into execution but the national will.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid of modern Europe, after a correſponding period in the progreſs of nations; which period ſhould be placed at the very commencement of civilization. Perhaps after the ſettlement of the Saracens in Spain, the Lombards in Italy, the Franks in Gaul, and the Saxons in England, we ſhould have heard no more of offenſive ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, had they depended on the uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced wiſhes of the people. For we are not to regard as <hi>offenſive</hi> the ſtruggles of a nation for the recovery of liberty.</p>
            <p>What an inconceivable maſs of ſlaughter are we then to place to the other account; to dark unequal government! to the magical powers poſſeſſed by a few men of blinding the eyes of the community, and leading the people to deſtruction by thoſe who are called their fathers and their friends! Theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations could not be carried on, for a long time together, in ages tolerably enlightened,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024075_0070_0FC317D715180A28"/>
without a permanent reſource. As long as the military conditions of feudal tenures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in full vigor, they were ſure to furniſh the means of deſtruction to follow the will of the ſovereign; but as the aſperities of this ſyſtem ſoftened away by degrees, it ſeems that governments were threatened with the neceſſity of applying to the people at large for voluntary enliſtments, and contributions in money; on which application the purpoſe muſt be declared. This would be too direct an appeal to the conſciences of men on a queſtion of offenſive war, and was, if poſſible, to be avoided. For even the power of the church, where there was no queſtion of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, could not be always relied on, to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate to a quarrel with their neighbors of the ſame faith; and ſtill leſs was it ſure of induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to part with their money. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient therefore of ſtanding armies became neceſſary; and perhaps rather on account of the money than the men. Thus money is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to levy armies, and armies to levy money; and foreign wars are introduced as the pretended occaſion for both.</p>
            <p>One general character will apply to much the greater part of the wars of modern times, —they are <hi>political</hi> and not <hi>vindictive.</hi> This alone is ſufficient to account for their real origin, they are wars of agreement<note n="*" place="bottom">Whenever the real ſecret hiſtory of the Engliſh and Spaniſh armaments of 1790 ſhall be publiſhed to the world, though it may not furniſh new arguments to men of reflection for diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing political cabinets, it may at leaſt increaſe the number of ſuch men. But this cannot be done with ſafety during the lives of ſome of the principal actors in that aſtoniſhing piece of auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. I am convinced that the perſon who at this moment ſhould do it, would not ſurvive the publication ſo long as pope Gangan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elli did the ſuppreſſion of the Jeſuits.</note>,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024075_0071_0FC317D8606E5288"/>
rather than of diſſention; and the conqueſt is taxes, and not territory. To carry on this buſineſs, it is neceſſary not only to keep up the military ſpirit of the nobleſſe by titles and penſions, and to keep in pay a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of troops, who know no other God but their king; who loſe all ideas of themſelves, in contemplating their officers; and who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the duties of a man, to practiſe thoſe of a ſoldier—this is but half the operation: an eſſential part of the military ſyſtem is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm the people, to hold all the functions of war, as well the arm that executes, as the will that declares it, equally above their reach. This part of the ſyſtem has a double effect, it palſies the hand and brutalizes the mind; an habitual diſuſe of phyſical forces totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the moral; and men loſe at once the power of protecting themſelves, and of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſe of their oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt uſeleſs to mention the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which every rational mind muſt draw from theſe conſiderations. But though they are too obvious to be miſtaken, they are ſtill too important to be paſſed over in ſilence; for we ſeem to be arrived at that epoch in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:024075_0072_0FC317DA01CB1758"/>
human affairs, when "all uſeful ideas, and truths the moſt neceſſary to the happineſs of mankind, are no longer excluſively deſtined to adorn the pages of a book <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>L'Aſſemblee nationale.</hi>
               </note>." Nations, wearied out with impoſture, begin to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſafety of man, inſtead of purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I will mention as one concluſion, which bids fair to be a practical one, that the way to prevent wars is not merely to change the military ſyſtem; for that, like the church, is a neceſſary part of the governments as they now ſtand, and of ſociety as now organized: but the <hi>principle of government</hi> muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely changed; and the conſequence of this will be ſuch a total renovation of ſociety, as to baniſh ſtanding armies, overturn the military ſyſtem, and exclude the poſſibility of war.</p>
            <p>Only admit the original, unalterable truth, <hi>that all men are equal in their rights,</hi> and the foundation of every thing is laid; to build the ſuperſtructure requires no effort but that of natural deduction. The firſt neceſſary deduction will be, that the people will form an equal repreſentative government; in which it will be impoſſible for <hi>orders</hi> or <hi>privileges</hi> to exiſt for a moment; and conſequently the firſt materials for ſtanding armies will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into peaceable members of the ſtate. Another deduction follows, That the people
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:024075_0073_0FC317E447350C08"/>
will be univerſally armed: they will aſſume thoſe weapons for ſecurity, which the art of war has invented for deſtruction. You will then have removed the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army by the organization of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the <hi>poſſiblity</hi> of it by the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the militia; for it is as impoſſible for an armed ſoldiery to exiſt in an armed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for a nobility to exiſt under an equal government.</p>
            <p>It is curious to remark how ill we reaſon on human nature, from being accuſtomed to view it under the diſguiſe which the unequal governments of the world have always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon it. During the American war, and eſpecially towards its cloſe, General Waſhington might be ſaid to poſſeſs the hearts of all the Americans. His recommendation was law, and he was able to command the whole power of that people for any purpoſe of defence. The philoſophers of Europe conſidered this as a dangerous criſis to the cauſe of freedom. They <hi>knew,</hi> from the example of Caeſar and Sylla and Marius and Alcibiades and Pericles and Cromwell, that Waſhington would never lay down his arms till he had given his country a maſter. But after he did lay them down, then came the miracle—his virtue was cried up to be more than human; and it is by this miracle of virtue in him, that the Americans are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to enjoy their liberty at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:024075_0074_0FC317E57752D398"/>I believe the virtue of that great man to be equal to the higheſt human virtue that has ever yet been known; but to an American eye no extraordinary portion of it could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that tranſaction. It would have been impoſſible for the general or the army to have continued in the field after the enemy left it; for the ſoldiers were all <hi>citizens</hi>; and if it had been otherwiſe, their numbers were not the hundredth part of the citizens at large who were all <hi>ſoldiers.</hi> To ſay that he was wiſe in diſcerning the impoſſibility of ſucceſs in an attempt to imitate the great heroes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, is to give him only the ſame merit for ſagacity which is common to every other perſon who knows that country, or who has well conſidered the effects of equal liberty.</p>
            <p>Though infinite praiſe is due to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting aſſembly of France for the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſolution and manly firmneſs which mark their operations in general; yet it muſt be confeſſed that ſome of their reforms bear the marks of too timorous a hand. Preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hereditary king with a tremendous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of powers, and providing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary number of prieſts, to be paid from the national purſe, and furniſhed with the means of rebuilding the half-deſtroyed ruins of the hierarchy, are circumſtances to be pardoned for reaſons which I have already hinted. But the enormous military force,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024075_0075_0FC317E6B1DB88D8"/>
which they have decreed ſhall remain as a permanent eſtabliſhment, appears to me not only unneceſſary, and even dangerous to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but totally and directly ſubverſive of the end they had in view. Their objects were the ſecurity of the frontiers and the tranquility of the ſtate; the reverſe of this will be the effect—not perhaps that this army will be turned againſt the people, or involve the ſtate in offenſive wars. On the contrary, ſuppoſe that it ſimply and faithfully defends the frontiers and protects the people; this defence and this protection are the evils of which I complain. They tend to weaken the nation, by deadening the ſpirit of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and teaching them to look up to others for protection, inſtead of depending on their own invincible arm. A people that legiſlate for themſelves ought to be in the habit of protecting themſelves; or they will loſe the ſpirit of both. A knowledge of their own <hi>ſtrength</hi> preſerves a temperance in their own <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and the performance of their <hi>duties</hi> gives a value to their <hi>rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is likewiſe the way to increaſe the ſolid domeſtic force of a nation, to a degree far beyond any ideas we form of a ſtanding army; and at the ſame time to annihilate its capacity as well as inclination for foreign aggreſſive hoſtilities. The true guarantee of perpetual tranquility at home and abroad, in ſuch a caſe, would ariſe from this truth,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024075_0076_0FC317E82DA0AA00"/>
which would paſs into an incontrovertible maxim, that offenſive operations would be impoſſible, and defenſive ones infallible.</p>
            <p>This is undoubtedly the true and only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of exterminating wars from the face of the earth: and it muſt afford no ſmall degree of conſolation to every friend of humanity, to find this unſpeakable bleſſing reſulting from that equal mode of government, which alone ſecures every other enjoyment for which mankind unite their intereſts in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Politicians, and even ſometimes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, are accuſtomed to ſpeak of war as an uncontrolable event, falling on the human race like a concuſſion of the elements—a ſcourge which admits no remedy; but for which we muſt wait with trembling prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for an epidemical diſeaſe, whoſe force we may hope to lighten, but can never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void. They ſay that mankind are wicked and rapacious, and "it muſt be that offences will come." This reaſoning applies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and to countries when governed by individuals; but not to nations delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſpeaking a national voice. I hope I ſhall not be underſtood to mean, that the nature of man is totally changed by living in a free republic. I allow that it is ſtill <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted</hi> men and <hi>paſſionate</hi> men, that direct the affairs of the world. But in national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, paſſion is loſt in deliberation, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt balances intereſt; till the good of the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024075_0077_0FC317F235B275C0"/>
whole community combines the general will. Here then is a great moral entity, acting ſtill from intereſted motives; but whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it never can be, in any poſſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of circumſtances, to commence an offenſive war.</p>
            <p>There is another conſideration, from which we may argue the total extinction of wars, as a neceſſary conſequence of eſtabliſhing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the repreſentative wiſdom of the people. We are all ſenſible that ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a blemiſh of human nature, by no means confined to ſubjects connected with religion. Political ſuperſtition is almoſt as ſtrong as religious; and it is quite as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally uſed as an inſtrument of tyranny. To enumerate the variety of ways in which this inſtrument operates on the mind, would be more difficult, than to form a general idea of the reſult of its operations. In monarchies, it induces men to ſpill their blood for a particular family, or for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular branch of that family, who happens to have been born firſt, or laſt, or to have been taught to repeat a certain creed, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to other creeds. But the effect which I am going chiefly to notice, is that which reſpects the territorial boundaries of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For a man in Portugal or Spain to prefer belonging to one of thoſe nations rather than the other, is as much a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to prefer the houſe of Braganza to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024075_0078_0FC317F41D8A83E8"/>
that of Bourbon, or Mary the ſecond of England, to her brother. All theſe ſubjects of preference ſtand upon the ſame footing as the turban and the hat, the croſs and the creſcent, or the lilly and the roſe.</p>
            <p>The boundaries of nations have been fixed for the accommodation of the <hi>government,</hi> without the leaſt regard to the convenience of the people. Kings and miniſters, who make a profitable trade of governing, are intereſted in extending the limits of their dominion as far as poſſible. They have a property in the people, and in the territory that they cover. The country and its inhabitants are to them a farm ſtocked with ſheep. When they call up theſe ſheep to be ſheared, they teach them to know their names, to follow their maſter, and avoid a ſtranger. By this unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impoſition it is, that men are led from one extravagant folly to another—to adore their king, to boaſt of their nation, and to wiſh for conqueſt—circumſtances equally ridiculous in themſelves, and equally incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with that rational eſtimation of things which ariſes from the ſcience of liberty.</p>
            <p>In America it is not ſo. Among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtates, the governments are all equal in their force, and the people are all equal in their rights. Were it poſſible for one ſtate to conquer another ſtate, without any expence of money, or of time, or of blood—neither of the ſtates, nor a ſingle individual in either of them, would be richer or poorer for the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024075_0079_0FC317F59E270A38"/>
event. The people would all be upon their own lands, and engaged in their own occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, as before; and whether the territory on which they live were called New-York or Maſſachuſetts, is a matter of total indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, about which they have no ſuperſtition. For the people belong not to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the government belongs to the people.</p>
            <p>Since the independence of thoſe ſtates, many territorial diſputes have been ſettled, which had riſen from the interference of their ancient charters. The interference of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is a kind of policy which, I ſuppoſe, every mother country obſerves towards her colonies, in order to give them a ſubject of contention; that ſhe may have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of keeping all parties quiet by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental bleſſing of a ſtanding army. But on the baniſhment of foreign controul, and all ideas of European policy, the enjoyment of equal liberty has taught the Americans the ſecret of ſettling theſe diſputes, with as much calmneſs as they have formed their conſtitutions. It is found, that queſtions about the boundaries between free ſtates are not matters of intereſt, but merely of form and convenience. And though theſe queſtions may involve a tract of country equal to an European kingdom, it alters not the caſe; they are ſettled as merchants ſettle the courſe of exchange between two commercial
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:024075_0080_0FC317F721B17D00"/>
cities. Several inſtances have occurred, ſince the revolution, of deciding in a few days, by amicable arbitration, territorial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which determine the juriſdiction of larger and richer tracts of country, than have formed the objects of all the wars of the two laſt centuries between France and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to ſpend any time in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this idea to the circumſtances of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the government ſhould be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and habitually in the hands of the people. It would apply to all Europe; and will apply to it, as ſoon as a revolution ſhall take place in the principle of government. For ſuch a revolution cannot ſtop ſhort of fixing the power of the ſtate on the baſis allotted by nature, the unalienable rights of man; which are the ſame in all countries. It will eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſuperſtitions about territorial juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and this conſideration muſt promiſe an additional ſecurity againſt the poſſiblity of war.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. The Adminiſtration of Juſtice.</head>
            <p>IT would be a curious ſpeculation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as uſeful as curious, to conſider how far the moral nature of man is effected by the organization of ſociety; and to what degree his predominant qualities depend on the nature of the government under which he lives. The adage, <hi>That men are every where the ſame,</hi> though not wholly falſe, would doubtleſs be found to be true only in a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe. I love to indulge the belief, that it is true ſo far as to enſure permanency to inſtitutions that are good; but not ſo far as to diſcourage us from attempting to reform thoſe that are bad. To conſider it as true in an unlimited ſenſe, would be to ſerve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of deſpotiſm; for which this, like a thouſand other maxims, has been invented and employed. It would teach us to ſit down with a gloomy ſatisfaction on the ſtate of human affairs, to pronounce the race of man emphatically "fated to be curſt," a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of ſelf-tormentors and mutual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins, bound down by the irreſiſtible deſtiny of their nature to be robbed of their reaſon by prieſts, and plundered of their property
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024075_0082_0FC31800EB7A1C98"/>
by kings. It would teach us to join with Soame Jenyns, and furniſh new weapons to the oppreſſors, by our manner of pitying the misfortunes of the oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of this adage, and as an apology for the exiſting deſpotiſms, it is ſaid, That all men are by nature tyrants, and will exerciſe their tyrannies, whenever they find opportunity. Allowing this aſſertion to be true, it is ſurely cited by the wrong party. It is an apology for equal, and not for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal governments; and the weapon belongs to thoſe who contend for the republican principle. If government be founded on the vices of mankind, its buſineſs is to reſtrain thoſe vices in all, rather than to foſter them in a few. The diſpoſition to tyrannize is effectually reſtrained under the exerciſe of the equality of rights; while it is not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the few, but invigorated in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, under all other forms of the ſocial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. But it is almoſt impoſſible to decide, among moral propenſities, which of them belong to nature, and which are the offspring of habit; how many of our vices are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on the permanent qualities of man, and how many reſult from the mutable energies of ſtate.</p>
            <p>If it be in the power of a bad government to render men worſe than nature has made them, why ſhould we ſay it is not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a good one to render them better? and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024075_0083_0FC3180848B756A8"/>
if the latter be capable of producing this effect in any perceivable degree, where ſhall we limit the progreſs of human wiſdom and the force of its inſtitutions, in ameliorating not only the ſocial condition, but the controlling principles of man?</p>
            <p>Among the component parts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that, whoſe operation is direct on the moral habits of life, is the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. In this every perſon has a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar inſolated intereſt, which is almoſt detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the common ſympathies of ſociety. It is this which operates with a ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated energy, collecting the whole force of the ſtate from the community at large, and bringing it to act upon a ſingle individual, affecting his life, reputation or property; ſo that the governing power may ſay with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar propriety to the miniſter of juſtice, <hi>divide et impera</hi>; for, in caſe of oppreſſion, the victim's cries will be too feeble to excite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; his cauſe having nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with that of the citizens at large. If therefore we would obtain an idea of the condition of men on any given portion of the earth, we muſt pay a particular attention to their judiciary ſyſtem, not in its form and theory, but in its ſpirit and practiſe. It may be ſaid in general of this part of the civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a nation, that as it is a ſtream flowing from the common fountain of the government, and muſt be tinged with whatever impurities
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024075_0084_0FC3180A3AEB2CF8"/>
are found in the ſource from whence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, the only hope of cleanſing the ſtream is by purifing the fountain.</p>
            <p>If I were able to give an energetic ſketch of the office and dignity of a rational ſyſtem of juriſprudence, deſcribe the full extent of its effects on the happineſs of men, and then exhibit the perverſions and corruptions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on this buſineſs in moſt of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of Europe, it would furniſh one of the moſt powerful arguments in favor of a general revolution, and afford no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to thoſe perſons who look forward with certainty to ſuch an event. But my plan embraces too many ſubjects, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in any; all that I can promiſe myſelf is to ſeize the rough features of ſyſtems, and mark the moral attitudes of man as placed in the neceſſary poſture to ſupport them.</p>
            <p>It is generally underſtood that the object of government, in this part of its adminiſtration, is merely to <hi>reſtrain</hi> the vices of men. But there is another object prior to this; an office more ſacred, and equally indiſpenſable, is to <hi>prevent</hi> their vices—to correct them in their origin, or eradicate them totally from the adoleſcent mind. The latter is performed by inſtruction, the former by coercion; the one is the tender duty of a father, the other, the unrelenting drudgery of a maſter; but both are the buſineſs of government, and ought to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024075_0085_0FC31811E0620618"/>
be made concurrent branches of the ſyſtem of juriſprudence.</p>
            <p>The abſurd and abominable doctrine, <hi>that private vices are public benefits,</hi> it is hoped, will be blotted from the memory of man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged from the catalogue of human follies, with the ſyſtems of governments which gave it birth. The ground of this inſulting doctrine is, that advantage may be taken of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant foibles of individuals to increaſe the revenues of the ſtate; as if the chief end of ſociety were, to ſteal money for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's purſe! to be ſquandered by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, to render them more inſolent in their oppreſſions! It is humiliating, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch arguments as theſe; where we muſt lay open the moſt degrading retreats of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted logic, to diſcover the poſitions on which they are founded. But <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> will lead to any thing: once teach a man, that <hi>ſome are born to command and others to be commanded</hi>; and after that, there is no camel too big for him to ſwallow.</p>
            <p>This idea of the objects to be kept in view by the ſyſtem of juſtice, involving in it the buſineſs of prevention as well as of reſtriction, leads us to ſome obſervations on the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſubject of criminal juriſprudence. Every ſociety, conſidered in itſelf as a moral and phyſical entity, has the undoubted faculty of ſelf-preſervation. It is an independent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, towards other beings in like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024075_0086_0FC31812D3FB0168"/>
of independence, it has a right to uſe this faculty of defending itſelf, without previous notice to the party; or without the obſervance of any duty, but that of abſtaining from offenſive operations. But when it acts towards the members of its own family, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe dependent and defenceleſs beings that make part of itſelf, the <hi>right</hi> of coercion is preceded by the <hi>duty</hi> of inſtruction. It may be ſafely pronounced, <hi>that a ſtate has no right to puniſh a man, to whom it has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no previous inſtruction;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any perſon has a right to do any action, unleſs he has been informed that it has an evil tendency. It is true, that as relative to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes, the having given this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a thing that the ſociety muſt ſometimes <hi>preſume,</hi> and is not always obliged to <hi>prove.</hi> But theſe caſes are rare, and ought never to form a general rule. This preſumption has however paſſed into a general rule, and is adopted as univerſal practiſe. With what juſtice or propriety it is ſo adopted, a very little reflection will enable us to decide.</p>
            <p>The great out-lines of morality are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſimple and eaſy to be underſtood; they may be ſaid to be written on the heart of a man antecedent to his aſſociating with his fellow-creatures. As a ſelf-dependent being he is ſelf-inſtructed; and as long as he ſhould remain a ſimple child of <hi>nature,</hi> he would receive from nature all the leſſons neceſſary
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:024075_0087_0FC31814A1C55AF0"/>
to his condition. He would be a complete moral agent; and ſhould he violate the rights of another independent man like himſelf, he would ſin againſt ſufficient light, to merit any puniſhment that the offended party might inflict upon him. But <hi>ſociety</hi> opens upon us a new field of contemplation; it furniſhes man with an other claſs of rights, and impoſes upon him an additional ſyſtem of duties; it enlarges the ſphere of his moral agency, and makes him a kind of artificial being, propel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and propelled by new dependencies, in which nature can no longer ſerve him as a guide. Being removed from her rudimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſchool, and entered in the college of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he is called to encounter problems which the elementary tables of his heart will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enable him to ſolve. Society then ought to be conſiſtent with herſelf in her own inſtitutions; if ſhe ſketches the lines of his duty with a variable pencil, too ſlight for his natural perception, ſhe ſhould lend him her optical glaſſes to diſcern them; if ſhe takes the ferule in one hand, ſhe is bound to uſe the feſcue with the other.</p>
            <p>We muſt obſerve farther—that though ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety itſelf be a ſtate of nature, as relative to the nation at large—though it be a ſtate to which mankind naturally recur to ſatisfy their wants and increaſe the ſum of their happineſs —though all its laws and regulations may be perfectly reaſonable, and calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:024075_0088_0FC31818D2F587E8"/>
the good of the whole—yet, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to an individual member, his having <hi>conſented</hi> to theſe laws, or even choſen to live in the ſociety, is but a <hi>fiction</hi>; and a rigid diſcipline founded on a fiction, is ſurely hard upon its object. In general it may be ſaid, that a man comes into ſociety by birth; he neither conſents nor diſſents reſpecting his relative condition; he firſt opens his eyes on that ſtate of human affairs in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his moral aſſociates are infinitely complicated; with theſe his duties are ſo blended and intermingled, that nature can give him but little aſſiſtance in finding them out. His morality itſelf muſt be arbitrary; it muſt be varied at every moment, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome local and poſitive regulation; his ſcience is to begin where that of preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages has ended; his alpha is their omega; and he is called upon to act by inſtinct what they have but learnt to do from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all mankind. Natural reaſon may teach me not to ſtrike my neighbor without a cauſe; but it will never forbid my ſending a ſack of wool from England, or printing the French conſtitution in Spain. Theſe are poſitive prohibitions, which nature has not written in her book; ſhe has therefore never taught them to her children. The ſame may be ſaid of all regulations that ariſe from the ſocial compact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:024075_0089_0FC3182417B503F8"/>It is a truth, I believe, not to be called in queſtion, that every man is born with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſcriptible claim to a portion of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which portion is termed his <hi>birth-right.</hi> Society may vary this right, as to its form, but never can deſtroy it in ſubſtance. She has no controul over the man, till he is born; and the right being born with him, and being neceſſary to his exiſtence, ſhe can no more annihilate the one than the other, though ſhe has the power of new-modeling both. But on coming into the world, he finds that the ground which nature had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him is taken up, and in the occupancy of others; ſociety has changed the form of his birth-right; the general ſtock of elements, from which the lives of men are to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, has undergone a new modification; and his portion among the reſt. He is told that he cannot claim it in its preſent form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as an independant inheritance: that he muſt draw on the ſtock of ſociety, inſtead of the ſtock of nature; that he is baniſhed from the mother; and muſt cleave to the nurſe. In this unexpected occurrence he is unprepared to act; but <hi>knowledge</hi> is a part of the ſtock of ſociety; and an indiſpenſable part to be allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the portion of the claimant, is <hi>inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> relative to the new arrangement of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right. To withold this inſtruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would be, not merely the omiſſion of a duty, but the commiſſion of a crime; and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024075_0090_0FC31825691BE148"/>
ſociety in this caſe would ſin againſt the man, before the man could ſin againſt ſociety.</p>
            <p>I ſhould hope to meet the aſſent of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced readers, in carrying this idea ſtill farther. In caſes where a perſon is born of poor parents, or finds himſelf brought into the community of men without the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, ſociety is bound in duty to furniſh him the means. She ought not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in the artificial laws by which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is ſecured, but in the artificial induſtry by which it is obtained. She is bound, in <hi>juſtice</hi> as well as policy, to give him ſome art or trade. For the reaſon of his incapacity is, that <hi>ſhe</hi> has uſurped his birth-right; and this is reſtoring it to him in another form, more convenient for both parties. The failure of ſociety in this branch of her duty, is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of much the greater part of the evils that call for criminal juriſprudence. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual feels that he is robbed of his natural right; he cannot bring his proceſs to reclaim it from the great community, by which he is overpowered; he therfore feels authorized in repriſal; in taking another's goods to replace his own. And it muſt be confeſſed, that in numberleſs inſtances the conduct of ſociety juſtifies him in this proceeding; ſhe has ſeized upon his property, and commenced the war againſt him.</p>
            <p>Some, who perceive theſe truths, ſay that it is unſafe for ſociety to publiſh them; but I
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024075_0091_0FC31826613C4918"/>
ſay it is unſafe not to publiſh them. For the party from which the miſchief is expected to ariſe, has the knowledge of them already, and has acted upon them in all ages. It is the wiſe who are ignorant of theſe things, and not the fooliſh. They are truths of nature; and in them the teachers of mankind are the only party that remains to be taught. It is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which the logic of indigence is much clearer than that of opulence. The latter reaſons from contrivance, the former from feeling; and God has not endowed us with falſe feelings, in things that ſo weightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our happineſs.</p>
            <p>None can deny that the obligation is much ſtronger on me, to ſupport my life, than to ſupport the claim that my neighbour has to his property. Nature commands the firſt, ſociety the ſecond:—in one I obey the laws of God, which are univerſal and eternal; in the other, the laws of man, which are local and temporary.</p>
            <p>It has been the folly of all old governments, to begin every thing at the wrong end, and to erect their inſtitutions on an inverſion of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. This is more ſadly the caſe in their ſyſtems of juriſprudence, than is commonly imagined. <hi>Compelling</hi> juſtice is always miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>rendering</hi> juſtice. But this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant branch of adminiſtration conſiſts not merely in compelling men to be juſt to each other, and individuals to ſociety—this is not
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024075_0092_0FC3182A453E8F50"/>
the whole, nor is the principal part, nor even the beginning, of the operation. The ſource of power is ſaid to be the ſource of juſtice; but it does not anſwer this deſcription, as long as it contents itſelf with <hi>compulſion.</hi> Juſtice muſt begin by flowing from its ſource; and the firſt as well as the moſt important object is, to open its channels from ſociety to all the individual members. This part of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration being well deviſed and diligently executed, the other parts would leſſen away by degrees to matters of inferior conſideration.</p>
            <p>It is an undoubted truth, that our duty is inſeparably connected with our happineſs. And why ſhould we deſpair of convincing every member of ſociety of a truth ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for him to know? Should any perſon object, by ſaying, that nothing like this has ever yet been done. I anſwer that nothing like this has ever yet been tried. Society has hitherto been curſt with governments, whoſe exiſtence depended on the extinction of proof. Every moral light has been ſmothered under the buſhel of perpetual impoſition; from whence it emits but faint and glimmering rays, always inſufficient to form any luminous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem on any of the civil concerns of men. But theſe covers are crumbling to the duſt, with the governments which they ſupport; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability becomes more apparent, the more it is conſidered, that ſociety is capable of curing all the evils to which it has given birth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:024075_0093_0FC3182E5470DD48"/>It ſeems that men, to diminiſh the phyſical evils that ſurround them, connect themſelves in ſociety; and from this connexion their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evils ariſe. But the <hi>immediate</hi> occaſion of the moral evils is nothing more than the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi> of the phyſical that ſtill exiſt even under the regulations that ſociety makes to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them. The direct object therefore of the government ought to be, to deſtroy as far as poſſible the remaining quantity of phyſical evils; and the moral would ſo far follow their deſtruction. But the miſtake that is always made on this ſubject is, that governments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of laying the ax at the root of the tree, aim their ſtrokes at the branches; they attack the moral evils <hi>directly</hi> by vindictive juſtice, inſtead of removing the phyſical by diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice.</p>
            <p>There are two diſtinct kinds of phyſical evils; one ariſes from want, or the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of want; the other from bodily diſeaſe. The former ſeems capable of being removed by ſociety; the latter is inevitable. But the latter gives no occaſion to moral diſorders; it being the common lot of all, we all bear our part in ſilence, without complaining of each other, or revenging ourſelves on the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As it is out of the power of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's goods to relieve us, we do not covet them for this purpoſe. The former is the only kind from which moral evils ariſe; and to this the energies of government ought to be
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024075_0094_0FC3183886901978"/>
chiefly directed; eſpecially that part which is called the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
            <p>No nation is yet ſo numerous, nor any country ſo populous, as it is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming. Europe, taken together, would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port at leaſt five times its preſent number, even on its preſent ſyſtem of cultivation; and how many times this increaſed popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be multiplied by new diſcoveries in the infinite ſcience of ſubſiſtence, no man will pretend to calculate. This of itſelf is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove, that ſociety at preſent has the means of rendering all its members happy in every reſpect, except the removal of bodily diſeaſe. The common ſtock of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity appears abundantly ſufficient for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. By common ſtock, I would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean the goods excluſively appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to individuals. Excluſive property is not only conſiſtent with good order among men, but it ſeems, and perhaps really is, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the exiſtence of ſociety. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtock of which I ſpeak, conſiſts, firſt, in <hi>knowledge,</hi> or the improvements which men have made in the means of acquiring a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and ſecondly, in the <hi>contributions</hi> which it is neceſſary ſhould be collected from indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, and applied to the maintenance of tranquility in the ſtate. The property exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively belonging to individuals, can only be the ſurpluſſage remaining in their hands, after deducting what is neceſſary to the real wants
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:024075_0095_0FC31839DC7B0BD0"/>
of ſociety. Society is the firſt proprietor; as ſhe is the original cauſe of the appropriation of wealth, and its indiſpenſable guardian in the hands of the individual.</p>
            <p>Society then is bound, in the firſt place, to diſtribute knowledge to every perſon accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wants, to enable him to be uſeful and happy; ſo far as to diſpoſe him to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intereſt in the welfare of the ſtate. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> where the faculties of the individual are naturally defective, ſo that he remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to provide for himſelf, ſhe is bound ſtill to ſupport and render him happy. It is her duty in all caſes to induce every human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by rational motives, to place his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the tranquility of the public, and in the ſecurity of individual peace and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But <hi>thirdly,</hi> in caſes where theſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall fail of their effect, ſhe is driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the laſt extremity,—ſhe is to uſe the rod of correction. Theſe inſtances would doubtleſs be rare; and, if we could ſuppoſe a long continuance of wiſe adminiſtration, ſuch as a well organized government would enſure to every nation in the world, we may alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ourſelves to believe, that the neceſſity for puniſhment would be reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p>Proceeding however on the ſuppoſition of the exiſtence of crimes, it muſt ſtill remain an object of legiſlative wiſdom. to diſcriminate between their different claſſes, and apply to each its proper remedy, in the quantity and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:024075_0096_0FC31840CA73D3B8"/>
mode of puniſhment. It is no part of my ſubject to enter into this enquiry, any farther than ſimply to obſerve, that it is the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of arbitrary governments to be jealous of their power. And, as jealouſy is, of all human paſſions, the moſt vindictive and the leaſt rational, theſe governments ſeek the revenge of injuries in the moſt abſurd and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous puniſhments that their fury can invent. As far as any rule can be diſcovered in their gradation of puniſhments, it appears to be this, That the ſeverity of the penalty is in proportion to the injuſtice of the law. The reaſon of this is ſimple,—the laws which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract nature the moſt, are the moſt likely to be violated.</p>
            <p>The publication, within the laſt half centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a great number of excellent treatiſes on the ſubject of penal laws, without producing the leaſt effect, in any part of Europe, is a proof that no reform is to be expected in the general ſyſtem of criminal juriſprudence, but from a radical change in the principle of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment<note n="*" place="bottom">The compaſſionate little treatiſe of Beccaria <hi>dei delitti e dell<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A method of communicating inſtruction to every member of ſociety, is not difficult to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024075_0097_0FC31842DA7479E8"/>
diſcover, and would not be expenſive in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The government generally eſtabliſhes miniſters of juſtice in every part of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. The firſt object of theſe miniſters ought to be, to ſee that every perſon is well inſtructed in his duties and in his rights; that he is rendered perfectly acquainted with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law, in its true ſpirit and tendency, in order that he may know the reaſon of his obedience, and the manner of obtaining redreſs, in caſe he ſhould deem it unjuſt; that he is taught to feel the cares and intereſts of an active ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, to conſider himſelf as a real member of the ſtate, know that the government is his own, that the ſociety is his friend, and that the officers of the ſtate are the ſervants of the people. A perſon poſſeſſing theſe ideas will never violate the law, unleſs it be from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and ſuch neceſſity is to be prevented by means which are equally obvious.</p>
            <p>For the purpoſes of compulſive juſtice, it is not enough that the laws be rendered famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the people; but the tribunals ought to be near at hand, eaſy of acceſs, and equally open to the poor as to the rich; the means of coming at juſtice ſhould be cheap, expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and certain; the mode of proceſs ſhould be ſimple and perfectly intelligible to the meaneſt capacity, unclouded with myſteries and unperplexed with forms. In ſhort; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould familiariſe itſelf as the well-known friend of every man; and the conſequence
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024075_0098_0FC31843DC48EBC8"/>
ſeems natural, that every man would be a friend to juſtice.</p>
            <p>After conſidering what is the duty of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and what <hi>would be</hi> the practice of a well-organized government, relative to the ſubject of this chapter, it is almoſt uſeleſs to enquire, what <hi>is</hi> the practice of all the old governments of Europe. We may be ſure beforehand, that it is directly the contrary,—that, like all other parts of the ſyſtem, it is the inverſion of every thing that is right and reaſonable. The pyramid is every where ſet on the little end, and all ſorts of extraneous rubbiſh are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought to prop it up.</p>
            <p>Unequal governments are neceſſarily found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ignorance, and they muſt be ſupported by ignorance; to deviate from their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, would be voluntary ſuicide. The firſt great object of their policy is to perpetuate that undiſturbed ignorance of the people which is the companion of poverty, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of crimes, and the pillar of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>In England the people at large are as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ignorant of the acts of parliament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are made, as they poſſibly can be before. They are printed by one man only, who is called the king's printer—in the old German character, which few men can read —and ſold at a price that few can afford to pay. But leſt ſome ſcraps of comments upon them ſhould come to the people through the medium of the public newſpapers, every ſuch paper is ſtamped with a heavy duty; and
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:024075_0099_0FC318451A43B1A0"/>
an act of parliament is made, to prevent men from lending their papers to each other <note n="*" place="bottom">As this work may chance to fall into the hands of ſome people who never ſee the acts of parliament (the ſame precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not being taken to prevent its circulation) it is out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to that claſs of readers, that I give this information. It is a duty of humanity, to ſave our fellow-creatures from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſnares, even thoſe that are ſpread for them by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Therefore: Notice is hereby given to all perſons, to whom theſe preſents ſhall come, that the penalty for letting a newſpaper, within the kingdom of Great-Britain, is fifty pounds.</note>; ſo that, not one perſon in a hundred ſees a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper once in a year. If a man at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Yorkſhire diſcovers by inſtinct that a law is made, which is intereſting for him to know, he has only to make a journey to London, find out the king's printer, pay a penny a page for the law, and learn the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alphabet. He is then prepared to ſpell out his duty.</p>
            <p>As to the general ſyſtem of the laws of the land, on which all property depends, no man in the kingdom knows them, and no man pretends to know them. They are a fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs abyſs, that exceeds all human faculties to ſound. They are ſtudied, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but to be diſputed; not to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but to breed confuſion. The man whoſe property is depending on a ſuit at law, dares not look into the gulph that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates him from the wiſhed-for deciſion; he has no confidence in himſelf, nor in reaſon, nor in juſtice; he mounts on the back of a
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024075_0100_0FC3184FB8CD2B10"/>
lawyer, like one of Mr. Burke's heroes of chivalry between the wings of griffin, and truſt the pilotage of a man, who is ſuperior to himſelf, only in the confidence which reſults from having nothing at ſtake.</p>
            <p>To penetrate into what are called the courts of juſtice, on the continent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the general ſyſtem of their adminiſtration in thoſe points which are common to moſt countries in Europe, would be to lay open an inconceivable ſcene of iniquity; it would be,
<q>
                  <l>"To pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,</l>
                  <l>Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful e'en to gods."</l>
               </q>
What are we to do with our ſenſibility, with our honeſt inſtinct of propriety—how refrain from exclamations of horror, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template a ſet of men aſſuming the ſacred garb of juſtice, for the uniform and well-known purpoſe of ſelling their deciſions to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bidder! For a judge to receive a bribe, we ſhould think an indelible ſtain upon his character as a <hi>man</hi>; but what ſhall we ſay of the ſtate of human nature, where it is no diſgrace to him as a <hi>judge?</hi> Where it is not only expected as a matter of courſe, and practiſed without diſguiſe, but is made almoſt a neceſſary part of the judiciary ſyſtem?</p>
            <p>Whether the practice of receiving bribes was the original idea on which is founded the <hi>venality of offices</hi> in modern governments, it is not to our purpoſe to enquire. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, they are concomitant ideas, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extenſive practices; and it is deſigned that
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:024075_0101_0FC31856690F42D0"/>
they ſhould be ſo. In France, before the revolution, the office of judge was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hereditary, like that of king; but it was worſe; it was held up for ſale by the king, and put at auction by the miniſter. As a part of the king's revenue aroſe from the ſale of juſtice, the government ſold all the offices in that department at fixed prices; but the miniſter made the bargains with thoſe who would give him moſt. Thus the ſeats of the judges became objects of ſpeculation, open to all the world; and the man whoſe conſcience was the beſt fitted to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable trade of deciding cauſes, could afford to give the higheſt price, and was conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure to be judge.</p>
            <p>Juſtice then was a commodity which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily gave a profit to three ſets of men, before it could be purchaſed by the ſuitor; even ſuppoſing it might have flowed to him in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect channel. But this was a thing impoſſible: there were other deſcriptions of men, more numerous, if not more greedy, than thoſe of whom we have ſpoken, through whoſe hands it muſt paſs and repaſs, before it could arrive at the client, who had paid his money to the judge. Theſe men who infeſted the tribunals in all ſtages of the buſineſs, were divided in France into about ſix claſſes. for want of the preciſe names in Engliſh to deſignate all their official deſtinctions, we ſhall rank the whole
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024075_0102_0FC318586400DF88"/>
under the great appellation of Lawyers<note n="*" place="bottom">To avoid any ſuſpicion of exaggeration, I will mention by their original names ſuch of theſe claſſes as occur to me. There were the <hi>counſeiller, avocat, procureur, ſecretaire, du judge, greſſier, huiſſier-priſeur, buiſſier-audiencier,</hi> with all their clerks, who muſt like wiſe all be paid, or the cauſe would ſtop in any ſtage of its progreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>. But though we here confound them together, as we often do objects at a diſtance; yet they were not to be ſo treated by the client. He muſt addreſs them all diſtinctly and reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the ſame <hi>argumentum ad patronum,</hi> with which he had adreſſed the judge: as one or more of each claſs had a neceſſary part in bringing forward and putting backward every cauſe that came into court.</p>
            <p>Lawyers in France ſerved two important purpoſes, which it is ſuppoſed they do not ſerve in England: they added conſiderably to the revenues of the crown by the purchaſe of their places; and they covered the iniquity of the judges under the impenetrable veil of their own. In a cauſe of ordinary conſequence, there was more writing to be done in France than there is even in England, perhaps by a hundred and fifty pages. The reaſon of this was, that it was more neceſſary to involve the queſtion in myſteries and perplexities that ſhould be abſolutely inſcrutable. For it muſt never be known, either at the time of trial or ever after, on what point or principle the cauſe was decided. To anſwer this end, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of the different orders of the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024075_0103_0FC3185C626684C0"/>
as well as encreaſing the quantity of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, had an admirable effect; it removed the poſſibility of fixing a charge of fraud or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management on any one of the great fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or of diſcovering, among the formidable piles of papers and parchments that enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped the myſteries of the trial, in what ſtage the iniquity was introduced.</p>
            <p>To call this whole ſyſtem of operations a ſolemn farce, is to give no utterance to our feelings; to ſay it is a ſplendid mockery of juſtice by which individuals are robbed of their property, is almoſt to ſpeak its praiſe.— The reflecting mind cannot reſt upon it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without glancing over ſociety, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the terrible inroads made upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals public and private, the devaſtation of principle, the outrage upon nature, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation of the laſt particle of dignity by which we recognize our own reſemblance in man.</p>
            <p>Its obvious tendency is, by its enormous expence, to bar the door of juſtice againſt the poor, who in ſuch countries are ſure to form the great body of mankind,—to render them enemies to ſociety, by teaching that ſociety is an enemy to them,—to ſtimulate them to crimes both from their own neceſſities, and from the example of their maſters,—and to ſpread over the people at large an incruſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ignorance, which excluding all ideas of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024075_0104_0FC31860C1C742E0"/>
their duties and their rights, compels them to forget their relation to the human race.</p>
            <p>Are theſe to be ranked among the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which call for a change in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Europe? Or are we to join with Mr. Burke, and lament as an evil of the French revolution, That the ancient ſyſtem "of juriſprudence will no more be ſtudied?" The whining of that good gentleman on this idea, is about as rational, as it would be to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the noble ſcience of Heraldry was in danger of being forgotten; or that men had loſt the myſtical meaning of <hi>Abracadabra.</hi> This word, ſerving as a charm, anſwered the ſame purpoſe in Medecine, as heraldry does in honor; or the old juriſprudence, in juſtice: it rendered men ſuperſtitious; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, immoral and unhappy.</p>
            <p>It is ſo faſhionable in Europe, eſpecially among Engliſhmen, to ſpeak in praiſe of the Engliſh juriſprudence, and to conſider it as a model of perfection, that it may ſeem neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a perſon to begin with an apology for offering his ideas on that ſubject, if he means to deviate from the opinion ſo generally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. But inſtead of doing this, I will begin by apologizing for thoſe who at this day ſupport the eſtabliſhed opinion: Your fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt apology, Gentlemen, is, that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing of the matter. To aſſign any other, would be leſs favourable to your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters as honeſt men.</p>

It is not enough, that the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice (which ought to be as ſimple as poſſible) is ſo involved in perplexity, that none but men of profeſſional ſkill can pretend to underſtand it, but the profeſſors are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as in France, into ſeveral diſtinct claſſes; each of which is abſolutely neceſſary to lend a helping hand in every ſtep of the progreſs of a cauſe. This dark multiplicity of form has not only removed the knowledge of law from the generality of men, but has created ſuch an expence in obtaining juſtice, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few ever make the attempt. The courts are effectually ſhut againſt the great body of the people, and juſtice as much out of their reach, as if no laws exiſted<note n="*" place="bottom">The proviſion made in the Engliſh law, enabling a perſon to bring his ſuit <hi>in forma pauperis,</hi> is rather an inſult than a real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Certainly, not one perſon in a hundred, who is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of juſtice in the ordinay courſe, would ever ſeek it in this; as in order to be entitled to it, he muſt go into court and ſwear that he has not property enough to proſecute his claim. A young tradeſman, and in general every perſon who wiſhes to carry on buſineſs, or has ſpirit enough to ſeek for juſtice, has a higher intereſt in eſtabliſhing a credit among his connexions in buſineſs, than in proſecuting any ordinary ſuit at law. He knows, that to expoſe his own poverty, eſpecially in a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial country, would be irretrievable ruin; it would be a <hi>poſitive</hi> injury; while ſetting down with the loſs of his right, without bringing his ſuit, is only a negative injury.</note>.</p>

But their number has always been ſo ſmall, that had they uttered the anathemas that the ſyſtem deſerves, their feeble voice could ſcarcely have been heard. No man, whoſe eyes are not blinded by fees or by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, can look upon the enormous maſs of writings which accumulate in a cauſe, without reflecting with indignation on the expence; one hundredth part of which would have been more than ſufficient for every purpoſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining juſtice between the parties. A writer who ſhould give the names and deſcriptions of the various parts of a proceſs, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences annexed to each part, would ſcarcely gain credit, except with profeſſional men.

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:024075_0107_0FC3186B5437E740"/>
in a cauſe, before any defence is ſet up, and where no defence is ever intended to be ſet up. The ſuitor begins his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible operation, by ſtating his claim, in what is called a <hi>Bill,</hi> which he leaves at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain office belonging to the court, and obtains an order, called a ſubpoena, for ſummoning the defendant. This being done, the court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the defendant to ſend an Attorney to write his name at another office of the court. This writing the name, is called an <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>; it anſwers no poſſible purpoſe, but that of encreaſing expences and fees of office, for which it is a powerful engine. For if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant does not comply, an expence of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of pounds may be made, to compel him. A <hi>capias,</hi> a proceſs for <hi>outlawry,</hi> a commiſſion of <hi>rebellion,</hi> and an order and commiſſion for <hi>ſequeſtration,</hi> are purſued in their proper ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, till he conſents to write his name.</p>
            <p>If the plaintiff has property to go through this proceſs, he may be ſaid to be able juſt to keep his ground; and his cauſe is in every reſpect preciſely where it was at firſt. If he has not ſufficient property, the cauſe is loſt for want of fees; and he is no better than if he had never been able to have begun the ſuit.</p>
            <p>We will however ſuppoſe that the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant very good-naturedly writes his name; he is then entitled to a certain delay, during which, the court informs him, he muſt plead
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024075_0108_0FC318782D59B5F0"/>
demur, or anſwer to the bill. When this time expires, he is entitled to a farther delay of four weeks. But though he is <hi>entitled</hi> to this farther delay, and neither the plaintiff nor the court can refuſe it; ſtill he muſt employ a ſollicitor to make a brief for counſel; and this ſollicitor muſt attend the counſel, and give him and his clerk their fees, for moving the court for this delay, which cannot be refuſed. The counſel muſt attend the court and make the motion; the ſollicitor muſt attend the court, and pay for the order, entry and copy; and then muſt cauſe it to be ſerved.</p>
            <p>At the end of this term of four weeks, the defendant is <hi>entitled</hi> to a farther delay of three weeks; which again cannot be refuſed. But he muſt pay his ſolicitor for drawing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing a petition for that purpoſe, and the petition muſt be preſented, and anſwered; for which he muſt pay; he muſt alſo pay for order, entry, copy, and ſervice. At the end of theſe three weeks he is in the ſame manner <hi>entitled</hi> to a farther delay of two weeks; but the ſame farce muſt be acted over again, to obtain it. And a very ſolemn farce is it to the parties, a very pleaſant farce to the officers of the court, and a very ridiculous farce to every body elſe.</p>
            <p>If, during all this time, the defendant had ſtopt paying, or the ſollicitor had ſtopt writing, the ſame proceſs, which was uſed to compel his appearance, muſt have been repeated: to wit, <hi>capias, outlawry,</hi> commiſſion of <hi>rebellion,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:024075_0109_0FC3187993A39A68"/>
and <hi>ſequeſtration.</hi> But we have arrived at the time when the defendant is in duty bound to anſwer to the bill; and here if he does not anſwer, then, <hi>capias, outlaway, rebellion</hi> and <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> again.</p>
            <p>Theſe terms muſt be explained to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and this is the beſt opportunity to do it. For the cauſe ſtill remaining preciſely where it was at firſt, we may ſuppoſe it ſufficiently at reſt, not to move during the explanation. A <hi>capias</hi> is an order, to take the man, and hold him in goal till he obeys the order of the court; whether it be to write his name, or any thing elſe. The word <hi>outlawry</hi> explains, of itſelf, this horrid engine of the court. A commiſſion of <hi>rebellion</hi> is an order iſſued, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the officer with the capias has ſearched and cannot find the man, and after an outlawry has taken place. It is directed to other perſons, requiring them to take up the man who was guilty of rebellion in refuſing to write his name. But as the officer with the capias, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore outlawry, could not find the man, the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the commiſſion of rebellion <hi>now,</hi> has no other meaning but <hi>ſees.</hi> A <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the whole property of the defendant into the hands of the court. And when this is done the cauſe is ſoon done alſo; for no eſtate could laſt long there. When the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is gone, the proceedings ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe that the defendant has complied with all orders thus far, and has
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:024075_0110_0FC3187B21B39040"/>
put in a good and ſufficient anſwer. Let us leave out of our account all motions, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, decrees, orders, &amp;c. for amending the bill, for referring to Maſters the inſufficiency of anſwers, reports upon thoſe anſwers, and farther anſwers, and exceptions to Maſters' reports, and orders and deciſions relative to them; and, inſtead of enquiring into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of theſe, let us go back and aſk what is the uſe of all, or of any part of this proceſs? Thirty thouſand Lawyers (this is ſaid to be the number in the kingdom) are now living on juſt ſuch ſtuff as the proceſs here deſcribed; and I call on them all, to point out the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that any of it ever ſerved, or even can ſerve, to their clients.</p>
            <p>It muſt be remembered, that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings thus far, were to end in three pretended objects—to compel an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; to obtain the <hi>uſual</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> time for the defendant to prepare his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and to compel him to give his anſwer. For the <hi>appearance,</hi> which is the ſolemn appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation given to the action of writing a name, it would be an inſult to the underſtanding of a child, to tell him that this could be of any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice towards forwarding juſtice. Next comes the ſucceſſion of applications and orders, for time to anſwer the bill. The practice of the court, which is the law in this caſe, allows the defendant, firſt a ſhort term, and then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of four weeks, three weeks, and two weeks;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024075_0111_0FC31881F90C9958"/>
which in all reckonings, unleſs it be in law, make nine weeks. And if that be a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, when divided into three parts, why is it not ſo before it is divided? And if neither the party, nor the court nor any body elſe, has a right to refuſe that term of time, why might not the defendant take it, without the expence of aſking three times? The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the proceſs goes to compel the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to give in an anſwer to the bill. And what is the importance of an anſwer? To ſolve this queſtion, let us conſider the object of the bill, to which the anſwer is required.</p>
            <p>The bill expreſſes the claim of the plaintiff, and points out the nature of the decree, which he prays may be made in his favor againſt the defendant. Notice is given to the defendant, that ſuch a ſuit is pending, and that he may appear and ſhow cauſe why the decree ſhould not be made. Having given this notice, it is not only cruel, but abſurd, to think of forcing him to defend himſelf, whether he will or no. One would ſuppoſe it little to the purpoſe, to make the attempt. Why may not the ſubpoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which gives notice to the defendant, point out the day, beyond which he cannot give an anſwer? then if he chooſes to defend, hear him candidly; but if he refuſes to come, and does not chooſe to defend,—proceed in the cauſe; he is willing that the decree ſhould paſs. Can it be reaſonable,—can it be any thing ſhort of flat contradiction and nonſenſe,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024075_0112_0FC31883E6F75780"/>
to compel him to appear, to compel him to aſk for a delay, and to compel him to defend? Can his defence be neceſſary in doing juſtice to the plaintiff? And if he will not defend himſelf can you make him? Can any one of the whole hoſt of all the profeſſions of the law, ſhow the leaſt ſhadow of uſe in all this ſlou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of proceſs thus far but <hi>fees</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> on the other?</p>
            <p>To proceed through all the forms, to the end of a ſuit in Chancery, would be to write a commentary on many volumes of practice, and would be calling the patience of the reader to a trial from which it would certainly ſhrink. But there are parts as much worſe than what we have deſcribed, as this is worſe than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. Strip from the adminiſtration of juſtice the forms that are perfectly uſeleſs and oppreſſive, and counſellors will have much leſs to do; while the whole order of attornies and ſollicitors will fail to the ground. If the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of nonſenſe were out of the way, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor who was called upon to hazard his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the manner of conducting his client's cauſe, would no more have it prepared and brought forward by an attorney, than a man of buſineſs would hazard his fortune by doing that buſineſs through an ignorant agent which he could more eaſily do himſelf. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, of writing, really neceſſary, in a ſimple and dignified ſyſtem of practice, is ſo ſmall, as
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024075_0113_0FC31887EC666CB0"/>
to be perhaps incredible to thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted only with the Engliſh proceſs.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen the mode of conducting this buſineſs in a country, where the common law of England is the general rule of deciſion, and where the adjudications of Weſtminſter-hall are authorities, as much as they are in Great Britain. But the laws of that country have ſtripped legal proceſs of its principal fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and the conſequence is, that the whole profeſſion of attornies and ſollicitors has va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The counſellor does the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his client; and ſo ſimple is the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a man may with eaſe commence, and carry through every ſtage, to final judgment and execution, five hundred cauſes in a year.</p>
            <p>And the whole proceedings in all theſe ſhall not afford writing enough to employ a ſingle clerk one hour in twenty-four. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and judgements in five hundred cauſes, in this country, would fill a warehouſe. And yet in that country, every allegation is neceſſary in their declaration and pleadings, which is neceſſary in Weſtminſter-hall. As they are not paid by the line, their declarations have but one Count, and in that Count there is no tautology. And ſo little is the expence of ſuits, where no more is done than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for juſtice; that judgement, in a cauſe where there is no defence, may be obtained
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024075_0114_0FC3188DD57C4650"/>
for leſs than ten ſhillings; and every perſon employed be fully paid for his ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">As this may awaken the curioſity of ſome of my readers, I will give the details. Suppoſe a ſuit to recover money due on Note or Bond; The writ and declaration are incorporated in one inſtrument; that is, the declaration is contained in the writ. The ſheriff is ordered to read this to the defendant, or leave a copy at his dwelling, at leaſt twelve days previous to the ſitting of the court. This writ is uſually filled up in a well known form, in a printed blank; of which a man may with eaſe fill a hundred in a day. For this the court taxes one ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſix-pence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſheriff if he has no travel to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, is paid ſix-pence for reading the writ to him, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the clerk of the court. It is then the duty of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, or of his lawyer, (who is both counſellor and ſolicitor) to attend the court on the firſt day of the ſitting; and then the parties in all cauſes are called by the cryer. For this attendance the court will tax three ſhillings and four-pence halfpenny; and if the defendant intends to make no defence he will not anſwer when called; and the clerk thereupon, on the third day after calling, if no motion is made by the defendant, enters judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the plaintiff; for which he has about two ſhillings; one ſhilling more is paid for a writ of execution, which is in form and effect a <hi>fieri facias</hi> a <hi>capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> and an <hi>elegit</hi>: that is, it goes againſt the goods and chattels of the debtor; and if the ſheriff cannot find thoſe, he is to take the body, or the land. Added to theſe coſts, there is a duty of 1s. 6d to government. Theſe ſeveral charges are an ample reward for all ſervices ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note>.</p>
            <p>Men who are habituated to the expences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in law-ſuits in England, will ſcarcely be perſuaded of the extent to which a reform would be carried, on a general deſtruction of abuſes. But let them reflect, that when law proceedings are ſtripped of every thing, but what the nature of the ſubject requires, there is no myſtery left. The rational part that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is ſoon comprehended, and eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in memory. This would doubtleſs aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024075_0115_0FC3188F7AABE1D8"/>
the number of ſuits; for it would open the courts to vaſt multitudes of people, againſt whom they are now effectually ſhut. But in proportion as it increaſed the number of law-ſuits, it would diminiſh the quantity of <hi>law-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi>; and the number of lawyers would dwindle to one tenth of what it is at preſent. in the country above alluded to, the number of men ſupported by this profeſſion is to the whole population, as one to 4600. Reduce the lawyers here to that proportion, and there would be left about three thouſand in the kingdom. It is aſſerted, (I know not on what ground) that the preſent number is thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Allowing it to be true, an army of twenty-ſeven thouſand lawyers, on this reform would find ſome other employment. But whether the reduction would amount to the number here ſuppoſed, or to half of it, is a queſtion of little moment. Saving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining twenty or thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in a uſeleſs occupation, and ſending them to profitable buſineſs, however impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant the object may appear, bears no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the advantage of opening the door of juſtice to the people, and habituating them to an eaſy and well-known method of demanding their right.</p>
            <p>There is a ſtrange idea prevalent in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (it has had its day in America) that it is good policy to raiſe the expences of legal proceedings above the reach of the lower claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024075_0116_0FC31895DB69CAB0"/>
of people; as it leſſens the number of ſuits. This kind of reaſoning appears too abſurd to ſupport its own weight for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it would be beneath our ſerious notice, were it not for the reflection, that men of ſuperficial reſearch are perpetually caught by it. the human mind is fitted, from its own indolence, to be dazzled by the glare of a propoſition; and to receive and utter for truth, what it never gives itſelf the trouble to examine. There is no paradox among all the enormities of deſpotiſm, but what finds its advocates from this very circumſtance. We muſt not therefore ſcorn to encounter an argument becauſe it is fooliſh. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of ſober philoſophy is often a taſk of drudgery; it muſt ſometimes liſten to the moſt incoherent clamours, which would be unworthy of its attention, did they not form a part of the general din, by which mankind are deafened and miſled.</p>
            <p>For a man to bring into court a ſuit that is manifeſtly unjuſt, is a crime againſt the ſtate; to hinder him from bringing one that is juſt, is a crime of the ſtate againſt him. It is a poor compliment to the wiſdom of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſuppoſe that no method can be deviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for preventing the firſt of theſe evils, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running into the laſt; and the laſt is ten times the greateſt of the two. The French, who appear to have been deſtined to give leſſons to the world by the wiſdom of their
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024075_0117_0FC31897A53CE1F8"/>
new inſtitutions, as well as by the folly of their old, have found the ſecret of impoſing a ſmall fine on a vexatious plaintiff; and of eſtabliſhing many other regulations on this ſubject, which effectually ſhut the door of the tribunal againſt the oppreſſor, while it eaſily opens to the feebleſt cry of the oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>They have likewiſe eſtabliſhed a method of communicating the knowledge of the laws to every human creature in the kingdom, however ignorant he may be in other reſpects. They are printed and paſted up on public buildings in every town and village, and read and explained by the curate from the pulpit in every pariſh. It is in contemplation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to inſtitute a general ſyſtem of public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, on a more uſeful and extenſive plan than has ever yet been deviſed. Several en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened philoſophers are buſied in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches; and ſeveral ſocieties are formed, whoſe object is to diſcover and bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the beſt concerted plan for this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant purpoſe. In their whole ſyſtem of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> they ſeem to be aiming at a degree of perfection which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes great ſucceſs. With all my partiality for the inſtitutions of the United States, I ſhould quote them (in compariſon to thoſe of France) with leſs confidence on the ſubject of this chapter, than of any other.</p>
            <p>In the adminiſtration of juſtice, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans are too much attached to the Engliſh
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024075_0118_0FC3189E75AC20A8"/>
forms; which ſerve to increaſe the expence and to myſticiſe the buſineſs, to a degree that is manifeſtly incoſiſtent with the dignity of a true republic. But in reſpect to Public Inſtruction, there are ſome circumſtances which deſerve to be mentioned to their praiſe. I am going to ſpeak only of the particular ſtate with which I am beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. How many of the others are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regulated in this reſpect, and how many are worſe, I am not accurately informed. This ſtate (which contains leſs than 240,000 inhabitants) is divided into about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred towns. Theſe are ſub-divided into ſmall portions, called ſchool-diſtricts, ſuitable for the ſupport of ſmall ſchools. Each of theſe diſtricts has a drawback on the ſtate-treaſury for a ſum, which bears a proportion to the public taxes paid by the inhabitants of the diſtrict, and which is about half equal to the ſupport of a ſchool-maſter. But this ſum can be drawn only on condition, that a ſchool is maintained in the diſtrict.</p>
            <p>The following remarkable conſequences ſeem to have reſulted from this proviſion: There is not perhaps in that ſtate, a perſon of ſix years old and of common intellects, who cannot read; and very few who cannot write and caſt accounts!—Beſides the uſeful books that are found in every family, it is computed that there are in the ſtate about three hundred public libraries, which have been formed by
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024075_0119_0FC318A0376E2F80"/>
voluntary ſubſcription among the people of the diſtricts and the pariſhes; till about the year 1768, which was more than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after the ſettlement of the ſtate, no capital puniſhment, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, had been inflicted within its juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, nor any perſon convicted of a capital offence; ſince that period, very few have been convicted, and thoſe few are generally Europeans by birth and education; there is no extreme poverty in the ſtate, and no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary wealth accumulated by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals.</p>
            <p>It would be abſurd to ſuppoſe, that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Inſtruction is by any means carried to the perfection that it ought to be, in this or any other ſtate in the univerſe. But this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment proves, that good morals and equal liberty are reciprocal cauſes and effects; and that they are both the parents of national happineſs, and of great proſperity.</p>
            <p>All governments that lay any claim to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability or juſtice have proſcribed the idea of <hi>ex-poſt-ſacto laws,</hi> or laws made after the performance of an action, conſtituting that action a crime, and puniſhing the party for a thing that was innocent at the time of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done. Such laws would be ſo flagrant a violation of natural right, that in the French and ſeveral of the American State Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are ſolemnly interdicted in their Declarations of Rights. This proſcription is
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024075_0120_0FC318A69088AE68"/>
likewiſe conſidered as a fundamental article of Engliſh liberty, and almoſt the only one that has not been habitually violated, within the preſent century. But let us reſort to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and juſtice, and aſk what is the difference between a violation of this article, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of that tremendous maxim of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, common to all the nations above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, <hi>ignorantia legis neminem excuſat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt of the laws of ſociety are poſitive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, not taught by nature. Indeed, ſuch only are applicable to the ſubject now in queſtion. For <hi>ignorantia legis</hi> can have reference only to laws ariſing out of ſociety, in which our natural feelings have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; and where a man is ignorant of ſuch a law, he is in the ſame ſituation as if the law did not exiſt. To read it to him from the tribunal, where he ſtands arraigned for the breach of it, is to him preciſely the ſame thing as it would be to originate it at the ſame time by the ſame tribunal, for the expreſs purpoſe of his condemnation. The law till then, as relative to him, is not in being. He is therefore in the ſame predicament that the ſociety in general would be, under the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an <hi>ex-poſt-facto</hi> law. Hence we ought to conclude that, as it ſeems difficult for a government to diſpenſe with the maxim above-mentioned, a free people ought, in their declaration of rights, to provide for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal public inſtruction. If they neglect to
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:024075_0121_0FC318AB8AA92810"/>
do this, and mean to avoid the abſurdity of a ſelf-deſtroying policy, by adhering to a ſyſtem of juſtice which would preſerve a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and inſpire a confidence worthy the name of liberty, they ought to reject the maxim altogether; and inſert in their declaration of rights, that inſtruction alone can conſtitute a duty; and that laws can enforce no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but where they are explained.</p>
            <p>It is truly hard and ſufficiently to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greted, that any part of ſociety ſhould be obliged to yield obedience to the laws to which they have not literally and perſonally conſented. Such is the ſtate of things; it is neceſſary that a majority ſhould govern. If it be an evil to obey a law to which we have not conſented, it is at leaſt a neceſſary evil; but to compel a compliance with orders which are unknown, is carrying injuſtice beyond the bounds of neceſſity; it is abſurd, and even impoſſible. Laws in this caſe may be avenged, but cannot be obeyed; they may inſpire terror, but can never command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
