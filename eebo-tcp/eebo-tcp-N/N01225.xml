            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The very Life of a Chriſtian muſt be a <hi>Life of Repentance.</hi> It is not enough, that a man <hi>Repent once</hi> in his Life, The Diſpoſitions of <hi>Repentance</hi> muſt <hi>Always</hi> be <hi>kept Alive,</hi> in a man, as long as he <hi>Lives.</hi> A Good man muſt over and over again <hi>Repent</hi> of his <hi>Evil-doing,</hi> and <hi>hold on Repenting</hi> all his Days.

               </hi> Never, Never to be out of it!</p>
            <p>The Firſt Thing to be now done, is, to Enquire,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which we are to keep in continual Exerciſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will briefly ſtate the Operations of that <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt; In <hi>Repentance,</hi> tis to be ſuppoſed, we are Apprehenſive, <hi>That we have Sinned;</hi> That we have been or done, that which is to be <hi>Repented</hi> of. An Apprehenſion of our <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> is neceſſary. A <hi>Repenting</hi> Sinner, is a <hi>Convinced</hi> Sinner. The Language of <hi>Repentance,</hi> is that; 2 Sam. 24.10. <hi>I have Sinned greatly in that I have done, I have done very Fooliſhly.</hi> Tis implied, That we are acquainted with the <hi>Law</hi> of our GOD; That we have an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with what the <hi>Exceeding Broad Law</hi> Enjoyns upon us. We muſt ſee the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD <hi>Violated,</hi> in what we have been, or done; A <hi>Law</hi> to be <hi>for ever Magnified and made Honourable.</hi> The Firſt Thing ſaid by a <hi>Repenting</hi> Sinner,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001462_0010_0FB34A57666F4B60"/>
is that, Luk. 15.17. <hi>I have Sinned againſt Heaven.</hi> But if we would not ſinfully <hi>Intermit</hi> our due <hi>Repentance,</hi> we muſt ſee our ſelves thus Chargeable with <hi>Sin,</hi> in <hi>all</hi> that we do; <hi>Sinful</hi> in all <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings;</hi> in all <hi>Conditions;</hi> in all <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> Defiled with <hi>Sin,</hi> in all that we meddle withal. In this our <hi>Sight</hi> of our <hi>Sin,</hi> tis not only our <hi>Actual Sin,</hi> that is to be ſet before our Eyes. Our Sight muſt penetrate as far as our <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin.</hi> This muſt be ſeen, as the <hi>Original</hi> of all our Sin. We muſt Look <hi>in,</hi> Look <hi>down,</hi> upon that <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Wickedneſs,</hi> which we have in an <hi>Heart,</hi> that is <hi>Deceitful above all things, and deſperately Wicked. 'O wretched One, that I am! What a Leper am I! What a Viper am I! What a Seed of all Sin have I Lodging in me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; Tis neceſſary to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> that we <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Think,</hi> what we have <hi>done,</hi> when we have <hi>Sinn'd.</hi> The Voice of <hi>Repentance</hi> is that; Job 33.27. <hi>I have Sinned, and Perverted that which is Right, and it Profited me not.</hi> To <hi>make Light of Sin,</hi> this is inconſiſtent with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> We don't <hi>Repent,</hi> until we
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001462_0011_0FB34A58E5384648"/>
reckon <hi>Sin,</hi> the worſt Evil in the world.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I would Chaſtiſe the moſt frequent and moſt fatal <hi>Folly</hi> in the world, I will ſomewhat Expreſſively tell you, what a man <hi>does,</hi> when he <hi>Sins.</hi> My Hearers, Attend unto me!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Sinner</hi> does Deny, Diſown, caſt off the <hi>Authority</hi> of the God that made him. He ſets up <hi>Himſelf</hi> in the Throne of his Maker. He Reproaches the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD, in His <hi>Laws;</hi> the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> Rules that GOD has given us. He Queſtions the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of GOD, and counts it better to be under his <hi>own Government,</hi> than that a <hi>Good</hi> GOD, ſhould Govern him. He throws Contempt on the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of GOD, and repreſents Him as an <hi>Unholy</hi> Approver of Sin. He defies the <hi>Power</hi> of GOD; &amp; Challenges all the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts of the All-powerful One. He deſpiſes the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of GOD; He deſpiſes the <hi>Threatenings</hi> of GOD; He believes not His <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in them. He makes a <hi>Vile Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Benefits,</hi> he has received from GOD; a Vile Uſe of the <hi>Corrections</hi> which GOD has Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon him; a Vile Uſe of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001462_0012_0FB34A5A6DD55278"/>
               <hi>Puniſhments</hi> which he hath ſeen GOD inflict upon other Offendors. He tramples on the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Bleſſed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, which hath been ſhed, that men might be <hi>Redeemed from all Iniquity.</hi> He turns a Deaf Ear upon the motions of the Holy SPIRIT, who Cries unto him, O <hi>Do not this abominable thing!</hi> The Dictates and Warnings of his own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> the Deputy of GOD, are nothing with him. The Excellent <hi>Pattern</hi> of a CHRIST, and of the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Excellent in the Earth,</hi> who have been the <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that Good One,</hi> is derided by him. He diſturbs the ſweet <hi>Harmony</hi> whereto the world is tuned, by a Great Creator and Preſerver. He Obeys the <hi>Devil,</hi> he Follows the <hi>Devil;</hi> and makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worſe than the <hi>Beaſts that Periſh.</hi> He wrongs the <hi>Faculties</hi> of his own <hi>Soul;</hi> and Expoſes himſelf to <hi>Wounds</hi> from the Wrath of GOD upon <hi>All his Intereſts.</hi> He prefers his <hi>Fleſh</hi> above his <hi>Immortal Spirit.</hi> He prefers <hi>Temporal</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Earth, before <hi>Eternal</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Heaven. He incurs the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but fearful <hi>Miſeries</hi> in the <hi>World to come;</hi> and all but for a momentany Delight in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001462_0013_0FB34A5BE57A6FC8"/>O Fearful! What? All of this <hi>Venom</hi> in every <hi>Sin!</hi> Such an Horror of <hi>Sin;</hi> Such an horrid and hideous <hi>Idaea</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> we ought always to be poſſeſſed of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; An <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of <hi>Our ſelves</hi> for <hi>our Sin;</hi> This muſt be an Ingredient of the <hi>Repentance</hi> to be always in motion with us.</p>
            <p>We muſt be greatly <hi>Griev'd,</hi> becauſe we have <hi>Sinned;</hi> Our <hi>Grief</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our <hi>Sin,</hi> muſt be incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a <hi>Mourning</hi> for Sin. <hi>Sorrow</hi> for Sin does <hi>Pierce</hi> the Heart, and <hi>Break</hi> the Heart, in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> The <hi>Repenting</hi> Soul Cries out, <hi>I am ſorry for my Sin!</hi> His Picture, I'll ſhow it you; Tis in Jer. 31.18. <hi>I have ſurely heard him be moaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,— I am aſhamed, yea, even confounded, beauſe I bear the Reproach of my Youth.</hi> His Dwelling is at <hi>Bochim.</hi> He looks on his Falls, with ſuch Eyes as <hi>Peter</hi> had; with <hi>Weeping Eyes.</hi> He <hi>Weeps Bitterly.</hi> He is Greatly <hi>Troubled;</hi> He never counts, he can be <hi>Troubled</hi> enough. He <hi>Mourns,</hi> becauſe he <hi>Mourns no more.</hi> And <hi>Sin</hi> being Loathſome to him,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001462_0014_0FB34AE72C9252F8"/>
he <hi>Loathes himſelf</hi> becauſe of it. He Cries out with him; Job 42.6. <hi>I Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor myſelf, and Repent.</hi> He Loads him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>Shame.</hi> He is <hi>Aſham'd</hi> of what he is and does. He looks upon <hi>Sin</hi> as a <hi>Shameful Folly.</hi> He calls himſelf, <hi>A Fool;</hi> and he is heartily willing, that the reſt of the world ſhould call him ſo. Hence, a <hi>Penitent Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> will proceed from him. He does with Sincerity and Ingenuity. <hi>Confeſs</hi> his Fooliſhneſs. He comes to that; Pſal. 32.5. <hi>I Acknowledge my Sin unto thee, and my Iniquity I have not hid; I ſaid, I will Confeſs my Tranſgreſſions unto the Lord.</hi> He will <hi>Confeſs</hi> unto GOD; and he is very ready to <hi>Confeſs</hi> unto <hi>Man</hi> alſo, if he be call'd unto it. Finally; He <hi>Judges</hi> himſelf; he <hi>Humbles</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He ſubmits to all the <hi>Humiliation</hi> that God ſhall order for him. He is a <hi>Self-Condemned</hi> Sinner. He joyns with the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD againſt himſelf; and he Cries out, <hi>Lord, I am worthy of all thy Judgments!</hi> If God viſit him with <hi>Plagues,</hi> he owns he has deſerved all theſe <hi>Plagues;</hi> and he ſays, <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001462_0015_0FB34AE8E7B48530"/>
I have Sinned againſt Him.</hi> Yea, and if <hi>Men</hi> treat him Contemptuouſly, he is <hi>Patient</hi> under the Contempt; he bears the Contempt with <hi>Patience;</hi> he ſees himſelf ſo Sinful, that he ſays, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt belongs to me!</hi> Calcate me! —<hi>I am Unſavoury Salt; O Trample on me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having paſs'd thro' theſe Points of <hi>Repentance,</hi> there is in it, Laſtly, A <hi>Returning</hi> to GOD in our Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. So we read; Hoſ. 6.1. <hi>Come, Let us Return unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Repenting Sinner,</hi> firſt, flies to the <hi>Pardoning Mercy</hi> of God in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Repentance</hi> is accompanied with <hi>Hope;</hi> An <hi>Hope of Pardoning Mercy;</hi> and with an <hi>Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prayer</hi> for a <hi>Pardon.</hi> An <hi>Hopeleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> is a <hi>Repentance</hi> for none but a <hi>Judas,</hi> none but a <hi>Devil.</hi> The <hi>Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Sinner, is not a <hi>Deſpairing</hi> Sinner. He is upheld with that Perſwaſion; Pſal 130.4. <hi>There is Forgiveneſs with thee, that thou moyſt be Feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, tis a Glorious CHRIST, who is his <hi>Hope.</hi> The <hi>Repenting Sinner</hi> flies to that <hi>Hope,</hi> as his only <hi>Refuge,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>The Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001462_0016_0FB34AEBE4DD5120"/>
Son of God, Cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> A <hi>Repenting</hi> Soul, is a <hi>Believing</hi> Soul. His Cry is; <hi>Lord, Let my Sin be Pardoned, becauſe a Glorious</hi> CHRIST <hi>is my Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and my Advocate. Lord. My whole Dependence is on a Glorious</hi> CHRIST, <hi>that I may find Mercy and Pardon with thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, the <hi>Repenting Sinner</hi> comes to New <hi>Reſolutions.</hi> He <hi>Reſolves</hi> with the Help of Grace, to Glorify GOD, with a New, and more Exact Obedience. Tis with him, as we read, Job 34.31, 32. <hi>I will not Offend any more; If I have done Iniquity, I will do it no more.</hi> He <hi>Forſakes</hi> every Sin. He <hi>Wiſhes, Oh! That I might not Sin any more!</hi> He <hi>Chuſes</hi> the Bleſſed GOD for <hi>his God.</hi> He <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves</hi> to Obey Him. His <hi>Deſires</hi> are; <hi>Oh! That my Life may be a Walk with God! Lord, I am Thine; I Reſolve, with thy Help, to Acknowledge thee in all my Wayes!</hi> If an <hi>Auſtin</hi> were here, he would ſay unto you, <hi>Inanis eſt Paenitentia, quam ſequens Culpa coinquinat. Repenting</hi> will be in vain, if <hi>Relapſing</hi> be not mightily watch'd againſt.</p>
            <p>THIS, This is <hi>Repentance;</hi> the <hi>Repentance</hi> to be for ever breathing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001462_0017_0FB34AED613BB890"/>
in us, as long as we have a Breath to draw in the World. The Soul of a Chriſtian ſhould be, ſtrongly Turned <hi>this Way;</hi> always Tending <hi>this Way.</hi> To be <hi>Repenting</hi> at this rate, muſt be the Daily Study and Labour of a Good Man. <hi>Eſſayes</hi> of ſuch <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> muſt be Livelily carried on, as long as we Live.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, The Second Thing to be now done, is to Enquire,</p>

               <hi>What are the <hi>Occaſions,</hi> which to keep <hi>Repentance in a Continual Ererciſe,</hi> we are to Lay Hold upon?</hi>

            <p>You will find a Fourth Occaſion for the Exerciſe of <hi>Repentance,</hi> in <hi>Every Errand that you go to Heaven upon.</hi> We can <hi>Requeſt</hi> nothing of the Holy GOD, but we may <hi>Repent</hi> of ſomething, which this thing may lead us to Think upon.

Before we <hi>Preach</hi> a <hi>Sermon,</hi> Sirs, we have ſomething to do in our <hi>Studies,</hi> And this is One Thing.

to Deliver unto our People. We ſhould on our Knees, humble our ſelves before the Lord for our own <hi>Miſcarriages,</hi> and implore the Pardon of them thro' the Blood of the only Sacrifice. In our going forth to Preach a <hi>Sermon,</hi> we ſhould alſo firſt of all, in Secret, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge before the Lord, our great <hi>Unworthineſs,</hi> to be Employ'd by Him in Holy Miniſtrations, among His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Every <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> among us, would be a <hi>Sermon,</hi> if' it were thus improved, for the promoting of our own <hi>Repentance.</hi> But then, O Communicant at the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord; Remember, Thou haſt before thee, an Ordinance which belongs to none but <hi>Repenting</hi> Souls. Do not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come, without ſome Solemn <hi>Renewal</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> every time you come.

            <p>Yea; There is a <hi>Seventh</hi> Occaſion for the Exerciſe of <hi>Repentance;</hi> and it may be called, a <hi>Seven-fold</hi> Occaſion, a <hi>Many-fold</hi> Occaſion.

            <p>Firſt; You have your <hi>Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But, what <hi>Uſe</hi> are you to make of them? You are adviſed; Rom. 2.4. <hi>The Goodneſs of God Leads thee to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Oh! Let your <hi>Enjoyments</hi> cauſe you to think; <hi>What, Oh! how much, have I been and done, to Forfeit ſuch Enjoyments! How Gloriouſly does the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace of Heaven, triumph over an Ill-deſerving Sinner, in ſuch Enjoyments!</hi> Think thus upon every one of them, as far as you can. Have <hi>Days of Thankſgiving</hi> for it. Man, Does GOD Smile upon thee? O <hi>Repent,</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001462_0028_0FB34AFF609A7B38"/>
               <hi>Wonder,</hi> becauſe thou doſt <hi>not Periſh!</hi> Every <hi>Morſel of Meat</hi> on thy Table, may be Eaten, with <hi>Wonder,</hi> that it is beſtow'd upon ſuch an <hi>Ill-deſerving Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Eat thy <hi>Morſel,</hi> with the <hi>Bitter Herbs</hi> of <hi>Repentance:</hi> It will be the <hi>Sweeter</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>And then; You have your <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> But what ſhould they drive you to? To <hi>Repentance.</hi> This is the Advice of Heaven; Job 34.31. <hi>Surely, It is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not Offend any more.</hi> Let your <hi>Afflictions</hi> cauſe you to think, <hi>What, What are the Iniquities, that have procured me thoſe Afflictions? Wherein have I rendred my ſelf worthy of ſuch Afflictions</hi>' Do thus upon every one of them. Child, Let not ſo much as a Fit of the <hi>Tooth-ake</hi> take thee, without ſome ſuch Reflections. It is a dreadful Brand upon any man; <hi>In the Time of his Diſtreſs, he Sins yet more againſt the Lord;</hi> And, <hi>He Repents not of the Sin for which God is now ſmiting of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, Let both <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> bring us down into the <hi>Duſt and Aſhes</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> before the Lord.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001462_0029_0FB34B021E45C180"/>I will go on, and make an Eighth Occaſion for the Exerciſe of <hi>Repentance.</hi> Tis, when a man is <hi>Reproved</hi> by his Neighbour; yea, I will add, And when a man is <hi>Reproached</hi> by his Neighbour. My Friend, Has a Kind and a Juſt <hi>Reproof</hi> been given to thee? Receive it with <hi>Repentance. Repent,</hi> and Reform, what is Amiſs.

But if a <hi>Reproof</hi> be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with <hi>Repentance,</hi> it will appear in this; It will be Entertained with a ſuitable <hi>Thankfulneſs.

to do with a <hi>Righteous God.</hi> You may ſay, as he, 2 Sam. 16.11. <hi>The Lord hath bidden him.</hi> Now, my Brethren, Your Buſineſs is to Search out, <hi>Why</hi> the <hi>Lord hath bidden him,</hi> and <hi>Repent</hi> of the <hi>Sin,</hi> which has provoked your Father, to Employ the <hi>Scourge</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or the <hi>Pen,</hi> upon you. Tho' the Thing ſpoken of you be a Curſed <hi>Falſhood</hi> &amp; <hi>Slander,</hi> yet you ſhall thus turn into a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> Let it ſet you a thinking, <hi>How far am I to blame, in that thing for which I am Evil ſpoken of ? However, I may be ſure, I am to blame for ſomething. What, what it is that the Glorious One ſees Blameworthy in me, for which He permits me to be buffeted with ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches?</hi> Don't Leave off, till the <hi>Lyes</hi> of Ill-minded People, awaken you to diſcover ſomething that is <hi>truly</hi> to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Dictate, and Mollify, and Lenify all that we ſay, when we vindicate our ſelves. Old <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was in the Right of it; <hi>Qui Paenitentiam agit, paratus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet eſſe ad opprobria perferenda, injuriaſque ſubeundas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will Suggeſt a Ninth Occaſion for the Exerciſe of <hi>Repentance.</hi> Tis, when we ſee the <hi>Actions of other Men.</hi> Do you ſee ary <hi>Laudable Actions,</hi> done by ther men? Bluſh, Bluſh, O Chriſtian of ſlow Pace, to think; <hi>How much do I lag behind that Excellent, Lively, Fruitful Servant of God!</hi> But you may ſee <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Actions</hi> done by other men. What is now to be done, but That? Pſal. 119.158. <hi>I beheld the Tranſgreſſor, and was grieved.</hi> We may be <hi>Grieved,</hi> becauſe <hi>Their Tranſgreſſons</hi> may mind us of <hi>Our Own.</hi> When we See or Hear a <hi>Wicked Thing</hi> done by any man, Think; <hi>Was I never my ſelf Guilty of Such a thing?</hi> If Guilty, Oh <hi>Repent</hi> over again. Be that as it is, what ever <hi>Wickedreſ</hi> we know committed in the World, it ſhould cauſe us to lay to Heart, our own Wicked, Corrupt, Vicious Nature.

Alas, I ſhould ſoon fall into that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if Left unto my ſelf.</hi> To Think ſo, is to <hi>Repent</hi> in one ſignal way of doing it.</p>
            <p>With a Tenth Occaſion for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Repentance,</hi> I will ſhut up all. Tis, <hi>in the <hi>Iudgments of God,</hi>
               </hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sinſul World. If we ſee any <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Thing</hi> befal any <hi>One Perſon,</hi> Oh!

So, when a Sad Accident befell ſome unhappy People, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our made that Application of it; Luk. 13.3. <hi>Except ye Repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> But then, in a time of <hi>General Judgments</hi> on the <hi>World,</hi> and on the <hi>place</hi> where we live; How Penitently ſhould we think; <hi>What ſhare has my Sin had, in Pulling down theſe Judgments ? What have I done, to increaſe the Heap of Wrath, which overwhelms the World? What are the Epidemical Sins, which provoke the Diſpleaſure of Heaven; and how far have I Sinfully conformed unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Obſervable, That our Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Eſaias</hi> cryes out upon himſelf, <hi>I dwell in the midſt of a people of Unclean

            <p>To demonſtrate this, I will only mention one paſſage, which I have ſome-where met withal</p>
            <p>
               <q>I would carry on the Matter, to ſo much of <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> in my apprehending <hi>Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> for <hi>Thoughts of Repentance,</hi> that the Provocations which may happen to be given unto my <hi>Bodily Senſes</hi> at any time, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Such <hi>Thoughts</hi> in my Scul. If I <hi>Smell</hi> any thing that is not Grateful, or <hi>Taſte</hi> any thing that is Bitter, My Soul ſhall fly away to ſome Thoughts on the <hi>Lothſomeneſs</hi> and <hi>Bitterneſs of <hi>Sin</hi>
                  </hi> immediately. A <hi>Freſh Abhorrence of</hi> Sin ſhall be awakened it me. If I happen to Lodge, where any <hi>Vermine,</hi> and <hi>Inſect,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults me, it ſhall Humble me. I will think ;<hi>I have been One among the Enemies of God in the World Theſe uneaſy Creatures are part of the Armies which the Lord of Hoſts Employes, and with ſome Contempt, againſt his Enemies.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From ſo Minute a Paſſage, you may take an Hint, how Surpriſingly the <hi>Excitations of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> in a Religious and Ingenious Mind, will <hi>Increaſe and Multiply!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Friends;Theſe are ſome of thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, by which a Life of Repentance is to

               </hi> of the <hi>Quaker,<hi>(he is very Proud)even, of his haughtineſs, and his Pride, and his Wrath;</hi>
