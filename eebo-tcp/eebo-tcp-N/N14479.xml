            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN a new publication appears, ſome prefatory account of the reaſons which led to it, and the manner in which it has been conducted, is generally expected.</p>
            <p>The compiler of this hiſtory was early impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his natural curioſity to enquire into the original ſettlement, progreſs, and improvement of the country which gave him birth. When he took up his reſidence in New-Hampſhire his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries were more particularly directed to that part of it. Having met with ſome valuable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts which were but little known, he began to extract and methodize the principal things in them; and this employment was (to ſpeak in the ſtyle of a celebrated modern author) his "hobby horſe."</p>
            <p>The work, crude as it was, being communicated to ſome gentlemen, to whoſe judgment he paid much deference, he was perſuaded and encouraged to go on with his collection, until the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came generally known, and a publication could not decently be refuſed.</p>
            <p>He owns himſelf particularly obliged to the public officers both in this and the neighbouring ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, under the former as well as the preſent conſtitutions, for their obliging at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in favouring him with the uſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic records or extracts from them. He is under
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018344_0004_0FA5D5E00D687308"/>
equal obligation to a number of private gentlemen, who have either admitted him to their own col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of original papers or procured ſuch for him. In the courſe of his enquiry he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had reaſon to lament the loſs of many valuable materials by fire and other accidents: But what has pained him more ſeverely is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention of ſome perſons in whoſe hands original papers have been depoſited, and who have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be waſted and deſtroyed as things of no value The very great utility of a public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory for ſuch papers under proper regulations, has appeared to him in the ſtrongeſt light, and he is perſuaded that it is an object worthy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an enlightened legiſlature.</p>
            <p>The late accurate and indefatigable Mr. PRINCE of Boſton, (under whoſe miniſtry the author was educated and whoſe memory he ſhall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere began ſuch a collection in his youth and continued it for above fifty years. By his will he left it to the care of the Old South Church, of which he was paſtor, and it was depoſited with a library of ancient books in an apartment of their meeting-houſe. To this collection, the public are obliged for ſome material hints in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent work, the author having had frequent acceſs to that library before the commencement of the late war. But the uſe which the Britiſh troops in 1775 made of that elegant building having proved fatal to this noble collection of manuſcripts; the friends of ſcience and of America muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the irretrievable loſs. Had we ſuffered it by the hands of SARACENS, the grief had been leſs poignant!</p>
            <p>Hiſtorians have mentioned the affairs of New-Hampſhire only in a looſe and general manner.
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:018344_0005_0FA5D5E32DE2A4A0"/>
Neale and Douglas, though frequently erroneous, have given ſome hints, which by the help of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal records and other manuſcripts, have in this work been carefully and largely purſued. Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon has ſaid many things which the others have omitted; his knowledge of the antiquities of the country was extenſive and accurate, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic are much obliged by the publication of his hiſtory; but he knew more than he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to relate. The few publications concerning New-Hampſhire are fugitive pieces dictated by party or intereſt. No regular hiſtorical deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ever appeared. The late Mr. FITCH of Portſmouth made a beginning of this ſort about the year 1728: From his papers ſome things have been collected which have not been met with elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The authorities from which information is derived are carefully noted in the margin. Where no written teſtimonies could be obtained, recourſe has been had to the moſt authentic tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſelected and compared with a ſcrupulous attention, and with proper allowance for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of human memory. After all, the critical reader will doubtleſs find ſome chaſms which in ſuch a work it would be improper to fill by the help of imagination and conjecture.</p>
            <p>The author makes no merit of his regard to truth. To have diſguiſed or miſrepreſented facts would have been abuſing the reader. No perſon can take more pleaſure in detecting miſtakes than the author in correcting them if he ſhould have opportunity. In tracing the progreſs of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy it is impoſſible not to take a ſide, though we are ever ſo remote from any perſonal intereſt in it: Cenſure or applauſe will naturally follow the opinion we adopt. If the reader ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018344_0006_0FA5D5E454374330"/>
to entertain different feelings from the writer, he has an equal right to indulge them; but not at the expence of candor.</p>
            <p>The Maſonian controverſy lay ſo directly in the way that it could not be avoided. The rancour ſhewn on both ſides in the early ſtages of it has now ſubſided. The preſent ſettlement is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially connected with the general peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the people, that no wiſe man or friend to the country can at this day wiſh to overthrow it.</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD, Dr. MATHER and Mr. PEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HALLOW have publiſhed narratives of the ſeveral Indian wars: Theſe have been compared with the public records, with ancient manuſcripts, with CHARLEVOIX's hiſtory of New-France, and with the verbal traditions of the immediate ſufferers or their deſcendants. The particular incidents of theſe wars may be tedious to ſtrangers, but will be read with avidity by the poſterity of thoſe whoſe misfortunes and bravery were ſo conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As the character of a people muſt be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from ſuch a minute ſeries, it would have been improper to have been leſs particular.</p>
            <p>The writer has had it in view not barely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late facts, but to delineate the characters, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the intereſts and tempers of the perſons who are the ſubjects of his narration, and to deſcribe the moſt ſtriking features of the times in which they lived. How far he has ſucceeded, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is defective, muſt be left to the judgment of <hi>every candid reader,</hi> to which this work is moſt reſpectfully ſubmitted.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>IT is happy for America that its diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſettlement by the Europeans happened at a time, when they were emerging from a long period of ignorance and darkneſs. The diſcovery of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic needle, the invention of printing, the revival of literature and the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion, had cauſed a vaſt alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their views, and taught them the true uſe of their rational and active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. To this concurrence of favourable cauſes we are indebted for the preciſion with which we are able to fix the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this great American empire: An advantage of which the hiſtorians of other countries almoſt univerſally are deſtitute; their firſt aeras being either diſguiſed by
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:018344_0010_0FA5D5E75C357F20"/>
fiction and romance, or involved in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable obſcurity.</p>
            <p>Mankind do not eaſily relinquiſh anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and eſtabliſhed prejudices, or adopt new ſyſtems of conduct, without ſome powerful attractive. The proſpect of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe wealth, from the mines of Mexico and Peru, fired the Spaniards to a rapid conqueſt of thoſe regions and the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their numerous inhabitants; but the northern continent, preſenting no ſuch glittering charms, was neglected by the European princes for more than a century after its diſcovery.<note place="margin">1496.</note> No effectual care was taken to ſecure to themſelves the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo extenſive a territory,<note place="margin">Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </note> or the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a friendly traffic with its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or of the fiſhery on its coaſts; till private adventurers at a vaſt expence, with infinite hazard and perſevering zeal, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſettlements for themſelves, and thereby enlarged the dominions of their ſovereigns.</p>
            <p>Of the voyagers who viſited the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern coaſt of America, for the ſake of its furs and fiſh, one of the moſt remarkable was Captain John Smith;<note place="margin">1614.</note> who ranged the ſhore from Penobſcot to Cape Cod, and in this route diſcovered the river Paſcataqua; which he found to be a ſafe harbour with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:018344_0011_0FA5D5E8128E03E8"/>
a rocky ſhore. He returned to England in one of his ſhips, and there publiſhed a deſcription of the country, with a map of the ſea-coaſt, which he preſented to Prince Charles,<note place="margin">Smith's Voyage.</note> who gave it the name of NEW-ENGLAND. The other ſhip he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind under the care of Thomas Hunt, who decoyed about twenty of the natives on board and ſold them for ſlaves at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga. This perfidious action excited a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent jealouſy in the natives, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enraged them againſt ſucceeding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers. Two of thoſe ſavages having found their way back as far as Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, then under the government of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain John Maſon, were reſtored to their native country by his friendly interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reported the ſtrong diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Engliſh in general enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the miſchievous plot by which they had been carried off. By this means, together with the prudent endeavours of Captain Thomas Dermer, and afterward of the Plymouth ſettlers,<note place="margin">Hubbard's printed Narrative of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, p. 3.</note> tranquillity was re-eſtabliſhed between the Indians and the adventurers, which was tolerably preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many years. However fond we may have been of accuſing the Indians of treachery and infidelity, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the example was firſt ſet them
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018344_0012_0FA5D5E8E8782B20"/>
by the Europeans. Had we always treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with that juſtice and humanity which our religion inculcates, and our true intereſt at all times required, we might have lived in as much harmony with them, as with any other people on the globe.</p>

               <note place="margin">1620.</note>The importance of the country now began to appear greater than before, and ſome meaſures were taken to promote its ſettlement. A patent had been granted by King James in 1606, limiting the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Virginia, from the thirty-fourth, to the forty-fourth degree of northern la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; which extent of territory had been divided into two parts, called North and South Virginia.

ſome of which are not yet ended.</p>
            <p>Two of the moſt active members of this council were Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Maſon. Gorges had been an officer in the navy of Queen Elizabeth,<note place="margin">Hume.</note> intimately connected with Sir Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh, of whoſe adventurous ſpirit he had a large ſhare. After the peace which King James made in 1604, he was appointed governor of the fort and iſland of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth in Devonſhire. While he reſided there, Captain Weymouth, who had been employed by Lord Arundel in ſearch of a northweſt paſſage, but had fallen ſhort of his courſe and put in at Pemaquid, brought from thence into the harbour of Plymouth, five natives of America, three of whom were eagerly ſeized by Gorges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his ſervice for three years. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of a tractable and communicative diſpoſition, and having won their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by gentle treatment, he learned from them many particulars concerning their country, its rivers, harbours, iſlands, fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries and other products; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, force, diſpoſition and government of the natives; and from this information he conceived ſanguine hopes of indulging his genius, and making his fortune, by a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018344_0015_0FA5D5ECB4AD7558"/>
diſcovery of the country. For this purpoſe he, in conjunction with others,<note place="margin">Gorges's Narrative.</note> ventured ſeveral ſhips, whereof ſome met with peculiar misfortunes; and others brought home accounts, which, though diſcouraging to ſome of his aſſociates, made him determine upon farther attempts, wherein his reſolution and perſeverance were more conſpicuous than any ſolid gain. Theſe tranſactions were previous to the eſtabliſhment of the council; in ſoliciting which, Gorges was ſo extremely active, that he was appointed their preſident, and had a principal ſhare in all their tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Maſon was a merchant of London, but became a ſea-officer, and, after the peace, governor of Newfoundland, where he acquired a knowledge of America, which led him, on his return to England, into a cloſe attachment to thoſe who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in its diſcovery; and upon ſome vacancy in the council, he was elected a member and became their ſecretary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo governor of Portſmouth in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.<note place="margin">1621.</note> He procured a grant from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of all the land from the river Naum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keag, [now Salem] round Cape Anne,<note place="margin">March <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018344_0016_0FA5D5EE26D82338"/>
to the head of the other; with all the iſlands lying within three miles of the coaſt. This diſtrict was called MARIANA. The next year another grant was made,<note place="margin">1622.</note> to Gorges and Maſon jointly, of all the lands between the rivers Merrimack and Sagadehock,<note place="margin">Aug. 10.</note> extending back to the great lakes and river of Canada, and this was called LACONIA.</p>
            <p>Under the authority of this grant, Gorges and Maſon, in conjunction with ſeveral merchants of London, Briſtol, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter, Plymouth, Shrewſbury and Dorche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who ſtyled themſelves "The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Laconia,"
attempted the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a colony and fiſhery at the river Paſcataqua; and in the ſpring of the following year ſent over David Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">1623.</note> a Scotſman, Edward and William Hilton, fiſhmongers of London, with a number of other people, in two diviſions, furniſhed with all neceſſaries to carry on their deſign. One of theſe companies landed on the ſouthern ſhore of the river, at its mouth, and called the place Little-Harbour: Here they erected ſalt-works, and built an houſe which was afterward called Maſon-Hall; but the Hiltons ſet up their ſtages eight miles further up the river toward the northweſt, on a neck of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018344_0017_0FA5D5EEDD5137F0"/>
land which the Indians called Winnicha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannat, but they named Northam,<note place="margin">Hubbard's MS.</note> and afterward Dover. Thompſon, not being pleaſed with his ſituation,<note place="margin">1624.</note> removed the next ſpring to an iſland in the Bay of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts;<note place="margin">Prince's Annals.</note> this the General Court after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confirmed to him and ſtill bears his name.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſettlements went on but ſlowly for ſeveral years, but the natives being peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſeveral other ſmall beginnings being made along the coaſt as far as Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, a neighbourly intercourſe was kept up among them, each following their reſpective employments of fiſhing, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and planting, till the diſorderly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of one Morton, at Mount Wollaſton in the Bay of Maſſachuſetts, cauſed an alarm among the ſcattered ſettlements as far as Paſcataqua. This man had,<note place="margin">1628.</note> in defiance of the king's proclamation, made a practice of ſelling arms and ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Indians, whom he employed in hunting and fowling for him; ſo that the Engliſh, ſeeing the Indians armed in the woods, began to be in terror. They alſo apprehended danger of another kind; for Morton's plantation was a receptacle for diſcontented ſervants, whoſe deſertion weakened the ſettlements, and who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

there without law, were more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than the ſavages themſelves. The principal perſons of Paſcataqua there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore readily united with their neighbours, in making application to the colony of Plymouth,<note place="margin">Prince's Annals.</note> which was of more force than all the reſt, to put a ſtop to this growing miſchief; which they happily effected by ſeizing Morton and ſending him priſoner to England.</p>

Bread was either brought from England in meal,<note place="margin">Prince's Annals, vol. 2 p. 30 70.</note> or from Virginia in grain, and then ſent to the wind-mill at Boſton, there being none erected here. Very little improvement was made on the lands; the lakes were not explored; the vines were planted but came to nothing; no mines were found but thoſe of iron, and theſe were not wrought; three of four houſes only were built within the firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years; the peltry trade with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians was of ſome value, and the fiſhery ſerved for the ſupport of the inhabitants; but yielded no great profit to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, who received but inadequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in lumber and furs.

They were both heartily engaged in the ſettlement of the country; they ſunk their eſtates in the undertaking, and reaped no profit to themſelves; yet their enterprizing ſpirit excited emulation in others, who had the advantage of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their plans and avoiding their miſtakes. Gorges accounted for the ill ſucceſs of his adventures in the following manner.<note place="margin">Gorges's Narrative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p 49.</note> 1. He began when there was no hope of any thing for the preſent but loſs; as he had firſt to ſeek a place; which, being found, was a wilderneſs; and ſo gloomy was the proſpect, that he could ſcarce procure any to go, much leſs to reſide in it; and thoſe whom he at length ſent, could not ſubſiſt but on the proviſions with which he ſupplied them. 2. He ſought not barely his own profit,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018344_0038_0FA5D605847F2F20"/>
but the thorough diſcovery of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; wherein he went ſo far (with the help of his aſſociates) as to open the way for others to make their gain. 3. He never went in perſon to overſee the people whom he employed. 4. There was no ſettled government to puniſh offenders, or miſpenders of their maſters goods. Two other things contributed to the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in as great, if not a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than what he has aſſigned. The one was that inſtead of applying themſelves chiefly to huſbandry, the original ſource of wealth and independence in ſuch a country as this; he and his aſſociates, being merchants, were rather intent on trade and fiſhery as their primary objects. Theſe can not be profitable in a new country, until the foundation is laid in the cultivation of the lands. If the lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trade and fiſhery can not now be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to advantage, without the conſtant aid of huſbandry in their neighbourhood, how could a colony of traders and fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men make profitable returns to their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers, when the huſbandry neceſſary for their ſupport was at the diſtance of Virginia or England? The other miſtake which theſe adventurers fell into was the idea of lordſhip, and the granting of lands
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018344_0039_0FA5D60644CDB4B0"/>
not as freeholds, but by leaſes ſubject to quit-rents. To ſettle a colony of tenants in a climate ſo far northward, where the charges of ſubſiſtence and improvement were much greater than the value of the lands, after the improvements were made; eſpecially in the neighbourhood of ſo reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable and growing a colony as that of Maſſachuſetts, was indeed a chimerical project; and had not the wiſer people among them ſought an union with the Maſſachuſetts, in all probability the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements muſt have been deſerted.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>WHILE the lower plantation on the river Paſcataqua lay under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by the death of its principal patron, the upper ſettlement, though car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with more ſucceſs, had peculiar difficulties to ſtruggle with. Two thirds of this patent belonged to ſome merchants of Briſtol, the other third to ſome of Shrewſbury; and there was an agreement that the diviſion ſhould be made by indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men. Captain Wiggen who was ſent over to ſuperintend their affairs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about one year's reſidence in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try made a voyage to England, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure more ample means for carrying on the plantation. In the mean time thoſe of Briſtol had ſold their intereſt to the lords Say and Broke, George Willys and William Whiting, who continued Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen in the agency, and procured a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of families in the Weſt of England, ſome of whom were of good

                  </gap> Dover Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</note>
to come over and increaſe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. It appears from ancient records that Wiggen had a power of granting lands to the ſettlers; but, as trade was their principal object, they took up ſmall lots, intending to build a compact town on Dover Neck, which lies between two branches of the river, and is a fine, dry, and healthy ſituation; ſo high as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the neighbouring ſhores, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a very extenſive and delightful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. On the moſt inviting part of this eminence they built a meeting-houſe, which was afterward ſurrounded with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment and flankarts, the remains of which are ſtill viſible. Wiggen alſo brought over William Leverich, a worthy and able puritan miniſter; but his allowance from the adventurers proving too ſmall for his ſupport in a new country, where all the neceſſaries of life were ſcarce and dear, he was obliged to remove to the ſouthward; and ſettled at Sandwich in the colony of Plymouth. This proved an unhappy event to the people, who, being left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of regular inſtruction, were expoſed to the intruſions of artful impoſtors.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe was one Burdet.<note place="margin">1634.</note> He had been a miniſter at Yarmouth in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;<note place="margin">Hubbard's MS Hiſt.</note> but either really or pretendedly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

offence at the extravagancies of the biſhops and ſpiritual courts, came over to New-England, and joined with the church in Salem, who employed him for a year or two as a preacher, being a good ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and plauſible in his behaviour. But, diſguſted with the ſtrictneſs of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,<note place="margin">1636.</note> he removed to Dover; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time in good eſteem with the people as a preacher; until by artful inſinuations he raiſed ſuch a jealouſy in their minds againſt Wiggen their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that they deprived him of his office, and elected Burdet in his place.</p>
            <p>During his reſidence here, he carried on a correſpondence with Archbiſhop Laud to the diſadvantage of the Maſſachuſetts colony,<note place="margin">1637.</note> repreſenting them as hypocritical and diſaffected, and that under pretence of greater purity and diſcipline in matters of religion, they were aiming at indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſovereignty; it being accounted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and treaſon by their general court, to ſpeak of appeals to the king. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thanked him for his zeal in the king's ſervice,<note place="margin">1638.</note> and aſſured him that care ſhould be taken to redreſs thoſe diſorders when leiſure from their other concerns would permit. This letter of the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop was intercepted, and ſhewn to the governor of Maſſachuſetts. Burdet's vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018344_0043_0FA5D60C6D05FC58"/>
was conſidered as the more atrocious, becauſe he had been admitted a freeman of their corporation, and had taken the oath of fidelity. A copy of his own letter was afterward found in his cloſet.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Antinomian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy at Boſton having occaſioned the baniſhment of the principal perſons of that ſect, ſeveral of them retired to this ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being without the juriſdiction of Maſſachuſetts. When this was known, Governor Winthrop wrote to Wiggen, Burdet and others of this plantation, <q>that as there had hitherto been a good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between them it would be much reſented if they ſhould receive the exiles; and intimating the intention of the general court to ſurvey the utmoſt limits of their patent, and make uſe of them.</q>
To this Burdet returned a ſcornful anſwer, refuſing to give the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor his title. The governor thought of citing him to court to anſwer for his contempt; but was diſſuaded from it by Dudley, the deputy-governor, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it imprudent to exaſperate him, leſt he ſhould avenge himſelf by farther accuſing them to their enemies in England. The governor contented himſelf with ſending to Hilton an account of Burdet's behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018344_0044_0FA5D60CD8200A68"/>
incloſing a copy of his letter, and cautioning the people not to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too far under his power. His true character did not long remain ſecret; for being detected in ſome lewd actions he made a precipitate removal to Agamenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus [now York] in the province of Maine, where he alſo aſſumed to rule, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a courſe of injuſtice and adultery till the arrival of Thomas Gorges, their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, [in 1640] who laid a fine on him, and ſeized his cattle for the payment of it<note n="*" place="bottom">The records of the court mention him as "a man of ill name and fame, infamous for incontinency."

He appealed to the king, but his appeal not being admitted, he departed for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land full of enmity againſt theſe plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

The principal inducement to the making this ſettlement was the very extenſive ſalt-marſh, which was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable, as the uplands were not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated ſo as to produce a ſufficiency of hay for the ſupport of cattle. With a view to ſecure theſe meadows, the general court of Maſſachuſetts had [in 1636] em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered Mr. Dummer of Newbury, with John Spencer, to build an houſe there at the expence of the colony,<note place="margin">Maſſa.

there ſold them for twenty-five pounds ſterling per head, which it is ſaid was the current price of the beſt cattle in New-England at that time. Theſe were of a large breed, imported from Denmark, from whence Maſon had alſo procured a number of men ſkilled in ſawing planks and making potaſhes. Having ſhared the ſtock and other materials, ſome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quitted the plantation; others of them tarried, keeping poſſeſſion of the buildings and improvements, which they claimed as their own; the houſes at Newichwan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock were burned; and thus Maſon's eſtate was ruined.

an high degree of enthuſiaſm, he made a capital figure in the controverſy; being one of the ſubſcribers to a petition in which the court was cenſured, with an indecent ſeverity, for their proceedings againſt Whelewright. For this offence he was disfranchiſed. He then made a voyage to England;<note place="margin">Nov. 15th, 1637.</note> and upon his return petitioned the court for three hundred acres of land which had been promiſed him for his former ſervices, intending to remove after Whele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright. In his petition he acknowledged his offence in condemning the court, and declared <q>that the Lord had brought him to a ſenſe of his ſin in that reſpect, ſo that he had been in great trouble on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof.</q>
On this occaſion the court thought proper to queſtion him concerning an offenſive expreſſion, which he had uttered on board the ſhip in which he came from England, <q>that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at Boſton were as zealous as the ſcribes and Phariſees, and as Paul before his converſion.</q>
He denied the charge, and it was proved to his face by a woman who was paſſenger with him, and whom he had endeavoured to ſeduce to his opinions. He wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

aſſurance, which was, <q>that having long lain under a ſpirit of bondage, he could get no aſſurance; till at length as he was taking a pipe of tobacco, the ſpirit ſet home upon him an abſolute promiſe of free grace, with ſuch aſſurance and joy that he had never ſince doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his good eſtate, neither ſhould he, whatever ſins he might fall into.</q>
This he would neither own nor deny; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the ſufficiency of a ſingle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. The court committed him for abuſing them with a pretended retraction, and the next day paſſed the ſentence of baniſhment upon him. Being allowed the liberty of attending public worſhip, his enthuſiaſtic zeal brake out in a ſpeech in which he endeavoured to prove <q>that as the Lord was pleaſed to convert Saul while he was perſecuting, ſo he might manifeſt himſelf to him while making a moderate uſe of the good creature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco; profeſſing withal that he knew not wherein he had deſerved the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the court.</q>
The elders reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for this inconſiderate ſpeech; and Mr. Cotton told him, <q>that though God often laid a man under a ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage while walking in ſin, as was the caſe with Paul, yet he never ſent a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            <p>Theſe proceedings, civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, being finiſhed, he removed out of their juriſdiction; and after a while came to Dover, where he procured the place of governor in the room of Burdet. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Winthrop hearing of this, wrote to Hilton and others of this plantation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them of his character. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill intercepted the letter, and returned a bitter anſwer to Mr. Cotton; and wrote another letter full of reproaches againſt the governor to a gentleman of his family, while he addreſſed the governor himſelf in a fawning obſequious ſtrain, begging an obliteration of former miſcarriages, and a bearing with human infirmities.

               <note place="margin">1639.</note>Being ſettled in his government, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a church to be gathered at Dover who choſe Hanſerd Knollys for their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. He had come over from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the year before; but being an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt of the Antinomian caſt, was not well received in Maſſachuſetts, and came here while Burdet was in office, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his preaching; but Underhill, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better with him, prevailed to have him choſen their miniſter. To ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his new patron, Knollys wrote in his favour to the church in Boſton; ſtyling him "The right worſhipful their honoured governor." Notwithſtanding which they cited him again to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; the court granting him ſafe conduct. At the ſame time complaint was made to the chief inhabitants on the river, of the breach of friendſhip in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Underhill after his rejection; and a copy of Knollys's letter was returned, wherein he had written that <q>Underhill was an inſtrument of God for their ruin,</q>
and it was enquired whether that letter was written by the deſire or conſent of the people. The principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Portſmouth and Dover diſclaimed his miſcarriages, and expreſſed their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to call him to account when a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

information ſhould be preſented; but begged that no force might be ſent againſt him. By his inſtigation Knollys had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo written to his friends in England, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious letter againſt the Maſſachuſetts planters, repreſenting them as more arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary than the high-commiſſion court, and that there was no real religion in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A copy of this letter being ſent from England to Governor Winthrop, Knollys was ſo aſhamed at the diſcovery, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a licence, he went to Boſton; and at the public lecture before the governor, magiſtrates, miniſters and the congregation, made confeſſion of his fault, and wrote a retraction to his friends in England, which he left with the governor to be ſent to them.</p>
            <p>Underhill was ſo affected with his friend's humiliation, and the diſaffection of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Piſcataqua to him, that he reſolved to retrieve his character in the ſame way. Having obtained ſafe conduct, he went to Boſton, and in the ſame public manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his adultery, his diſreſpect to the government and the juſtice of their proceedings againſt him: But his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was mixed with ſo many excuſes and extenuations that it gave no ſatisfaction; and the evidence of his ſcandalous deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018344_0054_0FA5D6177B20A090"/>
being now undeniable, the church paſſed the ſentence of excommunication, to which he ſeemed to ſubmit, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much dejected while he remained there.</p>
            <p>Upon his return, to pleaſe ſome diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons at the mouth of the river, he ſent thirteen armed men to Exeter to reſcue out of the officer's hand one Fiſh, who had been taken into cuſtody for ſpeaking againſt the king. The people of Dover forbad his coming into their court till they had conſidered his crimes and he promiſed to reſign his place if they ſhould diſapprove his conduct; but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were determined to remove him, he ruſhed into court in a paſſion, took his ſeat, ordered one of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to priſon for ſaying that he would not ſit with an adulterer, and refuſed to receive his diſmiſſion, when they voted it. But they proceeded to chuſe another go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, Roberts, and ſent back the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Exeter.</p>
            <p>A new ſcene of difficulty now aroſe. Thomas Larkham,<note place="margin">1640.</note> a native of Lyme in Dorſetſhire and formerly a miniſter at Northam near Barnſtable, who had come over to New-England, and not favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine, nor willing to ſubmit to the diſcipline of the churches in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018344_0055_0FA5D61810723098"/>
came to Dover; and being a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of good talents, eclipſed Knollys, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a party who determined to remove him. He therefore gave way to the popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and ſuffered Larkham to take his place; who ſoon diſcovered his licentious principles by receiving into the church perſons of immoral characters, and aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like Burdet, the civil as well as ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical authority. The better ſort of the people were diſpleaſed and reſtored Knollys to his office who excommunicated Larkham. This bred a riot in which Lark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham laid hands on Knollys, taking away his hat on pretence that he had not paid for it; but he was civil enough afterward to return it. Some of the magiſtrates joined with Larkham, and forming a court, ſummoned Underhill, who was of Knollys's party to appear before them, and anſwer to a new crime which they had to alledge againſt him. Underhill collected his adherents; Knollys was armed with a piſtol, and another had a bible mounted on an halbert for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. In this ridiculous parade they marched againſt Larkham and his party, who prudently declined a combat, and ſent down the river to Williams the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, at Portſmouth, for aſſiſtance.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018344_0056_0FA5D618DCFB6348"/>
He came up in a boat with an armed party, beſet Knollys's houſe where Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill was, guarded it night and day till a court was ſummoned, and then, Williams ſitting as judge, Underhill and his company were found guilty of a riot, and after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fined, were baniſhed the plantation. The new crime which Larkham's party alledged againſt Underhill was that he had been ſecretly endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the inhabitants to offer themſelves to the government of Maſſachuſetts, whoſe favor he was deſirous to purchaſe, by theſe means, as he knew that their view was to extend their juriſdiction as far as they imagined their limits reached, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould find a favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The ſame policy led him with his party to ſend a petition to Boſton, praying for the interpoſition of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their caſe: In conſequence of which the governor and aſſiſtants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned Simon Bradſtreet, Eſq. with the famous Hugh Peters, then miniſter of Salem, and Timothy Dalton of Hampton, to enquire into the matter, and effect a reconciliation, or certify the ſtate of things to them. Theſe gentlemen travelled on foot to Dover, and finding both ſides in fault, brought the matter to this iſſue,

that the one party revoked the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and the other the fines and baniſhment.</p>
            <p>In the heat of theſe diſputes, a diſcovery was made of Knollys's failure in point of chaſtity.

            <p>AN union having been formed between the ſettlements on Paſcataqua and the colony of Maſſachuſetts, their hiſtory for the ſucceeding forty years is in a great meaſure the ſame. It is not my intention to write the tranſactions of the whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony during that period; but, as many of the people in New-Hampſhire had the ſame principles, views and intereſts with the other people of New-England, I ſhall make ſome obſervations thereon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſe ſuch hiſtorical facts as may illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſubject.</p>
            <p>In the preceding century the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which had long lain hid in the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of monaſtic libraries, were brought to public view by the happy invention of printing; and as darkneſs vaniſhes before the riſing ſun, ſo the light of divine truth
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018344_0069_0FA5D624DB8EDEE0"/>
began to diſſipate thoſe errors and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions in which Europe had long been involved. At the ſame time a remarkable concurrence of circumſtances gave peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar advantage to the bold attempt of Luther, to rouſe Germany from her inglorious ſubjection to the Roman Pontiff, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate a reformation, which ſoon ſpread into the neighbouring countries. But ſo intimately were the political intereſts of kingdoms and ſtates blended with religious prejudices, that the work, though happily begun, was greatly blemiſhed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded.</p>
            <p>Henry the VIIIth of England took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this amazing revolution in the minds of men, to throw off the papal yoke, and aſſert his native claim to independence. But ſo dazzling was the idea of power, and the example of the firſt chriſtian princes, who had exerciſed a ſuperintendency in ſpirituals, as well as temporals, that he transferred to himſelf that ſpiritual power which had been uſurped and exerciſed by the biſhops of Rome, and ſat up himſelf as ſupreme head on earth of the church of England; commanding both clergy and laity in his dominions to ſwear allegiance to him in this newly aſſumed character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:018344_0070_0FA5D625A88B7C70"/>This claim was kept up by his ſon and ſucceſſor Edward the Sixth, in whoſe reign the reformation gained much ground; and a ſervice-book was publiſhed by royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the ſtandard of worſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline for his ſubjects. This excellent prince was taken out of the world in his youth; and his ſiſter Mary, who then came to the throne, reſtored the ſupremacy to the pope, and raiſed ſuch fiery perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the reformers, that many of them fled into Germany and the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; where they departed from that uniformity which had been eſtabliſhed in England, and became divided in their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and practice reſpecting eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs: the native effect of that juſt liberty of conſcience which they enjoyed abroad, purſuing their own enquiries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reſpective meaſures of light; uninfluenced by ſecular power, or the hope of acquiring dignities in a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>The acceſſion of Elizabeth inſpired them with new hopes; and they returned home, reſolving to attempt the reformation of the church of England, agreeably to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective opinions which they had embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their exile. But they ſoon found that the queen, who had been educated in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018344_0071_0FA5D62654D81AF8"/>
the ſame manner with her brother Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was fond of the eſtabliſhment made in his reign, and was ſtrongly prejudiced in favor of pomp and ceremony in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip. She aſſerted her ſupremacy in the moſt abſolute terms, and erected an high-commiſſion court with juriſdiction in eccleſiaſtical affairs. Uniformity being rigorouſly enjoined and no abatement or allowance made for tender conſciences (though it was conceded that the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were indifferent) a ſeparation from the eſtabliſhment took place. Thoſe who were deſirous of a farther reformation from the Romiſh ſuperſtitions, and of a more pure and perfect form of religion were deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>Puritans;</hi> whoſe principles, as diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers who were in favor with the queen, are thus repreſented.</p>
            <p>"The queen and court-reformers held, 1. That every prince had the ſole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to correct all abuſes of doctrine and worſhip within his own territories.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> 2. That the church of Rome was a true church though corrupt in ſome points of doctrine and government; that all her miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were valid, and that the pope was a true biſhop of Rome though not of the univerſal church. 3. That the ſcriptures
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018344_0072_0FA5D62744F08E90"/>
were a perfect rule of faith, but not a ſtandard of diſcipline; and that it was left to the diſcretion of the chriſtian magiſtrate, to accommodate the government of the church to the policy of the ſtate. 4. That the practice of the primitive church for the firſt four or five centuries was a proper ſtandard of church government and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and in ſome reſpects better than that of the apoſtles, which was only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the infant ſtate of the church, while it was under perſecution; whereas the other was ſuited to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of a national eſtabliſhment. 5. That things indifferent in their own nature as rites, ceremonies, and habits, might be ſettled, determined and made neceſſary by the command of the civil magiſtrate, and that in ſuch caſes it was the duty of the ſubject to obſerve them."</p>
            <p>"On the other hand, the puritans, 1. Diſowned all foreign juriſdiction over the church, but could not admit of that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power which the crown claimed by the ſupremacy. However, they took the oath, with the queen's explication, as only reſtoring her majeſty to the ancient and natural rights of ſovereign princes over their ſubjects. 2. They held the pope to be antichriſt, the church of Rome a falſe
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018344_0073_0FA5D628D2076EC8"/>
church, and all her miniſtrations ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and idolatrous. 3. That the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were a ſtandard of diſcipline as well as doctrine, and if there was need of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power, it was veſted not in the magiſtrate but in the officers of the church. 4. That the form of government ordained by the apoſtles was ariſtocratical, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a pattern to the church in after ages, not to be departed from in its main principles. 5. That thoſe things which Chriſt hath left indifferent ought not to be made neceſſary; and that ſuch rites and ceremonies as had been abuſed to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and ſuperſtition, and had a manifeſt tendency to lead men back thereto, were no longer indifferent but unlawful."</p>
            <p>"Both parties agreed too well in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of uniformity in public worſhip, and of uſing the ſword of the magiſtrate for the ſupport and defence of their reſpective principles; which they made an ill uſe of in their turns, whenever they could graſp it in their hands. The ſtandard of uniformity according to the biſhops, was the queen's ſupremacy and the laws of the land; according to the puritans, the decrees of national and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial ſynods, allowed and enforced by the civil magiſtrate. Neither party were
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018344_0074_0FA5D62957CE44D0"/>
for admitting that liberty of conſcience and freedom of profeſſion which is every man's right, ſo far as is conſiſtent with the peace of civil government. Upon this fatal rock of <hi>uniformity,</hi> was the peace of the church of England ſplit."</p>
            <p>It is melancholy to obſerve what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs were cauſed by the want of a juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between civil and eccleſiaſtical power, and by that abſurd zeal for uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which kept the nation in a long fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at length burſt out into a blaze, the fury of which was never thoroughly quelled till the happy genius of the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gave birth to a free and equitable <hi>tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereby every man was reſtored to the natural right of judging and acting for himſelf in matters of religion. All the celebrated wiſdom of Elizabeth's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not deviſe an expedient ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. Though her reign was long and proſperous, yet it was much ſtained with oppreſſion and cruelty toward many of her beſt ſubjects; who, wearied with ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual applications, waited the acceſſion of James, from whom they expected more favour, becauſe he had been educated in the preſbyterian church of Scotland, and profeſſed an high veneration for that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. But they ſoon found that he
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018344_0075_0FA5D62C45E3B890"/>
had changed his religious principles with his climate, and that nothing was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a prince of ſo baſe a character, but inſult and contempt.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of his reign a great number of the puritans removed into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where they formed churches upon their own principles. But not reliſhing the manners of the Dutch, after twelve years they projected a removal to America, and laid the foundation of the colony of Plymouth. The ſpirit of uniformity ſtill prevailing in England, and being carried to the greateſt extent in the reign of Charles the Firſt by that furious bigot Archbiſhop Laud; many of the leſs ſcrupulous, but conſcientious members of the church of England, who had hitherto remained in her communion, ſeeing no proſpect of reſt or liberty in their native country, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their brethren to America, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the colony of Maſſachuſetts, from which proceeded that of Connecticut.</p>
            <p>By ſuch men, influenced by ſuch motives, were the principal ſettlements in New-England effected. The fortitude and perſeverance which they exhibited therein will always render their memory dear to their poſterity. To prepare for their enterprize, they had to ſell their
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018344_0076_0FA5D62C67AA53D0"/>
eſtates, ſome of which were large and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and turn them into materials for a new plantation, with the nature of which they had no acquaintance, and of which they could derive no knowledge from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of others. After traverſing a wide ocean they found themſelves in a country full of woods, to ſubdue which required immenſe labour and patience; at a vaſt diſtance from any civilized people; in the neighbourhood of none but ignorant and barbarous ſavages; and in a climate, where a winter much more ſevere than they had been accuſtomed to, reigns for a third part of the year. Their ſtock of proviſions falling ſhort, they had the dreadful apprehenſion of periſhing by famine, one half of their number dying before the firſt year was completed; the ocean on one ſide ſeparated them from their friends, and the wilderneſs on the other, preſented nothing but ſcenes of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which it was impoſſible for them to conceive of before they endured them.</p>
            <p>But under all theſe difficulties, they maintained a ſteady and pious reſolution; depending on the providence of the ſupreme ruler, and never repenting the buſineſs on which they had come into this wilderneſs. As purity in divine adminiſtrations was the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018344_0077_0FA5D62DCD82D108"/>
profeſſed object of their undertaking, ſo they immediately ſet themſelves to form churches, on what they judged the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel plan. To be out of the reach of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latic tyranny, and at full liberty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their own enquiries, and worſhip God according to their conſciences, (which had been denied them in their own country) was eſteemed the greateſt of bleſſings, and ſweetened every bitter cup which they were obliged to drink. They always profeſſed that their principal deſign was to erect churches on the primitive model, and that the conſideration of temporal intereſt and conveniency had but the ſecond place in their views.<note n="*" place="bottom">

receive it, as ever you were to receive any truth by my miniſtry; for I am verily perſuaded, I am very confident, the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his holy word. For my part, I cannot ſufficiently bewail the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and will go at preſent no farther than the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their reformation. The Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther ſaw; whatever part of his will our good God has revealed to Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, they will rather die than embrace it. And the Calviniſts you ſee ſtick faſt where they were left by that great man of God, who yet ſaw not all things. This is a miſery much to be lamented; for though they were burning and ſhining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole counſel of God; but were they now living, would be as willing to embrace farther light, as that which they at firſt received.

            <p>Many of the firſt planters of New-England were perſons of good education, and ſome of them eminent for their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and learning. Such men could not but ſee the neceſſity of ſecuring to their poſterity the advantages which they had ſo dearly purchaſed. One of their firſt concerns was to have their children conſidered, from their earlieſt years, as ſubjects of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline. This became a matter of controverſy, and was largely diſcuſſed in ſermons and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and at length determined by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a ſynod. A regular courſe of academical learning was a point of equal importance, and admitted of no diſpute. They ſaw that the reputation and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

of the whole country depended great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it. They therefore took early care for the eſtabliſhment of ſchools, and within ten years from their firſt ſettlement, founded a college at Cambridge<note n="*" place="bottom">

rebellion againſt parents, and conſpiracy againſt the commonwealth were made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crimes; and becauſe ſome doubted whether the magiſtrate could puniſh breaches of the four firſt commands of the decalogue, this right was aſſerted in the higheſt tone, and the denial of it ranked among the moſt peſtilent hereſies, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with baniſhment. By the ſeverity and impartiality with which thoſe laws were executed, intemperance and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were ſo effectually diſcountenanced that Hugh Peters, who had reſided in the country twenty years, declared before the parliament that he had not ſeen a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en man, nor heard a profane oath during that period.

The drinking of healths, and the uſe of tobacco were forbidden, the former being conſidered as an heatheniſh and idolatrous practice, grounded on the ancient libations; the other as a ſpecies of intoxication and waſte of time. Laws were inſtituted to regulate the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſexes, and the advances toward matrimony: They had a ceremony of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothing, which preceded that of marriage. Pride and levity of behavior came under the cognizance of the magiſtrate. Not only the richneſs but the mode of dreſs, and cut of the hair were ſubject to ſtate-regulations. Women were forbidden to expoſe their arms or boſoms to view; it was ordered that their ſleeves ſhould reach down to their wriſt, and their gowns be cloſed round the neck. Men were obliged to cut ſhort their hair, that they might not reſemble women. No perſon not worth two hundred pounds was allowed to wear gold or ſilver lace, or ſilk hoods and ſcarfs.

            <p>The idea of liberty in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in that day ſtrangely underſtood, and myſteriouſly expreſſed. The venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Higginſon of Salem in his ſermon on the day of the election 1663, ſpeaks thus; 
<q>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:018344_0091_0FA5D639ECD3EFD8"/>The goſpel of Chriſt hath a right para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all rights in the world; it hath a divine and ſupreme right to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every nation, and the knee of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy is to bow at the name of Jeſus. This right carries liberty along with it, for all ſuch as profeſs the goſpel, to walk according to the faith and order of the goſpel. That which is contrary to the goſpel hath no right, and therefore ſhould have no liberty.</q>
Here the queſtion ariſes, Who is to be the judge of what is agreeable or contrary to the goſpel? If the magiſtrate, then there is only a liberty to believe and practiſe what the magiſtrate thinks right. A ſimilar ſentiment occurs in the ſermon of the learned Preſident Oakes on the ſame occaſion in 1673; <q>The outcry of ſome is for liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. This is the great Diana of the libertines of this age. But remember that as long as you have liberty to walk in the faith and order of the goſpel, and may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty, you have as much liberty of conſcience as Paul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired under any government.</q>
Here the queſtion recurs, Would Paul have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to walk according to the opinion which the magiſtrate might entertain of
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018344_0092_0FA5D63A95B9BCB0"/>
the faith and order of the goſpel? But this was all the freedom allowed by the ſpirit of theſe times. Liberty of conſcience and toleration were offenſive terms, and they who uſed them were ſuppoſed to be the enemies of religion and government. <q>I look upon toleration (ſays the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) as the firſt-born of all abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if it ſhould be born and brought forth among us, you may call it Gad, and give the ſame reaſon that Leah did for the name of her ſon, <hi>Behold a troop cometh,</hi> a troop of all manner of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</q>

            <p>The champion of theſe ſentiments was Cotton, who though eminently meek, placid and charitable, yet was ſtrongly tinctured with the prevailing opinion, That the magiſtrate had a cöercive power againſt heretics. The baniſhment of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Williams, miniſter of Salem, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a vehement controverſy on this point. Williams having written in favour of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience, and ſtyled the oppoſite principle "the bloody tenet;" was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Cotton, who publiſhed a treatiſe in 1647 with this ſtrange title, <q>The bloody tenet waſhed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</q>
In this work he labours to prove the lawfulneſs of the magiſtrate's uſing the civil ſword to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate heretics, from the commands given to the Jews to put to death blaſphemers and idolaters. To the objection, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſerves to make men hypocrites, he ſays, <q>better tolerate hypocrites and tares than briars and thorns. In ſuch caſes the civil ſword doth not ſo much attend the converſion of ſeducers, as the preventing the ſeduction of honeſt minds
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018344_0094_0FA5D64072F14A50"/>
by their means.</q>
He allows indeed that <q>the magiſtrate ought not to draw the ſword againſt ſeducers till he have uſed all good means for their conviction: But if after their continuance in obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rebellion againſt the light, he ſhall ſtill walk toward them in ſoft and gentle commiſeration, his ſoftneſs and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is exceſſive large to foxes and wolves; but his bowels are miſerably ſtraitned and hardned againſt the poor ſheep and lambs of Chriſt. Nor is it fruſtrating the end of Chriſt's coming, which was to ſave ſouls, but a direct ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing it, to deſtroy, if need be, the bodies of thoſe wolves, who ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſouls of thoſe for whom Chriſt died.</q>
In purſuing his argument he reſines ſo far as to deny that any man is to be perſecuted on account of conſcience <q>till being convinced in his conſcience of his wickedneſs, he do ſtand out therein, not only againſt the truth, but againſt the light of his own conſcience, that ſo it may appear he is not perſecuted for cauſe of conſcience, but puniſhed for ſinning againſt his own conſcience.</q>
To which he adds, <q>ſometimes it may be an aggravation of ſin both in judgment and practice that a man committeth it in
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:018344_0095_0FA5D64098FF71D0"/>
conſcience.</q>
After having ſaid that <q>it was toleration which made the world antichriſtian,</q>
he concludes his book with this ſingular ejaculation, <q>the Lord keep us from being bewitched with the whore's cup, leſt while we ſeem to reject her with open face of profeſſion, we bring her in by a back door of tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo come to drink deeply of the cup of the Lord's wrath, and be filled with her plagues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the ſtrangeſt language that ever was uſed on this or perhaps on any other ſubject, is to be found in a book printed in 1645 by the humourous Ward of Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwich entitled "the Simple Cobler of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gawam."
<q>My heart (ſays he) hath naturally deteſted four things; the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apocrypha in the bible: foreigners dwelling in my country, to croud out native ſubjects into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the eaſt: alchymized coins: toleration of divers religions or of one religion in ſegregant ſhapes. He that willingly aſſents to the laſt, if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines his heart by day-light, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will tell him, he is either an atheiſt, or an heretic, or an hypocrite, or at beſt a captive to ſome luſt. Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety is the greateſt impiety in the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018344_0096_0FA5D64220749800"/>
world. To authorize an untruth by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of the ſtate, is to build a ſconce againſt the walls of heaven, to batter God out of his chair. Perſecution of true religion and toleration of falſe are the Jannes and Jambres to the kingdom of Chriſt, whereof the laſt is by far the worſt. He that is willing to tolerate any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound opinion, that his own may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated though never ſo ſound, will for a need, hang God's bible at the devil's girdle. It is ſaid that men ought to have liberty of conſcience and that it is perſecution to debar them of it: I can rather ſtand amazed than reply to this; it is an aſtoniſhment that the brains of men ſhould be parboiled in ſuch impious ignorance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe ſpecimens, (of which the reader will think he has had enough) it is eaſy to ſee how deeply the principle of intolerancy was rooted in the minds of our forefathers. Had it ſtood only in their books as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſpeculation, it might have been excuſed, conſidering the prejudices of the times; but it was drawn out into fatal practice, and cauſed ſevere perſecutions which cannot be juſtified conſiſtently with chriſtianity or true policy. Whatever may be ſaid in favour of their proceedings

againſt the Antinomians, whoſe principles had ſuch an effect on the minds of the people as materially affected the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of government, in the infancy of the plantation; yet the Anabaptiſts and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers were ſo inconſiderable for numbers, and the colony was then ſo well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that no danger could have been rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally apprehended to the commonwealth from them. Rhode-Iſland was ſettled by ſome of the Antinomian exiles on a plan of entire religious liberty:<note place="margin">Callender's Century Sermon, 1738.</note> men of every denomination being equally protected and countenanced, and enjoying the honours and offices of government. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, fined and baniſhed, flocked to that new ſettlement, and many of the Quakers alſo took refuge there; ſo that Rhode-Iſland was in thoſe days looked upon as the drain or ſink of New-England; and it has been ſaid that <q>if any man had loſt his religion, he might find it there, among ſuch a general muſter of opinioniſts.</q>
Notwithſtanding this invective, it is much to the honour of that government that there never was an inſtance of perſecution for conſcience ſake countenanced by them. Rhode-Iſland and Pennſylvania afford a ſtrong proof that toleration conduces great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſettlement and increaſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant plantation.</p>

In conſequence of theſe laws four perſons were put to death at Boſton, bearing their puniſhment with patience and fortitude; ſolemnly proteſting that their return from baniſhment was by divine direction, to warn the magiſtrates of their errors, and intreat them to repeal their cruel laws;<note place="margin">Jewel's Hiſtory of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</note> denouncing the judgments of God upon them; and foretelling that if they ſhould put them to death others would riſe up in their room to fill their hands with work<note n="*" place="bottom">

O my beloved, I have waited as the dove at the windows of the ark, and have ſtood ſtill in that watch, which the maſter did at his coming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the fulneſs of his love; wherein my heart did rejoice that I might ſpeak a few words to you, ſealed with the ſpirit of promiſe.

            <p>Impartiality will not ſuffer a veil to be drawn over theſe diſgraceful tranſactions.

Argument and ſcripture were in this caſe the proper weapons to combat them with; and if theſe had failed of ſucceſs, they muſt have been left to the judgment of an omniſcient and merciful God.

and our fathers thought it hard, when they had fled from oppoſition and perſecution in one ſhape to be again troubled with it in another. But it would have been more to their honor to have ſuffered their magiſtracy and church order to be inſulted, than to have ſtained their hands with the blood of men who deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pity rather than puniſhment.

Did theſe offences deſerve death? had any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a right to terrify with capital laws perſons guilty of no other crimes than theſe, eſpecially when they profeſſed that they were obliged to go the greateſt lengths in maintaining thoſe tenets which they judged ſacred, and following the dictates of that ſpirit which they thought divine? Was not the mere <q>holding the point of the ſword</q>
to them, really inviting them to "ruſh on it" and ſeal their teſtimony with their blood? and was not this the moſt likely way to ſtrengthen and increaſe their party? Such puniſhment for offences which proceeded from a miſguided zeal, increaſed and inflamed by oppoſition, will never reflect any honour on the policy or moderation of the government; and can be accounted for only by the ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for cöercive power in religion, retained by moſt or all of the reformed churches; a prejudice which time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience were neceſſary to remove<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>From the following authorities, it will appear that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of New-England, however ſevere and unjuſtifiable in their proceedings againſt the Quakers, went no farther than the moſt eminent reformers; particularly the Bohemians, the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, the celebrated Calvin and the martyr Cranmer.</p>
                  <p>In the war which the Emperor Sigiſmond excited againſt the BOHEMIAN reformers, who had the famous Ziſea for their general; "The acts of barbarity which were committed on both ſides were ſhocking and terrible beyond expreſſion. For notwithſtanding the irreconcileable oppoſition between the religious ſentiments of the contending parties, they both agreed in this one horrible point, that it was innocent and lawful to perſecute and extirpate with fire and ſword, the enemies of the true religion, and ſuch they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally appeared to be in each others eyes." Moſheim's Eccl. Hiſt. vol. 3. p. 261.</p>
                  <p>"It were indeed ardently to be wiſhed, that the LUTHERANS had treated with more mildneſs and charity thoſe who differed from them in religious opinions. But they had unhappily imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpirit of perſecution in their early education. This was too much the ſpirit of the times, and it was even a leading maxim with our anceſtors [this author was a Lutheran] that it was both lawful and expedient to uſe ſeverity and force againſt thoſe whom they looked upon as hereties. <hi>This maxim was derived from ROME;</hi> and even thoſe who ſeparated from that church did not find it eaſy to throw off all of a ſudden that deſpotic and uncharitable ſpirit, that had ſo long been the main ſpring of its government and the general characteriſtic of it members. Nay in their narrow view of things, their very piety ſeemed to ſuppreſs the generous movements of fraternal love and forbearance, and the more they felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves animated with a zeal for the divine glory, the more difficult did they find it to renounce that ancient and favourite maxim, that whoever is found to be an enemy to God, ought alſo to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an enemy to his country." Moſheim, vol. 4. p. 437.</p>
                  <p>"Michael Servetus, a Spaniſh phyſician, publiſhed ſeven books in which he attacked the ſentiments adopted by far the greateſt part of the chriſtian church, in relation to the divine nature and a trinity of perſons in the Godhead. Few innovators have ſet out with a better proſpect of ſucceſs: But all his views were totally diſappointed by the vigilance and ſeverity of Calvin, who when Servetus was paſſing through Switzerland, cauſed him to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at Geneva in the year 1553, and had an accuſation of blaſphemy brought againſt him before the council.

                  <p>In the reign of Edward the ſixth of England, anno 1549, "A woman called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, was accuſed of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical pravity. Her doctrine was, <q>that Chriſt was not truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate of the virgin, whoſe fleſh being the outward man was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten and born in ſin; and conſequently he could take none of it; but the word, by the conſent of the inward man of the virgin was made fleſh.</q>
A ſcholaſtic nicety, not capable of doing much miſchief! but there was a neceſſity for delivering the woman to the flames for maintaining it. The young king though in ſuch tender years, had more ſenſe than all his counſellors and preceptors; and he long refuſed to ſign the warrant for her exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. CRANMER, with his ſuperior learning, was employed to perſuade him to compliance, and he ſaid, that the prince, being God's deputy, ought to repreſs impieties againſt God, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the king's deputies were bound to puniſh offenders againſt the king's perſon. He alſo argued from the practice of the Jewiſh church in ſtoning blaſphemers. Edward overcome by importunity more than reaſon at laſt ſubmitted, and told Cranmer with tears in his eyes, that if any wrong was done, the guilt ſhould lie entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his head.

And though the lenity of King Charles the IId in putting a ſtop to capital executions here has been much celebrated, yet in his letter to the Maſſachuſetts government the next year, wherein he requires liberty for the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land among them, he adds, <q>Wee cannot be underſtood hereby to direct, or wiſh that any indulgence ſhould be graunted to Quakers, whoſe principles, being inconſiſtent with any kind of government, Wee have found it neceſſary with the adviſe of our parliament here to make a ſharp law againſt them, and are well content you doe the like there.</q>

            <p>Divers others of the principal actors and abettors of this tragedy lived to ſee the folly and incompetency of ſuch ſanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laws, to which the ſufferings of their brethren, the nonconformiſts in England, did not a little contribute.

to add, that all thoſe diſgraceful laws were renounced and repealed, and the people of New-England are now as candidly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed toward the Quakers as any other denominations of chriſtians. To keep alive a ſpirit of reſentment and reproach to the country, on account of thoſe ancient tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which are now univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, would diſcover a temper not very conſiſtent with that meekneſs and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ought to be cultivated by all who profeſs to be influenced by the goſpel.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Mode of government under Maſſachuſetts. Maſon's efforts to recover the property of his anceſtor. Tranſactions of the king's commiſſioners. Oppoſition to them. Political principles. Internal tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Maſon diſcouraged.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>DURING the union of theſe planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Maſſachuſetts, they were governed by the general laws of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the terms of the union were ſtrictly obſerved. Exeter and Hampton were at firſt annexed to the juriſdiction of the courts at Ipſwich, till the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new county which was called Norfolk,<note place="margin">1643.</note> and comprehended Saliſbury, Haverhill, Hampton, Exeter, Portſmouth and Dover. Theſe towns were then of ſuch extent as to contain all the lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rivers Merrimack and Paſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua. The ſhire town was Saliſbury; but Dover and Portſmouth had always a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct juriſdiction, though they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as part of this new county; a court being held in one or the other, ſometimes once and ſometimes twice in the year, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one or more of the magiſtrates
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018344_0109_0FA5D4B71A371AF8"/>
or aſſiſtants, and one or more commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers choſen by the general court out of the principal gentlemen of each town. This was called the court of aſſociates;<note place="margin">Maſſ Gen. Court Rec.</note> and their power extended to cauſes of twenty pounds value. From them there was an appeal to the board of aſſiſtants, which being found inconvenient, it was in 1670 ordered to be made to the county court of Norfolk. Cauſes under twenty ſhillings in value were ſettled in each town by an inferior court conſiſting of three perſons. After ſome time they had liberty to chooſe their aſſociates,<note place="margin">1647.</note> which was done by the votes of both towns, opened at a joint meeting of their ſelectmen,<note place="margin">Dover and Portſmou. Rec.</note> though ſometimes they requeſted the court to appoint them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That mutual confidence between rulers and people, which ſprings from the genius of a republican government is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in all their tranſactions<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In 1652, the number of people in Dover was increaſed ſo that they were allowed by law to ſend two deputies to the general court. Hampton continued ſending but one till 1669, and Portſmouth till 1672. The names of the repreſentatives which I have been able to recover, are as follows:

He found the lands at Newichwannock occupied by Richard Leader, againſt whom he brought actions in the county court of Norfolk; but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ariſing whether the lands in queſtion were within the juriſdiction of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, and the court of Norfolk judging the action not to be within their cognizance, recourſe was had to the general court; who on this occaſion ordered an accurate ſurvey of the northern bounds of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:018344_0111_0FA5D4B952BFF510"/>
to be made; a thing which they had long meditated. A committee of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral court attended by Jonathan Ince and John Shearman ſurveyors,<note place="margin">Maſſa. Rec.</note> and ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian guides, went up the river Merrimack to find the moſt northerly part thereof, which the Indians told them was at Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochtan, the outlet of the lake Winnipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeogee. The latitude of this place was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be 43 degrees 40 minutes and 12 ſeconds, to which three miles being added, made the line of the patent, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their conſtruction, fall within the lake, in the latitude of 43 degrees 43 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes and 12 ſeconds.<note place="margin">1653.</note> Two experienced ſhip-maſters, Jonas Clarke and Samuel Andrews, were then diſpatched to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern coaſt, who found the ſame degrees, minutes, and ſeconds, on the northern point of an iſland in Caſco Bay, called the Upper Clapboard Iſland. An eaſt and weſtline, drawn through theſe points from the Atlantic to the South ſea, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſed to be the northern boundary of the Maſſachuſetts patent, within which the whole claim of Maſon, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of that of Gorges were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. When this grand point was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, the court were of opinion, that <q>ſome lands at Newichwannock, with the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:018344_0112_0FA5D4BA13DF18E0"/>
river, were by agreement of Sir Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Gorges and others, apportioned to Captain Maſon, and that he alſo had right by purchaſe of the Indians, as alſo by poſſeſſion and improvement;</q>
and they ordered <q>a quantity of land propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to his diſburſements, with the privilege of the river, to be laid out to his heirs.</q>
The agent made no attempt to recover any other part of the eſtate; but having tarried long enough in the country to obſerve the temper of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the management uſed in the determination of his ſuit, he returned; and the eſtate was given up for loſt unleſs the government of England ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>During the commonwealth, and the protectorate of Cromwell, there could be no hope of relief, as the family had always been attached to the royal cauſe, and the colony ſtood high in the favor of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and of Cromwell.<note place="margin">1660.</note> But the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of King Charles the ſecond encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Tufton, who now took the ſirname of Maſon, to look up to the throne for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and aſſiſtance. For though the plan of colonization adopted by his grandfather was in itſelf chimerical, and proved fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yet he had expended a large eſtate in
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:018344_0113_0FA5D4BA94323E08"/>
the proſecution of it, which muſt have been wholly loſt to his heirs, unleſs they could recover the poſſeſſion of his Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican territories. Full of this idea, Maſon petitioned the king; ſetting forth <q>the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment of the Maſſachuſetts colony upon his lands, their making grants and giving titles to the inhabitants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſpoſſeſſing him and keeping him out of his right.</q>
The king referred the petition to his attorney-general Sir Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry Palmer,<note place="margin">Nov. 8. MS in Su. Cour. files.</note> who reported that <q>Robert Maſon, grandſon and heir to Capt. John Maſon, had a good and legal title to the province of New-Hampſhire.</q>
Nothing farther was done at this time, nor was the matter mentioned in the letter which the king ſoon after ſent to the colony,<note place="margin">1662.</note> though ſome offenſive things in their conduct were therein reprehended,<note place="margin">Hutch.

            <p>This commiſſion was highly diſreliſhed by the colony, as inconſiſtent with the rights and privileges which they enjoyed by their charter, and which the king had ſacredly promiſed to confirm. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder that the commiſſioners were treated with much coolneſs at their arrival;<note place="margin">Hutch.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1665.</note>In their progreſs through the country they came to Paſcataqua,<note place="margin">June.</note> and enquired into the bounds of Maſon's patent. They heard the allegation of Whelewright, who when baniſhed by the colony, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to reſide immediately beyond what was called the bound-houſe, which was three large miles to the northward of the river Merrimack. They took the affidavit of Henry Jocelyn concerning the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018344_0115_0FA5D4BC39397D88"/>
between Governor Cradock and Captain Maſon, that the river ſhould be the boundary of their reſpective patents. They made no determination of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in their report to the king; but having called together the inhabitants of Portſmouth, Sir Robert Carre,<note place="margin">Maſs. Rec. Octo. 10.</note> in the name of the reſt, told them that <q>they would releaſe them from the government of Maſſachuſetts whoſe juriſdiction ſhould come no farther than the bound-houſe.</q>
They then proceeded to appoint juſtices of the peace and other officers, with power to act according to the laws of England,<note place="margin">Hutchin. Collection pap. 488.</note> and ſuch laws of their own as were not repugnant thereto, until the king's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould be farther known.</p>
            <p>There had always been a party here who were diſſaffected to the government of Maſſachuſetts. One of the moſt active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them was Abraham Corbett of Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, who, ſince the arrival of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners at Boſton, and probably by authority derived from them, had taken upon him to iſſue warrants in the king's name on ſeveral occaſions, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued a high miſdemeanor, as he had never been commiſſioned by the authority of the colony. Being called to account by the general court, he was admoniſhed,<note place="margin">Maſſa. Rec.</note> fined
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018344_0116_0FA5D4BCD8BC0800"/>
five pounds, and committed till the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was performed. Irritated by this ſeverity, he was the fitter inſtrument for the purpoſe of the commiſſioners, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him to frame a petition to the king in the name of the four towns, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the uſurpation of Maſſachuſetts over them, and praying to be releaſed from their tyranny. Corbett, in a ſecret manner, procured ſeveral perſons both in Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth and Dover to ſubſcribe this petition, but the moſt of thoſe to whom he offered it refuſed.</p>
            <p>The ſenſible part of the inhabitants now ſaw with much concern that they were in danger of being reduced to the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate which they had been in before their union with the colony. Awed by the ſupercilious behaviour of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, they knew not at firſt how to act; for to oppoſe the king's authority was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued treaſon, and it was ſaid that Sir Robert Carre had threatened a poor old man with death for no other crime than forbidding his grandchild to open a door to them. But when the rumour was ſpread that a petition was drawn, and that Corbett was procuring ſubſcribers, the people, no longer able to bear the abuſe, earneſtly applied to the general court, praying 
<q>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:018344_0117_0FA5D4BDAA7FF970"/>that in ſome orderly way they might have an opportunity to clear themſelves of ſo great and unjuſt aſperſions, as were by this petition, drawn in their name, caſt upon the government under which they were ſettled; and alſo to manifeſt their ſenſe of ſuch perfidious actions, leſt by their ſilence it ſhould be concluded they were of the ſame mind with thoſe who framed the petition.</q>
In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this petition, the court commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned Thomas Danforth, Eleazar Luſher, and Major General Leverett to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, and ſettle the peace in theſe places according to their beſt diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Theſe gentlemen came to Portſmouth,<note place="margin">October 9.</note> and having aſſembled the inhabitants, and publiſhed their commiſſion, they told them that they were informed of a petition ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in behalf of that and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring towns, complaining of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and deſired them if they had any juſt grievances to let them be known, and report ſhould be immediately made to the general court. The next day they aſſembled the people of Dover and made the ſame challenge. Both towns reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively proteſted againſt the petition, and profeſſed full ſatisfaction with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they ſignified in addreſſes to
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018344_0118_0FA5D4C04EE6E930"/>
the court. Dudley, the miniſter of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, certified under his hand to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that the people of that town had no concern directly nor indirectly with the obnoxious petition. They received alſo full ſatisfaction with regard to Hampton; a certificate of which might have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if they had thought it neceſſary.</p>
            <p>They then proceeded to ſummon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett before them for ſeditious behaviour; but he eluded the ſearch that was made for him, and they were obliged to leave a warrant with an officer to cite him to the court at Boſton. The commiſſioners had now gone over into the province of Maine, from whence Sir Robert Carre in their name ſent a ſevere reprimand to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, forbidding them to proceed againſt ſuch perſons as had ſubſcribed the petition, and incloſing a copy of a letter which the ſaid commiſſioners had written to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and council on the ſame ſubject.</p>
            <p>The committee returned and reported their proceedings to the court, and about the ſame time the commiſſioners came from their eaſtern tour to Boſton; where the court deſired a conference with them, but received ſuch an anſwer from Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Carre as determined them not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat their requeſt. A warrant was then
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:018344_0119_0FA5D4C1DBC55060"/>
iſſued by the ſecretary, in the name of the whole court, to apprehend Corbett and bring him before the governor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <q>to anſwer for his tumultuous and ſeditious practices againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>
The next ſpring he was ſeized and brought before them;<note place="margin">1666.</note> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a full hearing was adjudged guilty of ſedition,<note place="margin">May 23.</note> and exciting others to diſcontent with the government and laws, and of keeping a diſorderly houſe of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for which crimes he was ſentenced to give a bond of one hundred pounds with ſecurity for his peaceable behaviour and obedience to the laws; he was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited retailing liquors; diſabled from bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any office in the town or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, during the pleaſure of the court; and obliged to pay a fine of twenty pounds and five pounds for the coſts of his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>This ſeverity in vindication of their charter-rights they thought fit to temper with ſomething that had the appearance of ſubmiſſion to the royal commands. The king's pleaſure had been ſignified to the commiſſioners,<note place="margin">Hutchin. Collect. pap. 419.</note> that the harbours ſhould be fortified. This inſtruction came to hand while they were at Paſcataqua, and they immediately iſſued warrants to the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:018344_0120_0FA5D4C2BA73DA18"/>
four towns, requiring them to meet at a time and place appointed to receive his majeſty's orders. One of theſe warrants was ſent by expreſs to Boſton, from whence two officers were diſpatched by the governor and council to forbid the towns on their peril to meet, or obey the commands of the commiſſioners. But by their own authority they ordered a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to look out the moſt convenient place for a fortification, upon whoſe report <q>the neck of land on the eaſtward of the Great Iſland,<note place="margin">Maſſa Rec.</note> where a ſmall fort had been already built, was ſequeſtered for the purpoſe, taking in the Great Rock, and from thence all the eaſterly part of the ſaid iſland.</q>
The court of aſſociates being impowered to hear and determine the claims of thoſe who pretended any title to this land; a claim was entered by George Walton, but rejected; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation confirmed. The cuſtoms and impoſts on goods imported into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour were applied to the maintenance of the fort, and the trained bands of Great-Iſland and Kittery-Point were diſcharged from all other duty to attend the ſervice of it, under Richard Cutts, eſq. who was appointed captain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:018344_0121_0FA5D4C2DFE1ED20"/>The people of Maſſachuſetts have, both in former and latter times, been charged with diſloyalty to the king in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct toward theſe commiſſioners, and their diſregard of authority derived from the ſame ſource with their charter. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their conduct on this occaſion, we muſt conſider the ideas they had of their political connexion with the parent ſtate. They had been forced from thence by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: they came at their own charges into a wilderneſs, claimed indeed by the crown of England; but really in poſſeſſion of its native lords; from whom they had purchaſed the ſoil and ſovereignty, which gave them a title, conſidered in a moral view, ſuperior to the grant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean prince. For convenience only, they had ſolicited and accepted a patent from the crown, which in their opinion conſtituted the only bond of union between them and their prince, by which the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their allegiance to him was to be determined. This patent they regarded as a ſolemn compact, wherein the king had granted them undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the ſoil, and power of government within certain limits; on condition that they ſhould ſettle the country, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianize the natives, yield a fifth of all gold
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018344_0122_0FA5D4C3A6D22028"/>
and ſilver mines to the crown, and make no laws repugnant to thoſe of England. They had, on their part, ſacredly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe conditions; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the grant of title, property and dominion which the crown had made to them was irrevocable. And although they acknowledged themſelves ſubjects of the reigning prince, and owned a dependence on the royal authority; yet they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it to be only through the medium of their charter.</p>
            <p>The appointment of commiſſioners who were to act within the ſame limits, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of this authority, and to receive appeals from it; whoſe rule of conduct was no eſtabliſhed law, but their own "good and ſound diſcretion," was regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a dangerous ſtretch of royal power, militating with and ſuperſeding their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If the royal authority was deſtined to flow through the patent, it could not regularly be turned into another channel: if they were to be governed by laws made and executed by officers of their own chooſing, they could not at the ſame time be governed by the "diſcretion" of men in whoſe appointment they had no voice, and over whom they had no control. Two ruling powers in the ſame ſtate was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leciſm

            <p>The commiſſioners, having finiſhed their buſineſs, were recalled by the order of the king, who was much diſpleaſed with the ill treatment they had received from the Maſſachuſetts government, which was the more heinous, as the colonies of Plymouth, Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut had treated the commiſſion with acknowledged reſpect.

and commanding that all things ſhould remain as the commiſſioners had ſettled them until his farther order; and that thoſe perſons who had been impriſoned for petitioning or applying to them ſhould be releaſed.

            </argument>
            <p>AT the time of the firſt diſcovery of the river Paſcataqua by Captain Smith, it was found that the native inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe parts differed not in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, manners, nor government, from their eaſtern or weſtern neighbours. Though they were divided into ſeveral tribes, each of which had a diſtinct ſachem, yet they all owned ſubjection to a ſovereign prince, called Baſhaba,<note place="margin">Smith's Voyage.</note> whoſe reſidence was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where about Pemaquid. It was ſoon after found that the Tarratenes, who lived far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſtward, had invaded his country, ſurprized and ſlain him, and all the people in his neighbourhood, and carried off his women, leaving no traces of his authority. Upon which the ſubordinate ſachems, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no head to unite them, and each one ſtriving for the pre-eminence, made war among themſelves; whereby many of their people, and much of their proviſion were deſtroyed. When Sir Richard Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins viſited the coaſt in 1615,<note place="margin">Gorges's N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:018344_0129_0FA5D4CB5BCF3F58"/>
at its height; and to this ſucceeded a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, which carried them off in ſuch numbers that the living were not able to bury the dead;<note place="margin">Prince's Annals. 1617.</note> but their bones remained at the places of their habitations for ſeveral years. During this peſtilence, Richard Vines and ſeveral others, whom Sir Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Gorges had hired, at a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to tarry in the country through the winter, lived among them and lodged in their cabbins, without receiving the leaſt injury in their health,<note place="margin">Gorges, p. 12.</note>
               <q>not ſo much as feeling their heads to ach the whole time.</q>
By ſuch ſingular means did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence prepare the way for the peaceable entrance of the Europeans into this land.</p>
            <p>When the firſt ſettlements were made, the remains of two tribes had their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the ſeveral branches of the river Paſcataqua; one of their ſachems lived at the falls of Squamſcot, and the other at thoſe of Newichwannock; their head quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being generally ſeated in places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for fiſhing.

            <p>An Engliſh gentleman who had been much converſant among the Indians was invited, in 1660, to a great dance and feaſt; on which occaſion the elderly men, in ſongs or ſpeeches recite their hiſtories, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſentiments, and advice, to the younger. At this ſolemnity Paſſaconaway, being grown old, made his farewell ſpeech to his children and people; in which, as a dying man, he warned them to take heed how they quarrelled with their Engliſh neighbours; for though they might do them ſome damage, yet it would prove the means of their own deſtruction. He told them that he had been a bitter enemy to the Engliſh, and by the arts of ſorcery had tried his utmoſt to hinder
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:018344_0131_0FA5D4CCA6544D38"/>
their ſettlement and increaſe; but could by no means ſucceed. This caution perhaps often repeated, had ſuch an effect, that upon the breaking out of the Indian war fifteen years afterward, Wonolanſet,<note place="margin">Hubbard's printed Narrative. p. 9.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While the Britiſh nations had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with internal convulſions, and had endured the horrors of a civil war, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſame cauſes which forced the planters of New-England to quit the land of their nativity; this wilderneſs had been to them a quiet habitation. They had ſtruggled with many hardſhips; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had ſmiled upon their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their ſettlements were extended and their churches multiplied. There had been no remarkable quarrel with the ſavages, except the ſhort war with the Pequods, who dwelt in the ſouth-eaſt part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut: They being totally ſubdued in 1637, the dread and terror of the Engliſh kept the other nations quiet for near forty years. During which time the New-England colonies being confederated for their mutual defence, and for maintaining the public peace, took great pains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the goſpel among the natives, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:018344_0132_0FA5D4CD70F90490"/>
bring them to a civilized way of living, which, with reſpect to ſome, proved ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; others refuſed to receive the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, and remained obſtinately preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the Engliſh. Yet the object of their hatred was at the ſame time the object of their fear; which led them to forbear acts of hoſtility, and to preſerve an outward ſhew of friendſhip, to their mutual intereſt.</p>
            <p>Our hiſtorians have generally repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indians in a moſt odious light, eſpecially when recounting the effects of their ferocity. Dogs, caitiffs, miſcreants and hell-hounds, are the politeſt names which have been given them by ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who ſeem to be in a paſſion at the mentioning their cruelties,<note place="margin">Hubbard's Narrative and Mather's Magnalia.</note> and at other times ſpeak of them with contempt. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indulgence may be allowed to thoſe who wrote in times when the mind was vexed with their recent depredations and inhumanities, it ill becomes us to cheriſh an inveterate hatred of the unhappy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Religion teaches us a better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and providence has now put an end to the controverſy, by their almoſt total extirpation. We ſhould therefore proceed with calmneſs in recollecting their paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and forming our judgment of their character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:018344_0133_0FA5D4CE15793528"/>It muſt be acknowledged that human depravity appeared in theſe unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a moſt ſhocking view. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of education and the refinements of civilized life, either lay a check upon our vicious propenſities, or diſguiſe our crimes; but among them human wickedneſs was ſeen in its naked deformity. Yet, bad as they were, it will be difficult to find them guilty of any crime which cannot be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled among civilized nations.</p>
            <p>They are always deſcribed as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>cruel;</hi> and it cannot be denied that this diſpoſition indulged to the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſtrongly marks their character. We are ſtruck with horror, when we hear of their binding the victim to the ſtake, biting off his nails, tearing out his hair by the roots, pulling out his tongue, boring out his eyes, ſticking his ſkin full of lighted pitch-wood, half roaſting him at the fire, and then making him run for their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, till he faints and dies under the blows which they give him on every part of his body. But is it not as dreadful to read of an unhappy wretch, ſewed up in a ſack full of ſerpents and thrown into the ſea, or broiled in a red hot iron chair; or mangled by lions and tygers after having ſpent his ſtrength to combat them for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:018344_0134_0FA5D4CED3169CA8"/>
of the ſpectators in an amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre? and yet theſe were puniſhments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans in the politeſt ages of the empire. What greater cruelty is there in the American tortures, than in conſining a man in a trough, and daubing him with honey that he may be ſtung to death by waſps and other venomous inſects; or flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alive and ſtretching out his ſkin before his eyes, which modes of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not inconſiſtent with the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and elegance of the ancient court of Perſia? or, to come down to modern times; what greater miſery can there be in the Indian executions, than in racking a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner on a wheel, and breaking his bones one by one with an iron bar; or placing his legs in a boot and driving in wedges one after another; which tortures are ſtill, or have till lately been uſed in ſome Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean kingdoms? I forbear to name the torments of the inquiſition, becauſe they ſeem to be beyond the ſtretch of <hi>human</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. If civilized nations, and thoſe who profeſs the moſt merciful religion that ever bleſſed the world, have practiſed theſe cruelties, what could be expected of men who were ſtrangers to every degree of refinement either civil or mental?</p>
            <p>The Indians have been repreſented as
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:018344_0135_0FA5D4D15432D278"/>
               <hi>revengeful.</hi> When any perſon was killed, the neareſt relative thought himſelf bound to be the avenger of blood, and never left ſeeking, till he found an opportunity to execute his purpoſe. Whether in a ſtate,<note place="margin">Numbers ch. 35. v. 19. Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy ch. 19. v. 12.</note> where government is confeſſedly ſo feeble as among them, ſuch a conduct is not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable, and even countenanced by the Jewiſh law may deſerve our conſideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>treachery</hi> with which theſe people are juſtly charged, is exactly the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which operates in the breach of ſolemn treaties made between nations which call themſelves chriſtian. Can it be more criminal in an Indian, than in an European, not to think himſelf bound by promiſes and oaths extorted from him when under dureſs?</p>
            <p>Their <hi>jealouſy and hatred</hi> of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh neighbours may eaſily be accounted for, if we allow them to have the ſame feelings with ourſelves. How natural is it for us to form a diſagreeable idea of a whole nation, from the bad conduct of ſome individuals with whom we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted? and though others of them may be of a different character, yet will not that prudence which is eſteemed a virtue, lead us to ſuſpect the faireſt appearances,

            <p>Though the greater part of the Engliſh ſettlers came hither with religious views, and fairly purchaſed their lands of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, yet it cannot be denied that ſome, eſpecially in the eaſtern parts of New-England, had lucrative views only; and from the beginning uſed fraudulent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in trade with them. Such things were indeed diſallowed by the government, and would always have been puniſhed if the Indians had made complaint: but they knew only the law of retaliation, and when an injury was received, it was never forgotten till revenged. Encroachments made on their lands, and fraud committed in trade, afforded ſufficient grounds for a quarrel, though at ever ſo great a length of time; and kept alive a perpetual jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the like treatment again<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſ. du Pratz gives nearly the ſame account of the Indians on the Miſſiſſippi. <q>There needs nothing but prudence and good ſenſe to perſuade theſe people to what is reaſonable, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their friendſhip without interruption.

               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:018344_0137_0FA5D4D3A3C55170"/>Such was the temper of the Indians of New-England when the firſt general war began.<note place="margin">1675.</note> It was thought by the Engliſh in that day, that Philip, ſachem of the Wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panoags, a crafty and aſpiring man, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by intrigue, and partly by example, excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſuch a general combination. He was the ſon of Maſſaſſoiet, the neareſt ſachem to the colony of Plymouth, with whom he had concluded a peace, which he maintained more through fear than good will, as long as he lived. His ſon and immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor Alexander, preſerved the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſhew of friendſhip; but died with choler on being detected in a plot againſt them. Philip, it is ſaid, diſſembled his hoſtile pupoſes; he was ready, on every ſuſpicion of his infidelity, to renew his ſubmiſſion, and teſtify it even by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of his arms, till he had ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed a cruel jealouſy into many of the neighbouring Indians; which excited them to attempt the recovering their country by extirpating the new poſſeſſors. The plot, it is ſaid, was diſcovered before it was ripe for execution; and as he could no longer promiſe himſelf ſecurity under the maſk of friendſhip, he was conſtrained to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his true character, and accordingly began hoſtilities upon the plantation of

Swanzy, in the colony of Plymouth, in the month of June 1675.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this general opinion, it may admit of ſome doubt, whether a ſingle ſachem, whoſe authority was limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could have ſuch an extenſive influence over tribes ſo remote and unconnected with him as the eaſtern Indians; much more improbable is it, that thoſe in Virginia ſhould have joined in the confederacy, as it hath been intimated.<note place="margin">Hubbard's Narrative, p. 12.</note> The Indians ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver travelled to any greater diſtance than their hunting required; and ſo ignorant were they of the geography of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">Neal's Hiſt. N.E. Vol 1. p. 21.</note> that they imagined New-England to be an iſland, and could tell the name of an inlet or ſtreight by which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it was ſeparated from the main land. But what renders it more improbable that Philip was ſo active an inſtrument in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing this war, is the conſtant tradition among the poſterity of thoſe people who lived near him, and were familiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with him, and with thoſe of his Indians who ſurvived the war: which is, that he was forced on by the fury of his young men, ſorely againſt his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and that of his chief counſellors; and that as he foreſaw that the Engliſh would,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:018344_0139_0FA5D4D5021101C8"/>
in time, eſtabliſh themſelves and extirpate the Indians, ſo he thought that the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war upon them would only haſten the deſtruction of his own people. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a very common, and ſometimes a juſt excuſe with the Indians, when charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with breach of faith, that the old men were not able to reſtrain the younger from ſignalizing their valour, and gratifying their revenge, though they diſapproved their raſhneſs. This want of reſtraint was owing to the weakneſs of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their ſachems having but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of magiſtratical authority.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Briſtol ſhew a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpot where Philip received the news of the firſt Engliſhmen that were killed,<note place="margin">Callendar's Century Sermon, p. 73.</note> with ſo much ſorrow as to cauſe him to weep; a few days before which he had reſcued one who had been taken by his Indians, and privately ſent him home. Whatever credit may be given to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſo different from the current opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it muſt be owned, that in ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of general confuſion as the firſt war occaſioned, fear and jealouſy might create many ſuſpicions, which would ſoon be formed into reports of a general confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, through Philip's contrivance; and it is to be noted that the principal hiſtories
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:018344_0140_0FA5D4D59EB3B9D8"/>
of this war, [Increaſe Mather's and Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard's] were printed in 1676 and 1677, when the ſtrangeſt reports were eaſily cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and the people were ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing that was bad of ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable a neighbour as Philip. But as the fact cannot now be preciſely aſcertained, I ſhall detain the reader no longer from the real cauſes of the war in theſe eaſtern parts.</p>
            <p>There dwelled near the river Saco a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem named Squando, a noted enthuſiaſt, a leader in the devotions of their religion,<note place="margin">Hubbard, p. 29.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe qualifications rendered him a perſon of the higheſt dignity, importance and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence among all the eaſtern Indians. His ſquaw paſſing along the river in a canoe, with her infant child, was met by ſome rude ſailors, who having heard that the Indian children could ſwim as naturally as the young of the brutal kind, in a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unguarded humour overſet the canoe. The child ſunk, and the mother inſtantly diving fetched it up alive, but the child dying ſoon after, its death was imputed to the treatment it had received from the ſeamen; and Squando was ſo provoked that he conceived a bitter anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:018344_0141_0FA5D4D659686118"/>
to the Engliſh, and employed his great art and influence to excite the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt them. Some other injuries were alledged as the ground of the quarrel;<note place="margin">Magualia, Lib. 7. p. 55.</note> and, conſidering the intereſted views and irregular lives of many of the eaſtern ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers, their diſtance from the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the want of due ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation among them, it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a great part of the blame of the eaſtern war belonged to them.</p>
            <p>The firſt alarm of the war in Plymouth colony ſpread great conſternation among the diſtant Indians, and held them a while in ſuſpence what part to act; for there had been a long external friendſhip ſubſiſting between them and the Engliſh, and they were afraid of provoking ſo powerful neighbours. But the ſeeds of jealouſy and hatred had been ſo effectually ſown, that the crafty and revengeful, and thoſe who were ambitious of doing ſome exploits, ſoon found means to urge them on to an open rupture; ſo that within twenty days after Philip had begun the war at the ſouthward, the flame broke out in the moſt northeaſterly part of the country,<note place="margin">Hubbard, p. 13.</note> at the diſtance of two hundred miles.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh inhabitants about the river Kennebeck, hearing of the inſurrection in
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:018344_0142_0FA5D4D74B188F98"/>
Plymouth colony, determined to make trial of the fidelity of their Indian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by requeſting them to deliver their arms. They made a ſhew of compliance; but, in doing it, committed an act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on a Frenchman, who lived in an Engliſh family; which being judged an offence, both by the Engliſh and the elder Indians, the offender was ſeized; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a promiſe, with ſecurity, for his future good behaviour, his life was ſpared, and ſome of them conſented to remain as hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; who ſoon made their eſcape, and joined with their fellows in robbing the houſe of Purchas, an ancient planter at Pechypſcot.</p>
            <p>The quarrel being thus begun, and their natural hatred of the Engliſh, and jealouſy of their deſigns, having riſen to a great height under the malignant influence of Squando and other leading men; and being encouraged by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the weſtern Indians, who were daily making depredations on the colonies of Plymouth, and Maſſachuſetts; they took every opportunity to rob and murder the people in the ſcattered ſettlements of the province of Maine; and having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed themſelves into many ſmall parties, that they might be the more extenſively

miſchievous, in the month of September they approached the plantations at Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua, and made their firſt onſet at Oyſter river then a part of the town of Dover, but now Durham. Here they burned two houſes belonging to two perſons named Cheſly, killed two men in a canoe, and carried away two captives;<note place="margin">Hubbard, p. 19.</note> both of whom ſoon after made their eſcape. About the ſame time a party of four laid in ambuſh near the road between Exeter and Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where they killed one, and took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, who made his eſcape. Within a few days an aſſault was made on the houſe of one Tozer at Newichwannock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were fifteen women and children, all of whom, except two, were ſaved by the intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of a girl of eighteen. She firſt ſeeing the Indians as they advanced to the houſe, ſhut the door and ſtood againſt it, till the others eſcaped to the next houſe, which was better ſecured. The Indians chopped the door to pieces with their hatchets, and then entering, they knocked her down, and leaving her for dead, went in purſuit of the others, of whom two children, who could not get over the fence, fell into their hands. The adventurous heroine reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and was perfectly healed of her wound.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:018344_0144_0FA5D4DAD25DC458"/>The two following days they made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral appearances on both ſides of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, uſing much inſolence, and burning two houſes and three barns, with a large quantity of grain. Some ſhot were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed without effect, and a purſuit was made after them into the woods by eight men, but night obliged them to return without ſucceſs. Five or ſix houſes were burned at Oyſter river, and two more men killed. Theſe daily inſults could not be borne without indignation and repriſal. About twenty young men, chiefly of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, obtained leave of Major Waldron, then commander of the militia, to try their ſkill and courage with the Indians in their own way.<note place="margin">Hubbard, p. 22.</note> Having ſcattered themſelves in the woods, a ſmall party of them diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered five Indians in a field near a deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſe, ſome of whom were gathering corn, and others kindling a fire to roaſt it. The men were at ſuch a diſtance from their fellows that they could make no ſignal to them without danger of a diſcovery; two of them, therefore, crept along ſilently, near to the houſe, from whence they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ruſhed upon thoſe two Indians, who were buſy at the fire, and knocked them down with the butts of their guns; the other three took the alarm and eſcaped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:018344_0145_0FA5D4DAF40E5AE0"/>All the plantations at Paſcataqua, with the whole eaſtern country, were now filled with fear and confuſion: Buſineſs was ſuſpended, and every man was obliged to provide for his own and his family's ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The only way was to deſert their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, and retire together within the larger and more convenient houſes, which they fortified with a timber wall and flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts, placing a centry-box on the roof. Thus the labour of the field was exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the duty of the garriſon, and they who had long lived in peace and ſecurity were upon their guard night and day, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to continual alarms, and the moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh of October was obſerved as a day of faſting and prayer; and on the ſixteenth the enemy made an aſſault upon the inhabitants at Salmon falls, in Berwick. Lieutenant Roger Plaiſted, being a man of true courage and of a public ſpirit, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent out a party of ſeven from his garriſon to make diſcovery. They fell into an ambuſh; three were killed, and the reſt retreated. The Lieutenant then diſpatched an expreſs to Major Waldron and Lieutenant Coffin at Cochecho, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging moſt importunately for help, which they were in no capacity to afford, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:018344_0146_0FA5D4DB9B1B4520"/>
with their own ſafety. The next day Plaiſted ventured out with twenty men, and a cart to fetch the dead bodies of their friends, and unhappily fell into another ambuſh. The cattle affrighted ran back, and Plaiſted being deſerted by his men, and diſdaining either to yield or fly, was killed on the ſpot, with his eldeſt ſon and one more; his other ſon died of his wound in a few weeks. Had the heroiſm of this worthy family been imitated by the reſt of the party, and a reinforcement arrived in ſeaſon, the enemy might have received ſuch a ſevere check as would have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from appearing in ſmall parties. The gallant behaviour of Plaiſted, though fatal to himſelf and his ſons, had this good effect, that the enemy retreated to the woods; and the next day Captain Froſt came up with a party from Sturgeon creek, and peaceably buried the dead:<note place="margin">Hubbard, p. 24.</note> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the month had expired a mill was burned there, and an aſſault made on Froſt's garriſon, who though he had only three boys with him, kept up a conſtant fire, and called aloud as if he were commanding a body of men, to march here and fire there: the ſtratagem ſucceeded, and the houſe was ſaved. The enemy then proceeded down the river, killing and plundering as they
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:018344_0147_0FA5D4DC57F90DF0"/>
found people off their guard, till they came oppoſite to Portſmouth; from whence ſome cannon being fired they diſperſed, and were purſued by the help of a light ſnow which fell in the night, and were overtaken by the ſide of a ſwamp, into which they threw themſelves, leaving their packs and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the purſuers. They ſoon after did more miſchief at Dover, Lamprey river and Exeter; and with theſe ſmall, but ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating aſſaults and ſkirmiſhes, the autumn was ſpent until the end of November; when the number of people killed and taken from Kennebeck to Paſcataqua a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to upwards of fifty.</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſetts government being fully employed in defending the ſouthern and weſtern parts, could not ſeaſonably ſend ſuccours to the eaſtward. Major General Deniſon, who commanded the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the colony, had ordered the majors who commanded the regiments on this ſide of the country, to draw out a ſufficient number of men to reduce the enemy, by attacking them at their retreat to their head-quarters at Oſſapy and Pigwacket. But the winter ſetting in early and fiercely, and the men being unprovided with rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets to travel on the ſnow, which by the tenth of December was four feet deep in
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:018344_0148_0FA5D4DD140DA2F0"/>
the woods, it was impoſſible to execute the deſign. This peculiar ſeverity of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon however proved favourable. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were pinched with famine, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt by their own confeſſion about ninety of their number, partly by the war, and partly for want of food, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the neceſſity of ſuing for peace. With this view they came to Major Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, expreſſing great ſorrow for what had been done, and promiſing to be quiet and ſubmiſſive. By his mediation a peace was concluded with the whole body of eaſtern Indians, which continued till the next Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; and might have continued longer, if the inhabitants of the eaſtern parts had not been too intent on private gain, and of a diſpoſition too ungovernable to be a barrier againſt an enemy ſo irritable and vindictive. The reſtoration of the captives made the peace more pleaſant: A return from the dead could not be more welcome than a deliverance from Indian captivity.</p>
            <p>The war at the ſouthward, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpring,<note place="margin">1676.</note> drew toward a cloſe.

the war, now fearing a total extirpation, endeavoured to conceal themſelves among their brethren of Penacook who had not joined in the war, and with thoſe of Oſſapy and Pigwacket who had made peace. But they could not ſo diſguiſe themſelves or their behaviour as to eſcape the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who had been converſant with Indians. Several of them were taken at different times and delivered up to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic execution. Three of them, Simon, Andrew and Peter, who had been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in killing Thomas Kimbal of Bradford, and captivating his family, did, within ſix weeks voluntarily reſtore the woman and five children. It being doubted whether this act of ſubmiſſion was a ſufficient atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the murder, they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Dover priſon till their caſe could be conſidered. Fearing that this confinement was a prelude to farther puniſhment, they broke out of priſon, and going to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, joined with the Indians of Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck and Amoriſcogin in thoſe depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they renewed on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe parts, in Auguſt, and were afterward active in diſtreſſing the people at Paſcataqua.</p>
            <p>This renewal of hoſtilities occaſioned the ſending of two companies to the eaſtward
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:018344_0150_0FA5D4DEA2F134A8"/>
under Captain Joſeph Syll, and Captain William Hawthorne. In the courſe of their march they came to Cocheclio, on the ſixth of September, where four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mixed Indians were met at the houſe of Major Waldron, with whom they had made the peace, and whom they conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their friend and father. The two captains would have fallen upon them at once, having it in their orders to ſeize all Indians, who had been concerned in the war. The major diſſuaded them from that purpoſe, and contrived the following ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem. He propoſed to the Indians, to have a training the next day, and a ſham fight after the Engliſh mode; and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning his own men, with thoſe under Captain Froſt of Kittery, they, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the two companies, formed one party, and the Indians another. Having diverted them a while in this manner, and cauſed the Indians to fire the firſt volley; by a peculiar dexterity, the whole body of them (except two or three) were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, before they could form a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of what was intended.

               </gap> Indians, (as they were called) who had fled from the ſouthward and taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge among them, were made priſoners, to the number of two hundred; and being ſent to Boſton, ſeven or eight of them, who were known to have killed any Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, were condemned and hanged; the reſt were ſold into ſlavery in foreign parts.</p>
            <p>This action was highly applauded by the general voice of the colony; as it gave them opportunity to deal with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in a judicial way, as rebels, and, as they imagined, to extirpate thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome neighbours. The remaining Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, however, looked upon the conduct of Major Waldron as a breach of faith; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they had taken thoſe fugitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians under their protection, and had made peace with him, which had been ſtrictly obſerved with regard to him and his neighbours, though it had been broken elſewhere. The Indians had no idea of the ſame government being extended very far, and thought they might make peace in one place, and war in another, without any imputation of infidelity; but a breach of hoſpitality and friendſhip, as they deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

this to be, merited, according to their principles, a ſevere revenge, and was never to be forgotten or forgiven. The major's ſituation on this occaſion was indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely critical; and he could not have acted either way without blame. It is ſaid that his own judgment was againſt any forcible meaſure, as he knew that many of thoſe Indians were true friends to the colony; and that in caſe of failure he ſhould expoſe the country to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; but had he not aſſiſted the forces in the execution of their commiſſion, (which was to ſeize all Indians who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with Philip in the war) he muſt have fallen under cenſure, and been deemed acceſſary, by his neglect, to the miſchiefs which might afterward have been perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by them. In this dilemma he finally determined to comply with the orders and expectations of government; imagining that he ſhould be able to ſatisfy thoſe of the Indians whom he intended to diſmiſs, and that the others would be removed out of the way of doing any further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but he had no ſuſpicion that he was laying a ſnare for his own life. It was unhappy for him, that he was obliged in deference to the laws of his country, and the orders of government, to give offence
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:018344_0153_0FA5D4E2A3E12670"/>
to a people who, having no public judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and penal laws among themſelves, were unable to diſtinguiſh between a legal puniſhment and private malice<note n="*" place="bottom">The above account of the ſeizure of the Indians is given from the moſt authentic and credible tradition that could be obtained within the laſt ſixteen years, from the poſterity of thoſe perſons who were concerned in the affair. It is but juſt mentioned by Hubbard and Mather, and not in connexion with its conſequences. Neal, for want of better information, has given a wrong turn to the relation, and ſo has Wynne who copies from him. Hutchinſon has not mentioned it at all.</note>.</p>
            <p>Two days after this ſurpriſal the forces proceeded on their route to the eaſtward, being joined with ſome of Waldron's and Froſt's men; and taking with them Blind Will, a ſagamore of the Indians who lived about Cochecho, and eight of his people for pilots. The eaſtern ſettlements were all either deſtroyed or deſerted, and no enemy was to be ſeen; ſo that the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition proved fruitleſs, and the companies returned to Paſcataqua.</p>
            <p>It was then thought adviſeable, that they ſhould march up toward the Oſſapy ponds; where the Indians had a ſtrong fort of timber fourteen feet high, with flankarts; which they had a few years before hired ſome Engliſh carpenters to build for them, as a defence againſt the Mohawks, of whom they were always afraid. It was thought that if the Indians could be ſurprized on their firſt return to their head-quarters, at
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:018344_0154_0FA5D4E3140E23D8"/>
the beginning of winter, ſome conſiderable advantage might be gained againſt them; or if they had not arrived there, that the proviſions, which they had laid in for their winter ſubſiſtence, might be deſtroyed. Accordingly, the companies being well provided for a march at that ſeaſon, ſet off on the firſt of November; and after tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling four days through a rugged, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous wilderneſs, and croſſing ſeveral rivers, they arrived at the ſpot; but found the fort and adjacent places entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and ſaw not an Indian in all the way. Thinking it needleſs for the whole body to go further, the weather being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and the ſnow deep, a ſelect party was detached eighteen or twenty miles above; who diſcovered nothing but frozen ponds, and ſnowy mountains; and ſuppoſing the Indians had taken up their winter quarters nearer the ſea, they returned to Newich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wannock, within nine days from their firſt departure.</p>
            <p>They had been prompted to undertake this expedition by the falſe accounts brought by Mogg, an Indian of Penobſcot, who had come in to Paſcataqua, with a propoſal of peace; and had reported that an hundred Indians were aſſembled at Oſſapy. This Indian brought with him two men of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:018344_0155_0FA5D4E3E97937D0"/>
Portſmouth, Fryer and Kendal, who had been taken on board a veſſel at the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; he was deputed by the Penobſcot tribe to conſent to articles of pacification; and being ſent to Boſton, a treaty was drawn and ſubſcribed by the governor and magiſtrates on the one part, and by Mogg on the other; in which it was ſtipulated, that if the Indians of the other tribes did not agree to this tranſaction, and ceaſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities, they ſhould be deemed and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as enemies by both parties. This treaty was ſigned on the ſixth of November; Mogg pledging his life for the fulfilment of it. Accordingly, veſſels being ſent to Penobſcot, the peace was ratified by Mado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kawando the ſachem, and two captives were reſtored. But Mogg, being incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly permitted to go to a neighbouring tribe, on pretence of perſuading them to deliver their captives, though he promiſed to return in three days, was ſeen no more. It was at firſt thought that he had been ſacrificed by his countrymen, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fear when he left the veſſels;<note place="margin">1677.</note> but a captive who eſcaped in January gave a different account of him; that he boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having deceived the Engliſh, and laughed at their kind entertainment of him. There was alſo a deſign talked of among
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:018344_0156_0FA5D4E49E01EE38"/>
them to break the peace in the ſpring, and join with the other Indians at the eaſtward in ruining the fiſhery. About the ſame time it was diſcovered that ſome of the Narrhaganſet Indians were ſcattered in the eaſtern parts; three of them having been decoyed by ſome of the Cochecho Indians into their wigwams, and ſcalped, were known by the cut of their hair. This raiſed a fear in the minds of the people, that more of them might have found their way to the eaſtward, and would proſecute their revenge againſt them.</p>
            <p>From theſe circumſtances it was ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the truce would be but of ſhort continuance. The treachery of Mogg, who was ſurety for the performance of the treaty, was deemed a full juſtification of the renewal of hoſtilities; and the ſtate of things was, by ſome gentlemen of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua, repreſented to be ſo dangerous, that the government determined upon a winter expedition. Two hundred men, including ſixty Natick Indians, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted and equipped, and ſailed from Boſton the firſt week in February, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Major Waldron; a day of prayer having been previouſly appointed for the ſucceſs of the enterprize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="unknown:018344_0157_0FA5D4E55F321968"/>At Caſco the major had a fruitleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and a ſlight ſkirmiſh with a few Indians, of whom ſome were killed and wounded. At Kennebeck he built a fort, and left a garriſon of forty men, under the command of Captain Sylvanus Davis. At Pemaquid he had a conference with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Indians, who promiſed to deliver their captives on the payment of a ranſom: Part of it being paid, three captives were delivered, and it was agreed that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be renewed in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and all arms be laid aſide. Some ſuſpicion of their infidelity had ariſen, and when the major went aſhore in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon with five men, and the remainder of the ranſom, he diſcovered the point of a lance hid under a board, which he drew out and advanced with it toward them; charging them with treachery in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their arms ſo near. They attempted to take it from him by force; but he threatened them with inſtant death, and waved his cap for a ſignal to the veſſels. While the reſt were coming on ſhore, the major with his five men ſecured the goods: Some of the Indians ſnatching up a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of guns which they had hid, ran away: Captain Froſt, who was one of the five, ſeized an Indian, who was well known to
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:018344_0158_0FA5D4E612C52530"/>
be a rogue, and with Lieutenant Nutter, carried him on board. The major ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about found three guns, with which he armed his remaining three men; and the reſt being come on ſhore by this time, they purſued the Indians, killed ſeveral of them before they could recover their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, and after they had puſhed off, ſunk one with five men, who were drowned; and took four priſoners, with about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds of dried beef, and ſome other plunder. The whole number of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians was twenty-five.</p>
            <p>Whether the caſual diſcovery of their arms, which they had agreed to lay aſide, was ſufficient to juſtify this ſeverity, may be doubted; ſince, if their intentions had really been hoſtile, they had a fine oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ambuſhing or ſeizing the major and his five attendants, who came aſhore unarmed; and it is not likely that they would have waited for the reſt to come aſhore before they opened the plot. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, this ſudden ſuſpicion might be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and might inflame the prejudice againſt the major, which had been already excited by the ſeizure of their friends at Cochecho ſome time before.</p>
            <p>On the return of the forces, they found ſome wheat, guns, anchors and boards at
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:018344_0159_0FA5D4E87AD96248"/>
Kennebeck, which they took with them. They killed two Indians on Arrowſick Iſland, who, with one of the priſoners taken at Pemaquid, and ſhot on board, made the number of Indians killed in this expedition thirteen. They returned to Boſton on the eleventh of March, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loſs of a man, bringing with them the bones of Captain Lake, which they found entire in the place where he was killed<note n="*" place="bottom">Here ends Hubbard's printed narrative. The account of the remainder of this war is taken from his MS hiſtory, from ſundry original letters, and copies of letters, and from a MS journal found in Prince's collection, and ſuppoſed to have been written by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lawrence Hammond of Charleſtown.</note>.</p>
            <p>There being no proſpect of peace at the eaſtward, it became neceſſary to maintain great circumſpection and reſolution, and to make uſe of every poſſible advantage againſt the enemy. A long and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate animoſity had ſubſiſted between the Mohawks and the eaſtern Indians, the original of which is not mentioned, and perhaps was not known by any of our hiſtorians; nor can the oldeſt men among the Mohawks at this day give any account of it. Theſe Indians were in a ſtate of friendſhip with their Engliſh neighbours; and being a fierce and formidable race of men, their name carried terror wherever
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:018344_0160_0FA5D4E9413835C8"/>
it was known. It was now thought, that if they could be induced to proſecute their ancient quarrel with the eaſtern Indians, the latter might be awed into peace, or incapacitated for any farther miſchief. The propriety of this meaſure became a ſubject of debate; ſome queſtioning the lawfulneſs of making uſe of their help, "as they were heathen;" but it was urged in reply, that Abraham had entered into a confederacy with the Amorites,<note place="margin">Geneſis, ch. 14.</note> among whom he dwelled, and made uſe of their aſſiſtance in recovering his kinſman Lot from the hands of their common enemy. With this argument the objectors were ſatisfied; and the two meſſengers, Major Pynchon of Springfield, and Richards of Hartford were diſpatched to the country of the Mohawks; who treated them with great civility, expreſſed the moſt bitter hatred againſt the eaſtern enemy,<note place="margin">Hubbard's MS Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> and promiſed to purſue the quarrel to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power.</p>
            <p>Accordingly ſome parties of them came down the country about the middle of March, and the firſt alarm was given at Amuſkeeg falls; where the ſon of Wono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanſet being hunting, diſcovered fifteen Indians on the other ſide, who called to him in a language which he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:018344_0161_0FA5D4E9DB914810"/>
upon which he ſled, while they fired near thirty guns at him without effect. Preſently after this they were diſcovered in the woods about Cochecho. Major Waldron ſent out eight of his Indians whereof Blind Will was one, for farther information. They were all ſurprized to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a company of the Mohawks;<note place="margin">MS Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, March 30.</note> two or three eſcaped, the others were either killed or taken: Will was dragged away by his hair; and being wounded, periſhed in the woods, on a neck of land, formed by the confluence of Cochecho and Iſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs rivers, which ſtill bears the name of Blind Will's Neck. This fellow was judged to be a ſecret enemy to the Engliſh, though he pretended much friendſhip and reſpect; ſo that it was impoſſible to have puniſhed him, without provoking the other neighbouring Indians, with whom he lived in amity, and of whoſe fidelity there was no ſuſpicion.<note place="margin">Hubbard's MS Hiſt.</note> It was at firſt thought a fortunate circumſtance that he was killed in this manner; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence proved it to be otherwiſe; for two of thoſe who were taken with him eſcaping, reported that the Mohawks threatened deſtruction to all the Indians in theſe parts without diſtinction:<note place="margin">MS Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> So that thoſe who lived in ſubjection to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:018344_0162_0FA5D4EA9B57C568"/>
grew jealous of their ſincerity, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, not without very plauſible ground, that the Mohawks had been perſuaded or hired to engage in the war, on purpoſe to deſtroy them; ſince they never actually exerciſed their fury upon thoſe Indians who were in hoſtility with the Engliſh, but only upon thoſe who were in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them; and this only in ſuch a degree as to irritate, rather than to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or diſtreſs them. It cannot therefore be thought ſtrange that the friendly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were alienated from their Engliſh neighbours, and diſpoſed to liſten to the ſeducing ſtratagems of the French; who in a few years after made uſe of them, in conjunction with others, ſorely to ſcourge theſe unhappy people. The Engliſh, in reality, had no ſuch deſign; but the event proved, that the ſcheme of engaging the Mohawks in our quarrel, however lawful in itſelf, and countenanced by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Abraham, was a pernicious ſource of innumerable calamities.</p>
            <p>The terror which it was thought this incurſion of the Mohawks would ſtrike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eaſtern Indians was too ſmall to prevent their renewing hoſtilities very early in the ſpring. Some of the garriſon who had been left at Kennebeck were ſurprized

by an ambuſh, as they were attempting to bury the dead bodies of their friends, who had been killed the ſummer before, and had lain under the ſnow all winter.<note place="margin">Hubbard's MS.</note> The remainder of that garriſon were then taken off and conveyed to Paſcataqua; whither a company of fifty men and ten Natick Indians marched, under Captain Swaine, to ſuccour the inhabitants, who were alarmed by ſcattered parties of the enemy, killing and taking people, and burning houſes in Wells, Kittery, and within the bounds of Portſmouth<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>More miſchief being expected, and the eaſtern ſettlements needing aſſiſtance, the government ordered two hundred Indians of Natick, with forty Engliſh ſoldiers, under Captain Benjamin Swett of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Lieutenant Richardſon, to march to the falls of Taconick on Kennebeck river; where it was ſaid the Indians had

Swett divided his men accordingly, and went to meet them. The enemy retreated till they had drawn our people two miles from the fort and then turning ſuddenly and violently upon them, threw them into confuſion, they being moſtly young and unexperienced ſoldiers. Swett, with a few of the more reſolute, fought bravely on the retreat, till he came near the fort, when he was killed;<note place="margin">MS Letter of Mr. Gookin of Hampton.</note> ſixty more were left dead or wounded, and the reſt got into the fort.

They continued quiet all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding autumn and winter, and lived in harmony with the new garriſon.</p>

               <note place="margin">1678.</note>In the ſpring, Major Shapleigh of Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Captain Champernoon and Mr. Fryer of Portſmouth, were appointed commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to ſettle a formal treaty of peace with Squando and the other chiefs,<note place="margin">MS Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, April 12.</note> which was done at Caſco, whither they brought the remainder of the captives. It was ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in the treaty, that the inhabitants ſhould return to their deſerted ſettlements, on condition of paying one peck of corn annually for each family, by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to the Indians for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their lands, and one buſhel for Major Pendleton, who was a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor. Thus an end was put to a tedious and diſtreſſing war, which had ſubſiſted three years. The terms of peace were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:018344_0167_0FA5D4EF35A6A268"/>
but not unjuſt, conſidering the former irregular conduct of many of the eaſtern ſettlers, and the native propriety of the Indians in the ſoil: Certainly they were now maſters of it; and it was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their option, whether the Engliſh ſhould return to their habitations or not. It was therefore thought better to live peaceably, though in a ſort of ſubjection, than to leave ſuch commodious ſettlements and forego the advantages of trade and fiſhery, which were very conſiderable, and by which the inhabitants of that part of the country had chiefly ſubſiſted.</p>
            <p>It was a matter of great enquiry and ſpeculation how the Indians were ſupplied with arms and ammunition to carry on this war.<note place="margin">Hubbard's printed Narrative, p. 82.</note> The Dutch at New-York were too near the Mohawks for the eaſtern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to adventure thither. The French in Canada were too feeble, and too much in fear of the Engliſh, to do any thing which might diſturb the tranquility; and there was peace between the two nations. It was therefore ſuppoſed that the Indians had long premeditated the war, and laid in a ſtock beforehand. There had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſevere penalties exacted by the government, on the ſelling of arms and ammunition to the Indians; but ever

This indulgence, having been much abuſed by ſome of the eaſtern traders, who, far from the ſeat of government,<note place="margin">Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph's Narrative in Hutch. col. papers, p. 492.</note> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the reſtraint of law, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the ſource of the miſchief.

            <p>The whole burden and expence of this war, on the part of the colonies, were borne by themſelves.

and their ſilence was conſtrued to their diſadvantage, as if they were proud, and obſtinate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be conſidered as an independent ſtate. They had indeed no inclination to aſk favours from thence; being well aware of the conſequence of laying themſelves under obligations to thoſe who had been ſeeking to undermine their eſtabliſhment; and remembering how they had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected in the late Dutch wars, when they ſtood in much greater need of aſſiſtance: The king had then ſent ammunition to New-York, but had ſent word to New-England,<note place="margin">Hutch. col. pap. p. 506.</note>
               <q>that they muſt ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and make the beſt defence they could.</q>
It was therefore highly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to blame them for not making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for help. But if they had not been ſo ill treated, they could not be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſreſpect, ſince they really did not need foreign aſſiſtance. Ships of war and regular troops muſt have been altogether uſeleſs; and no one that knew the nature of an Indian war could be ſerious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to ſend them. Ammunition and money were neceſſary, but as they had long enjoyed a free trade, and had coined the bullion which they imported, there was no ſcarcity of money, nor of any ſtores
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018344_0170_0FA5D4F4070D2530"/>
which money could purchaſe. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of fighting with Indians could be learned only from themſelves: After a little experience, few men in ſcattered parties were of more ſervice than the largeſt and beſt equipped armies which Europe could have afforded. It ought ever to be remembered for the honor of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that as their firſt ſettlement, ſo their preſervation, increaſe, and defence, even in their weakeſt infancy were not owing to any foreign aſſiſtance, but under God, to their own magnanimity and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Our graveſt hiſtorians have recorded many omens, predictions, and other alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, during this and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod war, which in a more philoſophical and leſs credulous age would not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice. When men's minds were rendered gloomy by the horrors of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding wilderneſs, and the continual apprehenſion of danger from its ſavage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; when they were ignorant of the cauſes of many of the common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in nature, and were diſpoſed to reſolve every unuſual appearance into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy and miracle, it is not to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſhould imagine they heard the noiſe of drums and guns in the air,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:018344_0171_0FA5D4F4571B0A00"/>
and ſaw flaming ſwords and ſpears in the heavens, and ſhould even interpret eclipſes as ominous. Some old Indians had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated their apprehenſions concerning the increaſe of the Engliſh, and the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own people, which any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal obſerver in a courſe of forty or fifty years might eaſily have foretold, without the leaſt pretence to a ſpirit of prophecy; yet theſe ſayings were recollected, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, as ſo many predictions by force of a ſupernatural impulſe on their minds, and many perſons of the greateſt diſtinction were diſpoſed to credit them as ſuch. Theſe things would not have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but to give a juſt idea of the age: If mankind are now better enlightened, ſuperſtition is the leſs excuſeable in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining votaries.</p>

               <note place="margin">1675.</note>WHILE the country was labouring under the perplexity and diſtreſs ariſing from the war, meaſures were taking in England to increaſe their difficulties and divide their attention. The ſcheme of ſelling the provinces of New-Hampſhire and Maine to the crown being laid aſide, Maſon again petitioned the king for the reſtoration of his property; and the king referred the matter to his attorney general Sir William Jones, and his ſolicitor general Sir Francis Winnington, who reported that <q>John Maſon,<note place="margin">May 17.</note> eſq. grandfather to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, by virtue of ſeveral grants from the council of New-England under their common ſeal was inſtated in fee in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry great tracts of land in New-England, by the name of New-Hampſhire;<note place="margin">MS Copy in Superior Court files.</note> and that the petitioner being heir at law to the ſaid John had a good and legal title

to ſaid lands.<note place="margin">1676.</note>
               </q>
Whereupon a letter was diſpatched to the Maſſachuſetts colony,<note place="margin">March 10.</note> requiring them to ſend over agents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix months, fully impowered to anſwer the complaints, which Maſon and the heirs of Gorges had made, of their uſurping juriſdiction over the territories claimed by them; and to receive the royal determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in that matter. Copies of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were incloſed; and Edward Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph, a kinſman of Maſon, a man of great addreſs and penetration, reſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable in buſineſs, was charged with the letters, and directed by the Lords of Trade to make enquiry into the ſtate of the country. When he arrived,<note place="margin">June 10.</note> he waited on Governor Leverett, who read the king's letter with the petitions of Maſon and Gorges in council, Randolph being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,<note place="margin">Hutchin. col. pap. p. 504.</note> who could obtain no other anſwer than that "they would conſider it."</p>
            <p>He then came into New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">July.</note> and as he paſſed along, freely declared the buſineſs on which he was come, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly read a letter which Maſon had ſent to the inhabitants. Some of them he found ready to complain of the government, and deſirous of a change; but the body of the people were highly enraged againſt him; and the inhabitants of Dover in public

town-meeting <q>proteſted againſt the claim of Maſon; declared that they had bonâ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide purchaſed their lands of the Indians; recognized their ſubjection to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Maſſachuſetts, under whom they had lived long and happily, and by whom they were now aſſiſted in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eſtates and families againſt the ſavage enemy.</q>
They appointed Major Waldron <q>to petition the king in their behalf, that he would interpoſe his royal authority and afford them his wonted favor; that they might not be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Maſon, or any other perſon, but continue peaceably in poſſeſſion of their rights under the government of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts.<note place="margin">Dover Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</note>
               </q>
A ſimilar petition was ſent by the inhabitants of Portſmouth,<note place="margin">Portſmou. Records, Sept. 1.</note> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed John Cutts and Richard Martyn, eſqrs. Captains Daniel and Stileman to draught and forward it.</p>
            <p>When Randolph returned to Boſton, he had a ſevere reproof from the governor, for publiſhing his errand, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe diſcontent among the people. To which he made no other anſwer than that <q>if he had done amiſs,<note place="margin">Hutchin. col. pap. p. 510.</note> they might complain to the king.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After about ſix weeks ſlay, he went back to England and reported to the king, that <q>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:018344_0175_0FA5D4F771FEF340"/>he had found the whole country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the uſurpation of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of Boſton; earneſtly hoping and expecting that his majeſty would not permit them any longer to be oppreſſed; but would give them relief according to the promiſes of the commiſſioners in 1665.</q>
With the ſame bitterneſs of temper, and in the ſame ſtrain of miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, he inveighed againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in a long report to the Lords of Trade; which farther inflamed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that had long been conceived againſt the colony, and prepared the way for the ſeparation which was meditated.</p>
            <p>After his departure, a ſpecial council being ſummoned, at which the elders of the churches were preſent, the queſtion was propoſed to them <q>whether the beſt way of making anſwer to the complaints of Gorges and Maſon about the extent of their patent, be by ſending agents, or by writing only?</q>
To which they anſwered, <q>That it was moſt expedient to ſend agents, to anſwer by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, provided they were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much care and caution to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the affair with ſafety to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and loyalty to his majeſty, in the preſervation of their patent liberties.</q>
               <pb n="168" facs="unknown:018344_0176_0FA5D4F81A0F18C8"/>
Accordingly William Stoughton, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lieutenant-governor, and Peter Bulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley then ſpeaker of the houſe of deputies,<note place="margin">Hotel in. Hiſt. vol. 1. p. 311.</note> were appointed agents and ſailed for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1677.</note>At their arrival an hearing was ordered before the lords chief juſtices of the king's bench and common pleas; when the agents in the name of the colony diſclaimed all title to the lands claimed by the petitioner,<note place="margin">Narrative of Allen's Title, p. 5.</note> and to the juriſdiction beyond three miles northward of the river Merrimack, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the courſe of the river, ſo far as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The judges reported to the king <q>that they could give no opinion as to the right of ſoil, in the provinces of New-Hampſhire and Maine, not having the proper parties before them; it appearing that not the Maſſachuſetts colony, but the ter-tenants had the right of ſoil, and whole benefit thereof, and yet were not ſummoned to defend their titles. As to Maſon's right of government within the ſoil he claimed, their lordſhips, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his own counſel, agreed he had none; the great council of Plymouth, under whom he claimed, having no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to transfer government to any. It was determined that the four towns of Portſmouth,<note place="margin">Hutchin. vol. 1. p. 317.</note> Dover, Exeter and Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:018344_0177_0FA5D4FBE7637348"/>
were out of the bounds of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts.</q>
This report was accepted and confirmed by the king in council.</p>
            <p>After this, at the requeſt of the agents,<note place="margin">1679.</note> Sir William Jones the attorney general drew up a complete ſtate of the caſe to be tranſmitted to the colony;<note place="margin">Sept. 18.</note> by which it ſeems that he had altered his opinion ſince the report which he gave to the king in 1675,<note place="margin">Hutch. vol. 1. p. 317.</note> concerning the validity of Maſon's title. It was alſo admitted that the title could be tried only on the place, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no court in England that had cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of it.</p>
            <p>It became neceſſary then to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Maſon's title, that a new juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſhould be erected, in which the king might direct the mode of trial and appeal at his pleaſure: This being reſolved upon, the colony of Maſſachuſetts was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,<note place="margin">July 24.</note> by a letter from the ſecretary of ſtate, of the king's intention to ſeparate New-Hampſhire from their government,<note place="margin">Hutchin. col. pap. 522.</note> and required to revoke all commiſſions which they had granted there, and which were hereby declared to be null and void. To prevent any extravagant demand, the king obliged the claimant to declare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand and ſeal, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no rents of the inhabitants for the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:018344_0178_0FA5D4FCAACABA28"/>
time paſſed, before the twenty fourth of June 1679, nor moleſt any in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions for the time to come; but would make out titles to them and their heirs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, provided they would pay him ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the pound, according to the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value of all houſes which they had built and lands which they had improved.</p>
            <p>Things being thus prepared,<note place="margin">Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion paſſed the great ſeal on the eighteenth of September for the government of New-Hampſhire; which <q>inhibits and reſtrains the juriſdiction exerciſed by the colony of Maſſachuſetts over the towns of Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Dover, Exeter and Hampton, and all other lands extending from three miles to the northward of the river Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimack and of any and every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the province of Maine; conſtitutes a preſident and council to govern the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; appoints John Cutts, eſq. preſident, to continue one year and till another be appointed by the ſame authority; Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Martyn, William Vaughan, and Thomas Daniel of Portſmouth, John Gilman of Exeter, Chriſtopher Huſſey of Hampton and Richard Waldron of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, eſquires, to be of the council, who were authoriſed to chooſe three other qualified perſons out of the ſeveral parts of the

province to be added to them. The ſaid preſident and every ſucceeding one to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a deputy to preſide in his abſence; the preſident or his deputy with any five to be a quorum. They were to meet at Portſmouth in twenty days after the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the commiſſion and publiſh it. They were conſtituted a court of record for the adminiſtration of juſtice, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of England, ſo far as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would permit; reſerving a right of appeal to the king in council for actions of fifty pounds value. They were impowered to appoint military offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and take all needful meaſures for defence againſt enemies. Liberty of conſcience was allowed to all proteſtants, thoſe of the church of England to be particularly encouraged. For the ſupport of government they were to continue the preſent taxes, till an aſſembly could be called; to which end they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three months to iſſue writs under the province ſeal, for calling an aſſembly, to whom the preſident ſhould recommend the paſſing ſuch laws as ſhould eſtabliſh their allegiance, good order and defence, and the raiſing taxes in ſuch manner and proportion as they ſhould ſee ſit.

In caſe of the preſident's death, his deputy to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and on the death of a counſellor, the remainder to elect another, and ſend over his name, with the names of two other meet perſons, that the king might appoint one of the three.

If any of the inhabitants ſhould refuſe to agree with Maſon or his agents, on the terms before mentioned, the preſident and council were directed to reconcile the difference, or ſend the caſe ſtated in writing with their own opinions, to the king, that he with his privy council might determine it according to equity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The form of government deſcribed in this commiſſion conſidered abſtractedly from the immediate intentions, characters, and connexions of the perſons concerned, appears to be of as ſimple a kind as the nature of a ſubordinate government and the liberty of the ſubject can admit. The
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:018344_0181_0FA5D4FF2D595060"/>
people, who are the natural and original ſource of power, had a repreſentation in a body choſen by themſelves; and the king was repreſented by a preſident and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of his own appointment; each had the right of inſtructing their repreſentative, and the king had the ſuperior prerogative of diſannulling the acts of the whole at his pleaſure. The principal blemiſh in the commiſſion was the right claimed by the king of diſcontinuing the repreſentation of the people, whenever he ſhould find it inconvenient, after he had ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to continue this privilege. The clauſe, indeed, is artfully worded, and might be conſtrued to imply more or leſs at pleaſure. Herein Charles was conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with himſelf, parliaments being his averſion. However, there was in this plan as much of the ſpirit of the Britiſh conſtitution as there could be any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for in ſuch a colony; for here was no third branch to form a balance between the king or his repreſentative, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The inſtitution of an houſe of peers in Britain was the reſult of the feudal ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem: the barons being lords of the ſoil and enjoying a ſovereignty within their own territories and over their own vaſſals; the conſtitution was formed by the union
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:018344_0182_0FA5D4FF95329320"/>
of theſe diſtinct eſtates under one common ſovereign. But there was nothing ſimilar to this in New-England. The ſettlements began here by an equal diviſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty among independent freemen.

A council, whether appointed by him or choſen by the people could not form a diſtinct body, becauſe they could not be independent. Had ſuch a ſimple form of colony government been more generally adopted, and perſevering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhered to, and adminiſtered only by the moſt delicate hands, it might have ſerved better than any other, to perpetuate the dependence of the colonies on the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh crown.</p>

The other penal laws were in their main principles the ſame that are now in force. To prevent conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that might ariſe by reaſon of the late change of government, all townſhips and grants of land were confirmed, and ordered to remain as before; and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about the titles of land were to be determined by juries choſen by the ſeveral towns, according to former cuſtom. The preſident and council with the aſſembly were a ſupreme court of judicature, with a jury when deſired by the parties; and three inferior courts were conſtituted at Dover, Hampton and Portſmouth.

            <p>During this adminiſtration, things went on as nearly as poſſible in the old channel,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:018344_0188_0FA5D5066329D4C0"/>
and with the ſame ſpirit, as before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. A jealous watch was kept over their rights and privileges, and every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon them was withſtood to the utmoſt. The duties and reſtrictions eſtabliſhed by the acts of trade and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation were univerſally diſguſtful, and the more ſo as Randolph was appointed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, ſurveyor and ſearcher of the cuſtoms throughout New-England. In the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his commiſſion he ſeized a ketch belonging to Portſmouth, but bound from Maryland to Ireland, which had put into this port for a few days. The maſter Mark Hunking,<note place="margin">March 23.</note> brought an action againſt him at a ſpecial court before the preſident and council, and recovered damages and coſts to the amount of thirteen pounds. Randolph behaved on this occaſion with ſuch inſolence, that the council obliged him publickly to acknowledge his offence and aſk their pardon.<note place="margin">Council Records &amp; Files.</note> He appealed from their judgment to the king; but what the iſſue was doth not appear. Having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Captain Walter Barefoote his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty at this port, an advertiſement was publiſhed requiring that all veſſels ſhould be entered and cleared with him.

preſident and council, for <q>having in an high and preſumptuous manner ſet up his majeſty's office of cuſtoms without leave from the preſident and council;<note place="margin">March 25.</note> in contempt of his majeſty's authority in this place; for diſturbing and obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his majeſty's ſubjects in paſſing from harbour to harbour, and town to town; and for his inſolence in making no other anſwer to any queſtion propounded to him but "my name is Walter."</q>
He was ſentenced to pay a fine of ten pounds, and ſtand committed till it was paid. But though Randolph's authority was denied, yet they made an order of their own for the obſervation of the acts of trade, and appointed officers of their own to ſee them executed. They had been long under the Maſſachuſetts government, and learned their political principles from them; and as they had been uſed to think that all royal authority flowed in the channel of the charter, ſo they now thought that no authority derived from the crown could be regularly exerciſed in the province but through their commiſſion. In this they reaſoned agreeably not only to their former principles, but to their fundamental law, to which they ſteadily adhered, though they had no reaſon to think it would be
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:018344_0190_0FA5D507D63D1998"/>
allowed by the crown; and though they knew that a rigid adherence to rights, however clear and ſacred, was not the way to recommend themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>In the latter end of the year Maſon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from England with a mandamus,<note place="margin">Dec. 30.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the council to admit him to a feat at the board,<note place="margin">1681.</note> which was accordingly done. He ſoon entered on the buſineſs he came about; endeavouring to perſuade ſome of the people to take leaſes of him, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others if they did not, forbidding them to cut fire-wood and timber, aſſerting his right to the province and aſſuming the title of lord-proprietor. His agents, or ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards as they were called, had rendered themſelves obnoxious by demanding rents of ſeveral perſons and threatening to ſell their houſes for payment. Theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings raiſed a general uneaſineſs; and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions were ſent from each town, as well as from divers individuals, to the council
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:018344_0191_0FA5D508B28205F0"/>
for protection; who taking up the matter judicially publiſhed an order prohibiting Maſon or his agents at their peril to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat ſuch irregular proceedings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their intention to tranſmit the grievances and complaints of the people to the king. Upon this, Maſon would no longer ſit in council, though deſired, nor appear when ſent for; when they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to deal with him as an offender, he threatened to appeal to the king, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a ſummons to the preſident and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral members of the council, and others to appear before his majeſty in three months. This was deemed <q>an uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over his majeſty's authority here eſtabliſhed,</q>
and a warrant was iſſued for apprehending him; but he got out of their reach and went to England.</p>
            <p>During theſe tranſactions preſident Cutts died,<note place="margin">March 27. April 5.</note> and Major Waldron ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, appointing Captain Stileman for his deputy, who had quitted his place of ſecretary upon the appointment of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Chamberlayne to that office by royal commiſſion.<note place="margin">Dec. 30. 1680.</note> The vacancy made in the council by the preſident's death was filled by Richard Waldron junior.

            <p>During the remainder of the council's adminiſtration,<note place="margin">1682.</note> the common buſineſs went on in the uſual manner, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is mentioned, excepting another proſecution of Barefoote, with his aſſiſtants,<note place="margin">March 10.</note> William Haſkins and Thomas Thurton for ſeizing a veſſel <q>under pretence of his majeſty's name, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the authority of the province, and without ſhewing any breach of ſtatute though demanded.</q>
Barefoote pleaded his deputation from Randolph; but he was amerced twenty pounds to be reſpited during his good behaviour, and his two aſſiſtants five pounds each; the complainant being left to the law for his damages. This affair was carried by appeal to the king; but the iſſue is not mentioned.</p>
            <p>It will be proper to cloſe the account of this adminiſtration with a view of the ſtate of the province as to its trade, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and defence, from a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation thereof made by the council to the lords of trade, purſuant to their order.</p>
            <p>"The trade of the province, (ſay they) is in maſts, planks, boards and ſtaves and all other lumber, which at preſent is of

            <p>"Importation by ſtrangers is of little value; ſhips commonly ſelling their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes in other governments, and if they come here, uſually come empty to fill with lumber: but if haply they are at any time loaded with fiſh, it is brought from other ports, there being none made in our province, nor likely to be, until his majeſty pleaſe to make the ſouth part of the Iſles of Shoals part of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they not being at preſent under any<note n="*" place="bottom">When theſe iſlands were firſt ſettled is uncertain, but it muſt have been very early, as they are moſt commodiouſly ſituated for the fiſhery, which was a principal object with the firſt ſettlers.

[Maſſ Rec.] They are not named in Cutts's nor Cranfield's commiſſion; but under Dudley's preſidency, cauſes were brought from thence to Portſmouth, which is ſaid to be in the ſame country. In Allen's and all ſucceeding commiſſions, they are particularly mentioned; the ſouth half of them being in New-Hampſhire.</note>.</p>
            <p>In reference to the improvement of lands by tillage, our ſoil is generally ſo barren, and the winters ſo extreme cold and long that there is not proviſion enough raiſed to ſupply the inhabitants, many of whom were in the late Indian war ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed,

               <note place="margin">1682.</note>EXPERIENCE having now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Maſon, that the government which he had procured to be erected, was not likely to be adminiſtered in a manner favourable to his views, he made it his buſineſs, on his return to England, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit a change; in conſequence of which it was determined to commiſſion Edward Cranfield, eſq. lieutenant-governor and commander in chief of New-Hampſhire. By a deed enrolled in the court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,<note place="margin">Jan. 25,</note> Maſon ſurrendered to the king one fifth part of the quit-rents, which had or ſhould become due: Theſe with the fines and forfeitures which had accrued to the crown ſince the eſtabliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and which ſhould afterward ariſe, were appropriated to the ſupport of the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:018344_0197_0FA5D50F6741C630"/>
governor. But this being deemed too precarious a foundation, Maſon by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deed mortgaged the whole province to Cranfield, for twenty-one years,<note place="margin">MSS in the files.</note> as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the payment of one hundred and fifty pounds per annum, for the ſpace of ſeven years. On this encouragement Cranfield relinquiſhed a profitable office at home,<note place="margin">Fitch's MS.</note> with the view of bettering his fortune here.</p>
            <p>By the commiſſion, which bears date the ninth of May, the governor was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to call, adjourn, prorogue and diſſolve general courts; to have a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice in all acts of government; to ſuſpend any of the council when he ſhould ſee juſt cauſe (and every counſellor ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended was declared incapable of being elected into the general aſſembly;) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a deputy-governor, judges, juſtices, and other officers, by his ſole authority; and to execute the powers of vice-admiral. The caſe of Maſon was recited nearly in the ſame words as in the former commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the ſame directions were given to the governor to reconcile differences, or ſend caſes fairly ſtated to the king in council, for his deciſion. The counſellors named in this commiſſion were Maſon, who is ſtyled proprietor, Waldron, Daniel,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:018344_0198_0FA5D51018ADBBD8"/>
Vaughan, Martyn, Gilman, Stileman and Clements: Theſe were of the former council, and to them were added Walter Barefoote and Richard Chamberlayne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Council Records.</note>Cranfield arrived and publiſhed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion on the fourth of October, and within ſix days Waldron and Martyn were ſuſpended from the council, on certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles exhibited againſt them by Maſon. This early ſpecimen of the exerciſe of power muſt have been intended as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affront to them, in revenge for their former ſpirited conduct; otherwiſe their names might have been left out of the commiſſion when it was drawn.</p>
            <p>The people now plainly ſaw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deſigns formed againſt them. The negative voice of a governor, his right of ſuſpending counſellors, and appointing officers, by his own authority, were wholly unprecedented in New-England; and they had the ſingular mortification to ſee the crown not only appointing two branches of their legiſlature, but claiming a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on the election of their repreſentatives, in a particular caſe, which might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be eſſentially neceſſary to their own ſecurity. They well knew that the ſole deſign of theſe novel and extraordinary powers was to facilitate the entry of the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:018344_0199_0FA5D510DAD91BA0"/>
claimant on the lands which ſome of them held by virtue of grants from the ſame authority, and which had all been fairly purchaſed of the Indians; a right which they believed to be of more validity than any other. Having by their own labour and expence ſubdued a rough wilderneſs, defended their families and eſtates againſt the ſavage enemy, without the leaſt aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the claimant, and held poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for above fifty years; they now thought it hard and cruel, that when they had juſt recovered from the horrors of a bloody war, they ſhould have their liberty abridged, and their property demanded, to ſatisfy a claim which was at beſt diſputable, and in their opinion groundleſs.

            <p>An aſſembly, being ſummoned, met on the fourteenth of November; with whoſe concurrence a new body of laws was enacted, in ſome reſpects different from the former; the fundamental law being omitted and an alteration made in the appointment of jurors,<note place="margin">MS Laws.</note> which was now ordered to be done by the ſheriff, after the cuſtom in England.</p>

            <p>The diſſolution of the Aſſembly, a thing before unknown, aggravated the popular diſcontent, and kindled the reſentment of ſome raſh perſons in Hampton and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; who, headed by Edward Gove, a member of the diſſolved aſſembly, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſound of trumpet for <q>liberty and reformation.</q>
There had been a town meeting at Hampton, when a new clerk was choſen and their records ſecured. Gove went from town to town proclaiming what had been done at Hampton, carrying his
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:018344_0202_0FA5D3E768024770"/>
arms, declaring that the governor was a traitor and had exceeded his commiſſion, and that he would not lay down his arms till matters were ſet right, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to excite the principal men in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to join in a confederacy to overturn the government. His project appeared to them ſo wild and dangerous, that they not only diſapproved it, but informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and aſſiſted in apprehending him. Hearing of their deſign, he collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his company, and appeared in arms; but on the perſuaſion of ſome of his friends he ſurrendered. A ſpecial court was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately commiſſioned for his trial, of which Major Waldron ſat as judge, with William Vaughan and Thomas Daniel aſſiſtants. The grand jury preſented a bill in which Edward Gove, John Gove, his ſon, and William Hely, of Hampton; Joſeph, John and Robert Wadleigh, three brothers, Thomas Rawlins, Mark Baker and John Sleeper, of Exeter, were charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with high-treaſon. Gove, who behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great inſolence before the court, and pretended to juſtify what he had done, was convicted and received ſentence of death in the uſual hideous form;<note place="margin">Feb. 1.</note> and his eſtate was ſeized,<note place="margin">Records of Special Courts.</note> as forfeited to the crown. The others were convicted of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:018344_0203_0FA5D3E8C7690C88"/>
and reſpited. The king's pleaſure being ſignified to the governor that he ſhould pardon ſuch as he judged objects of mercy; they were all ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty but Gove, who was ſent to England, and impriſoned in the tower of London about three years. On his repeated peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the king, and by the intereſt of Randolph with the Earl of Clarendon, then lord chamberlain, he obtained his pardon and returned home in 1686, with an order to the then preſident and council of New-England to reſtore his eſtate.</p>
            <p>Gove in his petitions to the king plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "a diſtemper of mind" as the cauſe of thoſe actions for which he was proſecuted.<note place="margin">Gove's Papers.</note> He alſo ſpeaks in ſome of his private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a drinking match at his houſe, and that he had not ſlept for twelve days and nights, about that time. When theſe things are conſidered, it is not hard to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his conduct. From a letter which he wrote to the court while in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">MS in files.</note> one would ſuppoſe him to have been diſordered in his mind. His puniſhment was by much too ſevere, and his trial was hurried on too faſt, it being only ſix days after the commiſſion of his crime. Had he been indicted only for a riot there would have been no difficulty in the proof, nor
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:018344_0204_0FA5D3E9567972D0"/>
hardſhip in inflicting the legal penalty. Waldron, it is ſaid, ſhed tears when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the ſentence of death upon him.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth of February the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, by advertiſement, called upon the inhabitants to take out leaſes from Maſon within one month, otherwiſe he muſt, purſuant to his inſtructions, certify the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to the king, that Maſon might be diſcharged of his obligation to grant them. Upon this ſummons and within the time ſet, Major Waldron, John Wingett and Thomas Roberts, three of the principal landholders in Dover, waited on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to know his pleaſure, who directed them to agree with Maſon. They then retired into another room where Maſon was, and propoſed to refer the matter to the governor, that he might according to his commiſſion, ſtate the matter to the king for his deciſion. This propoſal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rejected, ſaying that unleſs they would own his title, he would have nothing to do with them.<note place="margin">Weare's MS.</note> While they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> courſe the governor came in and deſired them to depart.</p>
            <p>This piece of conduct is difficult to be accounted for, it being directly in the face of the commiſſion. Had the method there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in preſcribed, and by theſe men propoſed,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:018344_0205_0FA5D3EA174BD630"/>
been adopted, it was natural to expect that the king, who had all along favoured Maſon's pretenſions, would have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the caſe as much to his wiſh as upon an appeal from a judicial court; beſides, he had now the faireſt opportunity to have it decided in the ſhorteſt way, to which his antagoniſts muſt have ſubmitted, it being their own propoſal. His refuſal to accede to it was a capital miſtake, as it left both him and Cranfield expoſed to the charge of diſobedience. But it afforded a powerful plea in behalf of the people; whoſe confidence in the royal juſtice would have induced them to comply with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in the commiſſion. It being now impoſſible to have the controverſy thus decided they determined to hearken to none of his propoſals. As he generally met with oppoſition and contradiction he was induced to utter many raſh ſayings in all companies. He threatened to ſeize the principal eſtates, beggar their owners, and provoke them to rebellion by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a frigate into the harbour and procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoldiers to be quartered on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.<note place="margin">Weare's MS.</note> Theſe threats were ſo far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidating the people that they ſerved the more firmly to unite them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination not to ſubmit; and each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:018344_0206_0FA5D3EB18CC57C8"/>
was now warm in their oppoſition and reſentment.</p>
            <p>The governor on ſome freſh pretence ſuſpended Waldron, Martyn and Gilman from the council. The deaths of Daniels and Clements made two other vacancies. Vaughan held his ſeat the longeſt, but was at length thruſt out for his non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with ſome arbitrary meaſures. So that the governor had it in his power to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del the council to his mind, which he did by appointing at various times Nathanael Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Robert Eliot, John Hinckes, James Sherlock, Francis Champernoon and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Randolph, eſquires. The judicial courts were alſo filled with officers proper for the intended buſineſs. Barefoote, the deputy governor, was judge; Maſon was chancellor; Chamberlayne was clerk and prothonotary; Randolph was attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,<note place="margin">Council Rec.</note> and Sherlock provoſt marſhal and ſheriff. Some who had always been diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the country, and others who had been awed by threats or flattered by promiſes took leaſes from Maſon; and theſe ſerved for under ſheriffs, jurors, evidences, and other neceſſary perſons.</p>
            <p>Things being thus prepared, Maſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his law-ſuits by a writ againſt Major Waldron, (who had always diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:018344_0207_0FA5D3EC96691368"/>
himſelf in oppoſition to his claim) for holding lands and felling timber to the amount of four thouſand pounds. The major appeared in court, and challenged every one of the jury as intereſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſome of them having taken leaſes of Maſon, and all of them living upon the lands which he claimed. The judge then cauſed the oath of voire dire to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered to each juror, purporting <q>that he was not concerned in the lands in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and that he ſhould neither gain nor loſe by the cauſe.</q>
Upon which the major ſaid aloud to the people preſent, <q>That his was a leading caſe, and that if he were caſt they muſt all become te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to Maſon; and that all perſons in the province being intereſted, none of them could legally be of the jury.<note place="margin">MS in the files.</note>
               </q>
The caſe however went on; but he made no defence, aſſerted no title, and gave no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on his part. Judgment was given againſt him and at the next court of ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was fined five pounds for <q>muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and ſeditious words.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Suits were then inſtituted againſt all the principal landholders in the province, who, following Waldron's example, never made any defence. Some, chiefly of Hampton, gave in writing their reaſons for not join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:018344_0208_0FA5D3ED16BF7C80"/>
iſſue; which were, the refuſal of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to comply with the directions in the commiſſion; the impropriety of a jury's determining what the king had expreſsly reſerved to himſelf; and the incompetency of the jury, they being all intereſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one of whom had ſaid that <q>he would ſpend his eſtate to make Maſon's right good.</q>
Theſe reaſons were irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating rather than convincing to the court. The jury never heſitated in their verdicts. From ſeven to twelve cauſes were diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a day, and the coſts were multiplied from five to twenty pounds. Executions were iſſued, of which two or three only were levied; but Maſon could neither keep poſſeſſion of the premiſes nor diſpoſe of them by ſale,<note place="margin">MSS in files, and Weare's MSS.</note> ſo that the owners ſtill enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Several threatened to appeal to the king but Major Vaughan alone made the experiment.</p>
            <p>A ſuit was alſo commenced againſt Martyn who had been treaſurer, for the fines and forfeitures received by him, during the former adminiſtration; and judgment was recovered for ſeventy one pounds with coſts. Martyn petitioned Maſon as chancellor, ſetting forth that he had received and diſpoſed of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney according to the orders of the late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and council, and praying that the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:018344_0209_0FA5D3EDE17D6510"/>
whole burden might not lie upon him. A decree was then iſſued for the other ſurviving members of the late council, and the heirs of thoſe who were dead, to bear their proportion.<note place="margin">MSS in files.</note> This decree was afterward reverſed by the king in council.</p>
            <p>Cranfield with his council had now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the whole legiſlative power. They prohibited veſſels from Maſſachuſetts to enter the port, becauſe the acts of trade were not obſerved in that colony: They fixed the dimenſions of merchantable lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; altered the value of ſilver money, which had always paſſed by weight at ſix ſhillings and eight-pence per ounce; and ordered that dollars ſhould be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſix ſhillings each, which was then a great hardſhip; as many of them were greatly deficient in weight: They alſo changed the bounds of townſhips; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed fees of office; made regulations for the package of fiſh, and ordered the conſtables to forbear collecting any town or pariſh taxes till the province tax was paid,<note place="margin">Council Rec.</note> and the accounts ſettled with the treaſurer.</p>
            <p>The public grievances having become inſupportable, the people were driven to the neceſſity of making a vigorous ſtand for their liberties. The only regular way
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:018344_0210_0FA5D3EEA827D0D0"/>
was by complaint to the king. Having privately communicated their ſentiments to each other, and raiſed money by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, they appointed Nathaniel Weare, eſq. of Hampton their agent; and the four towns having drawn and ſubſcribed diſtinct petitions of the ſame tenor, Weare pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately withdrew to Boſton from whence he ſailed for England. Major Vaughan who accompanied him to Boſton, and was appointed to procure depoſitions to ſend after him, was upon his return to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, brought to an examination, treated with great inſolence and required to find ſureties for his good behaviour;<note place="margin">MSS in Files.</note> which, having broken no law, he refuſed<note n="*" place="bottom">In this refuſal he is countenanced by the example of the great Selden, and other members of parliament who were impriſoned by order of Charles I. in 1629. <bibl>Maca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But Moody was marked as an object of peculiar vengeance. He had for ſome time rendered himſelf obnoxious by the freedom and plainneſs of his pulpit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and his ſtrictneſs in adminiſtering the diſcipline of the church; one inſtance of which merits particular notice. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph having ſeized a veſſel, ſhe was in the night carried out of the harbour. The owner, who was a member of the church, ſwore that he knew nothing of it; but upon trial there appeared ſtrong ſuſpicions that he had perjured himſelf. He found means to make up the matter with the governor and collector; but Moody, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned for the purity of his church, requeſted of the governor copies of the evidence, that the offender might be called to account in the way of eccleſiaſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Cranfield ſternly refuſed, ſaying
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:018344_0213_0FA5D3F3175A5CF0"/>
that he had forgiven him, and that neither the church nor miniſter ſhould meddle with him; and even threatened Moody in caſe he ſhould. Not intimidated, Moody conſulted the church and preached a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon againſt falſe ſwearing; then the offender, being called to account,<note place="margin">Portſ. Chh. Records.</note> was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and at length brought to a public confeſſion. This procedure extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted the governor who had no way then in his power to ſhew his reſentment. But malice, ever fruitful in expedients to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its ends, ſuggeſted a method, which, to the ſcandal of the Engliſh nation, has been too often practiſed. The penal laws againſt nonconformiſts were at this time executing with great rigour in England; and Cranfield, ambitious to ape his royal maſter, determined to play off the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical artillery here, the direction of which he ſuppoſed to be deputed to him with his other powers.

Joſeph Rayn, by the governor's order exhibited an information at the next court of ſeſſions, before Walter Barefoote judge,<note place="margin">Feb. 5.</note> Nathanael Fryer and Henry Greene aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, Peter Coffin, Thomas Edgerly and Henry Robie juſtices, ſetting forth, <q>that Joſhua Moody clerk, being miniſter of the town of Portſmouth within the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of King Charles, was by the duty of his place and the laws of the realm, viz. the ſtatutes of the fifth and ſixth of Edward VI, the firſt of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, and the thirteenth and fourteenth of Charles II, required to adminiſter the Lord's ſupper in ſuch form as was ſet forth in the book of common prayer, and no other. But that the ſaid Moody in contempt of the laws had wilfully and obſtinately refuſed to adminiſter the ſame to the Honourable Edward Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Robert Maſon, and John Hinckes,<note place="margin">MSS in files.</note> and did obſtinately uſe ſome other form.</q>
Moody in his defence pleaded that he was not epiſcopally ordained as the ſtatutes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; nor did he receive his maintenance according to them; and therefore was not obliged to the performance of what had been commanded; that the alledged ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were not intended for theſe planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the known and avowed end of their
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:018344_0216_0FA5D3F55B1862D8"/>
ſettlement being the enjoyment of freedom from the impoſition of thoſe laws; which freedom was allowed and confirmed by the king,<note place="margin">Portſ. Chh. Records.</note> in the liberty of conſcience grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all proteſtants, in the governor's commiſſion.<note place="margin">Vaughan's Journal.</note> Four of the juſtices, viz. Greene, Robie, Edgerly and Fryer were at firſt for acquitting him; but the matter being adjourned till the next day, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field found means before morning to gain Robie and Greene, who then joined with Barefoote and Coffin, in ſentencing him to ſix months impriſonment, without bail or mainprize. The other two perſiſted in their former opinion, and were ſoon after removed from all their offices. Moody was immediately ordered into cuſtody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without being permitted firſt to ſee his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and he remained under confinement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in company with Major Vaughan, at the houſe of Captain Stileman, with liberty of the yard, for thirteen weeks; "his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice"
being declared forfeited to the crown. The next week after Moody's trial, the governor in a profane bravado ſent word to Seaborn Cotton miniſter of Hampton, that <q>when he had prepared his ſoul,<note place="margin">Vaughan's Journal.</note> he would come and demand the ſacrament of him as he had done at Portſmouth.</q>
Upon which Cotton
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:018344_0217_0FA5D3F61FFAA928"/>
withdrew to Boſton. The miniſter of Dover, John Pike, was (ſo far as I can find) unmoleſted. Exeter had then no ſettled miniſter.</p>
            <p>During Moody's impriſonment, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field would neither ſuffer him to go up to the town to preach, nor the people to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble at the iſland to hear, nor the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring miniſters to ſupply his place; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the family where he was confined were permitted to be preſent with him at ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath exerciſes. But while the governor was abſent on a tour to New-York, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon gave leave for opening the meeting-houſe twice, when they obtained a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to officiate;<note place="margin">Vaughan's Journal.</note> he alſo allowed both Moody and Vaughan to make a ſhort vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to their families. At length, by the interpoſition of friends, Moody obtained a releaſe, though under a ſtrict charge to preach no more within the province, on penalty of farther impriſonment. He then accepted an invitation from the firſt church in Boſton; where being out of the reach of his perſecutors, he was employed as a preacher,<note place="margin">Harvard College Records.</note> and was ſo highly eſteemed that upon the death of Preſident Rogers he was invited to take the overſight of the college, which he modeſtly declined, and continued his miniſtrations at Boſton, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

            <p>Upon a calm review of this proſecution, one can hardly tell which is moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the vindictive temper which gave it birth; or the profaneneſs and hypocriſy with which it was conducted. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended zeal of the proſecutors was totally inconſiſtent with a due regard to thoſe laws, and the principles of that church, for which they made themſelves ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible champions. For it had been long before this time, a received opinion in the church of England, that the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of all the ſacramental adminiſtrations depends on authority derived from the apoſtles, by <hi>epiſcopal</hi> ordination, in an uninterrupted ſucceſſion; and one of the ſtatutes on which the proſecution was
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:018344_0219_0FA5D3F79AEDA188"/>
grounded enacts, <q>that no perſon ſhall preſume to conſecrate and adminiſter the Lord's ſupper,<note place="margin">Stat. 13 &amp; 14 Car. II.</note> before he be ordained a prieſt by epiſcopal ordination, on pain of forfeiting for every offence one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds.</q>
The miniſters then in the province, being deſtitute of the grand pre-requiſite, were incapable by the act, of doing what was ſo peremptorily requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them; and had they complied with the governor's order, muſt have expoſed themſelves to the penalty, if he had pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exact it from them. But the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe penalties to the king's Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſubjects, who had fled hither from the rod of prelatic tyranny, was a moſt unwarrantable ſtretch of power; ſince the laſt of theſe acts, and the only one which had been made ſince the ſettlement of the colonies, was expreſsly reſtricted in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to <q>the realm of England, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Diſappointed in all his ſchemes for raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money by an aſſembly, Cranfield next ventured on the project of taxing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without their conſent. The pretext for this was a clauſe in the commiſſion, impowering him, with the council, <q>to continue ſuch taxes as had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:018344_0220_0FA5D3F96D25A1E8"/>
levied, until a general aſſembly could be called.</q>
This had been done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, at the beginning both of this and the former adminiſtration, when the change of government rendered it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But the council, though too much devoted to him, were not eaſily perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the meaſure at this time; till fear at length accompliſhed what reaſon could not approve: for, letters being received from the eaſtward, informing of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a plot among the Indians, who were inſtigated by Caſtine the Frenchman to renew the war early in the ſpring,<note place="margin">Feb. 14.</note> the council were ſummoned in haſte, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently agreed to the governor's propoſal, for continuing ſuch taxes as had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly laid, which he told them was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the immediate defence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the province. This affair, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was kept ſecret for the preſent; and the people were firſt to be convinced of the governor's paternal care and kindneſs in taking the neceſſary precautions for their ſafety.<note place="margin">March 13.</note> It was ordered that the meeting-houſes in each town ſhould be fortified, and bye garriſons were eſtabliſhed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places: Supplies of ammunition were ordered to be provided: Circular letters were diſpatched to the governors
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:018344_0221_0FA5D3F9FA18F0A8"/>
of the neighbouring colonies, informing them of the danger; and, to crown the whole, Cranfield himſelf, at the requeſt of the council, undertook a tour to New-York to ſolicit the governor, Dongan, for a number of the Mohawks to come down and deſtroy the eaſtern Indians;<note place="margin">Council Records.</note> promiſing to pay them for their ſervices out of the money which was thus to be raiſed.<note place="margin">Vaughan's Journal.</note>
            </p>
            <p>At his return from this excurſion, he found himſelf under ſome embarraſſment in his favourite views, from a letter of the lords of trade, which directed him to make uſe of an aſſembly, in raiſing money on the people. He could not, therefore, avoid calling one,<note place="margin">May 27.</note> though he immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it, becauſe ſeveral of the members were thoſe whom he had formerly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made conſtables. At the ſame time, in his letters to the ſecretary of ſtate, he repreſented the aſſembly as perſons of ſuch a mutinous and rebellious diſpoſition, that it was not ſafe to let them convene; that they had never given any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſupport of government; that he was obliged to raiſe money without them; and that it was impoſſible for him to ſerve his majeſty's intereſt without a ſhip of war to enforce his orders; and finally he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave to go to the Weſt-Indies for the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:018344_0222_0FA5D3FD4F71EF08"/>
recovery of his health. When this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was diſpatched, warrants were iſſued for collecting the taxes; which cauſed freſh murmurings and diſcontent among the people.</p>
            <p>But however diſaffected to the governor and his creatures, they were always ready to teſtify their obedience to the royal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; an inſtance of which occurred at this time. The ſeas of America and the Weſt-Indies being much infeſted with pirates, the king ſent of orders to all the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and colony aſſemblies, directing acts to be made for the ſuppreſſing of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and robbery on the high ſeas. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,<note place="margin">July 22.</note> having received this order, ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an aſſembly; and though it conſiſted almoſt entirely of the ſame perſons who were in the laſt; he ſuffered them to paſs the act, and then quietly diſſolved them: This was the laſt aſſembly that ever he called.<note place="margin">Council Records, and Files.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The tax-bills were firſt put into the hands of the newly made conſtables; who ſoon returned them, informing the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that the people were ſo averſe from the method, that it was impoſſible to collect the money. The provoſt, Thomas Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, was then commanded to do it, with the aſſiſtance of his deputies and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables.
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:018344_0223_0FA5D3FF4CFF35A0"/>
The people ſtill refuſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, their cattle and goods were taken by diſtreint and ſold by auction: Thoſe who would neither pay nor diſcover their goods to the officers, were apprehended and impriſoned; and ſome of the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, who refuſed to aſſiſt, ſuffered the ſame fate. The more conſiderate of the people were diſpoſed to bear theſe grievances, though highly irritating, till they could know the reſult of their applications to the king. But in a country where the love of liberty had ever been the ruling paſſion, it could not be expected but that ſome forward ſpirits would break the reſtraints of prudence, and take a ſummary method to put a ſtop to their oppreſſions. Several perſons had declared that they would ſooner part with their lives, than ſuffer diſtreints; and aſſociations were formed for mutual ſupport. At Exeter the ſheriff was reſiſted and driven off with clubs; the women having prepared hot ſpits and ſcalding water to aſſiſt in the oppoſition,<note place="margin">Dec. 29.</note> as Thurton teſtified in his depoſition on the occaſion. At Hampton he was beaten, and his ſword was taken from him;<note place="margin">Januar. 22.</note> then he was ſeated on an horſe, and conveyed out of the province to Saliſbury with a rope about his neck and his feet tied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:018344_0224_0FA5D3FFD8D187E8"/>
the horſe's belly. Juſtice Robie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to commit ſome of the rioters; but they were reſcued by the way, and both the juſtice and the ſheriff were ſtruck in the execution of their office. The troop of horſe,<note place="margin">Januar. 9.</note> under Maſon's command, was then ordered to turn out completely mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and armed, to aſſiſt in ſuppreſſing the diſorders; but when the day came not one trooper appeared. Cranfield thus finding his efforts ineffectual,<note place="margin">MSS in files.</note> and his authority contemptible, was obliged to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>The agent had been a long time in England, waiting for the depoſitions, which were to have been tranſmitted to him, in ſupport of the complaint which he was to exhibit. Cranfield and his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here did all that they could, to retard the buſineſs; firſt by impriſoning Vaughan, and then by refuſing to ſummon and ſwear witneſſes when applied to by others; who were obliged to go into the neighbouring governments, to get their depoſitions au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated; and after all, the proof was defective, as they had not acceſs to the public records. The agent, however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited his complaint againſt Cranfield in general terms,<note place="margin">July 11.</note> conſiſting of eight articles. <q>That he had engroſſed the power of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courts, and eſtabliſhing fees exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

of the aſſembly: That he had not followed the directions in his commiſſion reſpecting Maſon's controverſy; but had cauſed it to be decided on the ſpot by courts of his own conſtitution, conſiſting wholly of perſons devoted to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: That exorbitant charges had been exacted and ſome who were unable to ſatisfy them had been impriſoned: That others had been obliged to ſubmit, for want of money to carry on the ſuits: That he had altered the value of ſilver money: That he had impriſoned ſundry perſons without juſt cauſe: That he with his council had aſſumed legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without an aſſembly; and, that he had done his utmoſt to prevent the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from laying their complaints before the king,<note place="margin">W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="unknown:018344_0226_0FA5D4015E701570"/>When he had received this letter he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended Maſon's ſuits, till the queſtion concerning the legality of the courts ſhould be decided. He alſo ordered the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give copies to thoſe who ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for them. At the ſame time it was complained that the people, on their part, had been equally reſerved, in ſecreting the records of the ſeveral towns; ſo that Maſon upon enquiry could not find where they were depoſited; and the town clerks, when ſummoned, had ſolemnly ſworn that they knew neither where the books were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,<note place="margin">MSS in the files.</note> nor who had taken them out of their poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The neceſſary evidence on both ſides being procured,<note place="margin">1685.</note> a new complaint was drawn up, conſiſting of twelve articles, which were.
<q>That at the firſt ſeſſion of the aſſembly Cranfield had challenged the power of legiſlation and ſettlement of affairs to himſelf againſt the words of the commiſſion: That he had by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or mortgage from Maſon, made himſelf owner of the province, and ſo was not likely to act impartially between Maſon and the inhabitants: That he had made courts, whereof both judges and jurors had agreed with Maſon for their own lands, and ſome had taken deeds of
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:018344_0227_0FA5D40214919060"/>
him for other men's lands, ſo that they were engaged by their intereſt to ſet up Maſon's title: That Maſon had ſued forty perſons, and caſt all; and that the governor's interpoſal to ſtate the caſes, as by his commiſſion he was directed, had been refuſed though deſired; and that the defendants pleas grounded on the laws of England were rejected: That they could not reconcile the verdict with the attachment, nor the execution with the verdict, nor their practice under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the execution with either; that the verdict found the lands ſued for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the royal commiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and that commiſſion only gave power to ſtate the caſe if Maſon and the people could not agree; but the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took land and all: That the charge of every action was about ſix pounds, though nothing was done in court, but reading the commiſſion and ſome blank grants without hand or ſeal; and theſe were not read for one caſe in ten: That court charges were exacted in money, which many had not; who though they tendered cattle, were committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for non-payment: That miniſters, contrary to his majeſty's commiſſion, which granted liberty of conſcience to all
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:018344_0228_0FA5D4031D8C21F8"/>
proteſtants, had their dues withheld from them, even thoſe that were due before Cranfield came, and were threatened with ſix months impriſonment for not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering the ſacrament according to the liturgy: That though the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agreed that Spaniſh money ſhould paſs by weight, the governor and council ordered pieces of eight to paſs for ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, though under weight: That men were commonly compelled to enter into bonds of great penalty, to appear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what ſhould be objected againſt them, when no crime was alledged: That they had few laws but thoſe made by the governor and council, when his commiſſion directed the general aſſembly to make laws: That the courts were kept in a remote corner of the province; and the ſheriff was a ſtranger and had no viſible eſtate,<note place="margin">Weare's MSS.</note> and ſo was not reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for failures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this complaint, an hearing was had before the lords of trade on Tueſday the tenth of March; and their lordſhips reported to the king, on three articles on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the complaint viz.
<q>That Cranfield had not purſued his inſtructions with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Maſon's controverſy; but inſtead thereof had cauſed courts to be held and
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:018344_0229_0FA5D4069C24B640"/>
titles to be decided, with exorbitant coſts; and that he had exceeded his power in regulating the value of coins.</q>
This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was accepted, and the king's pleaſure therein ſignified to him. At the ſame time, his requeſt for abſence being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he, on receipt of the letters, privately embarked on board a veſſel for Jamaica;<note place="margin">Neal's Hiſt. &amp; Fitch's MS.</note> and from thence went to England, where he obtained the collectorſhip of Barbadoes. At his departure, Barefoote the deputy-governor took the chair; which he held till he was ſuperſeded by Dudley's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as preſident of New-England.</p>
            <p>Cranfield's ill conduct muſt be aſcribed in a great meaſure to his diſappointment of the gains which he expected to acquire, by the eſtabliſhment of Maſon's title; which could be his only inducement to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the government. This diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflaming his temper, naturally vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive and imperious, urged him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not only illegal, but cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly. A ruler never degrades his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter more than when he perverts public juſtice to gratify perſonal reſentment; he ſhould puniſh none but the enemies of the laws, and diſturbers of the peace of the community over which he preſides. Had there been the leaſt colour, either of zeal
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:018344_0230_0FA5D40819283F20"/>
or policy, for the ſeverity exerciſed in the proſecution of Moody, candour would oblige us to make ſome allowance for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailty. His ordering the members of the aſſembly to be made conſtables, was a mode of revenge diſgraceful to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the ſupreme magiſtrate. From the ſame baſe diſpoſition, he is ſaid to have employed ſpies and pimps,<note place="margin">Neal, vol. 2. p. 39.</note> to find matter of accuſation againſt people in their clubs, and private diſcourſe. And his deceit was equal to his malice; for, being at Boſton when the charter of that colony was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in queſtion, and the people were ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to ward off the danger; he adviſed them to make a private offer of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand guineas to the king, promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them in a favourable light; but when they, not ſuſpecting his intention, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his advice, and ſhewed him the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they had wrote to their agents for that purpoſe, he treacherouſly repreſented them as "diſloyal rogues;<note place="margin">Hutchin. vol. 1. pag. 337.</note>" and made them appear ſo ridiculous that their agents were aſhamed to be ſeen at court. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when he had quitted the country, and had time for reflection, he grew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his miſconduct, and while he was collector at Barbadoes, made a point of treating the maſters of veſſels,<note place="margin">Fitch's MS.</note> and other
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:018344_0231_0FA5D409B5E89920"/>
perſons who went thither from Paſcataqua, with particular reſpect.</p>
            <p>Although the deciſion of titles in Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's courts had been repreſented, in the report of the lords, as extrajudicial, and a royal order had been thereupon iſſued to ſuſpend any farther proceedings in the caſe of Maſon, till the matter ſhould be brought before the king in council, purſuant to the directions in the commiſſion; yet Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote ſuffered executions which had before been iſſued to be extended, and perſons to be impriſoned at Maſon's ſuit. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a freſh complaint and petition to the king, which was ſent by Weare, who about this time made a ſecond voyage to England, as agent for the province and attorney to Vaughan, to manage an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from ſeveral verdicts, judgments,<note place="margin">Weare's MSS.</note> decrees and fines which had been given againſt him in the courts here, one of which was on the title to his eſtate. An attempt being made to levy one of the executions in Dover, a number of perſons forcibly reſiſted the officer, and obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his deſign.<note place="margin">MSS in files.</note> Warrants were then iſſued againſt the rioters, and the ſheriff with his attendants attempted to ſeize them, while the people were aſſembled for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice. This cauſed an uproar in
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:018344_0232_0FA5D40A6B324210"/>
the congregation, in which a young hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine diſtinguiſhed herſelf by knocking down one of the officers with her bible. They were all ſo roughly handled that they were glad to eſcape with their lives.</p>
            <p>That nothing might be wanting to ſhew the enmity of the people to theſe meaſures, and their hatred and contempt for the authors of them;<note place="margin">MSS in files.</note> there are ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the original depoſitions on oath, of Barefoote and Maſon, relating to an aſſault made on their perſons by Thomas Wiggen and Anthony Nutter, who had been members of the aſſembly. Theſe two men came to Barefoote's houſe where Maſon lodged,<note place="margin">Dec. 30.</note> and entered into diſcourſe with him about his proceedings; denying his claim, and uſing ſuch language as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to take hold of Wiggen, with an intention to thruſt him out at the door. But Wiggen being a ſtronger man ſeized him by his cravat, and threw him into the fire; where his clothes and one of his legs were burned. Barefoote, attempting to help him, met with the ſame fate, and had two of his ribs broken and one of his teeth beaten out in the ſtruggle.

            <p>Nothing elſe occured during Barefoote's ſhort adminiſtration, except a treaty of friendſhip, between the Indians of Pena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook and Saco, on the one part; and the people of New-Hampſhire and Maine on the other. The foundation of this treaty ſeems to have been laid in Cranfield's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of bringing down the Mohawks on the eaſtern Indians; which had once before proved a pernicious meaſure; as they made no diſtinction between thoſe tribes which were at peace with the Engliſh, and thoſe which were at war.

Hagkins, a chief of the tribe, had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cranfield in the ſpring of the danger he apprehended, and had implored aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and protection, but had been treated with neglect. In Auguſt the Penacook and Saco Indians gathered their corn, and removed their families; which gave an alarm to their Engliſh neighbours, as if they were preparing for war. Meſſengers being ſent to demand the reaſon of their movement, were informed that it was the fear of the Mohawks, whom they daily expected to deſtroy them; and being aſked why they did not come in among the Engliſh for protection, they anſwered, leſt the Mohawks ſhould hurt the Engliſh on their account. Upon this they were perſuaded to enter into an agreement; and accordingly their chiefs being aſſembled with the council of New-Hampſhire, and a deputation from the province of Maine,<note place="margin">Septemb. 8.</note> a treaty was concluded, wherein it was ſtipulated, that all future perſonal injuries on either ſide ſhould, upon complaint, be immediately redreſſed; that information ſhould be given of approaching danger from enemies; that the Indians ſhould not remove their families from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the Engliſh without giving

            <argument>
               <p>The adminiſtration of Dudley as preſident, and Androſſe as governor of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Maſon's farther attempt. His diſappointment and death. Revolution. Sale to Allen. His commiſſion for the government.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHEN an arbitrary government is determined to infringe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, it is eaſy to find preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſupport the moſt unrighteous claims. King Charles the ſecond in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his reign was making large ſtrides toward deſpotiſm. Charters, which obſtructed his pernicious views, were by a perverſion of the law decreed forfeited. The city of London, and moſt of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in England, either ſuffered the execution of theſe ſentences, or tamely ſurrendered their franchiſes to the all-graſping hand of power. It could not be expected that in this general wreck of privileges the colonies of New-England could eſcape. The people of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts had long been viewed with a jealous eye.<note place="margin">Hutch. col. pap. p. 377.</note> Though the king had repeatedly aſſured them of his protection, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:018344_0237_0FA5D411D5E20148"/>
confirmed their charter privileges; yet their ſpirit and principles were ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſſonant to the corrupt views of the court, that intriguing men found eaſy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the royal ear, with complaints againſt them. Of theſe the moſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and indefatigable was Randolph,<note place="margin">Hutch. vol. 1. p. 329.</note> who made no leſs than eight voyages in nine years acroſs the Atlantic, on this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous buſineſs. They were accuſed of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their juriſdiction beyond the bounds of their patent; of invading the prerogative by coining money; of not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing appeals to the king from their courts; and, of obſtruſting the execution of the navigation and trade laws. By the king's command agents were ſent over to anſwer to theſe complaints. They found the prejudice againſt the colony ſo ſtrong, that it was in vain to withſtand it; and ſolicited inſtructions whether to ſubmit to the king's pleaſure, or to let the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt them be iſſued in form of law. A ſolemn conſultation being held, at which the clergy aſſiſted, it was determined
<q>to die by the hands of others rather than by their own.</q>
Upon notice of this, the agents quitted England;<note place="margin">1683.</note> and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph, as the angel of death ſoon followed them,<note place="margin">October.</note> bringing a writ of quo warranto
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:018344_0238_0FA5D413A9533558"/>
from the king's bench; but the ſcire facias which iſſued from the chancery did not arrive till the time fixed for their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was elapſed: This however was deemed too trivial an error to ſtop the proceedings; judgment was entered againſt them, and the charter declared forfeited.</p>
            <p>The king died before a new form of government was ſettled;<note place="margin">1685.</note> but there could be no hope of favour from his ſucceſſor, who inherited the arbitrary principles of his brother,<note place="margin">Feb. 6.</note> and was publickly known to be a bigoted papiſt.</p>
            <p>The intended alteration in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was introduced in the ſame gradual manner as it had been in New-Hampſhire. A commiſſion was iſſued, in which Joſeph Dudley, eſquire, was appointed preſident of his majeſty's territory and dominion of New-England; William Stoughton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty preſident; Simon Bradſtreet, Robert Maſon, John Fitz Winthrop, John Pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, Peter Bulkley, Edward Randolph, Wait Winthrop, Richard Warton, John Uſher, Nathaniel Saltonſtall, Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Gedney, Jonathan Tyng, Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Bradſtreet, John Hinckes, and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tyng, counſellors. Their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extended over Maſſachuſetts, New-Hampſhire, Maine and the Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet or King's province. Theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:018344_0239_0FA5D4141CB7F1A8"/>
were moſtly natives of the country,<note place="margin">1686.</note> ſome of them had been magiſtrates, and one of them governor under the charter. No houſe of deputies was mentioned in the commiſſion.</p>
            <p>The new form of government took place on the twenty fifth day of May; and on the tenth of June an order of council was iſſued for ſettling the country courts, which conſiſted of ſuch members of the council as reſided in each county, and any others of them who might be preſent; with ſuch juſtices as were commiſſioned for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe courts had the power of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and iſſuing all civil cauſes, and all criminal matters under life or limb; from them an appeal was allowed to a ſuperior court held three times in the year at Boſton, for the whole territory; and from thence appeals, in certain caſes, might be had to the king in council. Juries were pricked by the marſhal and one juſtice of each country, in a liſt given them by the ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the towns. A probate court was held at Boſton, by the preſident, and
<q>in the other provinces and remote counties</q>
by a judge and clerk appointed by the preſident. The territory was divided into four counties, viz. Suffolk, Middleſex, Eſſex and Hampſhire; and three provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, viz. New-Hampſhire, Maine, and
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:018344_0240_0FA5D414DADD4220"/>
King's province. By another order of the ſame date,<note place="margin">Printed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the files.</note> town-taxes could not be aſſeſſed but by allowance of two juſtices; and the members of the council were exempted from paying any part thereof.</p>
            <p>Things were conducted with tolerable decency, and the innovations were render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as little grievous as poſſible; that the people might be induced more readily to ſubmit to the long meditated introduction of a governor-general.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dec. 30.</note>In December following, Sir Edmund Androſſe who had been governor of New-York, arrived at Boſton with a commiſſion, appointing him captain-general and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in chief of the territory and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of New-England, in which the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of Plymouth was now included. By this commiſſion, the governor with his council, five of whom were a quorum, were impowered to make ſuch laws, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch taxes, and apply them to ſuch purpoſes as they ſhould think proper. They were alſo empowered to grant lands on ſuch terms,<note place="margin">MS Copy of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and ſubject to ſuch quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as ſhould be appointed by the king. Inveſted with ſuch powers, theſe men were capable of the moſt extravagant actions. Though Androſſe, like his maſter, began his adminiſtration with the faireſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:018344_0241_0FA5D4159D06E880"/>
yet like him, he ſoon violated them, and proved himſelf a fit inſtrument for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the moſt execrable deſigns. Thoſe of his council who were backward in aiding his rapacious intentions were neglected. Seven being ſufficient for a full board, he ſelected ſuch only as were devoted to him, and with their concurrence did what he pleaſed. Randolph and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were at firſt among his confidents;<note place="margin">Hutchin. vol. 1. p. 344. Collect. pap. p. 564.</note> but afterward when New-York was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to his government, the members from that quarter were moſt in his favour.</p>
            <p>To particularize the many inſtances of tyranny and oppreſſion which the country ſuffered from theſe men,<note place="margin">1687.</note> is not within the deſign of this work. Let it ſuffice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the preſs was reſtrained; liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience infringed; exorbitant fees and taxes demanded, without the voice or conſent of the people, who had no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of repreſentation. The charter being vacated, it was pretended that all titles to land were annulled; and as to Indian deeds,<note place="margin">Revolution in N. Eng. juſtified, p. 21.</note> Androſſe declared them no better than "the ſcratch of a bear's paw." Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders were obliged to take out patents for their eſtates which they had poſſeſſed forty or fifty years; for theſe patents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant fees were exacted, and thoſe who
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:018344_0242_0FA5D41657442958"/>
would not ſubmit to this impoſition had writs of intruſion brought againſt them, and their land patented to others. To hinder the people from conſulting about the redreſs of their grievances, town-meetings were prohibited, except one in the month of May for the choice of town officers; and to prevent complaints being carried to England, no perſon was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go out of the country without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs leave from the governor. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the vigilance of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, his emiſſaries and his guards, the reſolute and indefatigable Increaſe Mather,<note place="margin">I. Mather's life, p. 107.</note> miniſter of the ſecond church in Boſton, and preſident of the college, got on board a ſhip and ſailed for England, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in the name of the people againſt the governor, which he delivered with his own hand to the king; but finding no hope of redreſs, he waited the event of the revolution which was then expected.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1688.</note>When the people groaned under ſo many real grievances, it is no wonder that their fears and jealouſies ſuggeſted ſome that were imaginary. They believed Androſſe to be a papiſt; that he had hired the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and ſupplied them with ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deſtroy their frontier ſettlements;<note place="margin">Revolution juſtified, p. 29, 40.</note> and that he was preparing to betray the
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:018344_0243_0FA5D41767377978"/>
country into the hands of the French. At the ſame time, the large ſtrides that King James the ſecond was making toward the eſtabliſhment of popery and deſpotiſm, raiſed the moſt terrible apprehenſions; ſo that the report of the landing of the Prince of Orange in England was received here with the greateſt joy. Androſſe was ſo alarmed at the news; that he impriſoned the man who brought a copy of the prince's declaration, and publiſhed a proclamation commanding all perſons to be in readineſs to oppoſe "any invaſion from Holland," which met with as much diſregard as one he had iſſued before, appointing a day of thankſgiving for the birth of a Prince of Wales.</p>
            <p>The people had now borne theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and impoſitions for about three years: Their patience was worn out,<note place="margin">1689.</note> and their native love of freedom kindled at the proſpect of deliverance. The news of a complete revolution in England had not reached them; yet ſo ſanguine were their expectations, ſo eager were they to prove that they were animated by the ſame ſpirit with their brethren at home, that upon the rumour of an intended maſſacre in the town of Boſton by the governor's guards, they were wrought up to a degree of fury.
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:018344_0244_0FA5D41B6BF8AB08"/>
On the morning of the eighteenth of April the town was in arms, and the country flocking in to their aſſiſtance. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and thoſe who had fled with him to the fort, were ſeized and committed to priſon. The gentlemen who had been magiſtrates under the charter, with Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, the late governor, at their head, aſſumed the name of a council of ſafety, and kept up a form of government, in the exigency of affairs, till orders arrived from England; when Androſſe and his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices were ſent home as priſoners of ſtate, to be diſpoſed of according to the king's pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The people of New-Hampſhire had their ſhare of ſufferings under this rapacious adminiſtration; and Maſon himſelf did not eſcape. Having attended the hearing of Vaughan's appeal to the king which was decided in Maſon's favour; the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obtained here,<note place="margin">Nov. 6. 1686.</note> being affirmed; and having now the faireſt proſpect of realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his claim, he returned hither in the ſpring of 1687, but found his views ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in a manner which he little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The government was in the hands of a ſet of hungry harpies, who looked with envy on the large ſhare of territory which Maſon claimed,<note place="margin">Hutchin. collect. pa. p. 564.</note> and were for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celing
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:018344_0245_0FA5D41D9ACDD4E8"/>
it out among themſelves. The new judges delayed iſſuing executions on the judgments which he had formerly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the attorney-general, Graham, would not allow that he had power to grant lands by leaſes. This confirmed the people in their opinion of the invalidity of his claim, and rendered them (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) more averſe from him than ever they had been. At length, however, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Dudley the chief juſtice,<note place="margin">MS in Sup. Court files.</note> a writ of certiorari, directed to the late judges of New-Hampſhire, by which his cauſes were to be removed to the ſupreme court of the whole territory, then held at Boſton;<note place="margin">July 13, 1688.</note> but before this could be done, death put an end to his hopes and relieved the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a time of their fears.<note place="margin">Aug. or Sept. 1688.

            <p>The revolution at Boſton, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pleaſing to the people of New-Hampſhire, left them in an unſettled ſtate.

            <p>Had the inclination of the people been conſulted,<note place="margin">1691.</note> they would gladly have been annexed to that government.

The claim which Allen had to the lands from Naumkeag to three miles northward of Merrimack,<note place="margin">1692.</note> was noticed in the Maſſachuſetts charter; and he obtained a commiſſion for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">March 1.</note> in which his ſon in law John Uſher, then in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, was appointed lieutenant governor, with power to execute the commiſſion in Allen's abſence. The counſellors named in the governor's inſtructions were John Uſher lieutenant governor, John Hinckes, Nathaniel Fryer, Thomas Gratfort, Peter Coffin, Henry Green, Robert Eliot, John Gerriſh, John Walford and John Love. The governor was inſtructed to ſend to the ſecretary of ſtate the names of ſix other perſons ſuitable for counſellors. Three were a quorum, but the inſtructions were that nothing ſhould be done unleſs five were preſent except in extraordinary emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.

            <argument>
               <p>The war with the French and Indians, commonly called King William's war.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT was the misfortune of this country to have enemies of different kinds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with at the ſame time. While the changes above related were taking place in their government, a freſh war broke out on their frontiers, which, though aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to divers cauſes, was really kindled by the raſhneſs of the ſame perſons who were making havock of their liberties.</p>
            <p>The lands from Penobſcot to Nova-Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia had been ceded to the French, by the treaty of Breda,<note place="margin">Hutchin. coll. pap. p. 548.</note> in exchange for the iſland of St. Chriſtopher. On theſe lands the Baron de St. Caſtine had for many years reſided, and carried on a large trade with the Indians; with whom he was intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected; having ſeveral of their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, beſide a daughter of the ſachem Madokawando, for his wives. The lands which had been granted by the crown of England to the duke of York (now King James the ſecond) interfered with Caſtine's plantation, as the duke claimed to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Croix. A fort had been built by
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:018344_0251_0FA5D42194C9A7C0"/>
his order at Pemaquid, and a garriſon ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there to prevent any intruſion on his property. In 1686 a ſhip belonging to Paſcataqua landed ſome wines at Penob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot, ſuppoſing it to be within the French territory. Palmer and Weſt, the duke's agents at Pemaquid went and ſeized the wines; but by the influence of the French ambaſſador in England an order was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the reſtoration of them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a new line was run which took Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's plantation into the duke's territory. In the ſpring of 1688,<note place="margin">1688.</note> Androſſe went in the Roſe frigate, and plundered Caſtine's houſe and fort; leaving only the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his chapel to conſole him for the loſs of his arms and goods.<note place="margin">Hutchin. coll. pap. p. 562.</note> This baſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provoked Caſtine to excite the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to a new war, pretences for which were not wanting on their part. They complained that the tribute of corn which had been promiſed by the treaty of 1678, had been withheld; that the fiſhery of the river Saco had been obſtructed by ſeines; that their ſtanding corn had been devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cattle belonging to the Engliſh; that their lands at Pemaquid had been patent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without their conſent; and that they had been fraudulently dealt with in trade. Some of theſe complaints were doubtleſs
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:018344_0252_0FA5D422AF0B55C0"/>
well grounded; but none of them were ever enquired into or redreſſed.</p>
            <p>They began to make repriſals at North Yarmouth by killing cattle. Juſtice Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ordered ſixteen of them to be ſeized and kept under guard at Falmouth; but others continued to rob and captivate the inhabitants. Androſſe, who pretended to treat the Indians with mildneſs, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe whom Blackman had ſeized to be ſet at liberty. But this mildneſs had not the deſired effect; the Indians kept their priſoners, and murdered ſome of them in their barbarous frolicks. Androſſe then changed his meaſures, and thought to frighten them, with an army of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, which he led into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the month of November. The rigor of the ſeaſon proved fatal to ſome of his men; but he never ſaw an Indian in his whole march. The enemy were quiet during the winter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1689.</note>After the revolution, the gentlemen who aſſumed the government took ſome precautions to prevent the renewal of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities. They ſent meſſengers and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to ſeveral tribes of Indians,<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Neal, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them with fair promiſes; but their prejudice againſt the Engliſh was too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate to be allayed by ſuch means as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="unknown:018344_0253_0FA5D42631599B20"/>Thirteen years had almoſt elapſed ſince the ſeizure of the four hundred Indians, at Cochecho, by Major Waldron; during all which time, an inextinguiſhable thirſt of revenge had been cheriſhed among them, which never till now found opportunity for gratification<note n="*" place="bottom">The inveteracy of their hatred to Major Waldron on account of that tranſaction, appears from what is related by Mr. Williams in the narrative of his captivity, which happened in 1704. When he was in Canada, a jeſuit diſcourſing with him on the cauſes of their wars with New-England,

Wonolanſet, one of the ſachems of Penacook, who was diſmiſſed with his people at the time of the ſeizure, always obſerved his father's dying charge not to quarrel with the Engliſh; but Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, another ſachem, who had been treated with neglect by Cranfield, was more ready to liſten to the ſeducing invitations of Caſtine's emiſſaries. Some of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who were then ſeized and ſold into ſlavery abroad, had found their way home, and could not reſt till they had revenge. Accordingly a confederacy being formed between the tribes of Penacook and Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wacket, and the ſtrange Indians (as they were called) who were incorporated with them, it was determined to ſurpriſe the major and his neighbours, among whom they had all this time been peaceably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="unknown:018344_0254_0FA5D427AEF6C808"/>In that part of the town of Dover which lies about the firſt falls in the river Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checho, were five garriſoned houſes; three on the North ſide, viz. Waldron's, Otis's and Heard's; and two on the ſouth ſide, viz. Peter Coffin's and his ſon's. Theſe houſes were ſurrounded with timber-walls, the gates of which, as well as the houſe doors, were ſecured with bolts and bars. The neighbouring families retired to theſe houſes by night; but by an unaccountable negligence, no watch was kept. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians who were daily paſſing through the town viſiting and trading with the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as uſual in time of peace, viewed their ſituation with an attentive eye. Some hints of a miſchievous deſign had been given out by their ſquaws; but in ſuch dark and ambiguous terms that no one could comprehend their meaning. Some of the people were uneaſy; but Waldron who, from a long courſe of experience, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with the Indians, and on other occaſions had been ready enough to ſuſpect them, was now ſo thoroughly ſecure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when ſome of the people hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their fears to him, he merrily bad them to go and plant their pumpkins, ſaying that he would tell them when the Indians would break out. The very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:018344_0255_0FA5D4291EB77EB0"/>
before the miſchief was done, being told by a young man that the town was full of Indians and the people were much concerned; he anſwered that he knew the Indians very well and there was no danger.</p>
            <p>The plan which the Indians had pre-concerted was, that two ſquaws ſhould go to each of the garriſoned houſes in the evening, and aſk leave to lodge by the fire; that in the night when the people were aſleep they ſhould open the doors and gates, and give the ſignal by a whiſtle; upon which the ſtrange Indians, who were to be within hearing, ſhould ruſh in, and take their long meditated revenge. This plan being ripe for execution, on the evening of Thurſday the twenty ſeventh of June, two ſquaws applied to each of the garriſons for lodging, as they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did in time of peace. They were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into all but the younger Coffin's, and the people, at their requeſt, ſhewed them how to open the doors, in caſe they ſhould have occaſion to go out in the night. Meſandowit, one of their chiefs, went to Waldron's garriſon, and was kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as he had often been before. The ſquaws told the major, that a number of Indians were coming to trade with him the next day, and Meſandowit while at
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:018344_0256_0FA5D42A9C22BE58"/>
ſupper, with his uſual familiarity, ſaid,
<q>Brother Waldron, what would you do if the ſtrange Indians ſhould come?</q>
The major careleſsly anſwered, that he could aſſemble an hundred men, by lifting up his finger. In this unſuſpecting confidence the family retired to reſt.</p>
            <p>When all was quiet, the gates were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and the ſignal given. The Indians entered, ſet a guard at the door, and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the major's apartment, which was an inner room. Awakened by the noiſe, he jumped out of bed, and though now advanced in life to the age of eighty years, he retained ſo much vigour as to drive them with his ſword, through two or three doors; but as he was returning for his other arms, they came behind him, ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with an hatchet, drew him into his hall, and ſeating him in an elbow chair on a long table inſultingly aſked him, "Who ſhall judge Indians now?" They then obliged the people in the houſe to get them ſome victuals; and when they had done eating, they cut the major acroſs the breaſt and belly with knives, each one with a ſtroke, ſaying,
<q>I croſs out my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q>
They then cut off his noſe and ears, forcing them into his mouth; and when ſpent with the loſs of blood, he was
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:018344_0257_0FA5D42B581E1E38"/>
falling down from the table, one of them held his own ſword under him, which put an end to his miſery. They alſo killed his ſon in law Abraham Lee; but took his daughter Lee with ſeveral others, and having pillaged the houſe, left it on fire. Otis's garriſon, which was next to the major's, met with the ſame fate; he was killed, with ſeveral others, and his wife and child were captivated. Heard's was ſaved by the barking of a dog juſt as the Indians were entering: Elder Wentworth, who was awakened by the noiſe puſhed them out, and falling on his back, ſet his feet againſt the gate and held it till he had alarmed the people; two balls were fired through it, but both miſſed him. Coffin's houſe was ſurprized, but as the Indians had no particular enmity to him, they ſpared his life, and the lives of his family, and contented themſelves with pillaging the houſe. Finding a bag of money, they made him throw it by handfuls on the floor, while they amuſed themſelves in ſcrambling for it. They then went to the houſe of his ſon who would not admit the ſquaws in the evening, and ſummoned him to ſurrender, promiſing him quarter: He declined their offer and determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his houſe, till they brought out his
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:018344_0258_0FA5D42C207ED518"/>
father and threatened to kill him before his eyes: Filial affection then overcame his reſolution, and he ſurrendered. They put both families together into a deſerted houſe, intending to reſerve them for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; but while the Indians were buſy in plundering, they all eſcaped.</p>
            <p>Twenty three people were killed in this ſurpriſal, and twenty nine were captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; five or ſix houſes, with the mills, were burned; and ſo expeditious were the Indians in the execution of their plot, that before the people could be collected from the other parts of the town to oppoſe them, they fled with their priſoners and booty. As they paſſed by Heard's garriſon in their retreat, they fired upon it; but the people being prepared and reſolved to defend it, and the enemy being in haſte, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The preſervation of its owner was more remarkable.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Heard, with her three ſons and a daughter, and ſome others, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the night from Portſmouth. They paſſed up the river in their boat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived by the Indians, who were then in poſſeſſion of the houſes; but ſuſpecting danger by the noiſe which they heard, after they had landed they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Waldron's garriſon, where
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:018344_0259_0FA5D42CDE8439B0"/>
they ſaw lights, which they imagined were ſet up for direction to thoſe who might be ſeeking a refuge. They knocked and begged earneſtly for admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but no anſwer being given, a young man of the company climbed up the wall, and ſaw, to his inexpreſſible ſurprize, an Indian ſtanding in the door of the houſe, with his gun. The woman was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the fright that ſhe was unable to fly; but begged her children to ſhift for themſelves; and they with heavy hearts, left her. When ſhe had a little recovered ſhe crawled into ſome buſhes, and lay there till day-light. She then perceived an Indian coming toward her with a piſtol in his hand; he looked at her and went away: returning, he looked at her again; and ſhe aſked him what he would have; he made no anſwer, but ran yelling to the houſe, and ſhe ſaw him no more. She kept her place till the houſe was burned, and the Indians were gone; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, found her own houſe ſafe. Her preſervation in theſe dangerous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances was the more remarkable, if (as it is ſuppoſed) it was an inſtance of juſtice and gratitude in the Indians. For at the time when the four hundred were ſeized in 1676, a young Indian eſcaped
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:018344_0260_0FA5D42DC1184218"/>
and took refuge in her houſe, where ſhe concealed him; in return for which kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he promiſed her that he would never kill her, nor any of her family in any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture war, and that he would uſe his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the other Indians to the ſame purpoſe. This Indian was one of the party who ſurprized the place, and ſhe was well known to the moſt of them.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, after the miſchief was done, a letter from Secretary Addington, written by order of the government, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Major Waldron, giving him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the intention of the Indians to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize him under pretence of trade, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of his ſon.<note place="margin">Maſſ. Rec.</note> This deſign was communicated to Governor Bradſtreet by Major Henchman of Chelmsford, who had learned it of the Indians. The letter was diſpatched from Boſton,<note place="margin">Original Letter.</note> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by Mr. Weare; but ſome delay which he met with at Newbury ferry prevented its arrival in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The priſoners taken at this time were moſtly carried to Canada, and ſold to the French; and theſe, ſo far as I can learn, were the firſt that ever were carried thither<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>One of theſe priſoners was Sarah Gerriſh, a remarkably fine child of ſeven years old, and grand-daughter of Major Waldron, in whoſe houſe the lodged that fatal night. Some circumſtances attending her captivity are truly affecting. When ſhe was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the noiſe of the Indians in the houſe, ſhe crept into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bed and hid herſelf under the clothes to eſcape their ſearch. She remained in their hands till the next winter, and was ſold from one to another ſeveral times. An Indian girl once puſhed her into a river; but, catching by the buſhes, ſhe eſcaped drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet durſt not tell how ſhe came to be wet. Once ſhe was ſo weary with travelling that ſhe did not awake in the morning till the Indians were gone, and then found herſelf alone in the woods, covered with ſnow, and without any food; having found their tracks ſhe went crying after them till they heard her and took her with them. At another time they kindled a great fire, and the young Indians told her ſhe was to be roaſted. She burſt into tears, threw her arms round her maſter's neck, and begged him to ſave her, which he promiſed to do if ſhe would behave well. Being arrived in Canada, ſhe was bought by the Intendant's lady, who treated her courteouſly, and ſent her to a nunnery for education. But when Sir William Phips was at Quebec ſhe was exchanged, and returned to her friends, with whom ſhe lived till ſhe was ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old.</p>
                  <p>The wife of Richard Otis was taken at the ſame time, with an infant daughter of three months old. The French prieſts took this child under their care, baptized her by the name of Chriſtina, and educated her in the Romiſh religion. She paſſed ſome time in a nunnery, but declined taking the veil, and was married to a Frenchman, by whom ſhe had two children. But her deſire to ſee New-England was ſo ſtrong, that upon an exchange of priſoners in 1714, being then a widow, ſhe left both her children, who were not permitted to come with her, and returned home, where ſhe abjured the Romiſh faith. M. Siguenot, her former confeſſor, wrote her a flattering letter, warning her of her danger, inviting her to return to the boſom of the catholic church, and repeating many groſs calumnies which had formerly been vented againſt Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the other reformers. This letter being ſhewn to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Burnet, he wrote her a ſenſible and maſterly anſwer, refuting the arguments, and detecting the falſehoods it contained: Both theſe letters were printed. She was married afterward to Capt. Thomas Baker, who had been taken at Deerfield in 1704, and lived in Dover, where ſhe was born, till the year 1773.</p>
                  <p>Mr. John Emerſon, by declining to lodge at Major Waldron's on the fatal night, though ſtrongly urged, met with an happy eſcape. He was afterward a miniſter at New-Caſtle and Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</p>
                  <p>☞ Some of the circumſtances relating to the deſtruction of Cochecho are taken from Mather's Magnalia. The others from the tradition of the ſufferers and their deſcendants.</p>

The Indians had been ſeduced to the French intereſt by popiſh emiſſaries, who
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:018344_0262_0FA5D42F5863A700"/>
had began to faſcinate them with their religious and national prejudices. They had now learned to call the Engliſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and that to extirpate them as ſuch was meritorious in the ſight of heaven. When their minds were filled with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous phrenzy, they became more bitter and implacable enemies than before; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſale of ſcalps and priſoners turn to good account in Canada, they had ſtill farther incitement to continue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, and proſecute their vengeance.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of vigorous meaſures was now ſo preſſing, that parties were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched, one under Captain Noyes to Penacook, where they deſtroyed the corn, but the Indians eſcaped; another from Paſcataqua, under Captain Wincal, to Winnipiſeogee, whither the Indians had retired, as John Church, who had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at Cochecho and eſcaped from them, reported: One or two Indians were killed there, and their corn cut down. But theſe excurſions proved of ſmall ſervice, as the Indians had little to loſe, and could find an home wherever they could find game and fiſh.</p>
            <p>In the month of Auguſt Major Swaine, with ſeven or eight companies raiſed by the Maſſachuſetts government, marched
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:018344_0263_0FA5D42FEEA786F8"/>
to the eaſtward; and Major Church, with another party, conſiſting of Engliſh and Indians, from the colony of Plymouth, ſoon followed them. While theſe forces were on their march, the Indians, who lay in the woods about Oyſter river, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how many men belonged to Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's garriſon; and ſeeing them all go out one morning to work, nimbly ran between them and the houſe, and killed them all (being in number eighteen) except one who had paſſed the brook. They then attacked the houſe, in which were only two boys (one of whom was lame) with ſome women and children. The boys kept them off for ſome time and wounded ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them. At length the Indians ſet the houſe on fire, and even then the boys would not ſurrender till they had promiſed them to ſpare their lives. They perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly murdered three or four of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; one of them was ſet on a ſharp ſtake, in the view of its diſtreſſed mother, who with the other women and the boys were carried captive. One of the boys eſcaped the next day. Captain Garner with his company purſued the enemy, but did not come up with them.</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſetts and Plymouth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies proceeded to the eaſtward, ſettled
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:018344_0264_0FA5D430942E0BD0"/>
garriſons in convenient places, and had ſome ſkirmiſhes with the enemy at Caſco and Blue Point. On their return, Major Swaine ſent a party of the Indian auxiliaries under Lieutenant Flagg toward Winni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeogee to make diſcoveries. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians held a conſultation in their own language; and having perſuaded their lieutenant with two men to return, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of them tarried out eleven days longer; in which time they found the enemy, ſtaid with them two nights, and informed them of everything which they deſired to know; upon which the enemy retired to their inacceſſible deſerts,<note place="margin">Magnalia, lib. 7. p. 67.</note> and the forces returned without finding them, and in November were diſbanded.</p>
            <p>Nothing was more welcome to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed inhabitants of the frontiers than the approach of winter, as they then expected a reſpite from their ſufferings. The deep ſnows and cold weather were commonly a good ſecurity againſt an attack from the Indians; but when reſolutely ſet on miſchief, and inſtigated by popiſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, no obſtacles could prevent the execution of their purpoſes.</p>

American ſubjects of King William, with whom his maſter was at war in Europe. For this purpoſe he detached three parties of French and Indians from Canada in the winter, who were to take three different routes into the Engliſh territories. One of theſe parties marched from Montreal and deſtroyed Schenectada, a Dutch village on the Mohawk river, in the province of New-York. This action which happened at an unuſual time of the year, in the month of February, alarmed the whole country; and the eaſtern ſettlements were ordered to be on their guard.

The Indians then came up weſtward, and a party of them under Hoophood ſometime in May made an aſſault on Fox Point, [in Newington] where they burned ſeveral houſes, killed about fourteen people, and carried away ſix. They were purſued by the Captains Floyd and Greenleaf,<note place="margin">Mag lib. 7. p. 73.</note> who came up with them and recovered ſome of the captives and ſpoil, after a ſkirmiſh in which Hoophood was wounded and loſt his gun.

On the fourth day of July eight perſons were killed as they were mowing in a field near Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey river, and a lad was carried captive.

The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize was bold and hazardous; and had their ability been equal to the ardour of their patriotiſm, it might probably have been accompliſhed. Straining every nerve, they equipped an armament in ſome degree equal to the ſervice. What was wanting in military and naval diſcipline was made up in reſolution; and the command was given
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:018344_0271_0FA5D43B22F2E640"/>
to Sir William Phips, an honeſt man, and a friend to his country; but by no means qualified for ſuch an enterpriſe. Unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accidents retarded the expedition, ſo that the fleet did not arrive before Quebec till October; when it was more than time to return. It being impoſſible to continue there to any purpoſe; and the troops growing ſickly and diſcouraged, after ſome inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual parade, they abandoned the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
            <p>This diſappointment was ſeverely felt. The equipment of the fleet and army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a ſupply of money which could not readily be collected, and occaſioned a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per currency; which had often been drawn into precedent on like occaſions, and has proved a fatal ſource of the moſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and extenſive miſchief. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were almoſt diſpirited with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of poverty and ruin. In this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtate of the country, it was an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py circumſtance that the Indians volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily came in with a flag of truce,<note place="margin">Nov. 29.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a ceſſation of hoſtilities. A conference being held at Sagadahock, they brought in ten captives, and ſettled a truce till the firſt day of May, which they obſerved till the ninth of June;<note place="margin">1691.</note> when they attacked Storer's garriſon at Wells, but were brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The good effect of this regulation was preſently ſeen. A young man being in the woods near Cochecho, was fired at by ſome Indians. Lieutenant Wilſon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went out with eighteen men; and finding the Indians, killed or wounded the whole party excepting one. This ſtruck a terror, and kept them quiet the remainder of the winter and ſpring. But on the tenth day of June, an army of French and Indians made a furious attack

            <p>Sir William Phips, being now governor of Maſſachuſetts, continued the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of defence; keeping out continual ſcouts under brave and experienced officers. This kept the Indians ſo quiet that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one poor family which they took at Oyſter river, and ſome ſmall miſchief at Quaboag, there is no mention of any deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction made by them during the year 1693.<note place="margin">1693.</note> Their animoſity againſt New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was not quelled; but they needed a ſpace to recruit; ſome of their principal men were in captivity, and they could not hope to redeem them without a peace.<note place="margin">Aug. 11.</note> To obtain it, they came into the fort at Pemaquid; and there entered into a ſolemn covenant; wherein they acknowledged ſubjection to the crown of England; engaged to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the French intereſt; promiſed perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace; to forbear private revenge; to reſtore all captives; and even went ſo far as to deliver hoſtages for the due perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their engagements.

huſbandry being greatly impeded by the war. Frequent complaints were made of the burden of the war, the ſcarcity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and the diſpiritedneſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Once it is ſaid in the council minutes that they were even ready to quit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. The governor was obliged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs men to guard the outpoſts; they were ſometimes diſmiſſed for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and then the garriſon officers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account and ſeverely puniſhed: Yet all this time the public debt did not exceed four hundred pounds. In this ſituation they were obliged to apply to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for aſſiſtance; but this was granted with a ſparing hand. The people of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts were much divided and at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among themſelves, both on account of the new charter which they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from King William, and the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed witchcrafts which have made ſo loud a noiſe in the world. Party and paſſion had uſurped the place of patriotiſm; and the defence, not only of their neighbours, but of themſelves was neglected to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their malignant humours. Their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor too had been affronted in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, on the following occaſion.</p>
            <p>Sir William Phips, having had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Captain Short of the Nonſuch fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:018344_0275_0FA5D43E3A3970F8"/>
about the extent of his power as vice admiral, arreſted Short at Boſton, and put him on board a merchant ſhip bound for England, commanded by one Tay, with a warrant to deliver him to the ſecretary of ſtate. The ſhip put into Paſcataqua, and the Nonſuch came in after her. The lieutenant, Cary, ſent a letter to Hinckes, preſident of the council threatening to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſeamen if Short was not releaſed. Cary was arreſted and brought before the council, where he received a reprimand for his inſolence. At the ſame time Sir William came hither by land, went on board Tay's ſhip, and ſent the cabbin-boy with a meſſage to the preſident to come to him there; which Hinckes highly reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refuſed. Phips then demanded of Tay his former warrant, and iſſued ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanding the re-delivery of Short to him, broke open Short's cheſt, and ſeized his papers. This action was looked upon by ſome as an exertion of power to which he had no right, and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cite him before the council to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for aſſuming authority out of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.

(though Uſher had one, but was not preſent) and that no perſon belonging to the province had been injured,<note place="margin">MS in files.</note> adviſed the preſident to take no farther notice of the matter. Soon after this Sir William drew off the men whom he had ſtationed in this province as ſoldiers; and the council adviſed the lieutenant governor to apply to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Connecticut for men and proviſions; but whether this requeſt was granted does not appear.</p>

Influenced by the ſame pernicious councils, they kept a watchful eye on the frontier towns, to ſee what place was moſt ſecure and might be attacked to the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The ſettlement at Oyſter river, within the town of Dover, was pitched upon as the moſt likely place; and it is ſaid that the deſign of ſurprizing it was publickly talked of at Quebec two months before it was put in execution. Rumours of Indians lurking in the woods there-about made ſome of the people apprehend danger; but no miſchief being attempted, they imagined them to be hunting parties,<note place="margin">Magnalia, lib. 7. p. 86.</note> and returned to their ſecurity.

            <p>Oyſter river is a ſtream which runs into the weſtern branch of Paſcataqua; the ſettlements were on both ſides of it, and the houſes chiefly near the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Here were twelve garriſoned houſes ſufficient for the defence of the inhabitants, but apprehending no danger, ſome fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies remained at their own unfortified houſes, and thoſe who were in the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were but indifferently provided for defence ſome being even deſtitute of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The enemy approached the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, and halted near the falls on Tueſday evening, the ſeventeenth of July. Here they formed into two diviſions, one of which was to go on each ſide of the river and plant themſelves in ambuſh, in ſmall parties, near every houſe, ſo as to be ready for the attack at the riſing of the ſun; the firſt gun to be the ſignal. John Dean, whoſe houſe ſtood by the ſaw-mill at the falls, intending to go from home very early, aroſe before the dawn of day, and was ſhot as he came out of his door. This firing, in part, diſconcerted their plan; ſeveral parties who had ſome diſtance to go, had not then arrived at their ſtations; the people in general were immediately
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:018344_0279_0FA5D4412E61E6C0"/>
alarmed, ſome of them had time to make their eſcape, and others to prepare for their defence. The ſignal being given, the attack began in all parts where the enemy was ready.</p>
            <p>Of the twelve garriſoned houſes five were deſtroyed, viz. Adams's, Drew's, Edgerly's, Medar's and Beard's. They entered Adams's without reſiſtance, where they killed fourteen perſons; one of them, being a woman with child, they ripped open. The grave is ſtill to be ſeen in which they were all buried. Drew ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered his garriſon on the promiſe of ſecurity, but was murdered when he fell into their hands; one of his children, a boy of nine years old, was made to run through a lane of Indians as a mark for them to throw their hatchets at, till they had diſpatched him. Edgerly's was eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated; the people took to their boat, and one of them was mortally wounded before they got out of reach of the enemy's ſhot. Beard's and Medar's were alſo evacuated and the people eſcaped.</p>
            <p>The defenceleſs houſes were nearly all ſet on fire, the inhabitants being either killed or taken in them, or elſe in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to fly to the garriſons. Some eſcaped by hiding in the buſhes and other

ſecret places. Thomas Edgerly, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing himſelf in his cellar, preſerved his houſe, though twice ſet on fire. The houſe of John Buſs, the miniſter, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with a valuable library. He was abſent, his wife and family fled to the woods and eſcaped. The wife of John Dean, at whom the firſt gun was fired was taken with her daughter, and carried about two miles up the river, where they were left under the care of an old Indian while the others returned to their bloody work. The Indian complained of a pain in his head, and aſked the woman what would be a proper remedy: ſhe anſwered, Occapee, which is the Indian word for rum, of which ſhe knew he had taken a bottle from her houſe. The remedy being agreeable, he took a large doſe and fell aſleep; and ſhe took that opportunity to make her eſcape, with her child, into the woods, and kept concealed till they were gone.</p>
            <p>The other ſeven garriſons, viz. Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's, Bickford's, Smith's, Bunker's, Davis's, Jones's and Woodman's were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and ſucceſsfully defended. At Burnham's the gate was left open: The Indians, ten in number, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſurprize it, were aſleep under
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:018344_0281_0FA5D442E2FA6C08"/>
the bank of the river, at the time that the alarm was given. A man within, who had been kept awake by the tooth-ach, hearing the firſt gun, rouſed the people and ſecured the gate, juſt as the Indians who were awakened by the ſame noiſe were entering. Finding themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, they ran to Pitman's, a defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs houſe, and forced the door at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had burſt a way through that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the houſe which was next to the garriſon, to which he with his family, taking advantage of the ſhade of ſome trees, it being moonlight, happily eſcaped. Still defeated, they attacked the houſe of John Davis, which after ſome reſiſtance he ſurrendered on terms; but the terms were violated, and the whole family either killed or made captives. Thomas Bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford preſerved his houſe in a ſingular manner. It was ſituated near the river, and ſurrounded with a paliſade. Being alarmed before the enemy had reached the houſe, he ſent off his family in a boat, and then ſhutting his gate, betook himſelf alone to the defence of his fortreſs. Deſpiſing alike the promiſes and threats by which the Indians would have perſuaded him to ſurrender, he kept up a conſtant fire at them, changing his dreſs as often as he
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:018344_0282_0FA5D4436DAC9C98"/>
could, ſhewing himſelf with a different cap, hat or coat, and ſometimes without either, and giving directions aloud as if he had a number of men with him. Finding their attempt vain, the enemy withdrew, and left him ſole maſter of the houſe which he had defended with ſuch admirable addreſs. Smith's, Bunker's, and Davis's garriſons, being ſeaſonably appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the danger, were reſolutely defended, one Indian was ſuppoſed to be killed and another wounded by a ſhot from Davis's Jones's garriſon was beſet before day; Capt. Jones hearing his dogs bark, and imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wolves might be near, went out to ſecure ſome ſwine and returned unmoleſted. He then went up into the flankart and ſat on the wall. Diſcerning the flaſh of a gun, he dropped backward; the ball entered the place from whence he had withdrawn his legs. The enemy from behind a rock kept firing on the houſe for ſome time and then quitted it. During theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions the French prieſt took poſſeſſion of the meeting-houſe, and employed himſelf in writing on the pulpit with chalk; but the houſe received no damage.</p>
            <p>Thoſe parties of the enemy who were on the ſouth ſide of the river having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted their deſtructive work, collected in
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:018344_0283_0FA5D4474F668140"/>
a field adjoining to Burnham's garriſon, where they inſultingly ſhewed their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and derided the people, thinking themſelves out of reach of their ſhot. A young man from the centry-box fired at one who was making ſome indecent ſigns of defiance, and wounded him in the heel: Him they placed on a horſe and carried away. Both diviſions then met at the falls, where they had parted the evening before, and proceeded together to Capt. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's garriſon. The ground being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even, they approached without danger, and from behind a hill kept up a long and ſevere fire at the hats and caps which the people within held up on ſticks above the walls, without any other damage than galling the roof of the houſe. At length, apprehending it was time for the people in the neighbouring ſettlements to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in purſuit of them, they finally withdrew; having killed and captivated between ninety and an hundred perſons, and burned about twenty houſes, of which five were garriſons<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlevoix with his uſual parade boaſts of their having killed two hundred and thirty people, and burned fifty or ſixty houſes.

                  <p>Among theſe priſoners were Thomas Drew and his wife who were newly married. He was carried to Canada, where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued two years and was redeemed. She to Norridgwog, and was gone four years, in which ſhe endured every thing but death. She was delivered of a child in the winter, in the open air, and in a violent ſnow ſtorm. Being unable to ſuckle her child, or provide it any food, the Indians killed it. She lived fourteen days on a decoction of the bark of trees.

She was ſo overcome with the cold that ſhe grew ſleepy, laid down and was nearly dead, when they returned; they carried her ſenſeleſs to a wigwam, and poured warm water down her throat, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her. After her return to her huſband, ſhe had fourteen children; they lived together till he was ninety three and ſhe eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine years of age; they died within two days of each other and were buried in one grave.</p>

            <p>About forty of the enemy under Tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, a Norridgwog chief, reſolving on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief, went weſtward and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution as far as Groton.

As ſhe was in the field with her labourers,<note place="margin">Magnalia, lib. 7. p. 86.</note> the enemy fired from an ambuſh and killed her, with three others. Colonel Richard

Waldron and his wife with their infant ſon (afterward ſecretary) had almoſt ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame fate; they were taking boat to go and dine with this lady, when they were ſtopped by the arrival of ſome friends at their houſe; while at dinner they were informed of her death. She lived about two miles above the town of Portſmouth, and had laid out her farm with much ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. The ſcalps taken in this whole expedition were carried to Canada by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dokawando, and preſented to Count Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenac, from whom he received the reward of his treacherous adventure.</p>
            <p>There is no mention of any more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief by the Indians within this province till the next year, when,<note place="margin">1695.</note> in the month of July, two men were killed at Exeter. The following year,<note place="margin">1696.</note> on the ſeventh day of May, John Church, who had been taken and eſcaped from them ſeven years before, was killed and ſcalped at Cochecho, near his own houſe. On the twenty-ſixth of June an attack was made at Portſmouth plain, about two miles from the town. The enemy came from York-nubble to Sandy-beach in canoes, which they hid there among the buſhes near the ſhore. Some ſuſpicion was formed the day before by reaſon of the cattle running out of the
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:018344_0286_0FA5D44AE0C55FB0"/>
woods at Little-harbour; but falſe alarms were frequent and this was not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Early in the morning the attack was made on five houſes at once; fourteen perſons were killed on the ſpot, one was ſcalped and left for dead, but recovered, and four were taken. The enemy having plundered the houſes of what they could carry, ſet them on fire, and made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate retreat through the great ſwamp. A company of militia under Captain Shackford and Lieutenant Libbey purſued, and diſcovered them cooking their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, at a place ever ſince called Breakfaſt-hill. The Indians were on the farther ſide, having placed their captives between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the top of the hill, that in caſe of an attack they might firſt receive the fire. The lieutenant urged to go round the hill, and come upon them below to cut off their retreat; but the captain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in that caſe they would, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their cuſtom, kill the priſoners, ruſhed upon them from the top of the hill, by which means they retook the captives and plunder, but the Indians, rolling down the hill, eſcaped into the ſwamp and got to their canoes. Another party, under another commander, was then ſent out in ſhallops to intercept them as they ſhould
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:018344_0287_0FA5D44BB12953C0"/>
croſs over to the eaſtward by night. The captain ranged his boats in a line, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his men to reſerve their fire till he gave the watch-word. It being a calm night the Indians were heard as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; but the captain, unhappily giving the word before they had come within gun-ſhot, they tacked about to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and going round the Iſles of Shoals, by the favour of their light canoes eſcaped. The watch-word was Crambo, which the captain ever after bore as an appendage to his title<note n="*" place="bottom">The account of this tranſaction I had from the late Judge Parker, who had taken pains to preſerve it. It is mentioned, but not circumſtantially, by Dr. Mather. Magnalia, lib. 7. p. 89.</note>. On the twenty ſixth day of July, the people of Dover were waylaid as they were returning from the public worſhip, when three were killed,<note place="margin">Magnalia, lib. 7. p 89.</note> three wounded, and three carried to Penobſcot, from whence they ſoon found their way home.</p>
            <p>The next year on the tenth of June,<note place="margin">1697.</note> the town of Exeter was remarkably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from deſtruction. A body of the enemy had placed themſelves near the town, intending to make an aſſault in the morning of the next day. A number of women and children contrary to the advice of their friends went into the fields, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guard, to gather ſtrawberries. When
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:018344_0288_0FA5D44C5C219960"/>
they were gone ſome perſons, to frighten them, fired an alarm; which quickly ſpread through the town, and brought the people together in arms. The Indians ſuppoſing that they were diſcovered, and quickened by fear, after killing one, wounding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taking a child, made a haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and were ſeen no more there. But on the fourth day of July they waylaid and killed the worthy Major Froſt at Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,<note place="margin">Mag. lib. 7. p. 91. MS Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> to whom they had owed revenge ever ſince the ſeizure of the four hundred at Cochecho, in which he was concerned.</p>
            <p>The ſame year an invaſion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was projected by the French. A fleet was to ſail from France to Newfoundland and thence to Penobſcot, where being join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an army from Canada, an attempt was to be made on Boſton, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt ravaged from thence to Paſcataqua. The plan was too extenſive and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to be executed in one ſummer. The fleet came no further than Newfoundland, when the advanced ſeaſon, and ſcantineſs of proviſions obliged them to give over the deſign. The people of New-England were apprized of the danger, and made the beſt preparations in their power. They ſtrengthened their fortifications on the coaſt, and raiſed a body of men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:018344_0289_0FA5D44D1E9A9070"/>
the frontiers againſt the Indians who were expected to côoperate with the French. Some miſchief was done by lurking parties at the eaſtward; but New-Hampſhire was unmoleſted by them during the remainder of this, and the whole of the following year.</p>
            <p>After the peace of Ryſwick,<note place="margin">1698.</note> Count Frontenac informed the Indians that he could not any longer ſupport them in a war with the Engliſh, with whom his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was now at peace. He therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to bury the hatchet and reſtore their captives. Having ſuffered much by famine, and being divided in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about proſecuting the war, after a long time they were brought to a treaty at Caſco;<note place="margin">1699.</note> where they ratified their former engagements;<note place="margin">Januar. 7.</note> acknowledged ſubjection to the crown of England; lamented their former perfidy,<note place="margin">Mag. lib 7. p. 94.</note> and promiſed future peace and good behaviour in ſuch terms as the commiſſioners dictated, and with as much ſincerity as could be expected. At the ſame time they reſtored thoſe captives who were able to travel from the places of their detention to Caſco in that unfavourable ſeaſon of the year; giving aſſurance for the return of the others in the ſpring; but many of the younger ſort, both males and
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:018344_0290_0FA5D44DDF7325C0"/>
females, were detained; who, mingling with the Indians,<note place="margin">Hutchin. vol. 2. p. 110.</note> contributed to a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of enemies in future wars againſt their own country.</p>
            <p>A general view of an Indian war will give a juſt idea of theſe diſtreſſing times, and be a proper cloſe to this narration.</p>
            <p>The Indians were ſeldom or never ſeen before they did execution. They appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in the open field, nor gave proofs of a truly maſculine courage; but did their exploits by ſurprize, chiefly in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keeping themſelves hid behind logs and buſhes, near the paths in the woods, or the fences contiguous to the doors of houſes; and their lurking holes could be known only by the report of their guns, which was indeed but feeble, as they were ſparing of ammunition, and as near as poſſible to their object before they fired. They rarely aſſaulted an houſe unleſs they knew there would be but little reſiſtance, and it has been afterward known that they have lain in ambuſh for days together, watching the motions of the people at their work, without daring to diſcover themſelves. One of their chiefs who had got a woman's riding-hood among his plunder would put it on, in an evening, and walk into the ſtreets of Portſmouth,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:018344_0291_0FA5D44ED2CE83A0"/>
looking into the windows of houſes and liſtening to the converſation of the people.</p>
            <p>Their cruelty was chiefly exerciſed upon children, and ſuch aged, infirm, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent perſons as could not bear the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of a journey through the wilderneſs. If they took a woman far advanced in pregnancy their knives were plunged into her b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wels. An infant when it became troubleſome had its brains daſhed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next tree or ſtone. Sometimes to torment the wretched mother, they would whip and beat the child till almoſt dead, or hold it under water till its breath was juſt gone, and then throw it to her to comfort and quiet it. If the mother could not readily ſtill its weeping, the hatchet was buried in its ſkull. A captive weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his burden laid on his ſhoulders was often ſent to reſt the ſame way. If any one proved refractory, or was known to have been inſtrumental of the death of an Indian, or related to one who had been ſo, he was tortured with a lingering puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, generally at the ſtake, while the other captives were inſulted with the ſight of his miſeries. Sometimes a fire would be kindled and a threatening given out againſt one or more, though there was no intention of ſacrificing them, only to make
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:018344_0292_0FA5D45241E37988"/>
ſport of their terrors. The young Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans often ſignalized their cruelty in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing captives inhumanly out of ſight of the elder, and when inquiry was made into the matter, the inſulted captive muſt either be ſilent or put the beſt face on it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent worſe treatment for the future. If a captive appeared ſad and dejected he was ſure to meet with inſult; but if he could ſing and dance and laugh with his maſters, he was careſſed as a brother. They had a ſtrong averſion to Negroes, and generally killed them when they fell into their hands.</p>
            <p>Famine was a common attendant on theſe doleful captivities; the Indians when they caught any game devoured it all at one ſitting, and then girding themſelves round the waiſt, travelled without ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance till chance threw more in their way. The captives, unuſed to ſuch canine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts and abſtinences, could not ſupport the ſurfeit of the one nor the craving of the other. A change of maſters, though it ſometimes proved a relief from miſery, yet rendered the proſpect of a return to their home more diſtant. If an Indian had loſt a relative, a priſoner bought for a gun, a hatchet, or a few ſkins, muſt ſupply the place of the deceaſed, and be the father brother, or ſon of the purchaſer; and thoſe
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:018344_0293_0FA5D453DF22A460"/>
who could accommodate themſelves to ſuch barbarous adoption, were treated with the ſame kindneſs as the perſons in whoſe place they were ſubſtituted. A ſale among the French of Canada was the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py event to a captive, eſpecially if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſervant in a family; though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even there a priſon was their lot, till opportunity preſented for their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while the prieſts employed every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing art to pervert them to the popiſh religion, and induce them to abandon their country. Theſe circumſtances, joined with the more obvious hardſhips of travelling half naked and barefoot through pathleſs deſerts, over craggy mountains and deep ſwamps, through froſt, rain and ſnow, expoſed by day and night to the inclemency of the weather, and in ſummer to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous ſtings of thoſe numberleſs inſects with which the woods abound; the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs anxiety of mind, the retroſpect of paſt ſcenes of pleaſure, the remembrance of diſtant friends, the bereavements experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced at the beginning or during the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the captivity, and the daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of death either by famine or the ſavage enemy; theſe were the horrors of an Indian captivity.</p>

               <pb n="286" facs="unknown:018344_0294_0FA5D455AD6F2250"/>On the other hand, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that there have been inſtances of juſtice, generoſity and tenderneſs during theſe wars, which would have done honor to a civilized people.

The following additional one is taken from Capt. Hammond's MS Journal.
<q>April 13, 1677. The Indians Simon, Andrew and Peter burnt the houſe of Edward Weymouth at Sturgeon creek. They plundered the houſe of one Crawley but did not kill him, becauſe of ſome kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes done to Simon's grandmother.</q>

<q>carry children on their arms and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, feed their priſoners with the beſt of their proviſion, and pinch themſelves rather than their captives ſhould want food.</q>
When ſick or wounded they would afford them proper means for their recovery, which they were very well able to do by their knowledge of ſimples. In thus preſerving the lives and health of their priſoners, they doubtleſs had a view of gain. But the moſt remarkably fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable circumſtance in an Indian capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, was their decent behaviour to women. I have never read, nor heard, nor could find by enquiry, that any woman who fell

into their hands was ever treated with the leaſt immodeſty; but teſtimonies to the contrary are very frequent<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>Mary Rowlandſon who was captured at Lancaſter, in 1675, has this paſſage in her narrative, (p. 55.) "I have been in the midſt of theſe roaring lions and ſavage bears, that feared neither God nor man nor the devil, by day and night, alone and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eeping all ſorts together, and yet not one of them ever offered me the leaſt abuſe of unchaſtity in word or action."</p>
                  <p>Elizabeth Hanſon who was taken from Dover in 1724, teſtifies in her narrative, (p. 28.) that "the Indians are very civil toward their captive women, not offering any incivility by any indecent carriage."</p>
                  <p>William Fleming, who was taken in Pennſylvania, in 1755, ſays the Indians told him "he need not be afraid of their abuſing his wife, for they would not do it, for fear of offending their God (pointing their hands toward heaven) for the man that affronts his God will ſurely be killed when he goes to war." He farther ſays, that one of them gave his wife a ſhift and petticoat which he had among his plunder, and though he was alone with her, yet "he turned his back, and went to ſome diſtance while ſhe put them on." (p. 10.)</p>
                  <p>Charlevoix in his account of the Indians of Canada, ſays (letter 7.) "There is no example that any have ever taken the leaſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with the French women, even when they were their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners."</p>

Whether this negative virtue is to be aſcribed to a natural frigidity of conſtitution, let phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers enquire: The fact is certain; and it was a moſt happy circumſtance for our female captives, that in the midſt of all their diſtreſſes, they had no reaſon to fear from a ſavage foe, the perpetration of a crime, which has too frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced not only the perſonal but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character of thoſe who make large pretences to civilization and humanity.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The civil affairs of the province during the adminiſtrations of Uſher, Partridge, Allen, the Earl of Bellamont and Dudley, comprehending the whole controverſy with Allen and his heirs.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>JOHN Uſher, Eſquire, was a native of Boſton, and by profeſſion a ſtatione. He was poſſeſſed of an handſome fortune, and ſuſtained a fair character in trade. He had been employed by the Maſſachuſetts government, when in England, to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the purchaſe of the province of Maine, from the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and had thereby got a taſte for ſpeculating in landed intereſt. He was one of the partners in the million purchaſe, and had ſanguine expectations of gain from that quarter. He had rendered himſelf unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular among his coutrymen, by accepting the office of treaſurer, under Sir Edmund Androſſe, and joining with apparent zeal in the meaſures of that adminiſtration, and he continued a friendly connexion with that party,<note place="margin">Uſher's papers.</note> after they were diſplaced.</p>
            <p>Though not illnatured, but rather of an open and generous diſpoſition, yet he
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:018344_0297_0FA5D45918EDAEF0"/>
wanted thoſe accompliſhments which he might have acquired by a learned and polite education. He was but little of the ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and leſs of the courtier. Inſtead of an engaging affability he affected a ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his deportment, was loud in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and ſtern in command. Fond of preſiding in government, he frequently journied into the province, (though his reſidence was at Boſton, where he carried on his buſineſs as uſual,) and often ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the council when he had little or nothing to lay before them.

The reaſon why the commonalty of the people do not agree is becauſe 3 or 4 of the great landed men diſſuade them from it. The people have petitioned the king to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Boſton government, but it will not be for the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's intereſt to admit of that unleſs the king ſends a general governor over all.</q>
               </note>. The people perceived theſe views, and were aware of the danger. The tranſfer of the title from Maſon to Allen was only a change of names: They expected a repetition of the ſame difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under a new claimant. After the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they had hitherto made, it could not be thought ſtrange that men whoſe pulſe beat high for freedom, ſhould refuſe to ſubmit to vaſſalage; nor, while they were on one ſide defending their poſſeſſions againſt a ſavage enemy, could it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that on the other, they ſhould tamely ſuffer the intruſion of a landlord. Uſher's intereſt was united with theirs in providing for the defence of the country, and contending with the enemy; but when the propriety of the ſoil was in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſtood on oppoſite ſides; and as both theſe controverſies were carried on at the ſame time, the conduct of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple toward him varied according to the

They knew alſo that the Maſſachuſetts people were as averſe as themſelves from Allen's claim, which extended to a great part of their lands, and was particularly noticed in their new charter.</p>

Captain John Pickering, a man of a rough and adventurous ſpirit, and a lawyer, had gone with a company of armed men to the houſe of Chamberlayne, the late ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and clerk, and demanded the records and files which were in his poſſeſſion. Chamberlayne refuſed to deliver them without ſome legal warrant or ſecurity; but Pickering took them by force, and conveyed them over the river to Kittery. Pickering was ſummoned before the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, threatened and impriſoned, but for ſometime would neither deliver the books, nor diſcover the place of their conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs by order of the aſſembly and to ſome perſon by them appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.

               <note place="margin">1693.</note>Another favourite point with Uſher was to have the boundary between New-Hampſhire and Maſſachuſetts aſcertained: There were reaſons which induced ſome of the people to fall in with this deſire. The general idea was, that New-Hampſhire began at the end of three miles north of the river Merrimack; which imaginary line was alſo the boundary of the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing townſhips on each ſide. The people
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:018344_0301_0FA5D28E2B8576D8"/>
who lived, and owned lands near theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, pretended to belong to either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as beſt ſuited their conveniency; which cauſed a difficulty in the collecting taxes, and cutting timber. The town of Hampton was ſenſibly affected with theſe difficulties,<note place="margin">1695.</note> and petitioned the council that the line might be run.<note place="margin">Octob. 12.</note> The council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee of Hampton men to do it, and gave notice to the Maſſachuſetts of their intention;<note place="margin">Prov. files.</note> deſiring them to join in the affair.

Upon which the lieutenant-governor and council of New-Hampſhire cauſed the boundary line to be run from the ſea-ſhore three miles northward of Merrimack, and parallel to the river,<note place="margin">Brief of the caſe of N.

            <p>The only attempt made to extend the ſettlement of the lands during theſe times, was that in the ſpring of the year 1694, while there was a truce with the Indians. Uſher granted a charter for the townſhip of Kingſton to about twenty petitioners from Hampton. They were ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the dangers and difficulties of the ſucceeding hoſtilities, and many of them returned home within two years. After the war they reſumed their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:018344_0302_0FA5D28EDB8F30E8"/>
but it was not till the year 1725, that they were able to obtain the ſettlement of a miniſter. No other alterations took place in the old towns, except the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Great Iſland,<note place="margin">1693.</note> Little Harbour, and Sandy Beach, from Portſmouth, and their erection into a town by the name of New-caſtle; together with the annexation of that part of Squamſcot patent which now bears the name of Stretham, to Exeter, it having before been connected with Hampton.<note place="margin">Prov. files.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The lieutenant-governor was very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in theſe tranſactions, thinking them circumſtances favourable to his views, and being willing to recommend himſelf to the people by ſeconding their wiſhes ſo far as was conſiſtent with the intereſt he meaned to ſerve. The people, however, regarded the ſettling and dividing of townſhips, and the running of lines, only as matters of general convenience, and continued to be diſguſted with his adminiſtration. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated calls upon them for money were anſwered by repeated pleas of poverty, and requeſts for aſſiſtance from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring province. Uſher uſed all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with that government to obtain a ſupply of men to garriſon the frontiers; and when they wanted proviſions for the

garriſons, and could not readily raiſe the money, he would advance it out of his own purſe and wait till the treaſury could reimburſe it.</p>
            <p>For the two or three firſt years of his adminiſtration the public charges were provided for as they had been before, by an exciſe on wines and other ſpirituous liquors, and an impoſt on merchandize. Theſe duties being laid only from year to year,<note place="margin">1695.</note> Uſher vehemently urged upon the aſſembly a renewal of the act, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the duty to articles of export;<note place="margin">Nov. 7 &amp; 9.</note> and that a part of the money ſo raiſed might be applied to the ſupport of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The anſwer he obtained was, that
<q>conſidering the expoſed ſtate of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, they were obliged to apply all the money they could raiſe to their defence; and therefore they were not capable of doing any thing for the ſupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though they were ſenſible his honour had been at conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: They begged that he would join with the council in repreſenting to the king the poverty and danger of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that ſuch methods might be taken for their ſupport and preſervation as to the royal wiſdom ſhould ſeem meet.</q>
Being further preſſed upon the ſubject,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:018344_0304_0FA5D2905A886778"/>
they paſſed a vote to lay the propoſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for one year,

            <p>He had the mortification of being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his expectations of gain, not only from the people, but from his employer.

Partridge was a native of Portſmouth, a ſhipwright, of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mechanical genius, of a politic turn of mind, and a popular man. He was treaſurer of the province, and had been ill uſed by Uſher. Being largely concerned in trade he was well known in England, having ſupplied the navy with maſts and timber. His ſudden departure for England was very ſurprizing to Uſher, who could not imagine he had any other buſineſs than to ſettle his accounts.

The council voted an addreſs, and ſent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, of which Uſher was one, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to him at Boſton; and preparations were made for his reception in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;<note place="margin">July 31.</note> where he at length came and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his commiſſion to the great joy of the people, who now ſaw at the head of the government a nobleman of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed figure and polite manners, a firm friend to the revolution, a favourite of King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, and one who had no intereſt in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them.</p>
            <p>During the controverſy with Allen, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge had withdrawn; but upon this change he took his ſeat as lieutenant-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:018344_0313_0FA5D29C5A91B260"/>
and the diſplaced counſellors were again called to the board. A petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was preſented againſt the judges of the ſuperior court, and a proclamation was iſſued for juſtices of the peace and conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles only to continue in office, whereby the judges commiſſions determined. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Joſe was made ſheriff in the room of Ardell, and Charles Story ſecretary in the room of Sheaffe.</p>
            <p>The government was now modelled in favour of the people, and they rejoiced in the change, as they apprehended the way was opened for an effectual ſettlement of their long continued difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. Both parties laid their complaints before the governor, who wiſely avoided cenſuring either, and adviſed to a revival of the courts of juſtice, in which the main controverſy might be legally decided. This was agreed to, and the neceſſary acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed by an aſſembly, (who alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the earl with five hundred pounds which he obtained the king's leave to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) after about eighteen days ſtay he quitted the province, leaving Partridge, now quietly ſeated in the chair, to appoint the judges of the reſpective courts. Hinckes was made chief juſtice of the ſuperior court,<note place="margin">Council Records.</note> with Peter Coſſin, John Gerriſh and John

Plaiſted for aſſiſtants; Waldron chief ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the inferior court, with Henry Dow, Theodore Atkinſon and John Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>One principal object of the earl's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to fortify the harbour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the defence of the country in caſe of another war. He had recommended to the aſſembly in his ſpeech the building a ſtrong fort on Great Iſland, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">1700.</note> in his letters, aſſured them that if they would provide materials, he would endeavour to prevail on the king to be at the expence of erecting it.<note place="margin">June 6.</note> Col. Romer, a Dutch engineer, having viewed the ſpot, produced to the aſſembly an eſtimate of the coſt and tranſportation of materials, amounting to above ſix thouſand pounds. They were amazed at the propoſal; and returned for anſwer to the governor, that in their greateſt difficulties, when their lives and eſtates were in the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hazard, they were never able to raiſe one thouſand pounds in a year<note n="*" place="bottom">

No evidence appeared of his having obtained poſſeſſion. The work was to begin anew; and Waldron, being one of the principal landholders and moſt ſtrenuous oppoſers of the claim, was ſingled out to ſtand fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the controverſy with Allen, as his father had with Maſon.

He then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the king; who by an order in council granted him an appeal, allowing

<q>This declining to admit appeals to his majeſty in council, is a matter that you ought very carefully to watch againſt in all your governments. It is an humour that prevails ſo much in proprieties and charter colonies, and the INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCY they thirſt after is now ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that it has been thought fit thoſe conſiderations, together with other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt thoſe colonies, ſhould be laid before the parliament; and a bill has thereupon been brought into the houſe of lords for re-uniting the right of government in their colonies to the crown.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Before this letter was wrote the earl died at New-York,<note place="margin">March 5.</note> to the great regret of the people in his ſeveral governments, among whom he had made himſelf very popular.

            <p>The aſſembly of New-Hampſhire, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a fair opportunity,<note place="margin">Hutch. vol. 2. p. 131.</note> endeavoured as much as poſſible to provide for their own ſecurity;<note place="margin">Sept. 13.</note> and paſſed two acts, the one for confirming the grants of lands which had been made within their ſeveral town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips; the other for aſcertaining the bounds of them.

            </p>
            <p>The controverſy being carried before the king, both ſides prepared to attend the ſuit. Allen's age, and probably want of caſh, prevented his going in perſon; he therefore appointed Uſher to act for him, having previouſly mortgaged one half of the province to him,<note place="margin">Octob. 14.</note> for fifteen hundred pounds; Vaughan was appointed agent for the province,<note place="margin">1702.</note> and attorney to Waldron. It being a general intereſt, the aſſembly bore the expence,<note place="margin">May. 29</note> and notwithſtanding their pleas of poverty on other occaſions provided a fund, on which the agent might draw in caſe of emergency.</p>
            <p>In the mean time King William died and Queen Anne appointed Joſeph Dudley Eſq. formerly preſident of New-England,

            <p>When Allen's appeal came before the queen in council, it was found that his attorney had not brought proof that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had ever been legally in poſſeſſion;<note place="margin">Printed ſtate of Allen's ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, p. 9.</note> for want of this, the judgment reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Waldron was affirmed;<note place="margin">MS Copy of Lords Trade Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in 1753.</note> but the order of council directed that the appellant

               <pb n="312" facs="unknown:018344_0320_0FA5D2A2683BED40"/>While this appeal was depending a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was preſented to the queen, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Allen might be put in poſſeſſion of the waſte lands. This petition was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Sir Edward Northey attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who was ordered to report on three queſtions. viz. 1. Whether Allen had a right to the waſtes. 2. What lands ought to be accounted waſte. 3. By what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod her majeſty might put him into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. At the ſame time Uſher was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt to be re-appointed lieutenant-governor of the province. Upon this Vaughan entered a complaint to the queen, ſetting forth
<q>that Allen claimed as waſte ground not only a large tract of unoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied land, but much of that which had been long enjoyed by the inhabitants, as common paſture, within the bounds of their ſeveral townſhips. That Uſher, by his former managements and miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours when in office, had forced ſome of the principal inhabitants to quit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and had greatly haraſſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted all the reſt, rendering himſelf quite unacceptable to them. That he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the ſuits now depending, as on Allen's death he would in right of his wife be entitled to part of the eſtate. Wherefore it was humbly ſubmitted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:018344_0321_0FA5D2A316426CE0"/>
it would be proper to appoint, as lieutenant-governor, one whoſe intereſt and endeavour it would be to diſſeize the people of their ancient eſtates, and render them uneaſy; and it was prayed that no letters might be wrote to put Allen in poſſeſſion of the waſtes till the petitioner ſhould be heard by council.</q>
               <note place="margin">Uſher's papers.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Uſher's intereſt however prevailed.<note place="margin">1703.</note> The attorney-general reported, that
<q>Allen's claim to the waſtes was valid;<note place="margin">Januar. 28.</note> that all lands <hi>unincloſed and unoccupied</hi> were to be reputed waſte; that he might enter into and take poſſeſſion of them, and if diſturbed might aſſert his right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute treſpaſſers in the courts there; but that it would not be proper for her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to interpoſe, unleſs the queſtion came before her by appeal from thoſe courts; ſave, that it might be reaſonable to direct (if Allen ſhould inſiſt on it at the trials) that matters of fact be found ſpecially by the juries,<note place="margin">Superior Court files.</note> and that theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial matters ſhould be made to appear on an appeal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this Uſher obtained a ſecond commiſſion as lieutenant-governor; but was expreſly reſtricted from intermedling
<q>with the appointment of judges or juries,<note place="margin">July 26.</note> or otherwiſe, in matters relating to the

The people did not reliſh this re-appointment, nor did his ſubſequent conduct reconcile them to it. Upon his firſt appearance in council Partridge took his ſeat as counſellor;<note place="margin">Octob. 27.</note> but the next day deſired a diſmiſſion on account of a ſhip in the river which demanded his conſtant attention.

            <p>It had always been a favourite point with Uſher to get the books and files, which had been taken from Chamberlayne, lodged in the ſecretary's office. Among theſe files were the original minutes of the ſuits which Maſon had carried on, and the verdicts, judgments and bills of coſt he had recovered. As they were committed to the care of the recorder who was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the general court and removeable only by them, no uſe could be made of theſe papers but by conſent of the aſſembly.<note place="margin">Novem. 4.</note> When Uſher produced to the council an order from Whitehall that theſe records

            <p>Uſher ſucceeded but little better in his applications for money. He alledged that he had received nothing for his former ſervices, though they had given hundreds to Partridge; and complained that no houſe was provided for him to reſide in, which obliged him to ſpend moſt of his time at Boſton. The plea of poverty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand, was not forgotten in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe demands. But at length, upon his repeated importunity and Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's earneſt recommendation, after the aſſembly had refuſed making any proviſion for him, and the governor had expreſsly directed him to reſide at New-Caſtle, and exerciſe a regular command,<note place="margin">July 7.</note> it being a time of war; the council were prevailed upon to allow him two rooms in any houſe he could procure
"till the next meeting of the aſſembly,"
and to order <hi>thirty eight ſhillings</hi> to be given him for the expence of his "journey to and from Boſton."</p>
            <p>When Dudley acquainted the aſſembly with the royal determination in Allen's ſuits,<note place="margin">Feb. 10</note> they appeared tolerably ſatisfied
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:018344_0324_0FA5D2AAA3A38518"/>
with the equitable intention diſcovered therein; but begged him to repreſent to her majeſty that
<q>the province was at leaſt ſixty miles long and twenty wide, containing twelve hundred ſquare miles, that the inhabitants claimed only the property of the lands contained within the bounds of their townſhips, which was leſs than one third of the province, and had been poſſeſſed by them and their anceſtors more than ſixty years; that they had nothing to offer as a grievance if the other two thirds were adjudged to to Allen; but ſhould be glad to ſee the ſame planted and ſettled for the better ſecurity and defence of the whole; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al deſiring it might be conſidered how much time, blood and treaſure had been ſpent in ſettling and defending this part of her majeſty's dominion, and that the coſt and labour beſtowed thereon far exceeded the true value of the land ſo that they hoped it was not her majeſty's intention to deprive them of all the herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, timber and fuel, without which they could not ſubſiſt, and that the lands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the bounds of their townſhips was little enough to afford theſe neceſſary articles;<note place="margin">Records of the council and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> it not being uſual in theſe plantations to fence in

more of their lands than would ſerve for tillage, leaving the reſt unfenced for the feeding their cattle in common.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this plea, which was often alledged, Allen, by virtue of the queen's permiſſion,<note place="margin">Dec. 22, 1703.</note> had entered upon and taken poſſeſſion by turf and twig of the common land in each townſhip, as well as of that which was without their bounds,<note place="margin">Uſher's Papers.</note> and brought his writ of ejectment <hi>de novo</hi> againſt Waldron, and when the trial was coming on informed Governor Dudley thereof, that he might come into court and demand a ſpecial verdict agreeably to the queen's inſtructions. Dudley from Boſton informed the court of the day when he intended to be at Portſmouth, and directed the judges to adjourn the court to that day.<note place="margin">1704.</note> Before it came he heard of a body of Indians above Lancaſter,<note place="margin">Aug. 10.</note> which had put the country in ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It has been ſaid that he made very advantageous offers to Vaughan and Waldron if they would purchaſe his title; but that they utterly refuſed it. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſenſible that a door was ſtill open for litigation; and that after Allen's death they might, perhaps, meet with as much or more difficulty from his heirs, among whom Uſher would probably have a great influence: They well knew his indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable induſtry in the purſuit of gain, that he was able to harraſs them in law, and had great intereſt in England.

within lines already known and laid out, and which ſhould forthwith be reviſed; but that Allen and his heirs might peaceably hold and enjoy the ſaid great waſte, containing <hi>forty miles in length and twenty in breadth,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, at the heads of the four towns aforeſaid, if it ſhould ſo pleaſe her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and that the inhabitants of the four towns would be ſo far from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the ſettlement thereof, that they deſired the ſaid waſte to be planted and filled with inhabitants, to whom they would give all the encouragement and aſſiſtance in their power. That in caſe Allen would, for himſelf and heirs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quit claim, to the preſent inhabitants and their heirs, all that tract of land com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the bounds of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral towns, and warrant and defend the ſame againſt all perſons, free of mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, entailment and every other incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and that this agreement ſhould be accepted and confirmed by the queen; then they would lot and lay out to him and his heirs five hundred acres within the town of Portſmouth and New-Caſtle, fifteen hundred in Dover, fifteen hundred in Hampton and Kingſton, and fifteen hundred in Exeter, out of the common-ages

Maſon's title; King Charles's letter to the preſident and council of New-Hampſhire in 1680; the paragraph of Cranfield's commiſſion which reſpects Maſon's claim in 1682; the writ, verdict, judgment and execution againſt Major Waldron in 1683; the deciſion of the king in council againſt Vaughan in 1686; Dudley's writ of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorari in 1688; the fine and recovery in Weſtminſter-hall whereby the entail was cut off, and the conſequent deed of ſale to Allen in 1691; Sir Edward Northey's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in 1703; and evidence of Allen's taking poſſeſſion of the waſtes, and of his incloſing and occupying ſome land at Great Iſland. On this evidence, it was pleaded that the title derived from Maſon, and his poſſeſſion of the province, of which the lands in queſtion were part, was legal; that the appellee's poſſeſſion had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the appellant and thoſe from whom he derived his title, more eſpecially by the judgment recovered by Robert Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Major Waldron; and a ſpecial verdict was moved for, agreeably to the royal directions. The council on this ſide were James Meinzies and John Valentine.</p>
            <p>On Waldron's part was produced the deed from four Indian ſachems to Whele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright and others in 1629; and depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:018344_0332_0FA5D2B0A224D840"/>
taken from ſeveral ancient perſons who teſtified that they had lived with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Waldron when he began his plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Cochecho, about the year 1640, and aſſiſted him in building his houſes and mills, and that no perſon had diſturbed him in the poſſeſſion thereof for above forty years. To invalidate the evidence of the title produced on the oppoſite ſide, it was pleaded, That the alledged grant from the council of Plymouth to Maſon in 1629, was not ſigned; that livery and ſeizin were not endorſed on it as on other of their grants, and as was then the legal form; nor was it ever enrolled according to ſtatute: That the ſale of part of the ſame lands in 1628 to the Maſſachuſetts company, by an inſtrument ſigned and executed according to law, renders this ſubſequent grant ſuſpicious; and that his pretending to procure another grant of part of the ſame lands in 1635, was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he himſelf could not rely on the preceding one, nor was it credible that the ſame council ſhould grant the ſame lands twice, and to the ſame perſon: That the alledged grant in 1635 was equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; and that he muſt relinquiſh one or the other, it being contrary to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and uſage of law to rely on two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:018344_0333_0FA5D2B220157C58"/>
titles at once. It was urged,<note place="margin">1703.</note> That Waldron's poſſeſſion was grounded on a deed from the native lords of the ſoil, with whom his father had endeavoured to cultivate a friendly connexion; that he had taken up his land with their conſent, when the country was a wilderneſs; had cultivated it, had defended it in war at a great expence, and at the hazard of his life, which he finally loſt in the attempt; that the Indian deed was legally executed in the preſence of the factors and agents of the company of Laconia, of which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was one; that this was done with the toleration of the council of Plymouth, and in purſuance of the great ends of their incorporation, which were to cultivate the lands, to people the country and chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize the natives, for the honour and intereſt of the crown and the trade of England, all which ends had been purſued and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the appellee and his anceſtor. It was alſo alledged, that the writ againſt Major Waldron in 1683 was for
"lands and tenements,"
of which the quantity, ſituation and bounds were not deſcribed, for want of which no legal judgment could be given; that no execution had ever been levied, nor was the poſſeſſor ever diſturbed or amoved by reaſon thereof; and that
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:018344_0334_0FA5D2B2D7BD9360"/>
the copies produced were not atteſted,<note place="margin">1707.</note> no book of records being to be found. To invalidate the evidence of Maſon's poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it was obſerved, that he himſelf was never here in perſon; that all the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by his agents or ſucceſſors was only a factory for trade with the Indians, and principally for the diſcovery of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called Laconia; and that this was done in company with ſeveral other merchant-adventurers in London, who, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their goods erected a fort; but that this could not amount to a legal poſſeſſion, nor prove a title to the country, eſpecially as upon the failure of trade, the object of their enterprize, they quitted their factory, after a few years ſtay in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>As to the motion for a ſpecial verdict, it was ſaid that a jury could not find one, if they had no doubt of the law or fact, for the reaſon of a ſpecial verdict is a doubt either in point of law or evidence; nor was it conſiſtent with the privileges of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that a jury ſhould be <hi>compelled</hi> to find ſpecially. In addition to theſe pleas it was further alledged, that by the ſtatute law no action of ejectment can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained except the plaintiff, or thoſe under whom he claims, have been in poſſeſſion within twenty years; and if they have
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:018344_0335_0FA5D2B70244DB38"/>
been out of poſſeſſion ſixty years, then not only an ejectment, but a writ of right, and all other real actions are barred in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a ſubject, and that in ſuch caſes the right of the crown is alſo barred: and that by the ſtatute of 32 Hen. 8. ch. 9. It is enacted, that no perſon ſhall purchaſe any lands or tenements, unleſs the ſeller, or they by whom he claims, have been in poſſeſſion of the ſame or the reverſion or remainder thereof, or have taken the rents or profits thereof by the ſpace of one whole year next before ſuch bargain is made; and that the appellee and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, and no other perſon whatever had been in poſſeſſion of the premiſes, nor was it ever pretended by the appellant that the Maſons, of whom the purchaſe was made, were in poſſeſſion within one year, or at any time before the alledged purchaſe; that all the miſchiefs provided againſt by the above ſtatute have been experienced by the people of New-Hampſhire from the purchaſe made by the appellant's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the bare title of the propriety of the province. The council on this ſide were John Pickering and Charles Story.<note place="margin">Aug. 12.</note>

They returned the ſecond time with the ſame verdict; upon which the court ordered judgment to be entered, and that the defendant recover coſts of the appellant.

               <p>The war with the French and Indians, called Queen Anne's war. Concluſion of Dudley's and Uſher's adminiſtration.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE peace which followed the treaty of Ryſwick was but of ſhort duration, for the ſeeds of war were ready ſown both in Europe and America. Louis had proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pretender king of England, and his Governor Villebon had orders to extend his province of Acadia to the river Kennebeck, though the Engliſh court underſtood St. Croix to be the boundary between their territories and thoſe of the French The fiſhery was interrupted by French men of war, and by the orders of Villebon, who ſuffered no Engliſh veſſels to fiſh on the banks of Nova-Scotia. A French miſſion was eſtabliſhed, and a chapel erected at Norridgwog, on the upper part of Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, which ſerved to extend the influence of the French among the Indians. The governor of Canada, aſſuming the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their father and protector, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated them to prevent the ſettlement of the Engliſh to the eaſt of Kennebeck, and found ſome among them ready to liſten
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:018344_0338_0FA5D2BBE90962E8"/>
to his advice. The people in thoſe parts were apprehenſive of danger and meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a removal, and thoſe who had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoughts of ſettling there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.</p>
            <p>Things were in this poſture when Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley entered on his government. He had particular orders from England to rebuild the fort at Pemaquid; but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on the Maſſachuſetts aſſembly to bear the expence of it. However he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a viſit to the eaſtern country, and having notified his intention to the Indians, took with him a number of gentlemen of both his provinces<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hutchinſon has miſplaced this tranſaction by a year.</note>, and held a conference at Caſco with delegates from the tribes of Norridgwog,<note place="margin">1703.</note> 
               <note place="margin">June 20.</note> Penobſcot, Pigwacket, Pena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook and Amariſcoggin; who aſſured him that
<q>as high as the ſun was above the earth, ſo far diſtant was their deſign of making the leaſt breach of the peace.</q>
They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him a belt of wampum in token of their ſincerity, and both parties went to two heaps of ſtones which had formerly been pitched and called the <hi>Two Brothers,</hi> where the friendſhip was further ratified by the addition of other ſtones. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo declared, that although the French emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries among them had been endeavouring
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:018344_0339_0FA5D2BC9E8BA808"/>
to break the union, yet it was
<q>firm as a mountain, and ſhould continue as long as the ſun and moon.</q>
Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe fair appearances, it was obſerved that when the Indians fired a ſalute their guns were charged with ſhot; and it was ſuſpected that they had then formed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſeize the governor and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, if a party which they expected from Canada, and which arrived two or three days after, had come in proper ſeaſon to their aſſiſtance. However this might be, it is certain that in the ſpace of ſix weeks,<note place="margin">Auguſt 10.</note> a body of French and Indians, five hundred in number, having divided themſelves into ſeveral parties, attacked all the ſettlements from Caſco to Wells, and killed and took one hundred and thirty people, burning and deſtroying all before them<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hutchinſon takes no notice of this remarkable devaſtation, which is particularly related by Mr. Penhallon in his "wars of New-England." p. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>The next week (Auguſt 17) a party of thirty Indians under Captain Tom killed five people at Hampton village; among whom was a widow Muſſy, a noted ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er among the friends, and much lamented by them; they, alſo plundered two houſes; but the people being alarmed, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they fled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="unknown:018344_0340_0FA5D2BD63A3AC28"/>The country was now in terror and confuſion. The women and children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the garriſons. The men went armed to their work, and poſted centinels in the fields. Troops of horſe were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at Portſmouth and in the province of Maine. A ſcout of three hundred and ſixty men marched toward Pigwacket, and another to the Oſſapy Pond, but made no diſcoveries. Alarms were frequent, and the whole frontier country from Deeir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field on the weſt to Caſco on the eaſt was kept in continual terror by ſmall parties of the enemy.</p>
            <p>In the fall Col. March of Caſco made a viſit to Pigwacket, where he killed ſix of the enemy and took ſix more; this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the government to offer a bounty of forty pounds for ſcalps.</p>
            <p>As the winter came on the frontier towns were ordered to provide a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſnow-ſhoes; and an expedition was planned in New Hampſhire, againſt the head quarters of the Indians. Major Winthrop Hilton, and Captain John Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Exeter, Captain Cheſley and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Davis of Oyſter river, marched with their companies on ſnow-ſhoes into the woods; but returned without ſucceſs.

            <p>In May Col.

No ſuch great force as this appeared; but ſmall parties kept hovering on the out ſkirts. At Oyſter river they wounded William Taſker; and at Dover they laid in ambuſh for the people on their return from public worſhip, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily miſſed their aim. They afterward mortally wounded Mark Gyles at that place,<note place="margin">Auguſt 11.</note> and ſoon after killed ſeveral people in a field at Oyſter river, whoſe names are not mentioned.</p>
            <p>In the former wars New-Hampſhire had received much aſſiſtance from their
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:018344_0343_0FA5D2BFB8C6D5F8"/>
brethren of Maſſachuſetts; but theſe now remonſtrated to the governor that his other province did not bear their proportion of the charge for the common defence. The repreſentatives of New-Hampſhire urged, in reply, the different circumſtances of the two provinces; "moſt of the towns in Maſſachuſetts being out of the reach of the enemy, and no otherwiſe affected by the war than in the payment of their part of the expence, while this province was wholly a frontier by ſea and land, and in equal danger with the county of York, in which four companies were ſtationed, and the inhabitants were abated their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the public charges." They beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that twenty of the friendly Indians might be ſent to ſcout on their borders,<note place="margin">Council Rec.</note> which requeſt the governor complied with.</p>
            <p>In the winter, Col. Hilton with two hundred and ſeventy men,<note place="margin">1705.</note> including the twenty Indians, were ſent to Norridgwog on ſnow-ſhoes. They had a favourable ſeaſon for their march, the ſnow being four feet deep. When they arrived there, finding no enemy to contend with, they burnt the deſerted wigwams, and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The officers who went on this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition complained that they had only the pay of private ſoldiers.</p>

               <pb n="336" facs="unknown:018344_0344_0FA5D2C06CACC868"/>The late repairs of fort William and Mary at New-Caſtle were always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of as burdenſome to the people, and a repreſentation thereof had been made to the queen, who inſtructed Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley to preſs the aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts to contribute to the expence; as the river belonged equally to both provinces. They urged in excuſe that the fort was built at firſt at the ſole charge of New-Hampſhire to whom it properly belonged; that the whole expence of the repairs did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to what ſeveral of their towns ſingly paid toward the ſupport of the war for one year; that all the trade and navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the river, on both ſides, paid a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toward maintaining that fortreſs; and that they had been at great expence in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the frontiers of New-Hampſhire, and the parties who were employed in getting timber and maſts for her majeſty's ſervice; while New-Hampſhire had never contributed any thing to the ſupport of the garriſons, forces and guards by ſea, which were of equal benefit to them as to Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts. One thing which made New-Hampſhire more in favour with the queen was, that they had ſettled a ſalary on her governor, which the others never could be perſuaded to do. The repairs of the
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:018344_0345_0FA5D2C1160465F8"/>
fort, however, went on without their aſſiſtance, under the direction of Col. Romer; and when they were completed, a petition was ſent home for a ſupply of cannon, ammunition and ſtores.</p>
            <p>The next ſummer was chiefly ſpent in negotiating an exchange of priſoners; and Dudley had the addreſs to protract the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, under pretence of conſulting with the other governments about a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality propoſed by the governor of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, by which means the frontiers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral were kept tolerably quiet, although the enemy appeared once or twice in the town of Kittery. The line of pickets <note n="*" place="bottom">This line extended from the mill-pond on the ſouth, to the creek on the north ſide of the town. It croſſed the main ſtreet a few rods weſtward of the ſpot where the State Houſe now ſtands.</note> which incloſed the town of Portſmouth was repaired, and a nightly patrole eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on the ſeaſhore, from Rendezvous Point to the bounds of Hampton, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſurprize by ſea; the coaſt being at this time infeſted by the enemy's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers.</p>
            <p>During this truce, the inhabitants of Kingſton who had left the place, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to petition for leave to return to their lands; which the court granted on condition that they ſhould build a fort in the center of the town, lay out a parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:018344_0346_0FA5D2C5D708A310"/>
and ſettle a miniſter within three years. This laſt condition was rendered imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable by the renewal of hoſtilities.</p>
            <p>The governor of Canada had encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indians who inhabited the borders of New-England to remove to Canada, where being incorporated with the tribe of St. Francis, they have ever ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. By this policy they became more firmly attached to the intereſt of the French, and were more eaſily diſpatched on their bloody buſineſs to the frontiers of New-England, with which they were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Dudley, who was generally apprized of their movements, and kept a vigilant eye upon them, apprehended a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the winter; and gave orders for a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſcouting march, once a month, round the head of the towns from Kingſton to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon falls;<note place="margin">1706.</note> but the enemy did not appear till April; when a ſmall party of them attacked the houſe of John Drew at Oyſter river, where they killed eight and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two. The garriſon was near, but not a man in it: the women, however, ſeeing nothing but death before them, fired an alarm, and then putting on hats, and looſening their hair that they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like men, they fired ſo briſkly that the enemy, apprehending the people were
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:018344_0347_0FA5D2C7E38D97D0"/>
alarmed, fled without burning or even plundering the houſe which they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked. John Wheeler, meeting this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and miſtaking them for friendly Indians, unhappily fell into their hands and was killed with his wife and two children. Four of his ſons took refuge in a cave by the bank of the Little Bay, and though purſued by the Indians eſcaped unhurt.</p>
            <p>In July Colonel Schuyler from Albany gave notice to Dudley that two hundred and ſeventy of the enemy were on their march toward Paſcataqua, of which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately informed the people, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to cloſe garriſon, and one half of the militia to be ready at a minute's warning. The firſt appearance of this body of the enemy was at Dunſtable; from whence they proceeded to Ameſbury and Kingſton, where they killed ſome cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Hilton with ſixty four men march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Exeter; but was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without meeting the enemy. The reaſon he gave to the council for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſoon was the want of proviſion, there being none in readineſs at the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, notwithſtanding a law lately enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, enjoining it on every town to have ſtores ready and depoſited in the hands of their captains. For the ſame reaſon he had
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:018344_0348_0FA5D2C89F23CD40"/>
been obliged to diſcontinue a ſmall ſcout which he had for ſome time kept up. Hilton was ſo brave and active an officer that the enemy had marked him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and for this purpoſe a party of them kept lurking about his houſe, where they obſerved ten men to go out one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their ſcythes, and lay aſide their arms to mow; they then crept between the men and their guns, and ſuddenly ruſhing on them, killed four, wounded one, and took three; two only of the whole number eſcaped. They miſſed the major for this time, and two of their priſoners eſcaped; but ſuffered much in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, having nothing to ſubſiſt on for three weeks but lily roots and the rinds of trees. After this they killed William Pearl and took Nathaniel Tibbets at Dover.<note place="margin">Auguſt 10.</note> It was obſerved during this war that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did more damage in ſmall bodies than in larger, and by ſcattering along the frontiers kept the people in continual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and alarm; and ſo very few of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>In the following winter Hilton made another excurſion to the eaſtward, and a
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:018344_0349_0FA5D2C962DBD400"/>
ſhallop was ſent to Caſco with ſtores and proviſions for his party,<note place="margin">1707.</note> conſiſting of two hundred and twenty men. The winter being mild, and the weather unſettled, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their marching ſo far as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: cold dry weather and deep ſnow being moſt favourable to winter expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. However they came on an Indian track near Black Point, and purſuing it, killed four, and took a ſquaw who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to a party of eighteen,<note place="margin">Jan. 21.</note> whom they ſurprized as they lay aſleep on a neck of land at break of day, and of whom they killed ſeventeen and took the other. This was matter of triumph conſidering the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of finding their haunts. It was remarked that on the very morning that this affair happened it was reported, with but little variation from the truth, at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth though at the diſtance of ſixty miles.</p>
            <p>When Church went to Nova-Scotia he very earneſtly ſolicited leave to make an attempt on Port Royal; but Dudley would not conſent, and the reaſon he gave was, that he had written to the miniſtry in England and expected orders and naval help to reduce the place. His enemies however aſſigned another reaſon for his refuſal; which was that a clandeſtine trade was carried on by his connivance, and to his
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:018344_0350_0FA5D2CADF80A6C8"/>
emolument, with the French there. This report gained credit and occaſioned a loud call for juſtice.<note place="margin">Hutch. Hiſt. Maſſa. Vol 2. p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To wipe off theſe aſperſions he now determined to make an attack in earneſt on Port Royal, even though no aſſiſtance ſhould come from England. It was intended that an armament ſhould be ſent to America, and the commander was appointed; but the ſtate of affairs in Europe prevented their coming.</p>
            <p>Early in the ſpring the governor appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the aſſemblies of both his provinces, and to the colonies of Rhode Iſland and Connecticut, requeſting them to raiſe one thouſand men for the expedition. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut declined; but the other three raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole number, who were diſpoſed into two regiments, of which Colonel Wainwright commanded the one, and Colonel Hilton the other. They embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Nantaſket in twenty three tranſports furniſhed with whaleboats,<note place="margin">May 13·</note> under convoy of the Deptford man of war, Capt. Stuckley, and the province galley, Captain Southack. The chief command was given to Colonel March, who had behaved well in ſeveral
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:018344_0351_0FA5D2CBAE787048"/>
ſcouts and rencounters with the Indians, but had never been tried in ſuch ſervice as this.<note place="margin">May 26.</note> They arrived before Port Royal in a few days, and after burning ſome houſes, killing ſome cattle round the fort, and making ſome ineffectual attempts to bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard it, a jealouſy and diſagreement among the officers,<note place="margin">Penhallow p. 42.</note> and a miſapprehenſion of the ſtate of the fort and garriſon,<note place="margin">June 6 and 7.</note> cauſed the army to break up and reimbark in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly manner. Some of the officers went to Boſton for orders, ſome of the tranſports put in at Caſco; a ſloop with Captain Cheſley's company of ſixty men arrived at Portſmouth:<note place="margin">June 13.</note> Cheſley ſuffered his men to diſperſe,<note place="margin">Council Records.</note> but ordered them to return at the beat of the drum: Being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to account for this conduct he alledged that
<q>general orders were given at Port Royal for every man to make the beſt of his way home.</q>
The governor, highly chagrined and very angry, ſent orders from Boſton that if any more veſſels arrived the men ſhould not be permitted to come on ſhore "on pain of death." After a while he ordered Cheſley's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be collected and reimbarked, offering a pardon to thoſe who voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned, the reſt to be ſeverely puniſhed. By the latter end of July they got on board,
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:018344_0352_0FA5D2CC576B7FA8"/>
and with the reſt of the army, returned to the place of action. At the landing, an ambuſcade of Indians from among the ſedge on the top of a ſea-wall, greatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed the troops. Major Walton and Captain Cheſley, being then on ſhore with the New-Hampſhire companies, puſhed their men up the beach, flanked the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and after an obſtinate ſtruggle put them to flight. The command was now given to Wainwright, and the army put under the direction of three ſuperviſors; but no means could inſpire that union, firmneſs and ſkill which were neceſſary. By the laſt of Auguſt the whole affair was at an end, and the army returned ſickly, fatigued, diſheartened, and aſhamed; but with no greater loſs than ſixteen killed and as many wounded.</p>
            <p>While this unfortunate expedition was in hand, the frontiers were kept in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual alarm.<note place="margin">May 22.</note> Two men were taken from Oyſter river,<note place="margin">July 8.</note> and two more killed as they were driving a team between that place and Dover. Captain Sumerſby purſued with his troop and recovered the contents of the cart. Stephen and Jacob Gilman, brothers, were ambuſhed between Exeter and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton;<note place="margin">Penhallow p. 45.</note> their horſes were killed, but both
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:018344_0353_0FA5D2CD2350FC30"/>
of them eſcaped to the garriſon. King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, being a new plantation, was much expoſed, and was this ſummer weakened by the deſertion of eight men. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining inhabitants complained to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who ordered the captains of Exeter and Hampton to take them up as deſerters, and oblige them to return to the defence of their ſettlements, or do duty at the fort during the governor's pleaſure. They were afterward bound over to the ſeſſions for contempt of orders.<note place="margin">Council Rec.</note> The ſtate of the country at this time was truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed; a large quota of their beſt men were abroad, the reſt harraſſed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at home, obliged to continual duty in garriſons and in ſcouts, and ſubject to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſcipline for neglects. They earned their bread at the continual hazard of their lives, never daring to ſtir abroad unarmed; they could till no lands but what were within call of the garriſoned houſes, into which their families were crouded; their huſbandry, lumber-trade and fiſhery were declining, their taxes increaſing, their apprehenſions both from the force of the enemy and the failure of the Port Royal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition were exceedingly diſmal, and there was no proſpect of an end to the war, in which they were now advanced to the fifth ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:018344_0354_0FA5D2CDDA910680"/>
Yet under all theſe diſtreſſes and diſcouragements, they reſolutely kept their ground and maintained their garriſons, not one of which was cut off during the whole of this war, within the limits of New-Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Septem. 15.</note>In September one man was killed at Exeter,<note place="margin">— 17.</note> and two days after Henry Elkins at Kingſton. But the ſevereſt blow on the frontiers happened at Oyſter river, a place which ſuffered more than all the reſt. A party of French Mohawks painted red, attacked with an hideous yell a company who were in the woods, ſome hewing tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and others driving a team, under the direction of Captain Cheſley who was juſt returned the ſecond time from Port Royal. At the firſt fire they killed ſeven and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded another. Cheſley, with the few who were left, fired on the enemy with great vigour, and for ſome time check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ardor; but being overpowered, he at length fell. He was much lamented, being a brave officer. Three of the ſcalps taken at this time were ſoon after reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at Berwick.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1708.</note>The next year a large army from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada was deſtined againſt the frontiers of New-England. Dudley received infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it in the uſual route from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany,
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:018344_0355_0FA5D2CE97DF0DB0"/>
and immediately ordered guards in the moſt expoſed places of both his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. A troop under Captain Robert Coffin patroled from Kingſton to Coche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, and ſcouts were kept out continually. Spy-boats were alſo kept out at ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Paſcataqua and Winter harbours. Four hundred Maſſachuſetts ſoldiers were poſted in this province. The towns were ordered to provide ammunition, and all things were in as good a ſtate of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as could be expected. At length the ſtorm fell on Haverhill;<note place="margin">Aug. 29.</note> but the enemy's force having been diminiſhed by various accidents, they proceeded no farther, and every part of New-Hampſhire was quiet. Hilton made another winter march to Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wacket with one hundred and ſeventy men,<note place="margin">Penhallow 45, 48.</note> but made no diſcovery.</p>
            <p>The next ſpring William Moody,<note place="margin">1709.</note> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Stevens,<note place="margin">May 5.</note> and two ſons of Jeremy Gilman were taken at Pickpocket-mill in Exeter, and ſoon after Bartholomew Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſon was killed at Oyſter river.<note place="margin">June 30.</note> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Hilton and Captain Davis performed their uſual tour of duty in ſcouting, and the people this ſummer kept cloſe in garriſon, on a report that two hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had marched againſt them from Montreal. But the principal object now
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:018344_0356_0FA5D2CFA7B8BB50"/>
in view was a deſire of wiping off the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of a former year by an attempt, not on Port Royal, but on Canada itſelf. For this purpoſe ſolicitations had been made in England by Francis Nicholſon, Eſq. who had been lieutenant-governor of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and Captain Samuel Vetch a trader to Nova-Scotia, who was well acquainted with the French ſettlements there, and made a full repreſentation of the ſtate of things in America to the Britiſh miniſtry. An expedition being determined upon they came over early in the ſpring with the queen's command to the governors of the ſeveral provinces to raiſe men for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Vetch was appointed a colonel, and Nicholſon, by nomination of the governor of New-York, and conſent of the other governments, was made commander in chief. The people of New-Hampſhire were ſo much exhauſted, and their men had been ſo ill paid before, that it was with great difficulty, and not without the diſſolution of one aſſembly and the calling of another, that they could raiſe money to levy one hundred men and procure two tranſports for conveying them. After the utmoſt exertions had been made by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral governments, and Nicholſon with part of the troops had marched to Wood
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:018344_0357_0FA5D2D0324FC2C0"/>
creek, and the reſt with the tranſports had lain at Nantaſket three months wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a fleet, news arrived that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament promiſed from England was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to another quarter. Upon which the commander of the frigates on the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſtation refuſed to convoy the troops, the whole army was diſbanded, and the expence the colonies had been at was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. A congreſs of governors and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the aſſemblies met in the fall at Rhode-Iſland, who recommended the ſending home agents to aſſiſt Colonel Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon in repreſenting the ſtate of the country, and ſoliciting an expedition againſt Canada the next ſpring. The miniſtry at firſt ſeemed to liſten to this propoſal, but afterward changed their minds,<note place="margin">1710.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved only on the reduction of Port Royal. For this purpoſe Nicholſon came over in July with five frigates and a bomb ketch; the colonies then had to raiſe their quotas;<note place="margin">Auguſt. 1.</note> the New-Hampſhire aſſembly ordered one hundred men, who were got ready as ſoon as poſſible, and put under the command of Colonel Shadrach Walton. The whole armament ſailed from Boſton the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of September, and on the twenty-fourth arrived at the place. The force now being equal to its reduction, Suber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:018344_0358_0FA5D2D40DA95850"/>
the governor, waited only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of a few ſhot and ſhells as a decent pretence for a ſurrender; which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted on the fifth of October, and Vetch was appointed governor of the place which in honor of the queen was called Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis.<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Penhallow</note>
            </p>
            <p>While this expedition was in hand, and before the appointment of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, New-Hampſhire ſuſtained an heavy loſs in the death of Col. Winthrop Hilton. This worthy officer being concerned in the maſting buſineſs,<note place="margin">July 22.</note> and having ſeveral large trees felled about fourteen miles from home, went out with a party to peel the bark that the wood might not be injured by worms. While engaged in this buſineſs they were ambuſhed by a party of Indians, who at the firſt fire killed Hilton with two more, and took two; the reſt being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and their guns being wet, made no oppoſition, but eſcaped. The next day one hundred men marched in purſuit but diſcovered only the mangled bodies of the dead. The enemy in their barbarous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph had ſtruck their hatchets into the colonel's brains, and left a lance in his heart. He was a gentleman
<q>of good temper,<note place="margin">Penhallow p. 58.</note> courage and conduct, reſpected and lamented by all that knew him,</q>
               <pb n="351" facs="unknown:018344_0359_0FA5D2D58D260338"/>
and was buried with the honours due to his rank and character.</p>
            <p>Fluſhed with this ſucceſs, they inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared in the open road at Exeter, and took four children who were at their play. They alſo took John Wedgwood, and killed John Magoon near his brother's barn, a place which for three days he had viſited with a melancholy apprehenſion ariſing from a dream that he ſhould there be murdered.</p>
            <p>The ſame day that Hilton was killed, a company of Indians who had pretended friendſhip, who the year before had been peaceably converſant with the inhabitants of Kingſton, and ſeemed to be thirſting after the blood of the enemy, came into the town, and ambuſhing the road, killed Samuel Winſlow and Samuel Huntoon; they alſo took Philip Huntoon and Jacob Gilman, and carried them to Canada;<note place="margin">MS Letter of Ward Clark to Prince.</note> where, after ſome time, they purchaſed their own redemption by building a ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill for the governor after the Engliſh mode.</p>
            <p>The laſt that fell this ſummer was Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Garland, who was killed at Cochecho on his return from the public worſhip. As the winter approached, Colonel Walton with one hundred and ſeventy men traverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eaſtern ſhores, which the Indians
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:018344_0360_0FA5D2D7730CE8A0"/>
uſually viſited at this ſeaſon for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of gathering clams. On an Iſland where the party was encamped, ſeveral Indians decoyed by their ſmoke, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them for ſome of their own tribe, came among them and were made priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. One of them was a ſachem of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridgwog, active, bold and ſullen; when he found himſelf in the hands of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he would anſwer none of their queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and laughed with ſcorn at their threatening him with death. His wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eye witneſs of the execution of the threatening, was ſo intimidated as to make the diſcoveries which the captors had in vain deſired of the ſachem; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which three were taken at the place of which ſhe informed, and two more at Saco river, where alſo five were killed. This ſucceſs, inconſiderable as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, kept up the ſpirits of the people, and added to the loſs of the enemy who were daily diminiſhing by ſickneſs and famine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1711.</note>In the ſpring they renewed their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages on the frontiers in ſmall parties. Thomas Downs, John Church, and three more were killed at Cochecho; and on a ſabbath day ſeveral of the people there fell into an ambuſh as they were returning from public worſhip. John Horn was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:018344_0361_0FA5D2D8EDB3EBB0"/>
and Humphry Foſs was taken; but, by the determined bravery of Lieutenant Heard, he was recovered out of the hands of the enemy. Walton with two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies marched to the ponds about the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon; but the Indians had withdrawn,<note place="margin">Penhallow p. 60.</note> and nothing was to be ſeen but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted wigwams.</p>
            <p>After the reduction of Port Royal Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon went to England to ſolicit an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt Canada. The tory mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Queen Anne, to the ſurprize of all the whigs in England and America, fell in with the propoſal; and on the eighth of June Nicholſon came to Boſton with orders for the northern colonies to get ready their quotas of men and proviſion by the arrival of the fleet and army from Europe; which happened within ſixteen days; and while the ſeveral governors were holding a conſultation on the ſubject of their orders. A compliance with them in ſo ſhort a time was impoſſible; yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that could be done was done; the nature of the ſervice conſpiring with the wiſhes of the people, made the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments exert themſelves to the utmoſt. New-Hampſhire raiſed one hundred men, which was more than they could well ſpare; one half of the militia being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:018344_0362_0FA5D2D943A73DE0"/>
employed in guarding the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. They alſo voted them ſubſiſtence for one hundred and twenty ſix days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides providing for them on ſhore before their embarkation. Two tranſports were taken up at eight ſhillings per month per ton; and artillery ſtores were iſſued from the fort. The colony forces formed two regiments under the command of Vetch and Walton. The army which came from England were ſeven veteran regiments of the Duke of Marlborough's army, and a battalion of marines, under the command of Brigadier-General Hill, which, joined with the New-England troops made a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of about ſix thouſand five hundred men, provided with a fine train of artillery. The fleet conſiſted of fifteen ſhips of war from eighty to thirty-ſix guns, with forty tranſports and ſix ſtoreſhips under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Admiral Walker.<note place="margin">Penhallow p. 64.

But the ſanguine hopes of
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:018344_0363_0FA5D2DA295C9B98"/>
ſucceſs which had been entertained by the nation and the colonies were all blamed in one fatal night. For, the fleet having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ten leagues into the river St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in the night of the twenty third of Auguſt, the weather being thick and dark, eight tranſports were wrecked on Egg-Iſland near the north ſhore, and one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand people periſhed; among whom there was but one man who belonged to New-England. The next day the fleet put back, and were eight days beating down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt an eaſterly wind which would in two days have carried them to Quebec. After rendezvouſing at Spaniſh river in the iſland of Cape Breton, and holding a fruitleſs conſultation about annoying the French at Placentia, the expedition was broken up: the fleet returned to England, and the New-England troops to their homes. Loud complaints and heavy charges were made on this occaſion; the ignorance of the pilots; the obſtinacy of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; the detention of the fleet at Boſton; its late arrival there; the want of ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able orders;<note place="margin">Dummer's defence &amp; letter to a noble lord.</note> and the ſecret intentions of the miniſtry, were all ſubjects of bitter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation: but the miſcarriage was never regularly enquired into,<note place="margin">Octob. 9.</note> and the voyage was finally ſettled by the blowing up of

               <note place="margin">1712.</note>The failure of this expedition encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Indians to harraſs the frontiers as ſoon as the ſeaſon would permit. In April one Cunningham was killed at Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter; Enſign Tuttle at Dover, and Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Crommet at Oyſter river; on one of the upper branches of this ſtream the enemy burned a ſaw-mill with a large quantity of boards. A ſcouting party who went up the river Merrimack had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſurprize and kill eight Indians and recover a conſiderable quantity of plunder, without the loſs of a man. The frontiers were well guarded; one half of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia did duty at the garriſons and were ready to march at a minute's warning; a ſcout of forty men kept ranging on the heads of the towns, and the like care was taken by ſea, ſpy-boats being employed in coaſting from Cape Neddock to the Great Boar's-head. Notwithſtanding this vigilance, ſmall parties of the enemy were frequently ſeen. Stephen Gilman and Ebenezer Stevens were wounded at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, the former was taken and put to death.<note place="margin">

two children of John Waldron were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and for want of time to ſcalp them, their heads were cut off. There being no man at that time in Heard's garriſon, a woman named Eſther Jones mounted guard and with a commanding voice call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo loudly and reſolutely as made the enemy think there was help at hand, and prevented farther miſchief.</p>
            <p>In autumn the news of the peace of Utrecht arrived in America; and on the 29th of October the ſuſpenſion of arms was proclaimed at Portſmouth. The Indians being informed of this event came in with a flag of truce to Captain Moody at Caſco, and deſired a treaty; which the governor,<note place="margin">1713.</note> with the council of each province, held at Portſmouth,<note place="margin">July 11.</note> where the chiefs and deputies of the ſeveral belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent tribes, by a formal writing under hand and ſeal, acknowledged their perfidy, promiſed fidelity, renewed their allegiance, ſubmitted to the laws,<note place="margin">Penhallow p. 72, 80.</note> and begged the queen's pardon for their former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. The frequent repetition of ſuch engagements and as frequent violations of them, had by this time much abated the ſenſe of obligation on the one part, and of confidence on the other. But it being for the intereſt of both parties to be at peace, the event was peculiarly welcome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="unknown:018344_0366_0FA808F277C217F8"/>To preſerve the dependence of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and to prevent all occaſions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, private traffic with them was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and truck houſes eſtabliſhed at the public expence; and the next ſummer a ſhip was fitted out by both provinces,<note place="margin">1714.</note> and ſent to Quebec, where an exchange of priſoners was effected.</p>
            <p>During the whole of this long war, Uſher behaved as a faithful ſervant of the crown; frequently coming into the province by Dudley's direction, and ſometimes reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it ſeveral months, enquiring into the ſtate of the frontiers and garriſons, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting them in perſon, conſulting with the officers of militia about the proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of defence and protection, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his ſervice on all occaſions: Yet his auſtere and ungracious manners, and the intereſt he had in Allen's claim, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevented him from acquiring that popularity which he ſeems to have deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He was ſolicitous to ſupport the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his commiſſion; but could never prevail with the aſſembly to ſettle a ſalary upon him. The council generally paid his travelling expences by a draught on the treaſury, which never amounted to more than five pounds for each journey, until he came from Boſton to proclaim
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:018344_0367_0FA5D2DC452D9790"/>
the acceſſion of King George; when in a fit of loyalty and good humour they gave him ten pounds, which ſerved as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for two or three other grants. He often complained, and ſometimes in harſh and reproachful terms of their neglect;<note place="margin">Coun. Rec.</note> and once told them that his
<q>Negro ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were much better accommodated in his houſe than the queen's governor was in the queen's fort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dudley had the good fortune to be more popular. Beſide his attention to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral intereſt of the province and his care for its defence, he had the particular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of favouring the views of thoſe who were moſt ſtrongly oppoſed to Allen's claim; and they made him amends by promoting in the aſſembly addreſſes to the queen, defending his character, when it was attacked and praying for his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in office when petitions were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for his removal. One of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes was in one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſix, and another in one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeven, in both which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him as a "prudent, careful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful governor," and ſay they
<q>are perfectly ſatisfied with his diſpoſal of the people, and their arms and the public money.</q>

Uſher had ſome ſcruples about the validity of it as he had formerly had of Partridge's, and wrote on the ſubject to the aſſembly, who aſſured him that on inſpection they had found Vaughan's commiſſion

               <p>RIGHT honourable, right worſhippful and the reſt, my humble ſervis rembred. Your letter dated the 5th of December and Mr. Ares letter the third of April I received the ſeventh of June. The detaining of the former letter hath put you to a great charge in the plantation. For my care and paines I have not thought it much although I have had very little encouradgement from you and here. I do not doubt of your good will unto mee. For your fiſhing, you complain of Mr. Gibbes: A Londoner is not for fiſhing, neither is there any amity betwixt the Weſt cuntrimen and them. Briſto or Barnſtable is very convenient for your fiſhing ſhipes. It is not enough to ſit out ſhipes to fiſh but they muſt be ſure (God wil) to be at their fiſhing place the beginning of February and not to come to the land when other men have half their viage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wanerton hath the charge of the houſe at Paſcatawa and hath with him William Cooper, Rafe Gee, Roger Knight, and his wife, William Dermit and on boy. For your houſe at Newichwanicke, I ſeeing the neceſſity wil doe the beſt I can there and elſewhere for you until I hear from you againe. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe I have ſent but not knowing your intentes I cannot wel enlarge but I refer you to Mr. Herbert and Mr. Vaughan. For my ſettlement at Sanders-Point and the further good you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me I humbly thank you I ſhall do the beſt I can to be grateful. I have taken into my handes all the trade goods that remains of John Raymon's and Mr. Vaughan's and will with what convenience I may put them of. <hi>You complain of
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018344_0377_0FA5D2E5780969C8"/>
your returnes; you take the coorſe to have little; a plantation muſt be furniſhed with cattle and good hir'd hands and neceſſaries for them and not thinke the great lookes of men and many words wil be a meanes to raiſe a plantation.</hi> Thoſe that have been here this three year ſom of them have neither meat money nor clothes, a great diſparagement. I ſhall not need to ſpeak of this, you ſhall hear of it by others. For myſelf, my wife and child and four men we have but half a barrel of corn; beefe and porke I have not had but on peeſe this three months, nor beare this four months; for I have for two and twenty months had but two barrels of beare and two barrels and four booſhel of malt, our number commonly hath bin ten.

                  </gap>y nor clothes, I have bin as ſparing as I could, but it will not doe. Theſe four men with me is Charles Knell, Thomas Clarke, Steven Kidder, and Thomas Crockitt, three of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> have for their wages until the firſt of March four pounds per peeſe and the other for the yeare ſix pounds which in your behalf I have promiſed to ſatisfy in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or bever at ten ſhillings per pound. If there were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys for them for clothing there would not bee much for them to receave. You may perhaps think that fewer men would ſerve me but I have ſometimes on C [<hi>one hundred</hi>] or more Indians and far from neybors: Theſe that I have I can ſet to pale in ground for corne and garden. I have digged a wel within the palizado, where is good water, I have that to cloſe with timber. More men I could have and more employ, but I reſt thus until I heare from you. <hi>The vines that were planted will com to little, they proſper not in the ground they were ſet,</hi> them that groo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural are veri good of divers ſorts. I have ſent you a note of the beaver taken by me at Newichwanicke, and how it hath gon from me. George Vaughan hath a note of all the trade goodes in my cuſtody of the old ſtore John Ramon's and George Vaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's accomtes, but the beaver beinge diſpoſed of before I could make the devident I canot ſee but it muſt be all onpackt and be devided by you. The governor departed from the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the fifteenth of July in the morning. So for this time I end, committing you to the protection of the Almighty and ever reſt your loving ſervant,</p>

And North-ham is the bounds of all the land of Hilton's Point ſide. And the other land from the little river between the two Boores-Heds to run by the ſea till it meets with the line between the Maſſachuſetts and you, and ſo to run from the ſea by ſaid Maſſathuſetts line into the woods eight miles and from thence atwart the woods to meete with Portſmouth line neere Wheleright's creeke and that tracte of land to be called <hi>Hampton.</hi> So that their is foure towns named as you deſired but Exeter is not within the bounds of your pattents. But the grete dificulty is the agreement about the dividing line between the pattent of the twenty thouſand acres belonging to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Laconyah and the pattent of Bluddy poynt the river running ſo intrycate, and Bluddy poynt pattent bounds from thence to Squamſcutt falls to run three miles into the woods from the water ſide. But for your better underſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee have ſent you a draft of it according to our beſt ſkill of what we know of it at preſent, and have drawn a dividing line between the two pattents, ſo that Portſmouth is part of both pattents and Hampton we apprehend will be holly in the twenty thouſand acres pattent, and North-ham is the bounds of Hilton's point pattent. If what wee have don be to your likinge wee ſhall think our time well ſpent and what further commands you will pleaſe to lay on us we ſhall readily obeye

               <p>YOUR worſhip have done well in ſetting forward your plantacon, and for your milles they will prove benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unto you, by God's aſſiſtance. I would you had taken this coorſe ſooner, for the marchants I ſhall be very cant you ſe how I deale with any of them while I live. But God's will be done. I and the world doth judge that I could not in theſe my dayes have ſpent my time for noethinge. For their ſending trade and ſupport I deſire it not. I have ſupported but now ſonke under my burthen, the more I thinke on this, the more is my griefe.</p>
               <p>I have received the hogſd. of mault that you ſent me, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you humble thanks for the ſame. The ſervants that were with me are diſcharged and payd their wages for the yeare paſt and I have delivered unto Mr. Wannerton 43lb. of beaver to pay thoſe that were with him for the year paſt. For the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſervants there old wages or the dividing of the goods I expect a general letter, if not, then to heare further from your worſhippe. Your carpenters are with me and I will further them the beſt I can. Capt. Neale appoynted me two of your goats to keepe, at his departinge, I praiſe God they are 4. Of the goods that Mr. Bright left I onely reed. of Capt. Neale 4 buſhells of mault and at ſeveral times 8 gallons of ſacke, and from Mr. Wannerton 7 buſhells and 1 peck of mault, 5 lb. and ½ of ſugar and 3 pr. of children ſtockings and 97 lb of beefe which was of an old cow that Mr. Wannerton killed, being doubtfull that ſhe would not live over the winter. For theſe I will pay Mr. Jocelin for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I percieve you have a great mynd to the lakes, and I as great a will to aſſiſt you. If I had</hi> 2 <hi>horſes and</hi> 3 <hi>men with me I would by God's helpe ſoon reſolve you of the ſituation of it, but not to live there myſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pide-Cow arrived the 8th of Julie, the 13th day ſhe caſt anchor ſome halfe a mile from the falls, the 18th day the ſhippe unladen, the 10th fell downe the river, the 22d day the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters began about the mill, the 5th of Auguſt the <hi>iron ſtoane</hi> taken in the ſhippe. There is of 3 ſorts, on ſort that the myne doth caſt fourth as the tree doth gum, which is ſent in a rundit. On of the other ſortes we take to be very rich, there is great ſtore of it. For the other I know not; but may it pleaſe you to take notice of the waight and meaſure of every ſort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it goeth into the furnace and what the ſtone of ſuch weight
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:018344_0383_0FA5D2E9AB1D27B8"/>
and meaſure will yeeld in iron. This that 'e take to be the beſt ſtone is one mile to the ſouthward of the great houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">The great houſe ſtood oppoſite to the houſe of Mr. Temple Knight.</note>, it is ſome 200 rodd in length 6 foote wide, the depth we know not, for want of tools for that purpoſe we tooke onely the ſurface of the mine.</p>
               <p>I have paled in a piece of ground and planted it. If it pleaſe God to ſend us a drie time I hope there will be 8 or 10 quarters of corne. You have heare at the great houſe 9 cowes, 1 bull, 4 calves of the laſt yeare and 9 of this yeare; they prove very well, farre better than ever was expected, they are as good as your ordinary cattel in England, and the goats prove ſome of them very well both for milk and breed. If you did ſend a ſhippe for the Weſtern Iſlands of ſix ſcore tunne or thereabouts for cowes and goates it would be profitable for you. A ſtocke of iron worke to be put away with your boardes from the mill will be good, nayles, ſpikes, lockes, hinges, iron works for boats and pinaces, twine canvis, needles and cordage, pitch and tarre, graples, ankers, and neceſſarys for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Sr, I have written unto Mr. John Round to repair unto your worſhip; he is a ſilver ſmith by his trade but hath ſpent much time and means about iron, may it pleaſe you to ſend for him, he dwelleth in Mogul ſtreet, if you are acquainted with any finer or mettle man enquire of him and as you ſee cauſe ſend for him, he is well ſeene in all mineralls; if you deale with him he will give you a good light for your proceedings.</p>
               <p>The 6th of Auguſt, the ſhippe ready to ſet ſayle for Saco to load cloave bords and pipe ſtaves. A good huſband with his wife to tend the cattle and to make butter and cheeſe will be profitable, for maides they are ſoone gone in this country. For the reſt I hope Mr. Jocelyn for your own particulars will ſatisfye you for I have not power to examen it. This with my humble ſervice to your worſhip, I reſt,</p>

Maſon, grandfather to Robert Maſon one of the peticoners, and Edward Godfrey another of the peticoners, by virtue of ſeveral letters pattents under the great ſeale of England granted unto them and others by your majeſties late royal father, by themſelves and their aſſignes have been in actual and quiet poſſeſſion of ſeveral tracts, parſells and diviſions of land in New-England, as in and by the ſaid letters patents is particularly expreſſed, and that the ſaid Capt. Jno. Maſon and the ſaid Edward Godfrey did expend and lay out conſiderable ſums of money in ſettling plantacons and collonys there; That the ſaid Edward Godfrey has lived there for five and twenty yeares, having undergone and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the office of governor of the province of Mayne with much reputacon of integrity and juſtice, endeavouring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulacon and government of thoſe partes where he lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known and ſettled lawes of this kingdome; That notwithſtanding, the ſaid Edward Godfrey has not only been turned out of his ſaid place of governor, butt has been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outed and diſpoſſeſſed of his lands and eſtate in that country, which the inhabitants of the Maſſachuſetts have forcibly ſeized and ſtill doe detayne the ſame from him; That it appears as well by teſtimony of witneſſes as by a coppy of the letters pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents that they were not to act any thing repugnant to the lawes of England, nor to extend their bounds and limits of the ſaid corporacon farther than three miles northward of Merrymacke river, and as a memorial and evidence thereof, the governor of the Maſſachuſetts did ſett up an houſe about thirty yeares ſince, which is called <hi>the bound houſe,</hi> and is knowne by that name to this day, and with this diviſion and aſſignment or lort of land the inhabitants and pattentees of the ſaid corporacon of the Maſſachuſetts reſted content for the ſpace of ſixteen years together, until about the year 1652 they did enlarge and ſtretch their line about threeſcore miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their known and ſettled bounds aforeſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:018344_0386_0FA5D2EBE57C7368"/>It appears further by the witneſſes that the collony of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts has for theſe many years paſt endeavoured to modell and contrive themſelves into a free ſtate or commonwealth without any relacon to the crowne of England, aſſuming on themſelves the name and ſtile of a commonwealth, iſſuing of writs in their owne name, impoſing of oathes to be true unto themſelves contrary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That by reaſon of the premiſes the ſaid Rob.

the third day of November, in the eighteenth yeare of his reigne, give, grant and confirm unto ſeveral of the principal nobility and gentry of this kingdome by the name of the councell of New-England, their ſucceſſors and aſſignes forever, all the land in America lying between the degrees of 40 and 48 north latitude, by the name of New-England, to be held in ſee, with many royal privileges and immunities, only paying to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors, one fift part of all the oare of gold and ſilver that ſhould at any time be found upon the ſaid lands, as by the ſaid letters patents doth at large appeare.</p>
               <p>That John Maſon, eſq. your petitioner's grandfather, by virtue of ſeveral grants from the ſaid councell of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, under theire common ſeale, bearing date the 9th of March 1621, the 10th of Auguſt 1622, the 7th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1629, and the 22d of April 1635, was inſtated in fee in a great tract of land in New-England by the name of New-Hampſhire, lyeing upon the ſea-coaſt between the rivers of Naumkeek and Patcataway, and running up into the land weſtward threeſcore miles, with all the iſlands lying within five leagues diſtance of any part thereof, and alſo the ſouth halfe of the Iſles of Shoals; and alſo the ſaid John Maſon together with Sir Ferdinando Gorges, knt. was enfeoffed by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid councell of New-England in other lands by the name of Laconia by their deed beareing date the 27th day of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1629, the ſaid lands lyeing and bordering upon the great lakes and rivers of the Iroquois and other nations adjoining. All which ſaid lands to be held as fully, freely, in as large, ample and beneficial manner and forme to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes whatſoever as the ſaid councell of New-England by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his majeſty's ſaid letters patents might or ought to hold and enjoy the ſame, as by the ſaid ſeveral grants appeares.</p>
               <p>Whereupon your petitioner's ſaid grandfather did expend upwards of twenty two thouſand pounds in tranſporting peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, building houſes, forts, and magazines, furniſhing them with great ſtore of armes of all ſorts, with artillery great and ſmall, for defence and protection of his ſervants and tenants, with all other neceſſary commodities and materialls for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſettled plantation.</p>

               <p>At laſt the complaints of the oppreſſed ſubjects reaching the eares of your royal father, his mageſty cauſed the whole matter to be examined before his moſt honourable privy councell and all being fully proved, his majeſty did command the councell of New-England to give an account by what authority, or by whoſe procurement thoſe people of the Maſſachuſetts Bay were ſent over, his majeſty concieving the ſaid councell to be guilty thereof.</p>
               <p>But the ſaid councell of New-England made it plainley to appear to his majeſty that they were ignorant of the whole matter and that they had noe ſhare in the evills committed and wholly diſclaimed the ſame, and the ſaid councell finding they had not ſufficient means to give redreſs and rectify what was bro't to ruine, they humbly referred to his majeſty to doe therein as he pleaſed and thereupon the ſaid councell of New-England reſolved to reſign, and did actually reſigne the great charter of New-England into his majeſty's royal handes, ſeeing there was an abſolute neceſſity for his majeſty to take the management of that country to himſelf, it being become a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of high conſequence and only to be remedied by his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power, all which appears by the declaration of the councell of New-England dated the 25th of April, 1635, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the act of ſurrender of the great charter of New-England dated the 7th day of June, the ſame year</p>
               <p>That immediately thereupon, his majeſty in trinity terme 1635, cauſed a quo warranto to be brought up by Sir John Banks his majeſty's then attorney general againſt the governor, deputy governor and every of the aſſiſtants of the ſaid corporation of Maſſachuſetts in New-England ſeverally, according to their names mentioned in the ſaid patents of incorporation, being

               <p>IN the yeare of our Lord 1628, in the third yeare of his late majeſty Charles the firſt, of happy memory, ſeveral loyal and piouſly diſpoſed gentlemen obtained of the great council of New-England, a grant of a certain tract of land lying in New-England, deſcribed and bounded as therein expreſſed; which was in all reſpects fairly and openly procured and with ſo good an intent of propagating the goſpel among the natives, and to advance the honour and dignity of his late majeſty, of happy memory, that they were bold to ſupplicate his ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to ſuperadd his royal confirmation thereto, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in an ample royal charter was paſſed and remains under the broad ſeal of England, March the 4th 1629, in the fourth year of his majeſties reign, with further additions and enlargements well becoming ſo royal a majeſty, and ſuitable for the encouragement of ſo hazardous and chargeable an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. In purſuance whereof many of the ſaid patentees and other adventurers tranſported themſelves and eſtates and ſettled

Not many years different in time ſeveral others alſo of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects obtained other grants, and made ſeveral ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the more northern and eaſterne parts of the country, with whom for ſeveral years we had neighbourly correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being as they ſuppoſed without the limits of our patent, amongſt whom the preſent claimers and petitioners were.

In this time ignorance of the northerly running of Merrimack river hindred our actual claim and extention of government, yet at length being more fully ſettled, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained further acquaintance and correſpondency with the Indians poſſeſſing the uppermoſt parts of that rivre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging an adventure, as alſo frequent ſollicitations from the moſt conſiderable inhabitants of thoſe eaſtern parts earneſtly deſiring us to make proofe of and aſcertain our intereſt, we imployed the moſt approved artiſts that could be obtained, who upon their ſolemn oaths made returns, That upon their certain obſervation our northern patent line did extend ſo far north as to take in all thoſe towns and places which we now poſſeſs; which when the inhabitants as well as our ſelves were ſatisfied in (urged alſo with the neceſſity of government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) they peaceably and voluntarily ſubmitted to the government of the Maſſachuſetts, (viz.) Dover, Squamſcot and Portſmouth anno 1641, Kittery, York and Wells anno 1652 and 1653, from which times until the year 1662, when there was a ſmall interruption by a letter of Mr. Gorge, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the year 1665, (when his majeſtyes commiſſioners, Colonel Nichols and others came over) the inhabitants of thoſe parts lived well ſatisfied and uninterrupted under the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets government.

This is in a few words the true ſtate of the matter; for the further illuſtration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and juſtification of our proceedings therein and vindication of our ſelves from the reproachful imputation of uſurping au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over his majeſties ſubjects in the eaſterne parts pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, with other ſcandals caſt upon us by the petitioners, we humbly preſent the following pleas by way of demonſtration, and argue that our extenſion of government to thoſe eaſtern parts claimed is agreeable to our indubitable patent right; our patent according to the expreſs terme therein contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ambiguity or colour of other interpretation, lyes <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two eaſt and weſt paralel lines drawn from the moſt ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly part of Charles river and the moſt northerly part of Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, with three miles advantage upon each,</hi> which upon the obſervation of men of approved and undoubted truth upon oath, are found diſtant one degree and forty nine minutes north la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, being to extend in full latitude and breadth from ſea to ſea (ut in terminis) and therefore cannot be bounded by many hundreds or infinite numbers of lines, as the river of Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack maketh bends or angles in two hundred miles paſſage from Winipeſioke lake to the mouth thereof, which to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, as it is irrational ſo would it involve us and any borderer into ſo many inextricable diſputes as are by no wayes to be admitted by a prince ſeeking his ſubjects peace. Beſides were ſuch a conſtruction allowable (which with uttermoſt ſtreining is) yet all favourable interpretation is to be offered the paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees by the gracious expreſſion of the charter. Now accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the afore mentioned obſervation (ſo confirmed) all thoſe eaſtern plantations challenged by our opponents (ut ſupra) are comprehended within our northerly line. We deny not but the artiſts of their ſelves, and if any queſtion thence ariſe we feare not to ſubmit to tryal to the moſt exact and rigorous teſt that may be. The invincible ſtrength of this our firſt plea may further appear by the conſideration of the frivolous and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant allegations of the petitioners in oppoſition thereunto, viz. 1ſt. The nonextention of our line or aſſertion of our right to thoſe eaſtern parts for ſome years, ignorance as our caſe was circumſtanced debarring no man of his juſt right, neither can it reaſonably be ſuppoſed that the exact ſurvey of ſo large a

               <p n="3">3dly. That notorious falſhood of ſtretching our right to near four hundred miles north and ſouth more then formerly we were ſatisfied with, our whole breadth being but one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and nine mile, which is not much more then a quarter part of what he would have the world believe our new claime and (as he would inſinuate) uſurped territory doth contain, ariſing (we would charitably believe) partly from ignorance of the coaſting of the country, Mr. Maſon accounting by the ſea-ſide, and we ſuppoſe coaſting in the meaſure of every har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and cove to make up that calculation, which lies much of it due eaſt and not to the north, but we fear malevolently ſuggeſted (as many other things as of little credit) to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into his majeſtie his royal breaſt a beliefe that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in our pretentions, and ſo unworthy of his majeſties favour, which we hope ſuch unlawful endeavours will never be ſo proſperous as to obtain. What may be further added to this our firſt plea, may be ſupplied from the reaſons formerly preſented. We urge ſecondly, The invalidity of thoſe grants pretended to by the petitioners, which are of two ſorts; 1ſt. Such as beare date after ours, which we ſee no reaſon to feare any interruption from. Secondly, Such as are pretended to bear date before ours, againſt which we object that they are
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:018344_0395_0FA5D2F8AD1B2650"/>
not authentick, wanting a ſufficient number of grantors to make them ſo, none of them as we preſume will appeare upon tryal having above ſix hands and ſeals annexed to them, the ſaid council of New-England conſiſting of forty, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtys grant to them expreſsly requiring (as we are informed) ſeven at the leaſt to ſigne to make any valid act; and indeed Mr. Maſon's own often unwearied renewal of his grants in 1621, ſixteen hundred twenty two, ſixteen hundred twenty nine and 1635, (as he ſaith) tacitly confeſſeth the ſame invalidity, in the former puting him to charge for the latter, till at laſt he fell into ſuch a trade of obtaining grants that his laſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable was ſix years after the grant of our charter from his majeſty, and but three dayes before the ſaid council's declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their abſolute reſolution to reſign, and but a few days before their actual ſurrender, as he aſſerts; which of what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and conſideration it is from the ſaid council's circumſtanced under a neceſſity of reſignation of their great charter, procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather by the clamour of ſuch ill affected perſons as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent complaint than by any true accompt of diſſettlement or ill management here, is not difficult to judge. Hence it appears, firſt, how little reaſon Mr. Maſon hath to brand us with fraud or ſurreptitiouſneſs in obtaining our charter; which hath moſt ſhew of fraud and ſurreptitious procuration, a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe honble perſons ſubſcribing ours and fewer his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended antidated grants, is eaſie to determine. In which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is to be obſerved the high reflection caſt upon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his late majeſty and miniſters of ſtate, groundleſsly rendring the council's ſeal, yea the great ſeal of England, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to fraud and deceitful clandeſtine practices; yea upon his preſent majeſty, inſinuating himſelfe better acquainted with matters of ſtate then he who allows and confirmes our grant as authentick by his gracious letter of ſixteen hundred ſixty two, which intolerable boldneſs how unbecoming (not to ſay more) in a ſubject, it is not eaſie for us to ſay. To all which we may add Sr Ferdinando Gorges application to the authority here to interpoſe in his affair, which he, being one of the great council, would have been far from acknowledging, had Mr. Maſon's allegations been founded upon truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That articles of charge depending upon ſuch il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal and poſt dated grants cannot take place againſt us were their diſburſe as great as it is affirmed, which by eye witneſſes upon the place and ſtil living, are proved comparitively very inconſiderable.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. We affirme that the whole management of the affair

reſpecting our government of thoſe eaſtern parts was in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and peaceable way, and not without the reiterated and earneſt ſollicitation of moſt of the people there inhabiting, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appearing by their ſeveral petitions; and we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Mr. Gorge and Mr. Maſon by any living evidence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to ſhew any ſigne of a forceable entrance: Some majiſtrates upon the clearing of our right to them and acceptance of the tender of themſelves to us, being ſent thither without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther force than each of them a ſervant to attend them. Indeed ſome years after Capt. Boniton for mutinous carriage was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to juſtice; concerning which and many other caſes many inhabitants yet living and eye wittneſſes can give the moſt impartial evidences.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. We offer to conſideration that the deſerted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd ſtate of the people of thoſe places had we not had that patent right ſo clearly evinced, might warrant our actions; eſpecially conſidering the obligation upon us to ſecure his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's honour and maintain the publick peace, ſo hazarded by the total want of government amongſt them. Our firſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of juriſdiction being in the year 1641, eight year after Capt. Neale, agent for Mr. Maſon, had wholy deſerted the improvement of land and the government of the country, which indeed he never uſed but one year, for in the year 1630 he firſt came over, and in the year 1634 he quitted the place; and in the interim neglected the ſame in making a voyage for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the ſhort time of his tarriance not admitting of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of government or improvement. We may hereto ſubjoin that Mr. Joſeph Maſon, agent for Mrs. Ann Maſon, when here and all things were freſh in memory, made no demand contrary to what is affirmed, but petitioned our juſtice againſt his debtors there and elſewhere, and that Sr Ferdinando Gorges his grant being ſo mean and uncertainly bounded that he knew not well how to find much leſs to improve to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advantage, by his letter bearing date—doth devolve the whole charge and care of his pretended province upon the authority here eſtabliſhed. Laſtly, That the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of juriſdiction in thoſe eaſtern parts hath been and is his majeſty's honour, the people's great benefit, and our charge without profit, which had it not been, the ruine of thoſe parts would have unavoidably enſued in the want of all government, and their ſeizure by the French, who ever waited a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the ſame. They have part of them for thirty five years and others twenty yeares (ſome ſmall interruption inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening producing the ſtronger inclination and reſolution in

May it pleaſe your majeſty,</p>
               <p>Having received your majeſty's order in council of the 7th of February laſt paſt, whereby we are directed to enter into the examination of the bounds and limits which the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Maſſachuſetts Bay in N. E. on the one hand, and Mr. Maſon and Mr. Gorges on the other, do pretend by their ſeveral grants and patents to have been aſſigned unto them, as alſo to examine the patents and charters which are inſiſted on by either ſide, in order to find out and ſettle how far the rights of ſoil and government do belong unto any of them. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof the lords chief juſtices of your majeſty's courts of king's bench and common pleas were appointed to give us their aſſiſtance, we did on the 5th of April laſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſaid lords chief juſtices meet in obedience to your majeſty's commands, and having heard both parties by their council learned in the law, we did recommend unto their lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to receive a ſtate of the claims made by both parties, and to return their opinions upon the whole matter unto us, which their lordſhips have accordingly performed in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
               <p>In obedience to your lordſhips order we appointed a day for the hearing of all parties, and conſidering the matters referred, having received from them ſuch papers of their caſes as they were pleaſed to deliver; at which time all parties appearing, the reſpondents did diſclaim title to the lands claimed by the petitioners, and it appeared to us that the ſaid lands are in the poſſeſſion of ſeveral other perſons not before us, whereupon we thought not fit to examine any claims to the ſaid lands, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in our opinion) improper to judge of any title of land without hearing of the ter-tenants or ſome other perſons on their behalf; and if there be any courſe of juſtice upon the place having juriſdiction, we eſteem it moſt proper to direct the parties to have recourſe thither for the deciſion of any queſtion of property until it ſhall appear that there is juſt cauſe of complaint againſt the courts of juſtice there for injuſtice or grievance.</p>
               <p>We did in the preſence of ſaid parties examine their ſeveral claims to the government, and the petitioners having waved the pretence of a grant of government from the council of Plymouth, wherein they were convinced by their own council that no ſuch power or juriſdiction could be transferred or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by any colour of law; the queſtion was reduced to the province of Maine, whereto the petitioner Gorges made his title by a grant from king Charles the firſt, in the 15th year

By the ſaid letters patents the king confirmed that grant, made them a corporation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To which it was replied that the patent of 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli primi is invalid, (1) Becauſe there was a precedent grant, 18<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Jacobi, of the ſame thing then in being, which patent was ſurrendered afterwards and before the date of the other, 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Car. primi. (2) The grant of the government can extend no farther than the ownerſhip of the ſoil, the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of which as recited in that patent wholly excludes the province of Maine, which lies northward more than three miles beyond the river Merrimack.</p>
               <p>We having conſidered theſe matters do humbly conceive as to the firſt matter, that the patent of 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> is good notwithſtanding the grant made in the 18<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Jac: for it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by the recital in the patent 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> that the council of Plymouth had granted away all their intereſt in the lands the year before, and it muſt be preſumed they then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted

the government; whereupon it was lawful and neceſſary for the king to eſtabliſh a ſuitable frame of government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his royal wiſdom, which was done by that patent, 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> making the adventurers a corporation upon the place. As to the ſecond matter it ſeems to us to be very clear that the grant of the government 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> extends no farther than the boundaries expreſſed in the patent, and thoſe boundaries cannot be conſtrued to extend further north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards along the river Merrimack than three Engliſh miles, for the north and ſouth bounds of the lands granted ſo far as the river extends are to follow the courſe of the rivers which make the breadth of the grant, the words deſcribing the length to comprehend all the lands from the Atlantic ocean to the South ſea of and in all the breadth aforeſaid, do not warrant the over reaching thoſe bounds by imaginary lines or bounds, other expoſition would (in our humble opinion) be unreaſonable and againſt the intereſt of the grant. The words "of and in all the breadth aforeſaid" ſhew that the breadth was not intended an imaginary line of breadth, laid upon the broadeſt part but the breadth reſpecting the continuance of the boundaries by the river as far as the rivers go, but when the known boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of breadth determines it muſt be carried on by imaginary lines to the South ſea. And if the province of Maine lies more northerly than three Engliſh miles from the river Merrimack, the patent of 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> gives no right to govern there, and thereupon the patent of the ſame 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Car. 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> to the petitioner Gorges will be valid. So that upon the whole matter we are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of opinion as to the power of government, that the reſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the Maſſachuſetts and their ſucceſſors, by their patent of 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> martis 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Caroli 1<hi rend="sup">mi</hi> have ſuch right of government as is granted them by the ſame patent within the boundaries of their lands expreſſed therein, according to ſuch deſcription and expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as we have thereof made as aforeſaid, and the petitioner Sir Ferdinando Gorges his heirs and aſſigns by the patent 3d April, have ſuch right of government as is granted them by the ſame patent within [<hi>the territory</hi>] called the province of Maine according to the boundaries of the ſame expreſſed in the ſame patent.</p>

               <head>No. XX. Anſwer to the claim made by Mr. Maſon to the houſes and lands of New-Hampſhire. [In Mr. Weare's hand writing, but without date or ſignature.]</head>
               <p>IT does not legally appear that Mr. Maſon can lay any juſt claime to any of the lands in New-Hampſhire, for what right he pretends is either derived from Capt. Jno. Maſon, (whom he ſays was his grandfather) or from his majeſty's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: But preſume from neither of theſe has he any right. Not from Capt. Jno. Maſon; for, (1) It does not legally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that ever he had any right to the province of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. It is true there is a copy of a pattent or deed from the councell of Plymouth, which he brings over without atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of publique notary or any other authority. Beſides in ſaid coppy there is not the leaſt intimation of any hand or ſeale to the originall, and there is two men that ſwears this is a true coppy of the originall, which plainly demonſtrates that the originall is but a blanck; the truth whereof we are the more confirmed in, becauſe it is not rational to imagine that Mr. Maſon would come from England to proſecute a right and not bring with him what he had to make good his claime; but having nothing but blanck coppies, he could bring no better than he had, which cannot be looked upon as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique in any court.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) If it ſhould be ſuppoſed that ever Capt. Jno. Maſon had a right by pattent, yet it does not appear how Robert Tufton Maſon (as the plantiffe calls himſelf) derives a title from him either as his heir, executor or adminiſtrator, or by deed of gift; all that we can hear in court is that the plantife calls himſelf Capt. Maſon's heir.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) If the plantiffe or his anceſtors ever had a title to the lands he claims by pattent from the councill of Plymouth, yet they have loſt it by non uſe, for they never attended the ends of granting patents by king James, of bleſſed memory, in his hyneſs pattent to the great councell of Plymouth, which was the peopling of the land, inlargeing the king's dominions,
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="unknown:018344_0407_0FA5D18C17E0D2D0"/>
propagating the goſpel, converſion of the heathen the native proprietors, &amp;c. Now the plantife nor anceſtors never planted this province nor expended any thing upon it to the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in peace nor war, but the preſent inhabitants did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themſelves or predeceſſors, purchaſe their poſſeſſions from the natives, and by their permiſſion did ſit down upon the land and manured, to the vaſt expence of above 50 years time in hard labor, and expending upon it their whole eſtate. And in the late Indian war did defend it againſt the enimy to the loſs of many of their lives and conſiderable part of their eſtates, without any aſſiſtance from Mr. Maſon who now claimes not only what poor people have purchaſed and laboured hard upon, but alſo conquered or relived from cruell attempts of the barbarous heathen, and we conceave we were under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to run ſuch adventures to make ourſelves ſlaves to Mr. Maſon.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) It does not appear that there was a quorum of the great councell of Plymouth to the making of Capt. Maſon's deed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattent granted to the great councell of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, which renders his claime unvalide, if ever any thing in that kind was done, which we queſtion.</p>
               <p>From what is ſaid we humbly conceave Mr. Maſon has no right from Capt. Jno. Maſon.</p>
               <p>And that his majeſtie's commiſſion does neither give nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme any title to the lands claimed, we prove:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) We humbly conceave that his royal majeſty who is ſo prudent a prince and ſo ſolicitus for the peace of his ſubjects, would not have left that matter doubtfull to his ſubjects of this province but rather have told us that he had given all the lands to Mr. Maſon, but there is nothing of gift to him in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and <hi>if his majeſty had</hi> (which we cannot believe he would) we ſhould crave the benefit of the ſtatute in the 17<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of Charles the firſt, which ſays, No king and councell can alienate lands but by due courſe of law. But wee were never yet heard, and when it comes to legal tryal wee preſume the law of poſſeſſions will confirm our lands to us, ſeeing we have had peaceable poſſeſſion 50 yeares.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) If his majeſty had given the lands in the province to Mr. Maſon, what can be underſtood by that clauſe in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<q>That in caſe the inhabitants ſhall refuſe to agree with Mr. Maſon, then the governor ſhall interpoſe and reconcile all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences if he can, but if he cannot then to ſend the caſe, fairely ſtated to England that his majeſty and privy councell might determine according to right;</q>
which wee humbly conceave
<pb n="xxxix" facs="unknown:018344_0408_0FA5D18FEAC38A50"/>
puts a barr to any legal proceedings until his majeſty's mind be further known therein. The inhabitants have offered their reaſons to the governor according to commiſſion, which he will not admit of, only did take of one, viz. Capt. Stileman, and promiſed to ſend them to England, but we can hear of no anſwer and much fear his neglect.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) His majeſty in his commiſſion ſays,
<q>To prevent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable demands that may be made by Mr. Maſon for the right he claimes,</q>
which claime may prove good or bad when it comes to tryall. We underſtand to claime and to have are different things.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) His majeſty intimates in his royal commiſſion by what title Mr. Maſon does claime, viz. by a grant to his anceſtors,
<q>who improved and poſſeſſed the province with great expence, until moleſted and finally driven out;</q>
but this province can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be concluded to be the place he claims until he make theſe circumſtances appear, which we are ſure he never can doe.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Maſon not producing any original deed for any of the lands of this province, nor authentique copies, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants cannot make any compliance with him both becauſe we ſee no right he ever had, or believing if ever any was he hath mortgadged it already in England, and ſo alienated what right he had.</p>
               <p>Although upon the former grounds we have good plea againſt Mr. Maſon's claime, yet we did not ſee cauſe to join iſſue, not only becauſe judges and jurors were not qualified according to law, all of them being pickt for eſpouſing Mr. Maſon's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by the governor's order, who has a mortgadge for 21 yeares from Mr. Maſon for all the lands in the province.

               </opener>
               <p>IN obedience to your comand that I ſhould render a reaſon why I refuſe to pay quit-rent unto Robert Maſon, eſq. (as he titles himſelf) for my houſe and lands, and take deeds from him for the confirming of the ſame, I anſwer as followeth:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="unknown:018344_0409_0FA5D1914E7C86D0"/>1ſtly. Becauſe my ſaid land I bought and paid for. The title unto which is ſucceſſively derived unto me from thoſe that have poſſeſſed it, without any claime for at leaſt theſe 50 yeares, upon which I have built at my own charge without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and am in the poſſeſſion thereof as my owne. As to what is ſaid in the comiſſion concerning Mr. Maſon's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieters, with all due ſubmiſſion to his majeſty, I conceive it imploys rather his claime than a poſitive determination of his title.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. I humbly conceive that being in poſſeſſion of what I have bought and built upon, it reſts upon the claimer to make out his title (if he have any by law), begging the favour of an Engliſh ſubject therein, that it may be firſt tryed upon the place, according to the ſtatute law and the opinion of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's judges in England, and this before I am liable to pay quit-rent and take deeds of confirmation from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. Should Mr. Maſon obtaine his demands, myſelf and the reſt of the inhabitants would be undone forever, for then all his granted to him which hee calls commons being out of fence, which yet hath been bounded out by the ſeveral towns and poſſeſſed by them for theſe 50 yeares, and improved for the maintainance of their cattle both winter and ſummer, and for timber and fire wood, without which there is no liveing for us, it being impoſſible for us to ſubſiſt upon that which in the commiſſion is called gardens, orchards, if he may have the diſpoſal of the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. The ſaid Maſon ſpeaks of many thouſands of pounds expended upon the place, which with ſubmiſſion cannot be made out, and if it could, what then have the poor planters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in ſo many yeares labour ſince their firſt ſitting downe upon it, when they found it an howling wilderneſs and <hi>vacuum domicilium,</hi> beſides a great expence of blood and eſtate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it in the late Indian warr, nor can they to this day make both ends meet by all their labour and frugality, and therefore muſt needs ſink under the exaction of ſuch a propriator.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. The land which Mr. Maſon claimes as propriator is the land on which ſuch vaſt expence hath been laid out by his grandfather Captain John Maſon, for the peopling of it and the land from whence his ſaid grandfathers ſervants were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently driven out, or expeled by the inhabitants of the Maſſathu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, but upon this land there was no ſuch expence laid out by his grandfather Captain John Maſon for the end aforeſaid, nor is this the land from whence any ſervants of his ſaid grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father were ſo expelled, and therefore we that are poſſeſſed of
<pb n="xli" facs="unknown:018344_0410_0FA5D192C97B17F0"/>
this land are not concerned in his claime, hee hath miſtaken his province and may endeavour to find it ſome other where, for here is no ſuch place.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly. If Mr. Maſon had a patent here, why did he not take poſſeſſion in the day thereof. If hee were in poſſeſſion why did he not keep it ſtill: None ever drove him out as he informs, had hee been once ſettled he might to this day have kept it as the reſt of the inhabitants have done without the leaſt molliſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I am humbly of opinion that if he the ſaid Maſon or any of his ayres came hither, they only came as many ſhips did to Newfoundland and to this countrey to make a fiſhing voyadge or beaver trade, and that being at an end departed and left their room to the next taker.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumme of what I have at preſent to anſwer, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſting of your honour the ſtating of the caſe, with your opinion thereupon to his majeſty as the commiſſion directs; and when his majeſty ſhall in his wiſdom and juſtice ſee meet to order an hearing of the matter in his courts of judicature upon the place before a jury of unintereſted and indifferent perſons which may be had out of the neighbouring province, (and poſſibly Mr. Maſon may think not attainable in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince wherein all perſons are concerned,) as he hath been pleaſed to doe by that part of Mr. Maſon's claime, which lyes under his majeſty's government of the Maſſathuſets, I hope to be able upon theſe and other grounds ſo far to make out my title as to be held unblameable before God and man, for not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his demands. Or if I ſhould ſee cauſe to appeal to his majeſty and honourable councell that I ſhall be put beyond all need of paying quit rent to the pretended propriator.</p>

               <p>BY ſeveral advices we have received of a ſudden riſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Indians in theſe eaſtern parts to fall upon the Engliſh, we judged it abſolutely neceſſary without delay to provide for the ſafety and preſervation of his majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects inhabiting this province, and to give releef (if need be) to our neighbouring colonies. We have therefore upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the beſt means for the ſecuring of theſe provinces concluded it very neceſſary to entertain a number of ſouthern Indians for ſouldiers, who are beſt acquainted with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe Indians ſkulking fight; and this being <hi>a work of piety and charity</hi> for preventing the effuſion of chriſtian blood: And knowing that your honor has an influence upon the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Indians our honourable governor was willing to take the trouble upon himſelf of a journey to New-York to treat with your honor for ſending of ſuch a number of Mahiquas, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indians, as may be convenient to aſſiſt in this ſervice, and to make ſuch capitulations and agreement as to his honor ſhall ſeem reaſonable. We doubt not your honor's readineſs in any thing that may tend to his majeſty's ſervice and the ſafety of his ſubjects, having often heard a noble character of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor from our governor, whom we have intreated to preſent our letter with our moſt humble ſervice. We have committed all matters to his honor's prudence and management and what his honor ſhall judg fit to be done we ſhall ſee performed. So

praying for your honor's health and proſperity, we ſubſcribe ourſelvs, (being his majeſty's council of New-Hampſhire)</p>

                  <signed>May it pleaſe your hon. your moſt humble ſervants, To the Honble Col. Tho. Dongan, governor of his royal highneſs his colony of New-York, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories thereto belonging, humbly preſent.

               <p>THAT your petitioners predeceſſors having under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of your majeſty's royal anceſtors by their letters patents to the great council of Plymouth, removed themſelves and ſome of us into this remote and howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in purſuance of the glorious ends propoſed, viz. The glory of God, the enlarging his majeſty's dominions, and ſpreading the goſpel among the heathen: And in order thereunto either found the land we now poſſeſs <hi>vacuum domicilium,</hi> or purchaſed them of the heathen the native proprietors of the ſame, or at leaſt by their allowance, approbacon or conſent, have ſate downe in the peaceable poſſeſſion of the ſame for the ſpace of above fifty years; hoping that as wee had attended the ends, ſoe wee ſhould have ſhared in the priviledges of thoſe royal letters patents above menconed, and thereupon did the more patiently beare and chearefully graple with thoſe innumerable evils and difficulties that muſt neceſſarily accompany the ſettlers of new plantacons, eſpecially in ſuch climates as theſe, beſides the calamities of the late Indian warr to the loſs of many of our lives, and the great impoveriſhment of the ſurvivors. Wee were alſoe further incouraged from your majeſty's princely care in takeing us by your late commiſſion under your maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's immediate government, and appointing ſome among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to govern us according to thoſe methods there preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being particulerly bound to diſcountenance vice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote virtue and all good liueing, and to keep us in a due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to your majeſty's authority and continuance of our juſt libertyes and propertyes, together with liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

in matters of worſhipp, and all in order to our liueing in all godlineſs and honeſty, fearing God and honouring the king, which wee profeſs to be our deſire to doe.</p>
               <p>But contrariwiſe partly by the unreaſonable demands of our pretended proprietor Robert Maſon, eſq. and partly from ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other reaſons that are either effects or concomitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee are in a farr worſe condition than any other your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's plantacons, and reduced to ſuch confuſions and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that neceſſitate our humble application to your majeſty, upon whoſe clemency and juſtice only under God we depend for our releiſe.</p>
               <p>Your poore diſtreſſed and oppreſſed petitioners doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt humbly ſupplicate your moſt gracious majeſty that you will vouchſafe to give leave unto one of ourſelves, Mr. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Weare, whom wee have ſent for that end to ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſacred majeſty and your moſt honourable privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell our deploreable eſtate, the beholding of which we doubt not will move compaſſion toward us, and your majeſty's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to juſtice will incline to the uſing ſuch meanes as to your wiſdome ſhall ſeem beſt that the oppreſſed may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, wronged ones righted, and we your majeſty's almoſt undone ſubjects now proſtrate at your feet, may upon the taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your equity and goodneſs, be raiſed and further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in all humility and thankfulneſs as in duty bound ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more heartily to pray, &amp;c.</p>

The governor further ſaid, that the ſaid Vaughan was a mutinous fellow, and required of him bonds to the good behaviour; Mr. Vaughan anſwered he knew none of the king's laws he had broken, but if he could be informed of his crime he was ready to give bonds. And that in the whole diſcourſe Mr. Vaughan demeaned himſelf with a great deal of moderation and ſubmiſſion.

               <p n="5">5th. Quarter ſeſſions are come, and there Capt. Barefoote, Mr. Fryer, Coffin, Greene, Roby, Edgerly, were juſtices, Raines was attorny. It was brought in as a plea of the crowne. Mr. Moody pleaded his not beinge ordained, havinge no main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanſe according to ſtatute and therefore not obliged to that worke which the ſtatute required. Beſides theſe ſtatutes were not made for theſe plaſes, the knowne end of there removal hither beinge that they might enjoye liberty in theſe forrin plantatyones which theſe could not have by vertew of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes at home, and ware allowed to have here, eſpecyally our comityon grantinge liberty of contyenſe. Theſe things ware pleded, but to no purpoſe, after a ſhorte pleding and that not withoute many interoptyones and ſmiles by the pragmatticke, buſey impertenente atturny, he was comited to the marſhall, (viz. Longe Matthews) and held in cuſtody that night tho' permitted to lodge at Capt. Stileman's. The juſtiſes debated a littell, foure of them entered there deſente, viz. Mr. Fryer, Greene, Roby, Edgerly, but Capt. Barefoote and Coffin ware for his condemnatyon. Judgment of the caſe, every man's was entered by the ſecretary over night, but being deferred till nexte morninge informatyon was given to ſomebody who came in and thretned and hectored after ſuch a rate that Green and Roby alſo conſented as you ſee by the incloſed, and hee was comited to priſon. Petyon was by him made to the courte, and afterward to the governor, that hee might ſtep up at nighte to his famely and ſettle matters there, and that he mighte not

ther attempt here, but with what conveniente expedytyon will be don what is needful and neceſſary. Mr. Martin was ſued at the courte in two actyones, one by Mr. Maſon for fines &amp; forfetures collected and received by him as treaſurer from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty nine to eighty two, and another actyon by the governor for fines, &amp;c. from April eighty two. He is caſte in both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyones to the valew of about ſeventy pounds, although hee pleded that what hee received was diſpoſed by order of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which made him treaſurer, and had as good comityon from his mageſtie as that was in beinge, neither did it legally appeare that ether Mr. Maſſon or the governor have anny righte to fines and forfetures, the kinge appointinge all publicke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be diſpoſed or improved for the ſupporte of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; however it is but aſke and have, there demands in any caſe have the force of an executyon.</p>
               <p n="10">10th. The ſabbath is come but no prechinge at the Banke, nor anny allowed to com to us; we had noone but the fameley with us, the pore people wantinge for lake of bred. Motyones have bin made that Mr. Moody may goe up and prech on the Lord's daye, tho' hee com downe to priſſon at night, or that naibor miniſters might be permitted to com and prech, or that the people might com downe to the priſſon and here as many as could, but nothing will doe; an unparraleled example amongſt chriſtians to have a meneſter putt oute and no other way found to ſupply his plaſe by one menes or other. Mr. Frier was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely thretned for refuſeinge to ſubſcribe Mr. Moody's comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hath obtained fairely a diſmityon from all publike offices. Juſtis Edgerly alſo caiſhered, and bound over to the quarter ſeſſiones. It is ſaid that juſtis Greene is much afflicted for what hee has done, but Roby not. Peter Coffin can ſcarſe ſhow his hed in anny company<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Moody in the church records remarks thus on his judges:
<q>Not long after Green repented and made his acknowledgment to the paſtor who frankly forgave him. Robie was excommunicated out of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton church for a common drunkard and died excommunicate, and was by his friends thrown into a hole near his houſe for fear of an arreſt of his carcaſe. Barefoote fell into a languiſhing diſtemper whereof he died. Coffin was taken by the Indians, [at Cochecho 1689] his houſe and mill burnt, himſelf not being ſlain but diſmiſſed; the Lord give him repentance, though no ſigns of it have yet appeared.</q>

               <p n="14">14th. Nuſe came from the fourte at Caſco that there was greate danger of the Indyanes riſinge, which hath occatyoned a meetinge of the counſeil and ſome diſcourſe, but here no more ſinſe and hope it may vaniſh.</p>
               <p n="15">15th. Good Mrs Martin was buried, beinge not able to live above one ſaboth after the ſhutting up the dores of the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.

Mr. Eſtwicke is alſo put oute of all offis. Noote, that when I wente to him for takeinge oathes, hee ſaid all oathes ſhould be taken before the governor and counſell, but now could ſend to juſtiſes to doe it. We had for ſom nightes our key taken away from the chamber dore about 8 or 9 at nighte but have ſinſe left off that trade. Sowell of Exeter is ded. Severall overtures ware made this weeke to John Partridge and Wm Cotten by Raines to com oute of priſſon he giveinge them three months time to provide mony or anny other cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante paye, tho' they tendered fiſh, planke, &amp;c. before they ware put in, they refuſed to accept.</p>

The deſigne you may eſely ſee is to ruine mee, and how vaine my ples will be you maye eſely gueſſe.

Foulſham at Exeter. Whether Mr. Speker ſhall ſerve or fine is not yet determined. And now I am ſpekinge of the general aſſembly, muſte hinte what was formerly forgotten, vz. that they convened on the Mondaye and the choice of the ſpeker (there ould one) in words hily approved and hee complemented alamode. Then a bill was ſente them downe (of which if I can get it being now in priſſon ſhall incloſe a copia) which they talked a littel of and then brake up for the nighte and went up to the Banke to lodge (the tide ſerving very well to goe and com), the reporte of which hily diſguſted, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anſwer to the bill vehemently urged, which was in fine a negative. Hereopon in a grete raidge telling them they had bin up to conſult with Moody an uter enemy to church and coman welth with much of like nature, hee diſſolved them, which was don on the Tueſday, after which he came up to the Banke and gave order for a ſacrament on the next Lord's daye as you have herd and ſinſe the aſſembly men pricked for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables.</p>
               <p>By the premiſes you will ſee how the governor is makeinge good his word, <hi>hee came for mony and mony he will gete,</hi> and if hee get it you know hoo muſte looſe it, and how meſereable muſte our condityon quickly be if there be no remedy quickly provided. Hee contrives and cutts out worke and finds evill inſtrewments to make it up, and theſe ſom among ourſelves. Thus wee are cloven by our owne limbes.</p>
               <p n="28">28th. Sinſe Mr. Jaffery was diſpoſſeſſed, Raines offered him for five ſhillings per annum quit-rent to Mr. Maſon, hee ſhould have his houſe againe, provided hee would owne him proprietor, but hee refuſinge it is ſaid hee ſhall never have it againe. The talke is that his houſe muſte be court-houſe and priſſon booth, and ſtandinge ſo nere the governor it is judged ſutable for booth thoſe ends, that hee may have the ſhorter journey to courte and the priſoners may bee alwaies under his eye.</p>
               <p n="29">29th. John the Greeke havinge laine ſom weekes in priſſon upon executyon, his goods haveinge bin levied upon (as above), was by Raines locked oute of the priſſon and bidden to be gon, but hee would not, keepes his quarters ſtill with the other two.

               <p>Ditto 5th. Thus far was ſente you by waye of Barbados. It fallowes. The governor did ſaie to a Salem man that Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might goe out of the priſon, if hee would goe out of the provinſe, but wee here no more ſinſe.</p>

This nighte Matthews was beten at Merſore's (ſom fudlinge boute its like), but its made a mity thing on, ſaid to be a deepe plot, deeper then Gove's, managed by ſtrong heds, and abundanſe of that nature, and becauſe the perſons conſerned were under the inflewenſe of Vaughan and Moody they ſhould ſuffer for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for not techinge them better. Tho' wee know no more of it then you, nor is there ought in it worth notis, but thus we are treted. The governor went up to the Banke and made grete inquiries aboute it. Capt.

Matthews is made provoſt marſhall (at leſte) in his roome and Thurton marſhall's deputy. Good burds for ſuch offiſes. Lord have mercy upon us. They had alſo eighteen ſhillings from Sam.

Another conſtable is choſen, viz. Capt. Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eringe, tho' hee have as yet waved the oath, haveing lately

               <p>I am credible informed and you maye beleeve it, that the governor did in the open counſell yeſterdaye ſaye and ſware dredfully, that hee would put the provinces into the greteſte confuſion and diſtractyon hee could poſſible and then goe away and leve them ſoe, and then the devell take them all. Hee alſo then ſaid that Mr. Maſſon ſaid hee would drive them into a ſecond rebellyon, but himſelfe would doe it before; and I wonder he has not, ſuch actings are the redy way, but God hath kepte us hether to and I hope he will doe ſo ſtill. Hee alſo ſaid and ſwore that anny perſon that ſhould have any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſe with us or any of our mind, he would counte them his utter enemies and carry toward them as ſuch.</p>

               <p>This daye Raines beinge not willinge to give up a warrante that he had executed duringe the ſhorte time of beinge ſheriffe, was ſent for by the governor, and not apperinge, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor came to his chamber and did bete him dredfully, and bad the marſhall carry the rouge to gaile.

                  <p>The governor proffered mee (that whereas I was fined by the juſtices in Thurton's caſe, that I might thinke they had not done mee rite) that if I would proſecute it (giveing ſecurety ſo to doe,) in the king's bench at Weſtminſter, the exchequer, or before kinge and counſell, I ſhould; though by his comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon hee could not do it. My anſer was, unles I could have ſecurety given mee that in caſe I ſhould recover, I might have my charge and damidge made mee good, it would be of no benefit to mee. He ſaid there was no reſon for that, becaſe it was for the kinge; though it was his becaſe Mr. Maſon had

But he ſaid if I would depoſite a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſom hee would doe the like and would give bond, and have it tried as aboveſaid. My anſwer was I thoughte the forty pounds was eno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All ſo for my beinge in priſon for not giveing bond for my good behaviour, when the ſeſſiones came I was not broughte to my triall for that, but remanded to priſſon again.</p>
                  <p>At ditto time the governor tould mee hee had put me in priſſon on that account, and hee would abide by it till I would give two hundred pound bound. My anſer was I had rather ly in priſſon then give bond to tempt ſuch a fello as Thurton, (or ſuch others) that had ſworne againſte me alredy, and falſly, and judged it might be no ſcruple to him to doe the like again. And withal tould him that if his honner pleſed to let mee oute of priſon, I would ingaidge myſelfe by bond to live oute of the provines, though that would be very detrementall to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerns and by that I hoped he would have no thoughts of my miſbehaveinge myſelfe, that would be detrementall to the kinges governmente here or himſelf. Not that I ſcrupled give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge bond for my good behaviour, though not accuſed for anny thinge but for layeinge a temptatyon to ſom baſe minded perſon or perſons to forſware themſelves, as one had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in another caſe relateinge to me.</p>
                  <p>May 12th. Was informed that whereas Thurton had a comityon to be priſſon keeper, (and withal had vapored and ſaid the priſſon was to good for Vaughan, and the roome that hee had ſited up did intend to kepe it himſelfe and that V. ſhould take his quarters where he would aſſigne it, and that the priſoners ſhould not be waited on as Abbot had done, for he would keep them loaked up, only com morninge and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge) loſte his poaket booke wherein was his comityon and ſundry papors of conſernment.</p>

               <p>UPON reading a report from the right honourable the lords of the comittee of trade and plantacons in the words following:</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your majeſty,</p>
               <p>Having received an order in council dated the 11th of July laſt, upon the petition and complaint of Nathanael Weare, inhabitant of your majeſty's province of New-Hampſhire in New-England, in the behalfe of himſelfe and others your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects and planters there, againſt Edward Cranfield, Eſq. your majeſty's governor of that province, whereby wee were directed to report our opinions upon the ſaid complaint Wee did accordingly tranſmit a copy thereof to the ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cranfield, and upon receiving his anſwer, and hearing what the complainants could alleage and make out againſt him; Wee find that the ſaid Edward Cranfield has not purſued his inſtructions in reference to the propriety of ſoile which Robert Maſon, Eſq. claimes in that province, inaſmuch as the ſaid Edward Cranfield by his inſtructions is directed that in caſe the inhabitants of New-Hampſhire ſhould refuſe to agree with the ſaid Maſon, he ſhould interpoſe and endeavour to reconcile all differences, which if he could not bring to effect he was then to ſend into England ſuch caſes fairly and impartially ſtated, together with his opinion, for your majeſties determinacon; whereas inſtead thereof he has cauſed courts to be held in New-Hampſhire, and permitted titles of land to be decided there, and unreaſonable coſts to be allow'd, without firſt repreſenting the particular caſes to your majeſtie. As to the complaint of his having raiſed the value of coines againſt the laws of the
<pb n="lxxi" facs="unknown:018344_0439_0FA5D1ABC7D91FF0"/>
aſſembly there, wee are moſt humbly of opinion that although it be your majeſty's undoubted prerogative to ſet and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the price and value of coynes within your dominions, yet your majeſty's governor ought not to have made any alterations therein without having received your majeſty's ſpeciall direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All which wee humbly propoſe may be ſignified to him by your majeſty's order, and that the differences depending between the ſaid Robert Maſon and planters in that part of New-Hampſhire may be at length decided. Wee further of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that William Vaughan, one of the complaynants attending this board, may have opportunity allowed him of appealing to your majeſtie within a fortnight from all verdicts and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given in New-Hampſhire in his private caſe, upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof and by the relation it has with others your majeſty will be beſt able to judge of the right and title of the ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Maſon to that part of the province of New-Hampſhire aforeſaid, and upon bringing the ſaid appeale that all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at law relating to the ſaid title may forthwith ceaſe until your majeſty's further pleaſure be knowne.</p>

               <p>THAT your majeſty's loyal ſubjects of this province, had for more than fifty yeares been peaceably poſſeſſed of the lands lately challenged by Mr. Maſon, and having found the ſame an utter deſert and foreſt land, with exceſſive coſt and hard labour reduced the ſame to a tollerable ſupport of our ſelves and familyes and lately maintained the ſame with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That upon his late majeſty's declaration and order for the ſettlement and government of this province, wee accounted ourſelves happy for that therein we were by his ſaid majeſty's princely grace and favour, ſaved from the unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which Mr Maſon might have made upon us, by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations in the commiſſion for government, wherein it was provided that the ſaid preſident or governor for the time being, ſhould uſe all methods by his good advice to ſettle and quiet the people in the matter of Mr. Maſon's title, or otherwiſe impartially to ſtate the caſe and report the ſame to his majeſty, that a finall determination might thereupon have been made by his majeſty in councell, which if it had been duely attended had we doubt not long ſince by your majeſty's juſtice and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour putt us into an happy eſtate of quiet and repoſe.</p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding his ſaid majeſty's command and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the ſaid Mr. Maſon hath been allowed to purſue many of the inhabitants, in ſeverall ſuites and actions, wherein the government have taken to themſelves power of an abſolute judgment without any regard had to the ſaid commands and limitations, and with that exceſs and rigor as to aſſigne the ſaid Mr. Maſon ſometimes tenn pounds, other times twenty pounds coſts, when damages have been ſometimes not above two ſhillings, very ſeldom ten according to the orders and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations aboveſaid.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Mr. Maſon beyond and beſide the ſaid quit rents, and directly againſt his majeſty's order in the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, wherein the tennure of improved lands is aſſured to the ter-tenants upon payment of the ſaid quitt rent, or otherwiſe as his majeſty in councill ſhould determine, hath diſpoſed or given away the fee to ſeveral perſons of ſeveral lands which were longe before his challenge fenced and improved by others, to the great damage and injury of his majeſty's good ſubjects, beſide many other irregularities in the management of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the greate oppreſſion and deſtruction of trade
<pb n="lxxv" facs="unknown:018344_0443_0FA5D1AEA9010A30"/>
within your majeſty's province, and the utter impoveriſhing thereof.</p>
               <p>That for the laſt two yeare's and upward dureing the whole management of Mr. Maſon's ſuits at law againſt your majeſty's ſubjects, there hath been generally one jury returned to ſerve all the ſaid iſſues with little alterations and almoſt conſtantly one foreman, (who for that end wee are apt to feare) was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complyed with by Mr. Maſon for all the lands in his owne poſſeſſion formerly, with addition of ſeveral other lands to his owne proffitt.</p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding your majeſty's late gracious order, and inhibiting of any further procedure in the caſe of Mr. Maſon's title, until the cauſe were brought before your majeſty in councill, Mr. Walter Barefoote who was left deputy gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, hath ſince the arrival of your majeſty's commands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted executions to be extended, and perſons thereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in cauſes concerning the ſaid Maſon's title, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and unreaſonable coſts and damages.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, whereas your majeſty hath upon complaint made againſt the irregular proceedings done and ſuffered, been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to permit Mr. William Vaughan, one of the principal inhabitants and merchants in this province, to take his appeale to your majeſty in councill for reliefe, againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall oppreſſive judgments, one whereof referrs to the title of his lands within this province holden in the ſame forme with the reſt of his majeſty's good ſubjects here, wee do with all humble gratitude acknowledge your majeſty's juſtice and favour herein and for that the purſuance and iſſue of the ſaid appeale will therefore neceſſarily affect the whole province and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory to the determination of all Mr. Maſon's challenge, wee have judged it our duty in moſt humble manner to proſtrate ourſelves at your majeſty's feete, and have therefore betruſted and fully impowered Mr. Nathaniel Weare one of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this your majeſty's province our agent to lay before your majeſty and moſt honorable privy council the common caſe and condition of your majeſty's poore and diſtreſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this province, who is fully inſtructed humbly to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame, and the arbitrary and ſevere oppreſſions wee have laboured under, from which wee are well aſſured of reliefe by your majeſty's moſt juſt and gracious determination, and to make an humble and entire ſubmiſſion of ourſelves unto your majeſty's pleaſure, moſt humbly beſeeching that wee may hence forward have our perfect and immediate dependence upon your majeſty and the crown of England as well in the tennure
