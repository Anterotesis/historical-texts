            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>ST. JOHN, VIII. 36.</bibl>
               <q>IF THE SON THEREFORE SHALL MAKE YOU FREE, YE SHALL BE FREE INDEED.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>LIBERTY is an ineſtimable treaſure; the delight and paſſion of mankind. It is the ſource of almoſt all human felicity; the parent of virtue, pleaſure, plenty and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: And the love of it is an appetite ſo ſtrongly implanted in the nature and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all living creatures, that even the principle of ſelf-preſervation, which is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſtrongeſt, ſeems to be contained in it; ſince by means of Liberty, they enjoy the means of preſerving themſelves, and of ſatisfying their deſires in the manner which they chooſe and like beſt. Hence many ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals can never be tamed, but feel the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011141_0003_0F854A4A5B018B30"/>
of reſtraint in the midſt of the kindeſt uſage; and often grieve and ſtarve themſelves to death.</p>
            <p>By Liberty in general, I underſtand the Right every man has to purſue the natural, reaſonable and religious dictates of his own mind; to enjoy the fruits of his own labour, art and induſtry; to work for his own profit and pleaſure, and not for others, who live in idleneſs, and would riot in luxury, rapine and oppreſſion. In ſhort, liberty is to live upon one's own terms; and whenever this is loſt or invaded, labour and induſtry will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably languiſh; life grows precarious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways miſerable, and oftentimes intolerable. Slavery, on the other hand, is to live at the mere mercy and caprice of another; and a life of ſlavery muſt be a continual ſtate of uncertainty and wretchedneſs; often an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of violence; often the lingering dread of a premature death; and hence in moſt heroick ſouls, the love of liberty is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the love of life.</p>
            <p>How many have forſaken the tendereſt connections, and fled to the barbarous or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary wilderneſs, to enjoy the bleſſings of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and a good conſcience? How many have ruſhed into precipitate death, as a remedy for the loſs of it? What convulſions have ſhook the world from nations ſtruggling under vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011141_0003_0F854A4A5B018B30"/>
and oppreſſion? How many haughty tyrants have felt their vindictive rage? How many princes have brought ſudden vengeance upon themſelves and poſterity by their unjuſt uſurpations? Never was a nation ſo degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or regardleſs of their rights, as tamely to ſuffer the loſs of natural liberty and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of unlimited power. People muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and frightened before they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſlaves. And thus, by the engines of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and deluſion, have wicked and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men extinguiſhed liberty in almoſt every country except Great-Britain and her Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies. And here too, by the ſame fatal means, it muſt preſently expire, unleſs a ſovereign remedy be ſuddenly applied: The ſymptoms are many and dangerous, and its groans are continually ecchoing from ſhore to ſhore.</p>
            <p>What have not Americans done to prevent this ſad cataſtrophe? When parliamentary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and miniſterial caprice firſt began to extend their formidable arm and cruſh the tender plant of LIBERTY; how were its jealous SONS alarmed, and unanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defend their favourite TREE? Fired with an unquenchable love for their country, and the Britiſh conſtitution, they wrote with all the energy and enthuſiaſm of Greek or Roman orators. They painted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the moſt attractive charms, adorned
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011141_0004_0F854A4AEF8E6C58"/>
with the pleaſant fruits of peace, plenty, ſcience, virtue and happineſs; and ſlavery in its native horrour and deformity, black with ignorance, wickedneſs and miſery. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their inherent right to all the privileges of Engliſhmen; they gave ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their loyalty and affection; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated with a zeal becoming patriots; and they <hi>petitioned</hi> with the dutiful ſubmiſſion of humble dependants. And what is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? What is the reſult of all theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated endeavours? Why, inſtead of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediate redreſs, which they had reaſon to expect upon the principle of right, they were threatened by adminiſtration; charged with <hi>unwarrantable combinations,,</hi> and with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of violence and oppoſition to legal authority; their <hi>memorials</hi> were paſſed by in ſilence, and neglected, whilſt their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enemies were careſſed and heard with applauſe.</p>
            <p>As the laſt effort of a virtuous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed people; they have lately framed and entered into <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of induſtry, frugality and oeconomy, hereby intending to defeat the Acts of the Britiſh legiſlature; to diſtreſs the merchants and manufacturers in England, and thus intereſt them in our favour. A meaſure of this nature unanimouſly adopted, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourouſly proſecuted ſeems the moſt probable means left in their power for obtaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011141_0004_0F854A4AEF8E6C58"/>
of grievances, and a reſtitution of their invaluable rights and privileges. May di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence ſmile upon their attempts and grant the deſired ſucceſs!</p>
            <p>The nature and deſign of theſe reſolutions you cannot be ignorant of. They are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, practicable, and judiciouſly calculated to promote the end in view. I doubt not, the generality of you have ſigned them, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing at once a ſincere affection for your country, and a genuine love of liberty. You have given demonſtration of your magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and your abhorrence of oppreſſion and arbitrary power. You deteſt the black thoughts of <hi>ſlavery,</hi> or of betraying your rights by an indolent or timid behaviour. This encourages me humbly to propoſe to you, and I hope you will ſhew an equal ſpirit and alacrity in this caſe, to enter into <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for ſecuring another kind of liberty; a LIBERTY as much excelling the former as the Soul is more excellent than the Body; a LIBERTY which ſhall exalt you to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and immunities of the ſons of God; for in the emphatical language of our text, "If the ſon ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed."</p>
            <p>You confeſs that a future ſtate is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater importance than the preſent, and that temporal things cannot come into
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011141_0005_0F854A4BC231C098"/>
competition with things eternal and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; you acknowledge that there will be a ſolemn day of retribution, when the righteous and the wicked ſhall be eternally rewarded and puniſhed, by him who is appointed the ſovereign judge of quick and dead; you know from conſtant experience, that this is but a tranſient and evaneſcent ſcene, and that the faſhion of this world very ſoon paſſeth away. Can you therefore make earthly temporal things the ſole objects of your attention and purſuit, and neglect the endleſs joys of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and immortal glory? Can you be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every innovation and encroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your <hi>civil liberty,</hi> and at the ſame time ſink into ſpiritual and perpetual <hi>bondage</hi> to the worſt of tyrants? Well might the earth wonder and the heavens be aſtoniſhed at your folly. Surely if you know what it is to be reaſonable creatures, you will not heſitate a moment to enter into ſteady, permanent and inviolable <hi>reſolutions</hi> for obtaining ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty, and becoming the free and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſubjects of the Prince of peace.</p>
            <p>To aſſiſt you in this important matter, I ſhall endeavour to explain to you the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and relative meaning of the text, "If the ſon therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed;" and then conſider ſome of the eſſential properties of that freedom which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is perfective of your natures, and to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011141_0005_0F854A4BC231C098"/>
which I would urge you earneſtly to aſpire. And may God vouchſafe his almighty bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and grant us the glorious liberty of his children, "that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life." <hi>Luke</hi> i. 74, 75.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We are to take a view of the connection and relative meaning of the text.</p>
            <p>In this chapter we have an account of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers remarkable conferences our Saviour had with the unbelieving Jews, who daily ſought occaſion againſt him, and made every thing he ſaid a matter of controverſy and cavil. However he had a remnant, according to the election of grace, who believed on his name, and were his conſtant and faithful followers. In one of thoſe diſcourſes therefore, after having denounced death and final miſery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impenitent Jews, he addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe Chriſtians who believed on him, and tells them, "if you continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed." I exhort you to make it appear to the world that ye are my diſciples, by a holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary converſation; by adhering imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to my word, and the faith of the Goſpel; and for your encouragement, ye ſhall enjoy the privileges of all my ſincere and humble
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011141_0006_0F854A4C653FFED8"/>
followers, ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free."</p>
            <p>The Phariſees, who were preſent at this Conference, thinking themſelves egregiouſly affronted by the charter of liberty granted to believers, were much exaſperated at this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with equal pride and indignation replied, "we be Abraham's ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man, how ſayeſt thou, ye ſhall be made free?" We are of no ſlaviſh extraction; our pedigree is noble and virtuous; we are deſcended from that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious father of the faithful, who was in ſpecial covenant with God; and by that means we are free-born, or at leaſt poſſeſs privileges quite incompatible with a ſtate of ſlavery; yea, "we never were in bondage to any man;" therefore to talk of our being made free is perfect mockery and inſult.</p>
            <p>Jeſus, who bore the contradiction of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners againſt himſelf, did not chuſe to diſpute the truth of their inſinuations, though he might with a great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> juſtice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. For how long did the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham groan under the heavy yoke of Egyptian bondage? How often were they brought in ſubjection to the neighbouring nations in the time of the Judges? They were ſeventy years in a Babyloniſh captivity; and at this very juncture were lying under a national bondage
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011141_0006_0F854A4C653FFED8"/>
being tributaries to the Romans, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently looking for the Meſſiah, who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their crooked apprehenſions, would be a great temporal monarch, and would reſtore the kingdom to Iſrael. But if Chriſt had introduced a diſpute with the Jews, at preſent, concerning their civil liberty, it would have been intirely foreign to his ſubject; for he was ſpeaking before of a liberty where-with the truth ſhould make them free, which muſt undoubtedly be underſtood of a <hi>ſpiritual freedom.</hi> Therefore, without upbraiding them with their fallacy, he proceeded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the doctrine more fully, and anſwered them, "verily, verily, I ſay unto you, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin." He that maketh proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof; he that yieldeth his members inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin; he that complies with all the ſinful tendencies of corrupt nature, without any reluctance; is emphatically a <hi>ſlave;</hi> he hath ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can have no pretence to liberty, whatever boaſt he may make of his parentage, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral extraction.</p>
            <p>This is a truth of univerſal concern. It is not limited to the Jewiſh nation, or to the Phariſees of old, but is co-extenſive with the whole human race, "that whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſin is the ſervant of ſin." He is in

captivity to the Prince of this world. Though he never were in bondage to any man, yet he is in bondage to his own corruption. "Know ye not, (faith the apoſtle) that to whom ye yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs?" <hi>Rom. vi. 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that all men are naturally the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin is an undeniable propoſition. All are naturally in the gall of bitterneſs, and the bonds of iniquity. Hence proceeds that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference about heaven and eternal things which characterizes the preſent age; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the pleaſures of holineſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence which univerſally prevails; and that deluge of iniquity which has overſpread the world with ſuch an uncontrouled predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance. This, my brethren, is your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Though you enjoy all the external rights of freemen and Britiſh ſubjects, which is a doubtful caſe at preſent, yet you are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in ſpiritual bondage; ſlaves to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and to be inſenſible of it is a more ſhocking ſymptom of degeneracy, and that every heroick and generous principle is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in your minds.</p>
            <p>Would you now aſpire after liberty and happineſs? Would you eſcape from a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed captivity unto ſin? Would you become
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011141_0007_0F854A4D326D2248"/>
free citizens of the new Jeruſalem? Then you muſt determine to enter into ſteady, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and ſacred <hi>reſolutions</hi> to oppose the motions of ſin in your members, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world. You muſt offer up humble and fervent <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the throne of grace for relief. The Majeſty of Heaven will not be deaf to your complaints; "behold the Lord's hand is not ſhortened, that he cannot ſave; neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear." But your <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> muſt be preſented through Jeſus Chriſt, who is the way, the truth and the life. He is the believers <hi>agent</hi> in the celeſtial court. He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that will come unto God through him. And then "if the ſon ſhall make you free; ye ſhall be free indeed."</p>
            <p>I have now explained the connections and relative meaning of the text; I proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider ſome of the eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that freedom which alone is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of your natures, and to which I would urge you earneſtly to aſpire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a liberty that frees all believers from the guilt of ſin and the condemning ſentence of the law. The law required per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and univerſal obedience in heart and life
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011141_0008_0F854A4E01EEE368"/>
under pain of a moſt tremendous curſe; "curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." It prohibited the minuteſt failure, and admitted of no repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The ſmalleſt tranſgreſſion rendered the ſoul obnoxious to death and endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God's immaculate holineſs obliged him to annex threatenings of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite miſery to the breach of his law; and his unchangeable veracity makes him exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them; elſe few would reverence his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and his government would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to perpetual inſult and violation.</p>
            <p>Now all men, being by nature the children of wrath and diſobedience, lie expoſed to the penalty of a broken law. We are tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours from the womb; "and there is none righteous, no not one." Every perſon that reflects upon his own moral conduct, and compares it with the extent and purity of the divine commandment, will find juſt cauſe to lament with the prophet Iſaiah, "Woe is me, for I am a man of unclean lips." And woe unutterable ſhall be the certain portion of all unbelievers, who live and die under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving power of ſin; "they ſhall be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to outer darkneſs, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth." But believers in Chriſt are already freed from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſentence of the law, and delivered from
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011141_0008_0F854A4E01EEE368"/>
the guilt of ſin whereby, they were bound over to the awful terrours of death and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judgment. "Chriſt hath redeemed them from the curſe of the law, being made a curse for them; therefore being juſtified by faith, they have pardon and peace with God."</p>
            <p>Believers indeed are not freed from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious regard to the duties of the moral law. They are freed from it as a covenant for juſtification, but not as a rule for their direction and practice. This is the meaſure of their conduct both in private and in ſocial life. Hence the precepts of the law are ſtill urged under the goſpel, to enforce the duties of the Chriſtian religion. But yet it is certain, "that there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit." He hath blotted out the hand writing of ordinances, which threatened their eternal ruin; he hath canceled the obligation to puniſhment, and having ſpoiled principalities all powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them. O GLORIOUS LIBERTY OF BELIEVERS! "Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that juſtiſieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us. <hi>Romans</hi> viii. 33. 34.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011141_0009_0F854A4EB05784D0"/>
2. Another eſſential property of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the goſpel is, that it frees all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from the reigning power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin; what an abject and intolerable <hi>ſlavery</hi> is the ſervice of divers luſts? How ſad and deplorable is their condition, who follow the dictates of a hard heart and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved conſcience. Subjection to the moſt deſpotick prince on earth cannot exceed it. On the contrary, how ſecure and happy is the eſtate of thoſe who are renewed and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the operations of the bleſſed ſpirit! Their bondage is at an end. and their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is <hi>perfect freedom.</hi> "For the law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath made them free from the law of ſin and death." <hi>Romans</hi> viii. 2.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, perfection is not attainable in this life. None enjoy an abſolute freedom from corruption; the beſt of Chriſtians feel and lament the workings of indwelling ſin; they find a law in their members warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of their mind, and bringing them into captivity. Corruptions, like the Canaanites, are ſtill left in the land, to be thorns in our eyes, and goads in our ſides. Often too they prevail againſt the believer, and bring him into captivity and ſpiritual bondage; ſo that he cries out with the apoſtle
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011141_0009_0F854A4EB05784D0"/>
"O wretched man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the body of this death!"</p>
            <p>But it is alſo true, that ſin ſhall not have perpetual dominion over them, "for they are not under the law, but under grace." Their evil affections are crucified with Chriſt, and the body of ſin dieth in them daily; they are gradually gaining a more compleat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over their corruptions; and advancing by degrees to that region of perfect freedom and never-ending felicity which is beyond the grave.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Believers by the liberty of the goſpel are delivered from the controul and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Satan. I mean not that they are freed from the aſſaults and temptations of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant adverſary. The devil and his infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miniſters, under whoſe adminiſtration they were by nature, are continually <hi>impoſing taxes</hi> and exacting a <hi>revenue</hi> from the children of God, and exerting every malicious ſcheme to bring them into their former ſtate of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude and ſubjection. Hence we are ſaid to wreſtle not only with fleſh and blood, but with principalities and powers; with the rulers of the darkneſs of this world; with ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places. Our bleſſed Saviour himſelf conflicted with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptations of Satan; and Job, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011141_0010_0F854A4F86194F50"/>
and David, have left on record, doleful complaints on this account.</p>
            <p>But as Chriſt foiled the devil in every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and led captivity captive; "ſo believers are made more than conquerours by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his might." Being purchaſed not with corruptible things as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Redeemer, they pay him the voluntary tribute of gratitude and praiſe for his infinite condeſcenſion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited bleſſings; and bear their ſtrongeſt teſtimony againſt paying any <hi>duties</hi> to that evil ſpirit which ruleth in the children of diſobedience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Believers, by the liberty of the goſpel are delivered from the ſlaviſh fears and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of death. The Chriſtian is ſubject to the ſame calamities of life, and to the ſame laws of mortality with the infidel world; but not to the ſame dire and gloomy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of futurity. When the ſinner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches near the borders of the inviſible world, and yields to grave and ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, then he knows and feels himſelf to be, what he actually is, a wretch, a ſelf-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, ſelf condemned criminal, preſaging in his conſcience, that witneſs within him, his condemnation at a higher tribunal. But a ſincere Chriſtian's reaſon and conſcience are his friends and advocates. His rejoicing is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011141_0010_0F854A4F86194F50"/>
the teſtimony of a good conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, he has had his converſation in the world. Hence he hath confidence towards God; and when the time of his diſſolution comes, he can ſay in triumph, "O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth me thy victory, through Jeſus Chriſt." I <hi>. Cor.</hi> xv. 55, 57.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the liberty derived from the truth of the goſpel, is glorious, and its privileges extenſive; it frees us from the yoke of the ceremonial law, and from the more grievous burdens of the tradition of the elders; it frees us from falſe prejudices and miſtakes; from the dominion of luſt and paſſion; and reſtores the ſoul to a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſelf-government, and to the rational life of a Chriſtian; it enlarges the mind with ſpiritual knowlege; elevates it above the objects of time and ſenſe; and makes it an heir of glory and immortality; it brings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thought unto the obedience of Chriſt; nor does the ſoul ever act with greater liberty than when it acts under a divine command. The enemies of Chriſtianity pretend to free-thinking, whereas thoſe are the freeſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are guided by faith; thoſe are the men of freeſt thought, whoſe thoughts are captivated and brought unto obedience to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011141_0011_0F854A504E48D470"/>
You have now heard explained, though in a very curſory and imperfect manner, the eſſential nature of that freedom, which Chriſt, the eternal Son, grants to all thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth of his goſpel, and continue ſtedfaſtly in his word. You have alſo heard, that the whole world lieth in wickedneſs, by nature expoſed to the curſe of a broken law, and in miſerable captivity to the prince of this world. A little candid reflection, and ſelf-examination will convince you that this is the caſe. Ariſe then, my brethren, and laſh up your reſentment; view the LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY, the tranſporting LIBERTY of the SONS OF GOD! View the fulneſs of joy and immortal pleaſures that are before you! Theſe ſhall attend as rewards of your ſucceſs. Ignominy, diſgrace, ſlavery and endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould enflame you more than all the harangues in the world.</p>
            <p>Conſider the wiles and ſtratagems of your common enemy. "He is continually going about ſeeking whom he may devour." He is ſtriving to deprive you of your heavenly inheritance, and to involve you in common miſery and deſtruction. Now when your friend or neighbour injures you in your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral purſuits, or defrauds you of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected good, your revenge immediately riſes! When adminiſtration makes an illegal attack
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011141_0011_0F854A504E48D470"/>
upon your civil liberty, your reſentment is preſently rouſed, and every means exerted to fruſtrate their deſigns! Surely it becomes you much more to be jealous of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberty; to oppoſe the avowed enemy of God and man, and endeavour to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his wicked machinations.</p>
            <p>Conſider at what prodigious expence this freedom was procured; when thouſands of rams, and ten thouſand rivers of oil were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to purchaſe it, the bleſſed Jeſus "gave himſelf a ranſom for us." He who was the brightneſs of his father's glory, and the expreſs image of the inviſible God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed himſelf of his magnificence; aſſumed the humble garment of poverty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and ſuffered the rude inſults of a wicked world, and even the agonies of death itſelf, for our redemption Can you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neglect a treaſure of ſuch immenſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue? Can you forget your almighty bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour and advocate, whilſt you honour and applaud every common <hi>patriot</hi> that has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed himſelf in the cauſe of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Then every noble principle is eradicated out of your minds, and you are capable of venturing upon any form of ingratitude and baſeneſs.</p>
            <p>Conſider your own eternal felicity is at ſtake; this you cannot be altogether indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011141_0012_0F854A510AA66CD8"/>
about; it is of more importance to you than kingdoms and empires; "For what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and loſe his ſoul?" This conſideration ſhould awaken every one to vigourous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous after that grace and ſanctification, which alone can releaſe him from the bondage of corruption, and conſtitute him an heir of a bleſſed immortality. You mutually run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to meaſures of <hi>oeconomy, frugality</hi> and <hi>induſtry,</hi> in order to defeat the acts of parliament, and promote a general repeal; much more ſhould you adopt another kind of <hi>oeconomy</hi> and <hi>induſtry,</hi> as abſolutely neceſſary in order to defeat the empire of ſin in your ſouls, and to promote your own ſalvation.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, Conſider the welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſucceeding generations. A regard for poſterity is a conſiderable argument in the preſent conteſt for liberty. You want to tranſmit inviolate to the lateſt poſterity the rights and privileges of that happy conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you have derived from your anceſtours: an honeſt and laudable ambition! But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a favour of religion and chriſtian liberty is equally worthy to be tranſmitted to poſterity. You cannot convey them a better inheritance. God viſits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them that hate him; but ſhews mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011141_0012_0F854A510AA66CD8"/>
unto thouſands of them that love him and keep his commandments.</p>
            <p>From theſe and the like conſiderations, which are highly proper and rational, I hope you will not delay to enter into holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable reſolutions, for obtaining this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and exalted freedom, which ſhall make you happy amidſt all the ſtorms and tempeſts of this mortal ſcene, and heirs of a kingdom that ſhall never end, where you ſhall ſing hallelujahs and ſongs of ſalvation to Him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb that was ſlain, for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
