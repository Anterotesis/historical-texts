            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>The God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, the Rock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpake to me; he that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt, ruling in the Fear of God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we may judge by the <hi>manner</hi> in which theſe words are introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, there are none in all the bible, applicable to <hi>civil rulers,</hi> in their <hi>publick</hi> capacity, of more ſolemn importance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> words of <hi>good</hi> men are commonly tho't worthy of particular notice; eſpecially, if they are <hi>great</hi> as well as <hi>good,</hi> of an elevated <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005919_0005_102ACD02F7B78108"/>
as well as <hi>character</hi> in life. This is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that adds weight to my text. For it is enrolled among the <hi>laſt</hi> words of one of the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>greateſt</hi> men that ever lived. Such was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 'the man after God's own heart,' who was raiſed up from low life to the regal dignity, and ſtiled, on that account, 'the anointed of the God of Jacob.'</p>
            <p>And was my text nothing more than his own private ſentiments, formed with due care, upon long obſervation and experience, it might well deſerve the particular attention of all in civil power; eſpecially, as he was a man of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary knowledge, penetration and wiſdom, as well as piety; and, at the ſame time, ſingularly qualified to make a judgment in an affair of this nature, as he was called into publick ſervice from a youth, and had for many years reigned king in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not only <hi>David</hi> that here ſpeaks. The words are rather <hi>God's</hi> than his. For they are thus prefaced, <hi>The God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, the rock of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſpake to me.</hi> 'That <hi>God</hi> who had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Jews to be his people, and was their <hi>God</hi> ſo as he was not the God of other nations; the <hi>rock</hi> on whom their political ſtate was built, and on whom it depended for ſupport and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection':—This God <hi>ſpake unto David,</hi> either by <hi>Samuel,</hi> or <hi>Nathan,</hi> or ſome other inſpired pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or himſelf immediately from heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005919_0006_102ACD06A60C43D0"/>
as in the words I have read to you, <hi>He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi> It is certainly ſome momentous truth, highly worthy of the moſt ſerious conſideration of civil rulers, that is here delivered, or it would not have been uſhered in with ſo much ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>Some read the words, (agreable eno' to the original, as criticks obſerve) <hi>there</hi> ſhall <hi>be a ruler over men that</hi> ſhall <hi>be juſt, ruling in the fear of God;</hi> and refer them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as agreeing with other prophecies, which deſcribe him as a 'king that ſhall reign in righteouſneſs,' and be of 'quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord:' But if they be allowed to look forward to him that has ſince 'come forth out of <hi>Zion,'</hi> they were alſo deſigned for the inſtruction and benefit of <hi>Solomon, David'</hi>s ſon and appointed ſucceſſor to the throne of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And by analogy they are applicable to civil rulers, in their various ſtations, in all ages of the world.</p>
            <p>In this view I ſhall now conſider them, under the two following heads obviouſly contained in them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. There is a certain order among mankind, according to which ſome are entruſted with power to rule over others.</item>
               <item>II. Thoſe who rule over others muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005919_0007_102ACD0829992798"/>
The whole will then be applied to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the day.</p>
            <p>I. I am to ſay, in the firſt place, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order among men, according to which ſome are entruſted with power to rule over others. This is evidently ſuppoſed in the text; and 'tis ſuppoſed, not as a bare fact, but a fact that has taken place conformably to the will of God, and the reaſon of things.</p>
            <p>This, to be ſure, is the truth of the caſe, in it ſelf conſidered. Order and rule in ſociety, or, what means the ſame thing, civil government, is not a contrivance of arbitrary and tyrannical men, but a regular ſtate of things, naturally reſulting from the make of man, and his circumſtances in the world. Had man abode in innocency, his nature as a <hi>ſociable</hi> creature, and his condition as a <hi>dependent</hi> one, would probably have led to ſome ſort of civil ſuperiority: As, among the inhabitants of the upper world, there ſeems to be a difference of <hi>order,</hi> as well as ſpecies; which the ſcripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, by ſpeaking of them in the various ſtile of <hi>thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels</hi> and <hi>angels.</hi> But however it would have been, had man continued in obedience to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, government is rendered a matter of neceſſity by the introduction of ſin into the world. Was there no civil rule among men, but every one might do that which was right in his own eyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint from humane laws, there would not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005919_0008_102ACD09CBE7A350"/>
be ſafety any where on the earth. No man would be ſecure in the enjoyment, either of his liberty, or property, or life: But every man's hand would be againſt his fellow; and mankind muſt live in perpetual danger, from that oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rapine and violence, which would make this world rather a hell, than a fit place to dwell hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in.</p>
            <p>The preſent circumſtances of the human race are therefore ſuch, by means of ſin, that 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould, for their mutual defence and ſafety, combine together in diſtinct ſocieties, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much power in the hands of a few, as may be ſufficient to reſtrain the irregularities of the reſt, and keep them within the bounds of a juſt decorum. Such a ſuperiority in ſome, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in others, is perfectly adjuſted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of mankind.—Their circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.—They could not live, either comfortably or ſafely without it.</p>
            <p>And from hence, ſtrictly and properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does that civil order there is among men take riſe. Nor will it from hence follow, that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a mere humane conſtitution. For as it originates in the reaſon of things, 'tis, at the ſame time, eſſentially founded on the will of God. For the voice of reaſon is the voice of God: And he as truly ſpeaks to men by the reaſon of things, their mutual relations to and dependencies on each other, as if he uttered his voice from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005919_0009_102ACCE72F286340"/>
glory. And in this way, primarily, he declares his will reſpecting a civil ſubordination among men. The ſutableneſs of order and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, both to the nature of man, and his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the world, together with its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary connection, in the nature of things, with his ſafety and happineſs, is ſuch an indication of the divine pleaſure, that there ſhould be government, as cannot be gainſay'd nor reſiſted.</p>
            <p>Only it muſt be remembred here, a diſtinction ought always to be made between government in its <hi>general notion,</hi> and <hi>particular form</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtration.</hi> As to the <hi>latter,</hi> it cannot be affirmed, that this or that particular form of government is made neceſſary by the will of God and reaſon of things. The <hi>mode</hi> of civil rule may in conſiſtency with the public good, admit of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety: And it has, in fact, been various in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nations: Nor has it always continued the ſame, in the ſame nation. And one model of government may be beſt for this Community, and another for that; nay, that model which may be beſt for the ſame community at one time, may not be ſo at another. So that it ſeems left to the wiſdom of particular communities to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what form of government ſhall take place among them; and, ſo long as the general ends of ſociety are provided for and ſecured, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination may be various, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtances, policies, tempers and intereſts of different communities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005919_0010_102ACD122CBC83C0"/>
And the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>manner</hi> of veſting particular perſons with civil power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſupreme</hi> or <hi>ſubordinate.</hi> This is not ſo fix'd by the divine will, as that all nations are obliged to one and the ſame way of devolving the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of rule. The ſupreme authority in Iſrael, 'tis true, from which, of courſe, all ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate power in that ſtate was derived, was ſettled by God himſelf on <hi>David,</hi> and entail'd on his family to deſcend in a lineal ſucceſſion. But it does not appear, that this was ever intended to be a rule obligatory on all nations of the earth: Nor have they kept to it; but have varied in their manner of deſigning perſons for, and introducing them into, the ſeveral places of civil truſt. And this ſeems to be a matter alterable in its nature, and proper to be variouſly determined according to the different circumſtances of particular nations.</p>
            <p>But 'tis quite otherwiſe in reſpect of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf, in its <hi>general</hi> notion. This is not a matter of meer humane prudence, but of moral neceſſity. It does not lie with men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine at pleaſure, whether it ſhall or ſhall not take place; but, conſidering their preſent weak, expoſed and dependent condition, 'tis unalterably right and juſt there ſhould be rule and ſuperiority in ſome, and ſubjection and inferiority in others: And this therefore is invariably the will of God; his will manifeſted by the moral fitneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005919_0011_102ACD13ADB0ABA8"/>
And the will of God, as diſcovered in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of ſcripture, touching government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, perfectly coincides with his will <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi> made known, upon the ſame head, by the conſtitution of things: Or rather, 'tis more clearly and fully opened. For <hi>kings,</hi> and <hi>princes,</hi> and <hi>nobles,</hi> and <hi>all the judges of the earth,</hi> are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</note> as <hi>reigning and ruling by God:</hi> Yea, they are ſtiled, the <hi>miniſters of God</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 4.</note> and <hi>the powers that be</hi> are declared to be <hi>ordained of God</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Verſe 1.</note>: And, upon this conſideration, <hi>ſubjection to them</hi> is demanded, <hi>for conſcience ſake</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Verſe 5.</note>; and <hi>whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth,</hi> is looked upon as <hi>reſiſting the ordinance of God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Verſe 2.</note>. From all which it is apparent, there is no more room to diſpute the <hi>divinity</hi> of civil rule upon the foot of <hi>revelation,</hi> than of reaſon.</p>
            <p>And thus we have ſeen, not only that ſome among men have rule over others, but that it is reaſonable in itſelf, and agreable to the will of God, it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>And 'tis eaſy to collect from the whole, the true <hi>deſign</hi> of that power ſome are entruſted with over others. It is not merely that they might be diſtinguiſhed from, and ſet above vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; much leſs that they might live in greater pomp, and be revered as gods on earth; much leſs ſtill that they might be in circumſtances to oppreſs their fellow-creatures, and trample them
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005919_0012_102ACD1570FE4068"/>
under their feet: But it is for the <hi>general good</hi> of mankind; to keep confuſion and diſorder out of the world; to guard men's lives; to ſecure their rights; to defend their properties and liberties; to make their way to juſtice eaſy, and yet effectual, for their protection when innocent, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief when injuriouſly treated; and, in a word, to maintain peace and good order, and, in general, to promote the public Welfare, in all inſtances, ſo far as they are able. But this leads me to the next head of diſcourſe, which is what I have principally in view; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Thoſe who rule over others muſt be <hi>juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi> Here I ſhall diſtinctly ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They muſt be <hi>juſt.</hi> They ought to be ſo in their <hi>private</hi> capacity; maintaining a care to exhibit in their conduct, towards all they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with, a fair tranſcript of that fundamental law of the religion of Jeſus, as well as eternal rule of natural juſtice, 'all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.' But <hi>private</hi> juſtice, tho' neceſſary in all, yet is not the virtue here eſpecially intended. The injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpects thoſe who <hi>rule over men;</hi> and 'tis as <hi>magiſtrates,</hi> not <hi>private members</hi> of ſociety, that they are required to be <hi>juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this duty includes in it more than a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of unrighteouſneſs. 'Tis not enough that rulers are not unjuſt; that they don't betray
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005919_0013_10292A1277F56C98"/>
the truſts repoſed in them; that they don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the public; that they don't oppreſs the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whether in a barefac'd manner, or in a more covert way; by downright violence, or under the cloak of law: 'Tis not enough, I ſay, that rulers don't, in theſe and ſuch like ways, pervert judgment and juſtice; out, beſides all this, they muſt be <hi>poſitively</hi> righteous. Being poſſeſs'd of an inward, ſteady, uniform principle of juſtice, ſetting them, in a good meaſure, above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of private intereſt, or party views, they muſt do that which is equal and right, in their various ſtations, from the king in ſupreme, to the loweſt in authority under him.</p>
            <p>It would carry me too far beyond the hour aſſigned me, ſhould I make a diſtribution of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers into their ſeveral ranks, and mention the more ſpecial acts of juſtice reſpectively required of them. I ſhall therefore content my ſelf with ſpeaking of them chiefly in the collective ſenſe; pointing out, under a few general heads, ſome of the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant articles wherein they ſhould approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſt. And they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1"> They muſt be juſt in the <hi>uſe of their power;</hi> confining it within the limits preſcribed in the conſtitution they are under. Whatever power any are veſted with, 'tis delegated to them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome civil conſtitution. And this, ſo long as it remains the conſtitution, they are bound in juſtice to conform themſelves to: To be ſure, they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005919_0014_10292A7FACC20200"/>
ought not to act in violation of any of its main and eſſential rights. Eſpecially, is this an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point of juſtice; where the conſtitution is branched into ſeveral parts, and the power origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally lodged in it, is divided, in certain meaſures, to each part, in order to preſerve, a ballance in the whole. Rulers, in this caſe, in either branch of the government, are bounded by the conſtitution, and obliged to keep within the proper limits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them; never claſhing in the exerciſe of their power, never encroaching upon the rights of each other, in any ſhape, or under any pretence whatever. They have ſeverally and equally a right to that power which is granted to them in the conſtitution, and to wreſt it out of each other's hands, or to obſtruct one another in the regular legal exerciſe of it, is evidently unjuſt. As in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, which devolves the power of the ſtate, in certain proportions, on <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> they have neither of them a right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the province of the other, but are required, by the rule of righteouſneſs, to keep ſeverally within their own boundaries, acting in union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and conſiſtency with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. If the prerogatives of the <hi>King</hi> are ſacred, ſo alſo are the rights of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons:</hi> And if it would be unjuſt in <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Commons,</hi> to touch, in any inſtance, the prerogative of the <hi>crown;</hi> ſo would it be in the <hi>crown,</hi> to invade the rights, which are legally ſettled in <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons:</hi> In either of theſe caſes, the law of righteouſneſs is violated: Nor does the <hi>manner</hi> in which it is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005919_0015_10292A13FB8BD5E0"/>
done make any eſſential difference; for, if one part of the government is really kept from exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, according to the true meaning of the conſtitution, whether it be done openly, or by ſecret craft; by compulſion or corruption, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ballance is no longer preſerved; and which way ſoever the ſcale turns, whether on the ſide of <hi>ſovereignty,</hi> or <hi>popularity,</hi> 'tis forced down by a falſe weight, which, by degrees, will overturn the government, at leaſt, according to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular model.</p>
            <p>And the caſe is juſt the ſame in all <hi>dependent</hi> governments, as in thoſe whoſe power originates in themſelves: Eſpecially, where the derived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, like that of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is divided into ſeveral ruling parts, and diſtributes the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed powers and priviledges ſeverally among theſe ruling parts, to each their limited portion. The conſtitution is here evidently the <hi>grand rule</hi> to all cloathed with power, or claiming pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, in either branch of the government. And 'tis indeed a <hi>fundamental</hi> point of juſtice, that they keep reſpectively within the bounds marked out to them in the conſtitution. Rulers in one branch of the ſtate ſhould not aſſume the power delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe in another: Nay, ſo far ſhould they be from this, that they ſhould not, in any degree, leſſen their juſt weight in the government; much leſs may they contrive, by an undue application to their hopes or fears, or by working on their ambition, or covetouſneſs, or any other corrupt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005919_0016_10292A824FBB4860"/>
principle; much leſs, I ſay, may they contrive to influence them to give up their power, or, what is as bad, to uſe it unfaithfully, beſide the intention for which it was committed to them. Theſe are certainly methods of injuſtice; and, if put in practice, will, by a natural cauſality, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and, by degrees, deſtroy thoſe checks which rulers are mutually deſigned to have one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the effect whereof muſt be <hi>tyranny,</hi> or <hi>anarchy,</hi> either of which will be of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another general inſtance wherein rulers ſhould be juſt, relates to the <hi>laws by which they govern.</hi> [They have an undoubted right to make and execute laws, for the publick good. This is eſſentially included in the very idea of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Inſomuch, that government, without a right to enact and enforce proper laws, is nothing more than an empty name.</p>
            <p>And this right, in whomſoever it is veſted, muſt be exerciſed under the direction of <hi>juſtice.</hi> For as there cannot be government without a right of legiſlation, ſo neither can there be this right but in conjunction with righteouſneſs. 'Tis the <hi>juſt</hi> exerciſe of power that diſtinguiſhes <hi>right</hi> from <hi>might; authority</hi> that is to be revered and obeyed, from <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>tyranny,</hi> which are to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deprecated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005919_0017_10292A1CF022EBF8"/>
Thoſe therefore to whom it belongs to make, or execute the laws of a government ought, in theſe exerciſes of their power, to ſquare their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by that ſtrict juſtice, which will be to them a ſure rule of right action.]</p>
            <p>To be ſure, if they would be juſt, they muſt make no laws but what bear this character. They ſhould not, when upon the buſineſs of framing and paſſing acts, ſuffer themſelves to be ſwayed by any wrong biaſs, either from ſelf-will, or ſelf-intereſt; the ſmiles or frowns of men greater than themſelves; or the humour of the populace: But ſhould bring the propoſed laws to a fair and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial examination, not only in their reference to the temper, genius and circumſtances of the community, but to that juſtice alſo which is founded in the nature of things, and the will of the ſupreme legiſlator: And if they ſhould appear to be inconſiſtent with this eternal rule of equity, they ought not to countenance them, but ſhould do what they can to prevent their eſtabliſhment. And the rather, becauſe ſhould they enact that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtatute, which is unrighteous; eſpecially, if it be plainly and groſly ſo, they would be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with 'framing miſchief by a law': The guilt whereof would be the more aggravated, as power, in this caſe, would be on the ſide of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and, what is as bad, as unrighteouſneſs, by this means, would take a dreadful ſpread thro' the community. For as the laws are the rule for the executive powers in the government, if theſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005919_0018_10292A859CFE2E20"/>
are unjuſt, all that is done conſequent upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them, muſt be unjuſt too. That would be the ſtate of things which <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes, when he ſays, 'I ſaw under the ſun the place of judgment, that wickedneſs was there; and the place of righteouſneſs, that iniquity was there:' Than which, there cannot be given a more terrible repreſentation of the unhappy effect of a diſregard to juſtice in the making of laws.</p>
            <p>But Rulers, in order to their anſwering the character of juſt, muſt not ſatisfy themſelves with making none but righteous laws; but muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide alſo, ſo far as may be, a <hi>ſufficiency of ſuch</hi> to reſtrain the ſons of wickedneſs, men of avaricious minds, and no conſciences, from that rapine and violence, thoſe frauds and oppreſſions, in their various kinds and degrees, which their luſts would prompt them to perpetrate, to the damage of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and in violation of all that is right and juſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, they ſhould be particular in their care to guard the important and extenſive article of <hi>commerce;</hi> calculating laws ſo as that they may have a tendency to oblige every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the community, to uſe the methods of fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty in their dealings with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In order whereto, one of the main things neceſſary is, to fix the preciſe <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> according to which theſe and thoſe commodities ſhall be bought and ſold; hereby rendring the practice of honeſty eaſy and familiar, while, at
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005919_0019_10292A1E74FE0A40"/>
the ſame time, it is made a matter of difficulty, as well as hazard, for this member of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to defraud that, by palming on him a leſs quantity than he bargain'd, for, and expected to receive.</p>
            <p>[A noble example of this expedient to promote juſtice, the ſcripture preſents us with, in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory it gives of the laws by which the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were governed. It was not thought ſufficient to prohibit their 'doing unrighteouſneſs in mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, or weight, or meaſure;' and to command their having 'juſt ballances and juſt weights, a juſt Ephah and a juſt Hin:' But the <hi>ſtandard</hi> was fixt by law, according to which all weights and meaſures muſt be regulated; and it was kept in the <hi>ſanctuary of God.</hi> And ſo exact was the government in its care to prevent all fraud, that it allowed no "weights, ballances or meaſures to be made of any metal, as of <hi>Iron, Lead, Tin,</hi> (which were obnoxious to ruſt, or might be bent or eaſily impaired) but of <hi>Marble, Stone</hi> or <hi>Glaſs,</hi> which were leſs liable to be abuſed."<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Bp. <hi>Patrick</hi> on Levit. 19. 36.</note> And officers alſo "were appointed in every city to go about into ſhops, and ſee that the ballances and meaſures were juſt, and determine the ſtated mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them: And with whomſoever they found any weight or meaſure too light or ſhort, or bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance that went awry, they were to be puniſhed by the judges."<note n="‖" place="bottom">So ſpeaks <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> as quoted by <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on the above text.</note> This pattern of juſtice has
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005919_0020_10292A87F824B610"/>
been copied after by all governments acquainted with it; and the more particular their law, have been for the regulation of <hi>weights</hi> and <hi>meaſures,</hi> the better calculated have they been to promote honeſty in private dealing.]</p>
            <p>And if juſtice in rulers ſhould ſhew itſelf by reducing the things that are bought and ſold to <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> much more ought it to be ſeen in aſcertaining the <hi>medium of trade,</hi> as near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be, to ſome determinate value. For this, whether it be money, or ſomething ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to paſs in lieu of it, is <hi>that</hi> for which all things are exchanged in commerce. And if this, which is of ſuch univerſal uſe in the affair of traffick, be a thing variable and uncertain, of one value this week, and another the next, 'tis diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conceive, how juſtice ſhould take place between man and man, in their dealings with one another. If the meaſure we call a foot might gradually, in the ſpace of a few months or years, lengthen into a yard, or ſhorten into an inch; every one ſees, it would, if uſed as a meaſure in trade, tend to ſpread unrighteouſneſs in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, rather than juſtice. So, if the weight we call a pound might gradually, in the like ſpace, increaſe or diminiſh one half; 'tis paſt diſpute, it would be an occaſion of general ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, rather than a means to promote honeſty. And the caſe is really the ſame (however inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we may be of it) with reſpect to the <hi>paſſing medium</hi> in a government. If what we call a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005919_0021_10292A27B7020418"/>
               <hi>ſhilling,</hi> may, in a gradual way, in the courſe of a few months or years, riſe in <hi>value</hi> ſo as to be equal to two or three, or ſink in proportion; 'tis impoſſible, in the nature of things, but a wide door ſhould be opened for oppreſſion and injuſtice. An upright man, in this caſe, would find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly difficult to do himſelf juſtice, or others he might be concerned with in buſineſs. And for thoſe of diſhoneſt minds, and no principles of honour or religion, if men of craft and foreſight, they would have it very much in their power to enrich themſelves by being unjuſt to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, the caſe may be ſo circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a government, eſpecially if it be a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one, as that it may be extreamly difficult, if not impoſſible, while they have no money, to keep that which paſſes, in the room of it, from varying in it's <hi>real</hi> worth. But it is not very difficult; to be ſure, it is not impoſſible, to pitch upon ſome <hi>certain ſtandard,</hi> to which the <hi>current medium</hi> may be ſo related, as that it's true value, at different times, may be nearly aſcertained: And if this was eſtabliſhed as the rule in all <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic payments,</hi> as well as <hi>private contracts</hi> and <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,</hi> it would be no other than what is right. It would certainly tend not only to do every one juſtice, but to put it very much out of the power of men of no probity 'to go beyond and defraud their brother:' Whereas, while the <hi>medium</hi> is connected with no eſtabliſhed certain ſtandard,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005919_0022_10292A897A4E8380"/>
but continually varies in it's <hi>real</hi> worth, it muſt be, in the natural courſe of things, an occaſion of great injuſtice. [Some, on the one hand, under the fair pretence of a reaſonable care to ſecure themſelves, will injure thoſe who lie at their mercy, by extorting from them more that is meet. And others, on the other hand, will take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to pay a juſt debt with one half the true value it was originally contracted for: Nor will the practice of unrighteouſneſs be confined to theſe and ſuch like inſtances, but unavoidably mingle itſelf with men's tranſactions in the whole buſineſs of trade, ſo as to put them upon making a prey of one another; as is too much the caſe among ourſelves at this day.]</p>
            <p>There is yet another thing, belonging to this head, wherein rulers ſhould approve themſelves juſt; and that is, the <hi>execution of the Laws.</hi> [The power of <hi>executing</hi> as well as making laws (as has been hinted) is inſeparable from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the demands of juſtice are to be comply'd with, in the one as well as the other. If 'tis juſt that rulers ſhould make righteous laws, 'tis equally ſo, when they are made, that they ſhould take effectual care to enforce a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them. Of what ſervice would laws be, though ever ſo wiſely calculated to promote the public good, if offenders againſt them ſhould be connived at, or ſuffered, by one means or another, to go unpuniſhed? And what might reaſonably be expected in conſequence of ſuch a breach of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005919_0023_10292A29A14B0688"/>
truſt, but that the beſt laws, together with the authority that enacted them, ſhould be held in contempt?—There is no ſuch thing as ſupporting the honour of government, or ſecuring the good ends propoſed by the laws it eſtabliſhes, but by unſheathing the ſword, in a faithful and impartial execution of juſtice.</p>
            <p>But here, that we may ſpeak clearly, it may be proper to diſtinguiſh between <hi>thoſe rulers</hi> to whom it belongs to <hi>appoint</hi> and <hi>authoriſe perſons to execute the laws,</hi> and thoſe who are <hi>veſted with authority for this purpoſe.</hi> For the duty which juſtice requires is different, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that power, wherewith theſe different ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are betruſted.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a point of juſtice, in <hi>thoſe</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to <hi>empower others to execute the laws,</hi> to ſelect out of the community ſuch as are well qualified for ſo important a truſt. Every man is not fit to have the ſword of juſtice put into his hands. And the main thing to be lookt at, in the choice of perſons for this ſervice, is their <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> to it. <hi>Meerly</hi> their being men of birth and fortune, is not a ſufficient recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor, if they are eagerly forward in ſeeking for a poſt of honour or profit, is it a certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that they are fit to be put into it: Neither, if they ſhould offer money to purchaſe it, ought they, on this account, to be preferred to men of greater merit: Much leſs ought it to be looked
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005919_0024_10292A8C2ABA2410"/>
upon as a turning argument in their favour, that they are fit inſtruments to ſerve the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe in ſuperior ſtation. Theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations beſide the true merit of the caſe: And thoſe only ought to bear ſway, which enter into the real characters of men, determining their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for the truſt that is to be repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>The advice which <hi>Jethro</hi> gave <hi>Moſes</hi> is here proper, 'Thou ſhalt provide out of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 18. 21.</note> Theſe are the men, men of underſtanding, courage and reſolution; men of integrity, fidelity and honeſty; men of piety and ſubſtantial religion; men of a noble generoſity, ſetting them above the temptations, which thoſe of narrow minds and ſelfiſh views, are eaſily drawn away by and enticed: Theſe, I ſay, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per men to fill the various poſts in the ſtate. And it would be injuſtice to the public, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned in the diſpoſal of them, to neglect <hi>theſe,</hi> and beſtow them on thoſe of a contrary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Men of low natural capacities, and ſmall acquired accompliſhments, are unmeet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to places of important truſt. And ſhould this be done, it would be acting over the <hi>evil,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> complained of in his day, <hi>Folly is ſet in great dignity.</hi> And thoſe are as unfit to be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005919_0025_10292A2B23A2F878"/>
conſtituted guardians of the laws, who are indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, inactive and irreſolute; much more, if, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether herewith, they are known to be of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious turn of mind. It can't be ſuppoſed, men of this character ſhould be faithful in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice; and to devolve this care on them, would be to wrong the community, and expoſe authority.</p>
            <p>Not that thoſe, with whom it lies to appoint officers, are always to blame, when unqualified perſons are put into places of truſt; for they are liable, after all prudent caution, to be miſtaken in their own judgment, and to be impoſed on by miſinformation from others. But then, they ſhould take due care, when ſuch perſons are found, upon trial, to be unequal to the truſt committed to them, to remedy the inconvenience: Nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe will they continue <hi>innocent,</hi> however faultleſs they might be at firſt. 'Tis evidently the demand of juſtice, that ſuch unmeet perſons ſhould be diſplaced, and others better qualified put in their room.</p>
            <p>And 'tis equally juſt, that thoſe who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of behaving well, but behave ill in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſtations, ſhould be teſtified againſt. And ſhould they be ſo unadviſed, as groſly to abuſe their power; applying it to the purpoſes of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and oppreſſion, rather than to ſerve the good ends of government, it ought to be taken out of their hands, that they might no longer be

under advantages to injure their brethren of the ſame community.</p>
            <p>Theſe are demands of juſtice from <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are to <hi>put others into the executive truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And juſtice is likewiſe required of <hi>this ſort of rulers,</hi> according to the reſpective truſt that is committed to them.</p>
            <p>If 'tis their buſineſs to ſit in the place of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they muſt judge uprightly in all caſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civil or criminal, and not under a wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from favour to the rich, or pity to the poor, or fear of the great, or affection or diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any man's perſon whatſoever; having that precept in the divine law ever in their eye, 'Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judgment: Thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the perſon of the mighty: But in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhalt thou judge thy brother.'<note n="†" place="bottom">Levit. 19. 15.</note> And that alſo, 'Thou ſhalt not wreſt judgment, thou ſhalt not reſpect perſons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and prevent the words of the righteous.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 19. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If 'tis their buſineſs to enquire who have been offenders againſt the laws, and to exhibit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt them as ſuch; they muſt be coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005919_0027_10292A4DA1DCC708"/>
and impartial, complying with their duty equally in reſpect of all, be their character what it will.</p>
            <p>If 'tis their buſineſs to act as executioners of juſtice, they muſt faithfully inflict the adjudged ſentence: In doing of which, tho' there may be room for the exerciſe of compaſſion, eſpecially in the caſe of ſome ſort of debtors; yet the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the law may not be eluded by needleſs, much leſs fraudulent delays, to the injury of the creditor.</p>
            <p>In fine, whatever their truſt is, whether of leſs or greater importance, they muſt exerciſe it with care, fidelity, reſolution, ſteadineſs, diligence, and an entire freedom from a corrupt reſpect to men's perſons, as thoſe who are concerned for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of government, and that it's laws may take effect for the general good of the community.]</p>
            <p>To go on,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another inſtance wherein rulers ſhould be juſt, reſpects the <hi>debts</hi> that may be due from the <hi>public.</hi> A government may be in debt, as well as private men. Their circumſtances may be ſuch, as to render it adviſeable for them to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row money, either of other governments, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves: Or, they may have occaſion to make purchaſes, or to enter into contracts, upon ſpecial emergencies, which may bring them in debt. In which caſes, the rule of juſtice is the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005919_0028_10292A92331B86D0"/>
ſame to <hi>magiſtrates,</hi> as to men in a private life. They muſt pay that which they owe, according to the true meaning of their engagements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraud or delay.</p>
            <p>[They may alſo be in debt for ſervices done by labourers, in this and the other ſecular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And here the rule of juſtice is that, 'withold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. Say not unto thy neighbour, go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou haſt it by thee'.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. 3. 27, 28.</note> Or if the labourers are ſuch as have nothing beforehand, but their day-labour is what they depend on for the ſupport of themſelves and families, the rule is yet more particular, 'Thou ſhalt not oppreſs an hired ſervant that is poor and needy;—at his day thou ſhalt give him his hire, neither ſhall the ſun go down upon it; for he is poor, and ſetteth his heart on it: Leſt he cry againſt thee unto the Lord, and it be ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee'.<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 24. 14, 15.</note> And again, 'Thou ſhalt not defraud thy neighbour, nor rob him: The wages of him that is hired, ſhall not abide with thee all night until the morning'.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lev. 17. 13.</note>]</p>
            <p>In fine, they may be in debt to their <hi>own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> whether in higher or lower ſtation, the proper buſineſs of whoſe office calls off their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from other affairs. And as their time, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005919_0029_10292A4F866FCBF0"/>
care, and tho't, are employed in the ſervice of the <hi>public, a public maintenance</hi> is their juſt due. 'Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charge? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or, who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I theſe things as a man? Or ſaith not the law the ſame alſo?'<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 5. 7, 8.</note> For it is written, 'For this cauſe pay you tribute; for they are God's miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Nor is it ſufficient that they be ſupported ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of men in low life. This may be tho't enough, if not too much, by thoſe who imagine, that the more ſtrait-handed they are upon the head of allowances, the more ſerviceable they ſhall be to the public. But there is ſuch a Thing in the ſtate, as a 'with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding more than i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meet'. And it really tends to the damage of a government. Too ſcant an allowance may unhappily prove a temptation to officers, to be hard upon thoſe dependent on them; and what they may injuriouſly ſqueeze out of them, by one artful contrivance or another, may turn out more to the hurt of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than if twice that ſum had been paid out of the public treaſury, and this evil, by means here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had been prevented. Beſides, 'tis no ways fitting, that men cloathed with honour and power
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005919_0030_10292A93B67ECE40"/>
ſhould be brought down to a level with vulgar people, in the ſupport that is granted them. Their outward circumſtances ſhould be elevated in proportion to their civil character, that they may be better able to ſupport the viſible dignity of their ſtation, and command that reſpect which is due to men of their figure. He that is <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould eat the bread of a Governour;</hi> and ſubordinate officers ſhould be maintained, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rank they bear in the ſtate: Nor ought their honourable maintenance to be tho't a matter of <hi>meer bounty;</hi> 'tis rather a <hi>debt,</hi> which can't be withheld without injuſtice.</p>
            <p>[To be ſure, where their ſtipends have been eſtabliſhed, or, at leaſt, they have had reaſonable encouragement to expect ſuch a certain acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for their ſervice, righteouſneſs requires that it be paid them: Nor may it be tho't that the <hi>ſame nominal ſum,</hi> falling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſtly below the <hi>real worth</hi> of the debt, will be ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. It certainly is not ſufficient, in the eye of <hi>juſtice,</hi> either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>revealed;</hi> which reſpects no man's perſon, but will do that which is right to the loweſt, as well as to the higheſt officer in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>And the caſe, in point of equity, is really the ſame, where a government has come into no ſpecial agreement; but the aſcertaining the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> proper for the ſupport of it's officers, is left to it's own wiſdom and probity. For an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005919_0031_10292A51E2BA3E58"/>
is due to them by the law of righteouſneſs: And it ought to be granted, both in proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and full proportion, that there may be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for complaint, either of <hi>penurious</hi> or <hi>unjuſt</hi> dealing.</p>
            <p>I may add here, the <hi>diſtribution of rewards,</hi> in caſe of extraordinary ſervice done for a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, falls properly under this head of juſtice. For tho' there may be <hi>bounty</hi> in it, there is alſo a mixture of <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> But however this be, it has been the practice of all nations to ſhew ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular marks of reſpect to thoſe who have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves by their eminent labours for the public. And it is to be hoped, this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will never be backward, according to their ability, ſuitably to reward thoſe who have ſignalized themſelves, in doing ſervice for their king and country.]</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another general inſtance wherein rulers ſhould be juſt, concerns the <hi>liberties</hi> and <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of the <hi>ſubject.</hi> In all governments there is a reſerve of certain rights in favour of the people: In ſome, they are few in kind, and ſmall in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: In others, they are both great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; rendring the people ſignally happy whoſe lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is to be favoured with the undiſturbed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them. And it would be no wonder, if they ſhould keep a jealous eye over them, and think no coſt too much to be expended, for the defence and ſecurity of them: Eſpecially, if they
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005919_0032_10292A96629706B8"/>
were the purchaſe of wiſe and pious anceſtors, who ſubmitted to difficulties, endured hardſhips, ſpent their eſtates, and ventured their lives, that they might tranſmit them as an inheritance to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>And ſhall ſuch valuable, dear-bought rights be neglected, or invaded by the rulers of a people? 'Tis a principal part of that juſtice which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expected of them, as they would not groſly pervert one of the main ends of their office, to preſerve and perpetuate to every member of the community, ſo far as may be, the full enjoyment of their liberties and priviledges, whether of a <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>religious</hi> nature.</p>
            <p>Here I may ſay diſtinctly,</p>
            <p>As rulers would be juſt, they muſt take all proper care to preſerve entire the <hi>civil</hi> rights of a people. And the ways in which they ſhould expreſs this care are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>They ſhould do it by appearing in <hi>defence</hi> of their liberties, if called in queſtion, and making uſe of all wiſe and ſutable methods to prevent the loſs of them: Nor can they be too active, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or laborious in their endeavours upon this head: Provided always, the priviledges in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger are worth contending for, and ſuch as the people have a juſt right and legal claim to. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, there may be hazard of loſing <hi>real</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, in the ſtrife for thoſe that are <hi>imaginary;</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:005919_0033_10292A5530794958"/>
or <hi>valuable</hi> ones, for ſuch as are of trifling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>They ſhould alſo expreſs this care, by ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and faithfully placing a proper guard againſt the deſigns of thoſe, who would rule in a <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> manner, to the ſubverſion of the rights natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or legally veſted in the people. And here 'tis a great miſtake to ſuppoſe, there can be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger only from thoſe in the higheſt ſtation. There may, 'tis true, be danger from this quarter: And it has ſometimes proved ſo in fact: An unhappy inſtance whereof was ſeen in the <hi>arbitrary</hi> reign of king JAMES the <hi>ſecond,</hi> in <hi>perſon</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and by his <hi>repreſentative here;</hi> as a check to which, thoſe entruſted with the guardianſhip of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's rights were ſpirited to take ſuch meaſures, as iſſued in that <hi>revolution,</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhment of the ſucceſſion,</hi> on which his preſent majeſty's claim to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> throne is dependent. May the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> be continued in his royal houſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever! And may the ſame ſpirit, which ſettled it there, prevail in the rulers of the Engliſh nation, ſo long as the ſun and moon ſhall endure!</p>
            <p>But, as I ſaid, a people's liberties may be in danger from others, beſides thoſe in the higheſt rank of government. The men who ſtrike in with the <hi>popular</hi> cry of <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>priviledge,</hi> working themſelves, by an artful application to the fears and jealouſies of the people, into their good opinion of them as lovers of their country,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005919_0034_10292A98DB192240"/>
if not the only ſtanch friends to it's intereſts, may, all the while, be only aiming at power to carry every thing according to their own ſovereign pleaſure: And they are, in this caſe, moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enemies to the community; and may, by degrees, if not narrowly watched, arrive to ſuch an height, as to be able to ſerve their own ends, by touching even the people in their moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights. And theſe commonly are the men, thro' whoſe influence, either as primary mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or tools to others, they ſuffer moſt in their real liberties.</p>
            <p>In fine, they ſhould expreſs this care in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant readineſs to bear due teſtimony againſt even the ſmaller encroachments upon the liberty of the ſubject, whether by private men's invading one another's rights, or by the tyranny of inferiour officers, who may treat thoſe under their power, as tho' they had no <hi>natural</hi> rights, not to ſay a juſt claim to the invaluable priviledges of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> have ſet an illuſtrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this kind. Such was the proviſion they made to ſecure the people's priviledges, that it was dangerous for any man, tho' in <hi>office,</hi> to act towards the meaneſt <hi>freeman</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in violation of the meaneſt of them. Hence the <hi>magiſtrates</hi> who ordered <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to be <hi>beaten uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, feared when they heard they were</hi> ROMANS. And <hi>Lyſias, the chief captain,</hi> was filled with the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005919_0035_10292A56B46D0D10"/>
like <hi>fear</hi> for commanding, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be <hi>examined with ſcourging;</hi> when he underſtood, that he was <hi>born a freeman</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And it would have a good tendency to ſecure to the people the enjoyment of their liberties, if theſe ſmaller inſtances of illegal power were carefully and ſeverely chaſtiſed.</p>
            <p>But juſtice in rulers ſhould be ſeen likewiſe in their care of the <hi>religious</hi> rights and liberties of a people. Not that they are to exert their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in <hi>ſettling articles of faith,</hi> or <hi>impoſing modes of worſhip,</hi> ſo as that all muſt frame their <hi>belief,</hi> and order their <hi>practice,</hi> according to their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or lie expoſed to <hi>penalties</hi> of one kind or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. This would be to put men under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, as to the exerciſe of their religious rights: Nor are <hi>penal laws</hi> at all adjuſted in their nature, to enlighten men's minds, or convince their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This can be done only by <hi>good reaſon:</hi> And this therefore is the only proper way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to reaſonable creatures.</p>
            <p>Juſtice in rulers ſhould therefore put them upon leaving every member of the community, without reſpect of perſons, freely to chooſe his own religion, and profeſs and practice it according to that <hi>external form,</hi> which he apprehends will be moſt acceptable to his maker: Provided, his religion is ſuch as may conſiſt with the public ſafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y: Otherwiſe, it would be neither wiſdom nor juſtice in the government to <hi>tolerate</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005919_0036_10292A9C10CD1620"/>
Nor is this all; but they ſhould guard every man from all inſult and abuſe on account of his religious ſentiments, and from all moleſtation and diſturbance, while he endeavours the propagation of them, ſo far as he keeps within the bounds of decency, and approves himſelf a peaceable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, it would be no more than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, if, as <hi>chriſtian</hi> magiſtrates, they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed thoſe in their regards, who profeſſed the religion of JESUS, and in <hi>that way,</hi> which, to them, was moſt agreable to <hi>ſcripture rule.</hi> They ſhould be guardians to ſuch chriſtian ſocieties, by defending their conſtitution; by countenancing their manner of worſhip; by maintaining the liberties granted to them in the <hi>goſpel-charter,</hi> in all their regular exerciſes, whether in church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for the performance of the ſervices of piety, or the choice of officers, or the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcipline; or in councils, greater or leſs, for the help and preſervation of each other: And, in fine, by owning thoſe who miniſter to them in ſacred things, and providing for their ſupport, according to that rule in <hi>ſcripture,</hi> as well as <hi>common equity,</hi> 'They that preach the goſpel ſhould live of the goſpel': Or if they they are generally and wrongfully kept out of a great part of that ſupport, which has been engaged, and is juſtly due to them, by taking their caſe into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and doing what may be effectual for their relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005919_0037_10292A5A855C6020"/>
This laſt inſtance of the care of rulers, I the rather mention, becauſe it falls in ſo exactly with the circumſtances of the paſtors of the churches in this <hi>province.</hi> There is not, I believe, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men, in the land, more univerſally, or to a greater degree, injured and oppreſſed in regard of their juſt dues. While others have it, in ſome meaſure, in their power to right themſelves, by riſing in their demands, in proportion to the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the current medium, they are confined to a <hi>nominal quantum,</hi> which every day varies in its real worth, and has been gradually doing ſo, 'till it is come to that paſs, that many of them don't receive more than one <hi>half,</hi> or <hi>two thirds</hi> of the <hi>original value</hi> they contracted for. And to this it is owing, that they are diverted from their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, diſcouraged in their work, and too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated with contempt. And what is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their difficulty, their only deſiring that juſtice may be done them, often makes an uneaſineſs among their people: And if they urge it; to be ſure, if they demand it, 'tis great odds but there enſues thereupon contention and ſtrife, and, at laſt, ſuch a general alienation of affection, as puts an entire end to their uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>Suffer me, my <hi>fathers</hi> in the government, as I have this opportunity of ſpeaking in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to beſeech the exerciſe of your authority, on the behalf, (may I not ſay) of ſo valuable and uſeful a part of the community: And the rather, becauſe ſome <hi>ſpecial proviſion</hi> for their relief ſeems
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005919_0038_10292A9D972B80D8"/>
to be a matter of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and not <hi>meer favour;</hi> as it is by means of the <hi>public bills,</hi> tho' contrary to the deſign of the government, that they are injured. And might not <hi>this</hi> be made, without any great expence either of time or pains, and ſo as to be effectual too, to put it out of the power of people to turn off their miniſters with any thing ſhort of the true value of what they agreed with them for, when they ſettled among them? This is all they deſire: And as it is nothing more than common equity, would it not be hard, if they ſhould be ſtill left to groan under their oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to have no helper?</p>
            <p>The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general court,</hi> it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, more than twenty years ſince, "Upon ſerious conſideration of the great diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that many of the miniſters within this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince laboured under, with reſpect to their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>reſolved,</hi> that it was the indiſpenſible duty of the ſeveral towns and pariſhes, to make addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the maintenance of their reſpective mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and therein to have regard to the <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difference in the value of the bills of credit,</hi> from what they had ſometimes been".

And it is with thankfulneſs that we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this inſtance of the care of our <hi>civil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> tho' we are ſorry, we muſt, at the ſame time, ſay, it was generally treated with neglect by our congregations, as being void of power.</p>
            <p>It will not be pretended, but that the diſtreſſes of the miniſters, and from the ſame cauſe too, the ſinking of the medium, are vaſtly greater <hi>now,</hi> than they were <hi>twenty years ago:</hi> And if it was <hi>then</hi> reaſonable, in the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general Court,</hi> to <hi>recommend</hi> it to the ſeveral congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, throughout the province, as their <hi>indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty,</hi> to make additions to the maintenance of their miniſters, and therein to have regard to the lower value of the bills of credit, from what they formerly were; it is certainly <hi>now</hi> high time to <hi>oblige</hi> them to this: Eſpecially, as the grievances of the miniſters have often, ſince that day, upon theſe occaſions, been opened to their <hi>civil fathers,</hi> whoſe interpoſition has been humbly and earneſtly intreated.—But I would not be too preſſing: Neither have I ſaid thus much on my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who am not, thro' the goodneſs of God, in ſuffering circumſtances myſelf, but in very pity to many of my poor brethren who are; becauſe there may be danger leſt guilt ſhould lie on the government, if they take no notice of the ſighing of ſo conſiderable a body of men; and becauſe, I verily believe, the offerings of the Lord are too often deſpiſed, by reaſon of that poverty thoſe are

            <p n="5">5. Another inſtance of juſtice in rulers relates to the <hi>defence</hi> of the ſtate, and it's <hi>preſervation</hi> in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ſafety.</hi> [The happineſs of a people lies very much in their living peaceably among themſelves, and at quiet with their neighbours. For which reaſon, rulers are bound in juſtice to uſe all prudent endeavours, that they may 'fit every man under his own vine, and under his fig-tree, and have none to make them afraid'. In order whereunto,</p>
            <p>They ſhould take care to prevent inteſtine jarrs and commotions in the government, by giving no occaſion for murmurings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; or if any ſhould unhappily ariſe, by ſpeedily removing the cauſes of them: By teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a juſt diſpleaſure againſt the fomentors of animoſities, fewds and factions: By watching the motions of uneaſy, turbulent and mobbiſh ſpirits, and checking the firſt out-breakings of them; or if, thro' the luſts of men, inſurrection or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſhould happen, by ſeaſonably putting a ſtop thereto, leſt afterwards the whole force of the government ſhould be ſcarce ſufficient for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It may be, the late unnatural rebellion, which began in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was too much deſpiſed at firſt.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005919_0042_10292AA3ED0E2A18"/>
It would not otherwiſe, 'tis probable, have riſen to ſuch a formidable height: Tho' the alwiſe holy God, by permitting this, and then remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſucceeding the King's arms, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to put an end to this traiterous attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the throne of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> took occaſion, not only to lay the <hi>nation</hi> and it's <hi>dependencies,</hi> under more ſenſible bonds to give glory to him, in language like that of the 18th Pſalm, 'Great deliverance hath he given to his king, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy to his anointed: Therefore will we give thanks unto thee, O Lord, and ſing praiſes to thy name': But to do that alſo, which was proper to engage their more fervent prayers of faith, that he would go on to <hi>clothe the the king's enemies with ſhame,</hi> and cauſe <hi>the crown to flouriſh on his head,</hi> and the head of his poſterity forever.</p>
            <p>Rulers alſo ſhould endeavour to keep the ſtate from being embroiled in <hi>foreign</hi> war, by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in all prudent ways, to engage and continue the friendſhip of neighbouring nations; by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with leſſer injuries from them, and not haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſenting greater ones, ſo far as may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the public ſafety; by ſacredly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the treaties and contracts, they may have entred into with them; by expreſſing a due cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to invade their rights or properties, or in any inſtance whatever to give them juſt cauſe of provocation: Or if this ſhou'd at any time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005919_0043_10292A62CD1428E8"/>
by appearing ready to make them all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Or if, after all, war ſhould ariſe, by means of the pride, or avarice, or ſelf-will and tyranny of unreaſonable men, their concern ſhould now be to look to the preſervation of the ſtate at home, by providing a ſufficiency of warlike ſtores, in their various kinds; by guarding the expoſed frontiers and coaſts; and, in a word, by putting and keeping things in ſuch a poſture of defence, that neither their people, nor their intereſts, may eaſily fall a prey in their enemy's hands.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, it would be both wiſdom and juſtice to carry the war into their enemies territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; doing every thing in their power to humble their pride, curb their malice, and weaken their ſtrength; eſpecially, where there may be moſt danger of being annoyed by them.]</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> And finally, Rulers ſhould be juſt to promote the <hi>general welfare</hi> and <hi>proſperity</hi> of a people, by diſcouraging, on the one hand, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prodigality, prophaneſs, uncleaneſs, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the like immoralities, which tend, in the natural courſe of things, to their impoveriſhment and ruin: And by encouraging, on the other hand, induſtry, frugality, temperance, chaſtity, and the like moral virtues, the general practice whereof are naturally connected with the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of a people in every thing that tends to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005919_0044_10292A6450F5E370"/>
make them great and happy. As alſo, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the ſupport of government as eaſy as is conſiſtent with it's honour and ſafety; by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating laws to ſet forward thoſe manufactures which may be of public benefit; by freeing trade, as much as poſſible, from all unneceſſary burdens; and, above all, by a wiſe and ſutable proviſion for the inſtruction of children and youth: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto effectual care ſhould be taken for the encouragement and ſupport, not only of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſchools,</hi> but of the <hi>public means of education.</hi> COLLEGES ought to be the ſpecial care of the government, as it is from hence, principally, that it has it's dependence for initiating the youth in thoſe arts and ſciences, which may furniſh them, as they grow up in the world, to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings both in church and ſtate. It would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be unrighteous, not to protect theſe ſocieties in the full and quiet enjoyment of ſuch rights as have been freely and generouſly granted to them: And if they ſhould not have within themſelves a ſufficiency for the ſupport of their officers, it would be a wrong to the community not to do what was further wanting towards their comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and honourable ſupport.</p>
            <p>And having thus, in a general and imperfect manner, gone over the more important inſtances, wherein rulers ſhould be juſt, it might now be proper to enlarge on the <hi>obligations</hi> they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſo: But the time will allow me only to ſuggeſt as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:005919_0045_10292A67762E25D0"/>
[They are obliged to be thus juſt, from the <hi>fitneſs</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of the thing in <hi>itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</hi> 'Tis a duty that naturally and neceſſarily reſults from the relation they ſtand in to ſociety, and the power they are veſted with, in all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ways, to promote it's welfare. And it would, in the nature of things, be incongruous and abſurd for men ſo ſcituated and betruſted, and for ſuch good ends, to injure thoſe over whom they are exalted, by abuſing their power to the purpoſes of tyranny and oppreſſion. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would evidently and groſly break in upon that <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>fitneſs</hi> of action, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably and eternally required, in ſuch a <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things,</hi> as <hi>rulers</hi> and <hi>ruled,</hi> and the <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obligations</hi> reſpectively ariſing therefrom.</p>
            <p>They are alſo obliged to be thus juſt, in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>ſupreme legiſlator,</hi> made known in the <hi>revelations of ſcripture;</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins ſuch precepts as thoſe, 'Judges and officers ſhalt thou make thee;—and they ſhall judge the people with juſt judgment. Thou ſhalt not wreſt judgment;—that which is altogether juſt ſhalt thou follow'.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Deut. 16, 18, 19, 20.</note> And again, 'Thus ſaith the Lord, Execute ye judgment and righteouſneſs, and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hand of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor: And do no wrong, do no violence to the ſtranger, the fatherleſs, nor the widow':<note n="‖" place="bottom">Jer. 22. 3.</note> To which laws of the great king of the world they

owe an indiſputed obedience, as they are, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the reſt of mankind, the ſubjects of his government: Nor can they be freed from the charge of reflecting contempt on the divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and that ſovereign authority by which he governs his creatures, if, in their adminiſtrations, they ſhould expreſs a diſregard to them.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe obliged to be juſt, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>community,</hi> to which they are related; whoſe welfare is ſo dependent hereon, that if they act, in their reſpective ſtations, not from a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of juſtice, but under the influence of worldly views and ſelfiſh deſigns, it may reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that 'judgment ſhould be turned away backward, and juſtice ſtand afar off'; that 'truth ſhould fall in the ſtreet, and equity not be able to enter': The natural effect whereof muſt be the ruin of a people. Whereas, if they 'put on righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and it clothes them; and their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as a robe and a diadem: If they deliver the poor that cry, and the fatherleſs, and him that hath none to help him; and break to pieces the wicked, and pluck the ſpoil of his teeth'; they will approve themſelves thoſe 'righteous ones in authority, who cauſe the people to rejoice': And the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> wherewith they rule them will be their <hi>exaltation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, it ſhould be a conſtraining argument with rulers to be juſt, that they are accountable to that JESUS, whom God hath ordained to be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005919_0047_102929F66ADFFB90"/>
the judge of the world, for the uſe of that power he has put into their hands. And if, by their unjuſt behaviour in their places. they have not only injured the people, but unhappily led them, by their example, into practices that are fradulent and diſhoneſt; I ſay, if they have thus miſuſed their power, ſad will be their account another day; ſuch as muſt expoſe them to the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their judge, which they will not be able to eſcape. It will not be any ſecurity them, that they were once ranked among the great men of the earth. This may <hi>now</hi> be a protection to them, and it often indeed ſcreens them from that human vengeance, which overtakes thoſe of leſs influence, tho' guilty of leſs crimes: But the 'kings of the earth, and the great men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men', will in the day of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the ſon of God, be upon a level with the meaneſt of mankind, and as ready, if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves that they have been unjuſt in their ſtations, to 'ſay to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand'? A moſt affecting conſideration, and ſhould powerfully excite thoſe who rule over others, to a righteous exerciſe of their power; eſpecially, as they will by this means, if in other reſpects alſo they have behaved well, obtain the approbation of their judge; who will, as they have been 'faithful over a few things,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005919_0048_10292AA7D400D1B0"/>
make them ruler over many'; placing them at his own right hand, in his kingdom.</p>
            <p>II. I now proceed to ſay, in the ſecond place, Thoſe who rule over men, muſt <hi>rule in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fear of God, being not only in itſelf a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of religion, but alſo a grace that has a ſpecial influence on all the other parts of it, is commonly, and not unfitly, uſed in ſcripture to ſignify the whole of it. This ſeems to be the meaning of the phraſe here: And the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is, not only that rulers ſhould be endowed with an inward principle of religion, but that they ſhould exerciſe their authority, in their whole adminiſtration, under the influence of ſo good and powerful a diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that ruleth over men, muſt rule in the fear of God.</hi> As if the royal prophet had ſaid, 'It is neceſſary, civil rulers ſhould have upon their minds a becoming ſenſe of God and religion: And it ſhould govern their public conduct. Whatever they do, in their ſeveral ſtations, ſhould be done under the guidance of an habitual awe of God, a ſerious regard to his governing will, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableneſs to him. This is the principle that ſhould have a predominating ſway in all exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of themſelves in their public capacity'. This I take to be the true ſenſe of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:005919_0049_10292A7D54C27018"/>
To be ſure, 'tis the truth of the thing. Civil rulers ought to be poſſeſſed of a principle of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to act under the direction of it in their reſpective ſtations. This is a matter of <hi>neceſſity.</hi> I don't mean that it is neceſſary in order to their having a <hi>right</hi> to rule over men. <hi>Dominion is not founded in grace:</hi> Nor is every pious good man fit to be entruſted with civil power.—'Tis eaſy to diſtinguiſh between government in it's <hi>abſtracted notion,</hi> and the <hi>faithful advantageous adminiſtration</hi> of it. And religion in rulers is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the <hi>latter,</hi> tho' not to the former.</p>
            <p>Not but that they may be conſiderably uſeful in their places, if the religious fear of God does not reign in their hearts. From a natural bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of temper, accompanied with an active honeſt turn of mind, they may be inſtrumental in doing good ſervice to the public: Nay, they may be prompted, even from a view to themſelves, their own honour and intereſt, to behave well in the poſts they ſuſtain, at leaſt, in many inſtances. But if deſtitute of religion, they are poſſeſſed of no principle that will ſtimulate a care in them to act up to their character <hi>ſteadily</hi> and <hi>univerſally,</hi> and ſo as fully to anſwer the ends of their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>'Tis a principle of religion, and this only, that can ſet them free from the unhappy influence of thoſe <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>luſts,</hi> which they are ſubject to, in common with other men, and by means
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005919_0050_10292AD6E5513900"/>
whereof they may be betrayed into that tyranny and oppreſſion, that violence and injuſtice, which will deſtroy the peace and good order of ſociety. Theſe, 'tis true, may be under ſome tolerable check from other principles, at leaſt, for a while, and in reſpect of thoſe actings that are plainly enormous. But no reſtraints are like thoſe, which the true fear of God lays upon men's luſts. This habitually prevailing in the hearts of rulers, will happily prevent the out-breaking of their pride, and envy, and avarice, and ſelf-love, and other luſts, to the damage of ſociety; and not only ſo, but it will weaken, and gradually deſtroy, the very inward propenſities themſelves to the various acts of vice. It naturally, and powerfully, tends to this: And this is the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ct it will produce, in a leſs or greater degree, according to the ſtrength of the religious principle, in thoſe who are the ſubjects of it.</p>
            <p>And a principle of religion alſo, and this only, will be effectual to excite rulers to a uniform, conſtant and univerſal regard to truth and juſtice, in their public conduct. Inferiour principles may influence them in particular caſes, and at certain ſeaſons: But the fear of God only will prompt them to <hi>every inſtance</hi> of right action, and <hi>at all times.</hi> This will poſſeſs them of ſuch ſentiments, give ſuch a direction to their views, and fix ſuch a happy biaſs on their minds, as that their chief concern and care will be, to behave in their offices ſo as to anſwer the good ends for
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005919_0051_10292AAA8F5A4088"/>
which they were put into them. In one word, They will now be the ſubjects of that <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> principle of good conduct, which may, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, be depended on, to carry them thro' the whole of their duty, upon all occaſions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all difficulties, and in oppoſition to all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to the rendring the people, over whom they bear rule, as happy as 'tis in their power to make them.</p>
            <p>To be ſure, without a principle of religion, none of their ſervices for the public will meet with the divine approbation. 'Tis therefore, in reſpect of <hi>themſelves,</hi> a matter of abſolute neceſſity that they be poſſeſs'd of the true fear of God. It won't ſuffice, ſhould they behave well in their places, if they have no higher view herein than their own private intereſt; if they are influenced, not from a due regard to God, his honour and authority, but from love to themſelves. This will ſpoil their beſt ſervices, in point of the divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: Whereas, if they act from a principle of religion, what they do in a way of ſerving their generation will be kindly taken at the hands of a merciful God, and he will, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, amply reward them for it, in the great day of retribution.]</p>

               <p>Religion is not in ſuch a flouriſhing ſtate, at this day, but that it needs the countenance of your example, and the interpoſition of your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to keep it from inſult and contempt. We thankfully acknowledge the pious care, the legiſlature has lately taken to reſtrain the horrid practice of curſing and ſwearing, which ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prevailed, eſpecially in this, and our other ſea-port towns, to the diſhonour of God, and our reproach as wearing the name of chriſtians.

And tho' we would be far from deſiring, that our rulers ſhould eſpouſe a party in religion; yet we cannot but hope, they will never do any thing to encourage thoſe, who may have arrived at ſuch an height in ſpiritual pride, as to ſay, in their practice, to their brethren as good as themſelves, 'ſtand by thyſelf, come not near me; for I am holier than thou': Concerning whom the bleſſed God declares, 'Theſe are a ſmoke in my noſe, a fire that burneth all the day'.

               <p>We are thankful for the good and wholeſome laws which have been made, from time to time, for the ſuppreſſion of vice, in it's various kinds; and, in particular, for the reſtraint that has been laid upon thoſe, who may be inclined to exceſſive drinking. Alas! that ſuch multitudes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, are overtaken with this fault. Hard drinking is indeed become common all over the land. And 'tis aſtoniſhing to think what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ſtrong drink are conſumed among us! Unleſs ſome, well capable of forming a judgment, are very much miſtaken, more a great deal is needleſſly and viciouſly conſumed than would ſuffice to anſwer the whole charge, both of church and ſtate. A reproach this, to any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! And if ſomething further is not done by the government, to prevent the uſe that is made of ſtrong drink, it will, in a little time, prove the deſtruction of the country, in the natural courſe of things; if God ſhould not poſitively teſtify his diſpleaſure againſt ſuch horrid intemperance. It may deſerve your conſideration, my <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:005919_0061_10292AB632CB5B60"/>
whether one occaſion of this ſcandalous conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrong drink, has not been the needleſs multiplication of <hi>taverns,</hi> as well as more <hi>private licenſed houſes,</hi> that are too commonly uſed for <hi>tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and ſerve to little purpoſe, but to tempt people, in low life, ſinfully to waſte their time, and ſpend their ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>[It would alſo redound much to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the province, if our <hi>civil Fathers</hi> could contrive ſome way or other, that might be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to prevent people's laying out ſo much of the fruit of their labour, in that which is <hi>needleſs</hi> and <hi>extravagant.</hi> It will not be denied, by any capable of making obſervation, that the <hi>exceſſes,</hi> all ranks of perſons have unhappily run into, need correction. 'Tis owing, in a great meaſure, to our <hi>pride,</hi> diſcovering it ſelf in the <hi>extravagance</hi> of our <hi>garb,</hi> as well as <hi>manner of living,</hi> that we are brought low. And, if ſome <hi>reſtraint</hi> is not laid upon this vicious diſpoſition, ſo generally prevalent in the land, we may complain of our difficulties, but 'tis not likely, without a miracle, they ſhould be redreſſed.]</p>
               <p>But there is nothing more needs your awaken'd attention, my honoured <hi>Fathers</hi> in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the unhappy ſtate of this people by means of the <hi>current medium.</hi> Whatever wiſe and good ends might be propoſed at firſt, and from time to time, in the <hi>emiſſion of bills of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> they have proved, in the event, a cruel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005919_0062_10292AE77480DF48"/>
of oppreſſion. It may be, there was ſcarce ever a province under more melancholly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by reaſon of injuſtice, which is become almoſt unavoidable. Sad is the caſe of your men of <hi>nominal ſalaries:</hi> And much to be pitied alſo are thoſe <hi>widows</hi> and <hi>orphans,</hi> who depend on the loan of their money for a ſubſiſtance: While yet, theſe laſt, of all perſons in the community, ſhould be moſt carefully guarded againſt every thing that looks like oppreſſion. This ſin, when <hi>widows</hi> and <hi>fatherleſs children</hi> are the perſons wronged by it, is heinouſly aggravated in the ſight of a righteous God; as may eaſily be collected from that emphatical prohibition, ſo often repeated in all parts of the bible, 'Thou ſhalt not oppreſs the widow, nor the fatherleſs'. But the oppreſſion reigning in the land, is not confined to this order or that condition of perſons, but touches all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. None eſcape its pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, neither high nor low, rich nor poor. Like an over-bearing flood, it makes its way thro' the province; and all are ſufferers by it, in a leſs or greater degree, and feel and own themſelves to be ſo.</p>
               <p>And will you, our honoured rulers, by any poſitive acts, or faulty neglects, ſuffer your ſelves to be inſtrumental in the continuance of ſuch a ſtate of things? God forbid! We don't think you would <hi>deſignedly</hi> do any thing to countenance oppreſſion, or neglect any thing that might have a tendency to remove it out of the land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:005919_0063_10292ABA780114F8"/>
Neither can we think, that any former aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have <hi>knowingly</hi> acted, in the <hi>emiſſion of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bills,</hi> upon diſhoneſt principles: Tho' it may be feared, whether the righteous God, in holy diſpleaſure at the ſins both of <hi>rulers</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> may not have witheld counſel from our wiſe men, and ſcattered darkneſs in their paths: And if, in conſequence hereof, there has been diſunion in the ſentiments of our <hi>civil Fathers,</hi> concerning the <hi>public medium,</hi> and unſteadineſs in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, 'tis no matter of wonder: Nor, upon this ſuppoſition, is it hard to be accounted for, that injuſtice, by means of the <hi>paper currency,</hi> ſhould have taken ſuch a general and dreadful ſpread, thro' the land.</p>
               <p>But, by what means ſoever we became invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in theſe perplexities, 'tis certainly high time to make a pauſe, and conſider what may be done that will be effectual towards the recovering and maintaining juſtice and honeſty, that we may be called the <hi>city of righteouſneſs, the faithful city.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be culpable vanity in me, to attempt to preſcribe to our honourable legiſlature; yet may I, without going beyond my line, after the example of the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> with you <hi>of public righteouſneſs,</hi> and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with <hi>a judgment to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are, my <hi>Fathers,</hi> accountable to that God whoſe throne is in the heavens, in common with

other men. And his eyes behold your conduct in your public capacity, and he ſees and obſerves it, not merely as a ſpectator, but an almighty righteous judge, one who enters all upon record in order to a reckoning another day. And a day is coming, it lingers not, when you ſhall all ſtand upon a level, with the meaneſt ſubjects, before the tremendous bar of the righteous judge of all the earth, and be called upon to render an account, not only of your private life, but of your whole management as entruſted with the concerns of this people.</p>
               <p>Under the realiſing apprehenſion of this, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me, in the name of God, (tho' the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his ſervants) to adviſe you to review the public conduct, reſpecting the <hi>paſſing bills,</hi> and to do whatever may lay in your power to prevent their being the occaſion of that injuſtice, which, if continued much longer, will deſtroy the ſmall remains of common honeſty that are ſtill left in the land, and make us an abhorrence to the people that delight in righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Let me beſeech you, <hi>Sirs,</hi> for the ſake of this poor people, and for the ſake of your own ſouls, when you ſhall ſtand before the dreadful bar of the eternal judgment, to lay aſide all party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and private conſiderations, and to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon this great affair, with a ſingle view to the public good, and under the uniform influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005919_0065_10292ABCDAFCAD18"/>
of a ſteady principle of righteouſneſs; for, as the wiſe man obſerves, 'tranſgreſſors ſhall be taken in their own naughtineſs', while 'the righteouſneſs of the upright ſhall deliver them, and their integrity ſhall guide them'; and a-again, 'as for the upright, the Lord directeth their way'.</p>
               <p>If there needs any excuſe for my wonted plaineſs of ſpeech, I can only ſay;—my conſcience beareth me witneſs, that what I have ſaid has proceeded, not from want of a decent reſpect for thoſe who are my <hi>civil Fathers,</hi> but from faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, whoſe I am, and whom I deſire to ſerve, as well as from an ardent love to my dear country, which I am grieved to behold in tears, by reaſon of 'the oppreſſions that are done under the ſun'.</p>
               <p>Cuſtom might now demand an addreſs to my fathers and brethen in the <hi>miniſtry;</hi> but as a ſermon will be preached to the <hi>clergy</hi> to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, by one who is every way my ſuperior, and from whom I expect myſelf to receive inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall no otherwiſe apply to them than as they may be concerned in the <hi>exhortation</hi> to the <hi>people,</hi> which, agreably to the preceeding diſcourſe, ſpeaketh in the words of the inſpired <hi>Solomon,</hi> 'Fear God, and honour the king'.</p>

our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſubjects of that regenerating change, which ſhall renew your whole inner man, and form you to a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the bleſſed Jeſus, in the moral temper of his mind.</p>
               <p>And let your religion now diſcover itſelf in all proper ways; particularly, in doing your duty to thoſe, whom it hath pleaſed God to entruſt with power to rule over you.</p>
               <p>Be exhorted to 'make ſupplications, prayers and interceſſions, with giving of thanks, for the King in ſupreme, and for all in authority' under him, that by means of their wiſe, and gentle, and juſt adminiſtrations in Government, we may 'lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty'.</p>
               <p>And as ſubjection to civil rulers is ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily demanded of you, by the laws of our holy religion, that you can't be good chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, let me caution you, on the one hand, not to 'deſpiſe dominion', nor 'ſpeak evil of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities': And, on the other, let me 'put you in mind to be ſubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magiſtrates; ſubmitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake: Whether it be to the king, as ſupreme; or unto gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the

praiſe of them that do well: 'For ſo is the will of God'.</p>
               <p>And as rulers are the miniſters of God, his authoris'd deputies, for the people's good, and continually, ſo far as they anſwer the ends of their inſtitution, attend on this very thing: 'For this cauſe pay you tribute alſo': And do it, not grudgingly, but with a chearful mind, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that glorious ſovereign Being, who has ſaid, 'render unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar'</hi>s'.</p>
               <p>In fine, Let me call upon you to 'render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all their dues'. Abhor the little arts of fraud and deceit that are become ſo common, in this day of growing diſhoneſty. Make uſe of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> in your dealings with your neighbour; and be fair and equitable, wherein you may have to do with him in a way of commerce.

               </gap> the audience of the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is taken from the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Barnard'</hi>s Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Sermon; where, ſpeaking of the <hi>medium of our trade,</hi> he ſays, (pag. 29, 30.) <q>It was the poſitive law of God, (yet in it ſelf a moral precept;) (Lev. xix. 35, 36.) <hi>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judgment, in mete-yard, in weight; in meaſure: juſt ballances, juſt weights, and a juſt ephah, and a juſt hin, ſhall ye have.</hi> And ſo may context ſays, the <hi>juſt weight, and ballance, are the Lord's.</hi> They are what God ſtrictly requires. They are his weight, and meaſure, and not to be altered by man, at pleaſure. And if the weight, and meaſure, by which men deal out to their neighbours, muſt be juſt, certain, and invariable, much more ought that to be ſo which is the ſtandard of all others, and the only ſure rule by which to proportion the value of every thing; which it cannot be, while it is left to every man's diſcretion, juſtice or probity, to lengthen, or ſhorten, to widen, or contract, to add to, or take from, it, as may beſt ſuit with his particular occaſions. 'Till a Government have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ballance even, and the weight, meteyard, ephah, and hin, of ſuch a certain ſize, that every man may know what certain rule to go by, in dealing with his neighbour, it will be left to each perſon to act as he pleaſes; and when every man is left at ſuch a lawleſs liberty, it will not be to be wondered at, if ſome that can't help it, are forced to accept of the one half of the weight and meaſure that others can demand; or if what was but an ounce a while ago be grown up to a pound anon, and the nail ſtretches it ſelf to a yard; I mean the variations of all meaſure will be without bounds, becauſe the medium that proves them is it ſelf variable; and there will as certainly be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in the variation, in the diminiſhing hand, let the quantity of the medium be more or leſs, as that there are men that buy, and ſell, and hope to get gain. What the conſequents of this muſt be to a people, needs no great foreſight to determine. And where the fault of all the
<pb facs="unknown:005919_0070_10292AF2D55351F0"/>
confuſion brought upon ſuch a people, will at laſt be found to lie (tho' it might have taken it's riſe from humane frailty, and miſtake, but becomes greatly aggravated by the continuance of the error after the diſcovery of it,) every one may plainly ſee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The other are borrowed from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Appleton'</hi>s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon the like occaſion, in which it is ſaid, (pag. 37, 38.) <q>Many of our rulers have from the beginning been men of juſtice and wiſdom, that have had the knowledge and the principle; but there is reaſon to fear this has not been the caſe of all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is to be feared, that ſome former aſſemblies have not in all reſpects govern'd themſelves by thoſe precepts and principles; if they had, I cannot think we ſhould have been ſo involved, as now we are. <hi>GOD forbid, that I ſhould be guilty of raſh judging.</hi> But who can think, if there had been nothing of a party-ſpirit, or of a ſpirit of pride and oppoſition, nothing of a ſelfiſh and a contracted ſpirit, that the Province would have been ſo perplexed, as that now it ſeems to be beyond any common ſkill to extricate it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That <hi>honeſty is the beſt policy</hi> is as true as it is a common ſaying, and is abundantly ſupported by the oracles of truth: <hi>the righteouſneſs of the upright ſhall deliver them, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors ſhall be taken in their own naughtineſs,</hi> Prov. 11. 6. The righteous Lord, I fear, has been provoked with the corruptions that he has ſeen in our general Courts, and ſo has withheld wiſdom from the wiſe, and ſcattered darkneſs in their paths, and left many marks of his diſpleaſure upon us. The unſteady conduct about our <hi>medium</hi> ſhews, that there has wanted not only wiſdom, but truth and juſtice. For if there had been that uprightneſs, and ſuch a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted regard to the public good as there ſhould have been; I can't think that things would have come to this unhappy paſs. The integrity of the upright would have guided them into better meaſures, than to ſend forth a medium with ſuch a <hi>depreciating tendency</hi> in it; that inſtead of it's being a fixed ſteady medium of commutative juſtice, it has been, for many years, the grand medium of injuſtice among us, and rendred juſtice between man and man almoſt impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</q>
