            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT prevailed on me to conſent to the publiſhing of the following Letter, was a ſincere and firm Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that it is really the Cauſe of GOD and his CHRIST that I here plead, and that the eternal Intereſt of the Souls of Men is very nearly concerned in it. For it is manifeſt to me, that ſome Notions have of late been propagated and inculcated in this Country, that are equally deſtructive to the right Belief both of GOD and the Goſpel. I have indeed that Charity for thoſe that have done it, that I do not believe they are at all ſenſible of theſe fatal Conſequences of what they teach, tho' I very much wonder they are not aware of them.</p>
            <p>I am not inſenſible that the odious Name of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> will be the Cry againſt theſe Papers, from thoſe little Minds that are affected with Sounds more than Senſe, and that are engaged at any Rate to ſupport a Party, without ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and impartially attending to the Truth and Right of the Caſe. But I do hereby declare, that I abhor all ſuch Party Names and Diſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>ns, and that <hi>I will call no Man Maſter upon Earth, for one is my Maſter in Heaven.</hi> The only Queſtion worth attending to, is, not what <hi>Calvin</hi> or what <hi>Arminius</hi> taught, but what CHRIST and his Apoſtles taught? for He alone was <hi>the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of our Faith.</hi> And, (all <hi>Metaphyſics</hi> and Words without any Meaning, being ſet aſide, which have nothing to do in the preſent Subject,) I humbly ſubmit it to every one's Candor and unbyaſſed Conſideration, whether what follows
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:005614_0004_102691B61F005B08"/>
be not truly the Doctrine of Chriſt: The Subſtance of which may be briefly expreſſed in the following Manner, and in the very Language of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That GOD really means as he ſays, when he ſays and ſwears by himſelf, That he hath no pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth:—That he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance and be ſaved:—And that he hath given his Son a Ranſom for all, who accordingly hath taſted Death for every Man, and was a Propotiation for the Sins of the whole World:— So that whoſoever will may now come and take of the Waters of Life freely.— And becauſe of our Inability to help our ſelves, GOD hath by his bleſſed Son, aſſured us that he will, for his ſake, give his Holy Spirit to every one that ſeriouſly aſks him, and earneſtly ſtrives to work out his Salvation with Fear and Trembling, in whom he works by his bleſſed Spirit both to will and to do:—And that he will through his free Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, moſt aſſuredly pardon every true Penitent, accept of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believer, and eternally reward all thoſe that in the way of well doing, or in a ſtedfaſt Courſe of ſincere and univerſal Obedience to the Goſpel, are faithful unto the Death.</q>— This is the true Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; and this is all that I was concerned to defend in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>UPON a more mature Conſideration of what you, not long ſince, ſuggeſted to me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Divine Sovereignty,</hi> together with what you added upon that Occaſion, relating to the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel; I beg leave to write a few Lines to you upon this Subject; nothing captious or diſputacious, I aſſure you, but with that ſerious, calm and impartial State of Mind that becomes a Chriſtian, who is above all Things deſirous to know the Truth, in order that he may be governed by it in the purſuit of everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
               <p>You may remember, it was your chief Inquiry, as a Teſt of my being a true Chriſtian;—<hi>Can you in Sincerity ſubſcribe to the Truth of OUR Doctrine?</hi> By which you meant the Doctrine of the Divine Sovereignty, as you had explain'd it: <hi>i. e.</hi> (if I underſtood you right,) as implying God's eternal, arbitrary and abſolute Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the everlaſting Fate of his Creatures, from his own meer Motion, and without any Conſideration of their good or ill Behaviour. To which, I muſt ſtill anſwer; No, <hi>good Sir,</hi> by no means! For the ſake of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005614_0006_1026B073612E81C0"/>
the Love of God I cannot!—The <hi>Love of Chriſt it ſelf conſtraineth me</hi> that I cannot!—For it manifeſtly appears to me infinitely impoſſible to be true, as being utterly contrary to the <hi>Divine Attributes;</hi> contrary to many <hi>plain Texts</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and contrary to the general Drift and Deſign of the <hi>whole Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is contrary to the Nature and Attributes of God, becauſe it appears plainly inconſiſtent with the very Notion of his being a Moral Governour of the World: For it repreſents Him as laying his Creatures under a Neceſſity of being what they are, whether good or bad, and ſo leaves no Room for either Virtue or Vice, Praiſe or Blame, Reward or Puniſhment, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. —Nay, it implies a formed Deſign of laying, by far the greateſt Number of his Creatures, under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being eternally miſerable, antecedent to any Conſideration of their Demerit: And this, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by ſome, from a moſt ſelfiſh View of promoting his own Glory, at the Expence of their endleſs and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Miſery; and in effect, of neceſſitating their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful that they might be miſerable; for he that wills the End, muſt will the Means; and this implies the moſt ſhocking Reflexions imaginable on the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Holineſs, Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, all at once; and no leſs ſevere Reflections upon his Truth; for it imports a manifeſt Double Dealing with them; a ſecret Will inconſiſtent with what he has clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; ſince he has declared, and that with an Oath, that he earneſtly deſires their Happineſs, when at the ſame Time he ſecretly deſigns their inevitable Ruin.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine alſo appears to be evidently contrary to a great many plain Texts of Holy Scripture, which aſſure us in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt Terms, That <hi>GOD is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance. That He would have all Men to be
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005614_0007_1026B0A7B3EA0A00"/>
ſaved, and</hi> that for this End <hi>he ſent his Son into the World, who taſted Death for every Man,</hi> and <hi>became a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> and <hi>gave himſelf a Ranſom for all;</hi> nay, even for thoſe that <hi>by denying the Lord that bought them, bring upon themſelves ſwift Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Ezek. 18.29, 32. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. and 2.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.2. <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>—</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it ſeems manifeſtly repugnant to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Drift of the whole Word of God, (which is plainly to excite our utmoſt Activity in the purſuit of all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Heart and Life,) there being nothing that can ſo effectually tend not only to tempt us to entertain hard and unworthy Thoughts of God, but alſo to cut the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of all our Endeavours to repent and return to Him and our Duty, as even the moſt diſtant Surmize, that poſſibly all our Labour may be in vain; ſince, for ought we know, we may be abſolutely excluded from all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſucceeding by a ſovereign and inexorable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary, nothing can ſo effectually tend to put us upon the moſt vigourous Exertion of our ſelves in endeavouring to be <hi>Holy as God is Holy, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as He is Righteous, and Merciful as He our Heavenly Father is Merciful,</hi> as thoſe moſt amiable Apprehenſions of him, which repreſent him as being, in and through his bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt, an univerſal and irreſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Lover of the <hi>Souls which he hath made,</hi> and ſincerely and ſolicitouſly deſirous of their Happineſs, in proportion to their ſeveral Capacities, for Chriſt's Sake, <hi>without reſpect of Perſons,</hi> to grant them all the Aid and Aſſiſtance neceſſary thereunto, ſo far as can conſiſt with his treating them as being what they are, and what he himſelf hath made them, <hi>i. e.</hi> tho' frail, yet free, ſelf exerting and ſelf-determining Agents; and to make all the tender and merciful Allowances for their Frailty that can conſiſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005614_0008_1026B0797167C420"/>
with the ſincerity of their Obedience, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Authority in the Government of the World.— And this, I think, is manifeſtly the Idea or Conception of God, which, (agreably to the Light of Nature,) the Holy Scriptures univerſally give us concerning Him.</p>
               <p>On which Account if their be any Difficulties from either Reaſon or Scripture, (as to me there appear none, but what by attentive Conſideration may be eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted.) yet methinks we ſhould be ſtrongly inclined, for God's ſake as well as our own, to get over them; and whatever obſcure Texts there may be that may ſeem to carry a different Sound, to interpret them, (as in fact the Church of God always did in the firſt and pureſt Ages; <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr, <hi>Whitby</hi>'s Diſcourſe on theſe Subjects, paſſion.</note> and as we do now,) in a Manner conſiſtent with the Divine Attributes, and thoſe many plain Texts that are intirely conſonant to them, and the general Drift of the whole Word of God; being well aſſured that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the Meaning of thoſe few obſcure Texts, they cannot poſſibly mean any thing contrary either to the Light of Nature, or any other Texts of Scripture, or that can tend to diſcourage or diſhearten our utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſeek and purſue the everlaſting Happineſs of our Souls.—</p>
               <p>In this Manner I am obliged to think upon this great and important Subject.—But you told me if I could not think with you about the Divine Sovereignty, <q>I need go no further in my Inquiry, there already appears upon me a black Mark, and my Spot is not the Spot of God's Children.</q>—Nay, you did, in effect, tell me, It <hi>is impoſſible</hi> for me under this miſtake, <q>to be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of God's ſpecial Grace here, or Glory hereafter.</q>

                  <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can receive it?</hi>—I beſeech you, <hi>Sir,</hi> can this be right, to paſs ſuch bitter Cenſures upon every one that cannot think preciſely with you in ſome ſpeculative Points, tho' they agree with you both in Heart and Life, in the great practical Matters wherein the Life of all Religion conſiſts?—Is this, can this be conſiſtent with the Spirit of the Goſpel thus to judge one another, and to propagate a Spirit of judging at ſuch a prodigious Rate?— Can any thing be more contrary to Chriſt's Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Judge not that ye be not judged,</hi> and to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s whole 14th to the <hi>Romans,</hi> particularly v. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> And what can this be leſs than a direct Invaſion of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who claims to himſelf alone the Prerogative of <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>ſearching the Hearts and trying the Reins of the Children of Men?</hi>—I do ſincerely profeſs, that after the utmoſt Intenſeneſs of Thought and the moſt ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Care not to be miſled in my Apprehenſions, I am ſtill under the ſame neceſſity of thinking as I do upon theſe Points, as I am in being perſuaded that I ſee the Sun when I look full upon it on the Meridian in a clear Day: And that I can no more yield my Aſſent to ſome Points of your Doctrine than to this Propoſition, that 2 and 2 are equal to 5.—And yet I would by no means cenſure you as you cenſure me; I will not ſuffer my ſelt to imagine but that your Miſtakes, (great as I apprehend them,) may conſiſt with your being a ſerious Chriſtian.</p>

Texts relating to this Matter, it ſeems to me very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to diſtinguiſh between the Conſideration of GOD as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> and as a <hi>Judge;</hi> and between the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, which is a State of Probation, and the Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to be awarded in the Life to come, according to what Uſe they ſhall have made of them here.—In the one God acts as a <hi>Sovereign Lord</hi> of his Favours, and in the other as a <hi>Righteous Judge</hi> of the Behaviour of his Creatures under them.—</p>
               <p>I agree, then, that God is intirely ſovereign and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> in the Diſtribution of his Talents and Favours, both ſpiritual and temporal, as proper Means of Trial and Probation in this World: <hi>i. e.</hi> the various Abilities, Capacities, Privileges and Advantages He beſtoweth upon Mankind: And he is intirely at <hi>Liberty to do what he will with his own;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beſtow, not only the good Things of this Life, but eternal Life and Salvation upon his Creatures in what Manner and Meaſure, and upon what Terms He thinks fit; nor is he obliged to give any Account to any one of his Proceedings. But we may always and in all Caſes reſt aſſured of this, that <hi>the Judge of all the Earth will do</hi> nothing but <hi>what is right;</hi> and that tho' <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs are round about Him,</hi> with regard to many of his Diſpenſations here, yet <hi>Juſtice and Judgment</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>the Habitation of his Throne.</hi> Pſ. 97.2.—Not that Things are therefore right meerly becauſe he does them, but He therefore does them becauſe they are right.</p>
               <p>Indeed I cannot think it conſiſtent with the Divine Attributes, God's Wiſdom, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to give Being to any of his Intelligent Creatures, without putting them into a Condition, that, (every thing being conſidered in the whole of their Nature and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005614_0011_1026B0AC4A6EF5A0"/>
Duration,) would render Being deſirable to them; <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Wollaſton</hi>'s Religion of Nature, p. <hi>200.</hi>
                  </note> nor to put them eternally into a Condition that is <hi>worſe than not to be,</hi> but for their own perſonal Fault or voluntary Miſconduct in Oppoſition to his Will: And if you will weigh Things exactly, I believe you will find your ſelf obliged to think with me in this Matter; unleſs you will go into thoſe two monſtrouſly abſurd Concluſions to which Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> is reduced, and which he is obliged to maintain as being the Foundations of the whole abſolute Syſtem, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it is better to be eternally miſerable, than not to be;</hi> and conſequently, <hi>That it may conſiſt with the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, to inflict exquiſite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miſery upon innocent Creatures:</hi> i. e. <hi>upon ſuch as were never capable of formal or actual Sin.</hi>—See his <hi>Vindiciae Gratioe,</hi> Lib. 2. p. 16. <hi>De Amiſ. Grat. Digr.</hi> 1.—Such are the hopeful Principles on which that fatal Doctrine is founded!—But in truth, methinks I would not wiſh any Cauſe more effectually baffled, than to ſee it reduced to ſuch prodigious Abſurdities as theſe are.</p>
               <p>For tho' God is not accountable to his Creatures for any of his Proceedings, yet we muſt conceive, that his own infinite Wiſdom, Holineſs, Juſtice and Goodneſs muſt be a Law to Him from which he cannot vary.— And as I cannot think it conſiſtent with either of them to lay any of his Creatures, (antecedent to any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Behaviour,) under an abſolute Neceſſity of being eventually and irretrievably miſerable; ſo I muſt do Him that Honour as to think, they do oblige Him, in giving them Being, to put them into a Condition that is in the whole better than not to be, and by no means to put them into a worſe Condition than not to be, but in Caſe of their own wilful Diſobedience and final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: For if you think otherwiſe, you muſt, in effect,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005614_0012_1026B07ECFF29888"/>
ſuppoſe him to will Miſery meerly for Miſery's ſake!— A Thought ſo ſhocking and horrid, that it muſt be forever removed at an infinite Diſtance from that greateſt and beſt of Beings!—But every thing beyond what is juſt ſufficient to render Being deſireable, even to a perfect Creature, however ſo obedient, I take to be Matter of meer ſovereign Goodneſs, in which God may go into what variety He pleaſes: Much more muſt the whole Syſtem of the Goſpel to fallen Man be Matter of meer ſovereign free Grace; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in this Diſpenſation of his free Grace in Chriſt to Mankind, <hi>He hath Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion on whom,</hi> in what Manner and Meaſure, and upon what Terms he ſees fit. And none can reaſonably complain, ſo long as his Condition is better than not to be, and it will be intirely his own Fault if he be not in ſome Degree happy; and ſince he ſhall not be accountable for what he never received, and ſhall be treated according to his Conduct in the uſe of the Talent that was committed to his Truſt.</p>
               <p>GOD is therefore confeſſedly ſovereign and arbitrary in the various Diſtributions of his Talents and Favours to his Creatures, and the ſeveral Conditions in which he places them, as proper Means and Occaſions of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—It is from his meer ſovereign good Pleaſure that he allots to one Creature the Nature and Condition of a Man, to another that of an Angel;—to one Man a healthy, to another a ſickly Conſtitution:—To one Poverty, to another Riches;—to one ſmall Abilities and mean Advantages, to another large Powers and great Opportunities for Learning and Improvement:— To one Man or Number of Men, <hi>One Talent,</hi> viz. the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> to another <hi>two Talents,</hi> viz. <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> to another <hi>five,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>—In theſe and the like various Diſtributions of Favours, Talents and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005614_0013_1026B0ADD937D750"/>
in this State of Probation, I grant God's Decrees and Allotments are abſolute and perſonal as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.—But this is but a temporary and probationary State; whereas in the State of Retribution after this Life, the Condition of Men will be decided for all Eternity, and this, not according to any abſolute Diſpoſition he has already made; not according to what they have received here, but according to what Uſe and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhall have made of what they had received; as is plain from many of our Saviour's Parables and Diſcourſes, and particularly thoſe of the 25th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as well as many other Texts, and indeed from the whole Bible.—It is therefore manifeſt, that with regard to the future State of our Being, a ſovereign and abſolute Deciſion cannot be ſuppoſed to take Place; and that God's Decrees with regard to that State can imply nothing elſe but his Reſolution to treat all Men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Uſe they ſhall have made of his ſeveral Allotments to them in this World: <hi>i. e.</hi> To render the Good Happy and the Wicked Miſerable; in various Proportions, according to their Behaviour.—</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it ſeems to me, that the right Way of forming a juſt Notion of God's Decrees, is, to judge of them by the Facts as they really are before our Eyes. No Man is in fact laid under an abſolute Neceſſity of being ſinful and miſerable in the whole and Reſult of Things; therefore He never decreed abſolutely that he ſhould be ſo: — And God has in fact, aſſured us, that none ſhall be miſerable at laſt but for their own Fault; it muſt therefore be his Decree, that thoſe that are miſerable at laſt ſhall be ſo only for their own inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable Wickedneſs. As <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall be upon him, ſo the Wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him.</hi> Ezek. 18.20.—There are in fact a great variety of Talents and Privileges beſtowed on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005614_0014_1026B0808F278C10"/>
Mankind; therefore God, is the ſovereign Lord of his Favours, decreed there ſhould be ſuch a variety;— and he has in fact declared that Good Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that make a good uſe of them will be happy, and the ſlothful, the wicked and impenitent will be miſerable according to the Sentence which he will paſs upon them as the righteous Judge of their Conduct and Behaviour: He therefore decreed that this ſhould be the Reſult of things, <hi>viz.</hi> That the righteous ſhould be happy and the wicked miſerable.—This is all the Notion that I can have of the Decrees of God: And as I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this is the true Senſe of the Holy Scriptures, taken in the whole, and critically read and conſidered, and with which every particular Text that may ſeem to ſound otherwiſe, may eaſily be reconciled; ſo I can't but think that whatever objections may ſeem to lie againſt it from the Fore-knowledge of God, will be ſound to ariſe only from the narrowneſs of our own way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving things, and to conſiſt meerly in <hi>darkning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel by Words without Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſtrictly and philoſophically ſpeaking, there can be no more Propriety in attributing <hi>Preſcience</hi> or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to God, than in attributing <hi>Repentance</hi> to him; becauſe there is neither <hi>paſt</hi> nor <hi>to come,</hi> neither <hi>fore</hi> nor <hi>after</hi> in him; for theſe Expreſſions imply Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which implies Limitation, which cannot be in an infinitely perfect and immutable Being. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to philoſophic Verity, they cannot any otherwiſe be aſcribed to God than <hi>Repenting, Grieving, Eyes, Ears, Hands</hi> and other bodily Parts and Paſſions.—We are therefore to conceive all theſe and the like Expreſſions which are uſed in the Holy Scriptures, as being, (what they are commonly called,) God's ſpeaking of himſelf after the manner of Men; and conſequently that God's <hi>Foreknowing</hi> and <hi>predeſtinating</hi> are Terms that are uſed,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005614_0015_1026B0AFCDF6FB50"/>
(like his <hi>Repenting,</hi>) meerly figuratively and by way of Accommodation to our weak Capacities and our low way of apprehending and conceiving divine Things; and are to be explained after the ſame Manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That as God's <hi>Repenting, (Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) means not any Change in Him, but only that the Face of his Conduct towards the Old World was, in the Event, as if he had repented he had made it, or as being fitly reſembled, by a Man's repenting of his having made a Thing, when he ſees it needful to deſtroy it: So God's <hi>Foreknowing</hi> and <hi>predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating, (Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) implies, not any thing <hi>fore</hi> or <hi>after, preceeding</hi> or <hi>ſucceeding</hi> in him, but only that the Event in his Conduct in this or the other Inſtance, is as if he had <hi>forſoer</hi> or <hi>fore</hi> determined this or the other Event, or that his infinite Knowledge and unerring Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as they appear in the Facts, may be fitly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the fore-ſight of a wiſe Man who ſhrewdly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juctures beforehand what will happen in ſuch and ſuch Caſes, and before determines and provides accordingly.</p>
               <p>If therefore we would ſpeak with ſtrict Propriety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God in reference to this Matter, we muſt not ſay that he <hi>fore-knows</hi> or <hi>fore-ordains,</hi> but that he <hi>knows</hi> and <hi>ordains,</hi> or appoints; <hi>i. e.</hi> That by one ſingle Act, one infinite all comprehending View, (to which all Things, that with reſpect to our narrow limited Minds, are <hi>paſt, preſent</hi> or <hi>to come,</hi> are equally and at once preſent,) he ſees and knows, approves or diſapproves his Creatures as being what they really are, and appoints, orders and conducts towards them accordingly.—For, as it cannot be but that God's Knowledge muſt be abſolutely perfect, He muſt therefore <hi>fore-ſee,</hi> or rather <hi>ſee</hi> every thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as being what it is; neceſſary Events as being neceſſary, and contingent as being ſuch, and the Actions of ſuch as he has made free Agents as being free; but the Certainty, before it is, that any Thing will be, does
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005614_0016_1026B0848F8C5CA8"/>
no more infer the Neceſſity of it, than the certainty of it when it is, implies its being a neceſſary Event. For if ſo, every thing would be equally neceſſary, and nothing could poſſibly have been otherwiſe than it is: But to ſay this, is abſurd; becauſe we are intuitively certain that we have, (and therefore God has given us,) ſelf-exerting, and ſelf-determining Powers, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that our Actions, and the Events of them do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately depend on our own Wills, which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we blame out ſelves when we do amiſs, as knowing we might have done otherwiſe. Wheareas if we ſuppoſe our Actions immediately depending on the Will of God, we muſt ſuppoſe them neceſſary as to us, and conſequently that we are not to blame for them, being not properly <hi>Agents</hi> but <hi>acted</hi> and neceſſitated in what we do; which is abſurd, as it makes God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Sins, and is inconſiſtent with the very Being of Virtue or Vice, of Praiſe or Blame, and of moral Agency or moral Government.—Since therefore we know that theſe Things are not, and cannot be ſo in themſelves, we are ſure they cannot be known or willed to be ſuch by Almighty God.—</p>
               <p>As therefore God has thus plainly diſcovered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to be ſuch as the Facts in Conjunction with his Attributes and reveal'd Religion declare them to be, and he can have no ſecret Reſerves inconſiſtent with them; ſo I conceive that his great End in giving Being to his Creatures,, and in all his various Diſpenſations towards them muſt have been, (not any Self-Views;—not to ſerve himſelf of them, or to add any thing to his own Happineſs, for he is infinitely Self-ſufficient for that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant on any of his Creatures, but) that they might be happy in proportion to their ſeveral Capacities, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and Improvements, in conſequence of their chearful Submiſſion to his Sovereign Allotments, and ſincere and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005614_0017_1026B0B5E19945C8"/>
faithful Obedience to all his holy and righteous Laws: Only with this Reſerve, that in Caſe of their final Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and Diſobedience, they ſhould be miſerable in proportion to the ſeveral Degrees of their Wickedneſs, for the Terror of others, and to ſupport the Honour of his Laws and Authority in the Government of the World.—This, I ſay, is the only way of thinking I can find any Reaſon for on this Subject.</p>
               <p>Now againſt all this, you only deſired me to read the 9th of <hi>Romans ſeriouſly</hi> and <hi>prayerfully.</hi>—To which I anſwer, I have very often read that Chapter <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> and <hi>prayerfully,</hi> and I will add, <hi>carefully</hi> too; (for we muſt not expect our Prayers to be heard, unleſs we uſe great <hi>Care,</hi> Diligence and Exactneſs, as well as <hi>Seriouſneſs</hi> in the ſearch of Truth)—And after all, I cannot find one Syllable in it relating to the future, eternal Condition of particular Perſons, it being only a Vindication of God's Sovereignty in dealing with whole Nations of Men, and particularly in electing the <hi>Jews</hi> at firſt, and rejecting them now, and calling the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be his peculiar People, to enjoy peculiar Talents and Favours in this World.— And I can't but think a little Attention, without prejudice in favour of preconceived human Schemes, muſt ſatisfy any conſiderate Perſon that this is really the Caſe.—Pray read and conſider carefully what Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> on the <hi>Five Points,</hi> and in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi> in the 15th of his 18 Sermons, publiſhed in his Life-time, have written upon this Chapter, and what he ſays upon all other Texts relating to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his Poſthumous Sermons <note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo a late Eſſay for a New Tranſlation of the Bible.</note>.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> conceited that they alone were, and were forever to continue the peculiar People of God, and that they alone were to enjoy the Benefits of the <hi>Meſiah</hi>'s
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005614_0018_1026B08683666450"/>
Kingdom: They could not therefore brook it to think that their Nation muſt now be rejected and the Gentiles called; this was a great Stumbling-block to them.— Now this is the Difficulty that St. <hi>Paul</hi> is here about to obviate: which he does by ſhewing, 1ſt. That God is meerly ſovereign and arbitrary in the various Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Favours, and in chuſing and rejecting whom he pleaſes with regard to the Privileges of being his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People; and 2dly. That however, he was now very juſt in rejecting them, and leaving them to the hardneſs of their Hearts, as he did <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He argues in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, that they could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably complain, becauſe God is ſovereign and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in chuſing whom he will to be his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:—He was ſo at firſt in chuſing the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to enjoy the great Talent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſiah,</hi> and in rejecting that of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> from that Privilege, tho' they were not deſtitute of a good Talent in enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leſſer Advantage of the Light of Nature; and ſo he was now in rejecting the <hi>Jews</hi> for a Time, and calling the Gentiles to the yet greater and ineſtimable Talent of the Goſpel.—I ſay of theſe Diſpenſations of Providence St. <hi>Paul</hi> is manifeſtly to be underſtood.— For it is evident that thoſe Inſtances he alledges of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Perſons themſelves, (much leſs of their eternal State,) but of the Nations to deſcend from them, as will plainly appear if you look into the Texts in <hi>Geneſis</hi> from whence they are quoted.—Thus, as it was ſaid of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> Gen. 17.20. <hi>Twelve Princes ſhall be begot, and I will make him a great Nation;</hi> ſo of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> it was ſaid to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 25.23. <hi>Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in thy Womb, two manner of People ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from thy Bowels, the one People ſhall be ſtronger
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005614_0019_1026B0B905187180"/>
than the other People, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> which ſays the Apoſtle, was ſaid <hi>that the Purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand.</hi> v. 11, 12. So that this muſt be an Election of People and not of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, for it never was fact in the Perſons themſelves.</p>
               <p>And the next Words, Jacob <hi>have I loved and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> quoted from <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2, 3. are manifeſtly to be underſtood, not of the Perſons, but of the Nations; for the Words are, <hi>I loved</hi> Jacob <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and laid his Mountains and Heritage waſte for the Dragon of the Wilderneſs; whereas</hi> Edom <hi>ſaith, we are impoveriſhed,</hi> &amp;c. all which is evidently ſpoken of the People, and with regard to their Condition in this World.—Where, by the way, neither is God's Hatred of <hi>Eſau</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to imply abſolute Hatred, (for he had a good Bleſſing,) but only a leſs degree of Love; according to a known Figure of Speech in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, whereby that is frequently ſpoken abſolutely which is meant comparatively. In the ſame Senſe, Chriſt ſays, Luk. 14.26. <hi>He that hateth not Father and Mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cannot be my Diſciple:</hi> Where ſurely he cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean abſolute Hatred, but only a leſs degree of Love; and ſo he explains himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. by ſaying, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi>—So that God's hating <hi>Eſau</hi> only means that he loved him, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the People deſcending from him,) leſs than <hi>Jacob, i. e.</hi> the People deſcending from him, and beſtowed leſs Talents and Privileges on the one than on the other.</p>
               <p>It is therefore, only with reſpect to the Beſtowment of certain ſpecial Privileges and Talents in this Life, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> is to be underſtood when he ſays, v. 16. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>It is

not of him that willeth,</hi> [for <hi>Abraham</hi> wiſhed, <hi>O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live,] nor of him that runneth,</hi> [for <hi>Eſau</hi> ran to fetch the Veniſon that he might obtain the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,] <hi>but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> who therefore in the ſovereign Beſtowment of his peculiar Favours, <hi>hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy</hi> and <hi>hath Compaſſion on whom he will have Compaſſion.</hi> For here Juſtice hath nothing to do, and <hi>there can be no Unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> And with reſpect to theſe various arbitrary Diſtributions and Allotments, it may juſtly be anſwered to any one that is tempted to find Fault, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>who art thou, O Man, that replieſt againſt God? Shall the Thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, to make of the ſame Lump, one Veſſel to Honour, and another to Diſhonour?</hi>— Where yet it muſt be obſerved, that Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels made to diſhonourable, <hi>i. e.</hi> to leſs honourable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, have, however, ſome Degree, ſome Intereſt in their Maker's and Owner's Love and Favour.—But all this has nothing to do with the Diſtributions of the Life to come; there Juſtice alone takes Place, which conſiſts in the exact and equitable Rewards and Puniſhments to Men, according to their good or ill Conduct in the Uſe of the ſeveral Talents arbitrarily committed to them in this Life.</p>
               <p>But you will perhaps ſay, Is not the Example of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be underſtood of the Diſtributions of the Life to come?—I anſwer, No.—For St. <hi>Paul</hi> was as well concerned, as I ſaid, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Juſtice of God in rejecting the <hi>Jews,</hi> as his Sovereignty in freely beſtowing his Goſpel Favours upon the Gentiles.— To this Purpoſe, therefore, it is, that he alledges the Example of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he might juſtify God's Dealings in rejecting the <hi>Jews,</hi> and juſtly hardening their Hearts, <hi>i. e.</hi> leaving them to the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

of their Hearts in rejecting Chriſt, as he had juſtly hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> left him to the hardneſs of his Heart, in reſiſting the Force of the Miracles he had wrought for his Conviction, and to ſhew that God might juſtly make the <hi>Jews</hi> Monuments of his Wrath in cutting them off from being a People, for their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rejecting of Chriſt, as he had made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his Wrath in the Eyes of the World, for his Obſtinacy in hardening his Heart againſt the Means uſed for his Conviction.—</p>
               <p>I interpret God's hardening <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart, not of any actual Efficiency of his, (for this ſeems needleſs in it ſelf, as well as inconſiſtent with his Attributes,) but, either of God's doing that, (<hi>e. g.</hi> his removing the Plagues,) from whence he took Occaſion to harden his Heart; or his leaving him to the hardneſs of his Heart.—In this Senſe it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. God moved <hi>David</hi> to number <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which, in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. is called <hi>Satan</hi>'s provoking him to number them. That Expreſſion therefore can only mean God's leaving or permitting <hi>Satan</hi> to tempt him; and this in the ſame Senſe as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Priſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.22. That <hi>whatſoever they did there, he was the doer of it.</hi> Not that he actually did it; but that it was done with his Permiſſion, and under his Eye and Superintendecy.—</p>
               <p>And that Expreſſion, v. 17. <hi>For this Cauſe have I raiſed thee up,</hi> &amp;c. does not mean, <hi>for this Cauſe have I given thee Being;</hi> but for this Cauſe have <hi>I made thee to ſtand,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word imports, <hi>i. e. for this Cauſe</hi> have I ſupported or ſubſiſted thee, and prolonged thy Life through one Plague after another, that I might, for thy Obſtinacy and Perverſeneſs, make thee an illuſtrious Example of my Vengeance <hi>to all the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>laſtly, Whom he will he hardneth,</hi> v. 18. does not mean of all that he hath given Being to, whem he will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005614_0022_1026B08DFB3BBA10"/>
he hardens in their Sins, that he may render them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable; but, of thoſe who for their perſonal Diſobedience, Obſtinacy and Impenitency, deſerve to be finally abandoned, <hi>whom he will</hi> he leaves to the hardneſs of their Hearts, and makes uſe of them as Monuments of his Wrath for the Terror of others as he did <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and was now determined to leave the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and Wickedneſs, in rejecting and crucifying Chriſt.—Thus I am obliged to interpret the 9th of <hi>Romans:</hi>—And that this is the only right Interpretation, is further evident from the Texts in <hi>Hoſea</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which the Apoſtle quotes in Confirmation of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment v. 25, 27, 29. and from the Concluſion of the whole v. 30. and 31. From whence it is manifeſt, that the Queſtion is wholly between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> as a People in this preſent State, and conſequently, that his whole Diſcourſe has nothing to do with any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Decrees of God, with regard to the perſonal and eternal Condition of Men.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid upon this Text may be applied to the Solution of whatever Difficulties may ſeem to ariſe from other Texts; ſuch as that Expreſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. of God's <hi>chuſing them in Chriſt before the Foundation of the World:</hi>—The meaning of which muſt be this:— That whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> had been wont to conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the only peculiar People, to enjoy the Benefit of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> he would have them to know that they might not arrogate that Privilege to themſelves alone, but that God had choſen or deſigned the Gentiles as well as them to enjoy the Bleſſings of the Meſſiah's Kingdom; and that even <hi>before the Foundation of the World,</hi> that they might be holy or ſanctified to God in him, to lead holy and vertuous Lives here, and ſo be happy forever hereafter.—For it may be truly ſaid of all baptized Chriſtians, (being by that Ordinance taken
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005614_0023_1026B0BF629D7EF8"/>
out of the <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> and grafted into the Body of Chriſt, the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and ſo taken into <hi>the Family and Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God,</hi>) that they are <hi>predeſtinated to the Adoption of Children,</hi> v. 5. and that they <hi>are choſen in Chriſt,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ineſtimable Talent of the Goſpel, that by that heavenly Diſpenſation they might learn to be <hi>holy in all Manner of Converſation.</hi>—And accordingly all that are baptized, and ſo <hi>born of Water and the Spirit,</hi> being <hi>ſaved by the Waſhing of Regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (Joh. 3.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.) are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as belonging to the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> tho' they are at preſent in a State of Probation. But their final and everlaſting Poſſeſſion of the heavenly Inheritance provided for them, depends upon their final perſeverance in Obedience, for if, after all, <hi>they draw back,</hi> God's <hi>Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in them.</hi> Heb. 10.38.</p>
               <p>It may be added here, that the Word <hi>Choſen,</hi> when ſet in Contradiſtinction to thoſe that are called, (as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few choſen,</hi>) ſignifies thoſe that are <hi>approved</hi> good Men, who comply with the Call of the Goſpel.—So that the Senſe of thoſe Words, is, that, tho' there were many that, at that Time, were <hi>called</hi> to the Knowledge of the Goſpel, yet there were comparatively but <hi>few</hi> that did comply with the Call, ſo as, in Heart and Life to conform to it, and thereby become ſuch as God approves of and delights in.—And the obſtinately unbelieving and diſobedient are called <hi>Reprobate,</hi> as being <hi>diſapproved</hi> and rejected of God, for their Diſobedience and obſtinate perſiſting in their Rebellion and Impenitency.—For other Texts ſee <hi>Whithy, Clarke</hi> and <hi>Clagget, and the Eſſay above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a ſhort Sketch of my Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thinking upon this Subject, whereof this is the Sum, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Diſtribution of Talents and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005614_0024_1026B090DB6EA4E0"/>
in this State of Probation, the Sovereignty of God as a Benefactor does truly take Place; but in the future Diſtributions of Rewards and Puniſhments, abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty is intirely out of the Queſtion.—As a Judge deciding the eternal Condition of Men, God never once repreſents himſelf as arbitrary, but every where, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding according to Equity, <hi>without reſpect of Perſons;</hi> not treating Men according to any abſolute Diſpoſition he hath already made, but in exact proportion to their own Conduct in the uſe of the Talents committed to their Truſt.</p>
               <p>And I would wiſh it to be ſeriouſly conſidered, that it was the <hi>wicked Servant, (Mat.</hi> 25.24. compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.22.) who repreſented his Lord, (as many have lately done among us in theſe Times,) as <hi>reaping where he never ſowed, and gathering where he had not ſtrowed,</hi> i. e. (like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> requiring <hi>Brick without Straw,</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of his Creatures Things as impoſſible for them to do, as it is to create a World, and damning them to all Eternity for not performing them.—Let it alſo be remembered, that in the Parable of the Labourers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. where God is repreſented as making that Anſwer, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own?</hi> which you built ſo much upon, he does not mean to vindicate his Conduct as a Judge, as tho' in that Capacity he might arbitrarily reward or not reward as He pleaſed, (for he did exactly reward according to Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,) but as a Benefactor at firſt, in granting the Favour and making the Stipulation upon what Terms he thought fit, in which he is confeſſedly arbitrary.—</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the 25th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and all ſuch Texts of Scripture as repreſent God as a Judge rewarding and puniſhing, have not, as far as I can ſee, any Place at all in your Syſtem of Divinity.—But in truth, I cannot think of a greater Diſhonour that can be done to Almighty
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005614_0025_1026B0C227903068"/>
God, than to repreſent him as arbitrary conſidered as a Governour and a Judge, when he has taken abundant Care throughout the whole Scripture, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the End of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to repreſent himſelf, not as an arbitrary, but as a moral Governour of the World; proceeding upon Stipulations with his Reaſonable Creatures;—treating them, not as <hi>Machines</hi> or Stocks and Stones, but as Rational and Moral Agents, ſuch as he hath made them; beſtowing Means and Aſſiſtances, and uſing Arguments, Motives and Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with them, ſuch as Promiſes, Threatnings, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the like; and rewarding or puniſhing them according as they ſhall be found to have conducted themſelves.—Such is the Notion or Conception that I am obliged to entertain of Almighty God, and with which every Thing in the Scriptures, I think, is clearly conſiſtent.</p>
               <p>But now in Conſequence of that ſtrange, unnatural and unſcriptural Notion of the Almighty, which your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſeems to imply, you appear to me, in effect, to fly in the Face of the whole Scriptures, by denying the Being of any Promiſes at all, as being inconſiſtent with the Divine Sovereignty.—I confeſs, you, and thoſe on your Side, are herein conſiſtent enough with your ſelves; for ſuppoſing a meer ſovereign abſolute and arbitrary Deciſion of the eternal Fate of Mankind, antecedent to, or without any Conſideration of their perſonal Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, it is plain that all Stipulations, Promiſes, Threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but a meer Farce, and can have no ſerious Meaning in them.—But then do but conſider what you are doing; for if you deny the Being of any Promiſes conſiſtent with the Sovereignty of God, you do in Effect, deſtroy the very Being of the New Covenant, and, by Conſequence, the whole Deſign and Purport of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion; which is likewiſe the ſad Havock that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005614_0026_1026B09272987038"/>
Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has made of Chriſtianity, in his Piece againſt <hi>the whole Duty of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> I confeſs, is a heavy Charge, and nothing grieves me more than that a Gentleman of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Station has given the Occaſion.—Indeed you was then only undertaking to prove that there are <hi>no Promiſes in Scripture to the Unregenerate,</hi> [meaning by the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> thoſe, (whether baptized or not,) who are under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin.]—But pray how did you prove it?—Why, by this Argument, (they were your own Words,) That <hi>if God had bound himſelf by his Promiſe to</hi> any <hi>of his Creatures, [i. e.</hi> good or bad,] <hi>he is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or withold the promiſed Bleſſing as may pleaſe him.</hi>—Now ſurely if this Argument proves any thing, it proves that no Promiſe at all, to good or bad, is conſiſtent with the Divine Sovereignty; and then where is there any Place for any <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or indeed <hi>Old</hi> either?—And if the Caſe be ſo, away with the Bible ſure enough!—It is indeed a <hi>ſeal'd Book,</hi> a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and an <hi>old Almanack,</hi> as ſome People have of late preſumed to call it.— In ſhort, if the Caſe be thus, it can be nothing better than a meer Impoſture, and muſt be utterly a ſenſleſs and unmeaning Thing.—Which, by the Way, is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Doctrine, That <hi>no Words,</hi> (and conſequently, not the Scriptures,) <hi>can teach what it is to be a true Chriſtian, any more than what it is to ſee, or what Light and Colours are to a Man born blind.</hi>—See <hi>London Magazine,</hi> for 1739.</p>
               <p>But I will appeal to any Man of Common Senſe, that reads the Bible carefully, whether it be not full of many <hi>exceeding great and precious Promiſes,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them? 2.1.4. and whether it be not manifeſtly the Deſign and Tendency of the whole Scripture, from the Beginning to the End, to inculcate theſe two Points? <hi>viz.</hi>

1ſt. <hi>To put Mankind upon the moſt vigorous Activity in ſeeking and purſuing their everlaſting Happineſs;</hi> and 2dly. <hi>To aſcertain Succeſs to them in ſo doing.</hi>—Is it not one of the firſt Things you read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> after the Fall (4.7.) <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> And the laſt in <hi>Revelations,</hi> (22.14.) <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have a</hi> RIGHT <hi>to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gate into the City;</hi> and <hi>whoſoever will let him come and take of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life freely.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me aſk you,—are there Promiſes, or are there not?—If you ſay there are not, as your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems plainly to import, I muſt think we are laid under a Neceſſity of being deceived; for ſurely no Words can expreſs Promiſes, if thoſe of the Scripture do not; they are certainly expreſſed juſt as they would be if God had deſigned we ſhould underſtand them ſo.—If you allow there are Promiſes, pray where is the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in ſuppoſing, nay, what elſe can be made of them, but that God deſigned to paſs over a <hi>Right,</hi> at leaſt a conditional Right to his Creatures, of what he promiſes them?— I own the Matter of the Promiſes is Matter of meer ſovereign free Grace: Nay, it is Matter of meer ſovereign Grace that God has in his bleſſed Son given us any Promiſes at all:—But ſurely notwithſtanding this, when he has been graciouſly pleaſed to grant us theſe <hi>precious Promiſes,</hi> it muſt have been his Deſign to paſs over a <hi>Right</hi> to us of the Bleſſings promiſed; to which we could have had no <hi>Right</hi> but upon the Score of his meer Grace in Chriſt.—Which <hi>Right</hi> therefore he has granted us, (I allow,) not to plead in the Virtue of any thing we can do, but meerly in the Virtue of what Chriſt hath done for us, <hi>in whom</hi> alone it is that <hi>all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen.</hi> 2 Cor, 1.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005614_0028_1026B0955D70D1C8"/>In his <hi>Right</hi> therefore we muſt plead, who has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed this Benefit for us, and not in the Virtue or Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit of any thing we do, which we can only humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as meer Qualifications neceſſary to render us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving what God in Chriſt hath freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.—So that what we do muſt be conſidered, not in the <hi>aſſuming</hi> and <hi>challenging</hi> way that you repreſented in order to ridicule our Doctrine, and as all that was, in every Inſtance poſſible to be done, but as what, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the merciful Terms of the New Covenant, God is graciouſly pleaſed in Chriſt to expect from ſuch frail and imperfect Creatures as we are, with all our Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Infirmities about us.—It was therefore very unjuſt for you to put Things in ſuch a ridiculous Light as you did, to talk of <hi>owing, claiming, challenging,</hi> &amp;c.— Nobody ever dreamt of uſing ſuch Language to God, which could not become an Angel, much leſs a fallen ſinful Creature, when the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promiſes is Matter of free Grace.—Conſider Things in this Light, and then what Senſe is there in your <hi>Categoric Syllogiſm,</hi> and all your other Reaſonings on this Subject?</p>
               <p>But ſtill you inſiſt upon it that there is <hi>no Promiſe to the unregenerate.</hi>—Now as to this, I grant there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing promiſed to the obſtinate Sinner, perſiſting wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unrelentingly in his Sin and Rebellion, that <hi>hates to be reformed, and caſts God's Words behind his Back.</hi>— But tho' there is nothing promiſed to him, continuing in that Condition, yet it does by no means follow but that the Promiſe is made to him upon Condition of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and returning to his Duty for the Time to come.—Yea, but you will ſay, he can't repent and turn to God.—I allow he cannot truly repent of himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's Help.— But then what I inſiſt upon, is. That God has promiſed to hear and help him by his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005614_0029_1026B0C747118260"/>
bleſſed Spirit, if he earneſtly prays and ſtrives in ſuch a Manner as may be expected from ſuch a frail Creature as he is. Tell me, is there no <hi>Medium</hi> between an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate relentleſs Sinner, and one that is throughly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, in your Senſe of the Word, <hi>i. e,</hi> that has gained the Maſtery of his Luſts, and is univerſally in Heart and Life devoted to God in Jeſus Chriſt?—May not one who is not yet thus intirely devoted to God, be brought by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Common Grace,</hi> (abſolutely given in Chriſt to all,) to be ſerious and really ſolicitous for Salvation, ſo as being deeply ſenſible of his own Guilt and Weakneſs, earneſtly to cry to God for Help, and to ſtrive in earneſt that he may be qualified for God's Help?—To me it is plain this may be the Caſe of one not yet throughly converted from Sin to God.</p>
               <p>Now this is the Man to whom I ſay the Promiſes of divine efficacious Aid or <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> do belong: This is <hi>he who hath, to whom ſhall be given,</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Senſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25, 29 —And I am under an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Neceſſity of underſtanding <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7, 11, 28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as belonging to ſuch as he.—Can any one be ſo abſurd as to interpret theſe Promiſes thus?—You that have already received the ſpecial Grace of God, <hi>aſk and ye ſhall receive:</hi>—You who have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found Mercy, <hi>ſeek and ye ſhall find:</hi>—You to whom the Gate of Mercy is already opened, and are already got within it, <hi>knock and it ſhall be opened;</hi>—You who have already got Reſt, <hi>come to me and I will give you Reſt,</hi> &amp;c.— Is not this making perfect Nonſenſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes of God?—To me it ſeems nothing can be more ſo:— And yet this muſt be your own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, if you deny their being made even to the unregenerate, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſuch as, being deeply ſenſible of their Guilt and Pollution, and utter Inability to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are ſo ſeriouſly concerned <hi>to become renewed in the

Spirit of their Minds,</hi> as to <hi>aſk, ſeek, knock</hi> and <hi>ſtrive</hi> that they may obtain the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>For God's ſake, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> let us take Care that we do not, from a violent Attachment to any preconceived hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Schemes, pervert the plaineſt and moſt obvious Declarations and Promiſes of the Goſpel.—To me it is manifeſt, that this is what thoſe on your Side really do; and that your whole Syſtem, where it is peculiar, is not founded on the Holy Scripture, (taken in the whole, and critically read and conſidered,) but on the empty Cob-webs of <hi>Scholaſtical Metaphyſics, (vain Philoſophy, Science falſly ſo called,)</hi> together with ſome few obſcure Texts, not rightly underſtood, for want of a critical Skill in the ancient Languages, and the Notions and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of thoſe Times, and for want of an exact At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Scope and Argument of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: In conſequence of which you manifeſtly torture the plaineſt Texts, to make them ſpeak your Senſe, and ſo corrupt the plainneſs and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and in effect make it a meer unintelligible Riddle.—</p>
               <p>For my part, I cannot for my Life help interpreting thoſe and the like Promiſes in this plain, eaſy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Manner:— You that have not yet received the Grace of God for the thorough Renovation of your Souls, <hi>aſk and ye ſhall receive:</hi>—You that have not yet found Mercy, <hi>ſeek and ye ſhall find:</hi>—You to whom the Gate of Mercy is not yet opened, <hi>knock and it ſhall be opened:</hi>—You who are <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> under a deep and pungent Senſe of the Power and Guilt of Sin, and can find no Reſt, (as none can be had any other way,) <hi>Come to me and I will give you reſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>Take my Yoke upon you,</hi> [my Doctrines to believe, and my Laws to obey,] and <hi>learn of me,</hi> [follow my Example] and <hi>ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls.</hi>—And laſtly, you who are deeply ſenſible of your Weakneſs and great

Need of the Help of God's holy Spirit, aſk, for <hi>he will give his holy Spirit to them that aſk him;</hi> i. e. to them that <hi>ſtrive</hi> as well as ſeek, and <hi>watch</hi> as well as <hi>pray.</hi>— Thus, I ſay, I am neceſſitated to underſtand theſe <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes,</hi> and in faithfulneſs to our great Lord and Maſter, and to the Souls <hi>which he hath made</hi> and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am obliged thus plainly to interpret and inculcate them—</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral other Paſſages in your Diſcourſe that appeared to me very exceptionable; but I have done, and will only conclude with my earneſt Prayer to God, That he will <hi>open our Eyes, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the wondrous Things of his Law;</hi> That <hi>what we ſee not he would teach us,</hi> and lead us into all neceſſary Truth and Duty!—And let us earneſtly beg that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may differ in our Speculations in ſome Points, we may not ſuffer any thing to tempt us to a Spirit of Alienation and Uncharitableneſs; but that unitedly <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Things that make for Peace</hi> and <hi>true Holineſs here,</hi> we may at length meet together in that bleſſed World where <hi>Peace and Holineſs</hi> ſhall be conſummated in unſpeakable and everlaſting Happineſs!—According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I remain, <hi>Sir,</hi>

               <p>I might remark upon ſeveral Paſſages in your Letter; but there is one I cannot be content to paſs by, and that is, your Expreſſion of <hi>being ſanctified in the Womb,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſuppoſe you allude to the like Expreſſion in <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. which you ſeem to underſtand of the real inherent Sanctification of the Spirit; whereas it is manifeſt, that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005614_0033_1026B0CF2E812AA8"/>
God is not there ſpeaking of <hi>real,</hi> but only of <hi>relative</hi> Sanctification, and that all he means, is, that he had in his holy Purpoſe ſet him apart, devoted or conſecrated him to that ſacred Office of a Prophet, to which he was now calling him.</p>
               <p>Another Miſtake you labour under, is in apprehending that I aim at <hi>undermining</hi> ſome of the <hi>Soul-humbling Doctrines of the Goſpel.</hi>—To which I anſwer, No, <hi>Sir,</hi> God forbid!—I firmly believe it to be the great Deſign of the Goſpel to humble the Souls of Men, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their perverſe Wills, and reduce them to an intire Union with the Will of God, to ſubmit to all his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Appointments, and to take him in his own Way, and be content to be ſaved upon his Terms.—This is plain from the whole Run of my Letter, and intirely conſiſtent with it.—I muſt therefore beg leave to ſuſpect that you did not read it with ſufficient Candor and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which I would yet wiſh you to do, rather than to perſiſt in ſo hard an Opinion of me, for which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſenſible I have given you any juſt Occaſion.</p>
               <p>But if you cannot think me altogether right in my Notion of the Sovereignty and Promiſes of God, I beg you will not conſider me as an Oppoſer of the Word of God, (as your Letter ſeems to imply;) for I am ſure I oppoſe nothing, but rejoice in every thing, that, (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Inſtructions of the Goſpel,) can tend to the everlaſting Happineſs of the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>And if after all our well-meant Inquiries, we cannot attain to think alike here in this dark and infirm State, let us however put the beſt Conſtruction we can on each other's Conduct, and, as I ſaid, hope at length to meet together in that happy State before us, where all Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Prejudice ſhall be forever done away, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God and Truth and Love ſhall forever reign!—</p>
