            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>NEHEMIAH,</hi> the author of this book, was a great officer in the court of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> king, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we now ſpeak, <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> (being his Cup-bearer). Which honorable and profitable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, it ſeems, tempted him to tarry behind, when
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013758_0004_0F91AAE851E4DF20"/>
his brethren return'd from captivity, about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years before, under <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> in order to rebuild the temple and city; which had now, according to the prophecy, lain waſte ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years.</p>
            <p>But when he found, by an account given him by ſome of his brethren who had return'd from Judea, the yet deſolate condition of his ancient city and country, being a good man and a true <hi>patriot,</hi> he was greatly affected, and paſs'd ſeveral days in <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>tears</hi> and doleful <hi>retirement:</hi> And then addreſs'd himſelf to God in the moſt <hi>humble prayer</hi> and <hi>ſupplication</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of which is thus given by a learned paraphraſt.</p>
            <p>"Lord of heaven and governor of all things! who art infinitely juſt and tremendous in thy judgments upon the diſobedient; and faithful to all thy promiſes to thy dutiful ſervants: Lend a gracious car to the cries of a diſtreſs'd Iſraelite, humbly confeſſing his own and his father's ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and lamenting the calamities of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thine own choſen people.</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice that they have thus long felt and ſmarted under the heavy ſtrokes of thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous diſpleaſure, and, with all contrition beg again to be reſtor'd to thy wonted favor and protection.</p>
            <p>Remember how thy earlieſt ſure threats of puniſhing their wickedneſs with the loſs of their dear country, were ſtill accompanied with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013758_0005_0F91AAE8A8FB8808"/>
promiſe, that their repentance ſhould at laſt retrieve it again; and cauſe them ſtill to be own'd by thee for thine <hi>inheritance;</hi> for whoſe ſakes thou haſt done ſuch marvellous things in the ſight of all nations.</p>
            <p>Have mercy upon the multitude of the guilty, for the ſake of thoſe who are truly penitent, and ſincerely deſire thy true honour and worſhip.</p>
            <p>Make me the inſtrument of procuring their ſafety and taking away their reproach, by bleſſing the endeavours I am now going to uſe with the Perſian Emperor in their favour."</p>
            <p>Here was a <hi>true patriot</hi> indeed! Here was a man who ſought the good of his country! and ſought it from principle, and in the right way!</p>
            <p>Firſt he <hi>mourn'd</hi> for their diſtreſs; then he <hi>faſted</hi> and <hi>pray'd,</hi> and beſought the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>direct</hi> and proſper him: And then he <hi>uſed</hi> the moſt likely <hi>means</hi> he could think of to procure their relief; which was by uſing his intereſt with the <hi>Emperor</hi> to get a commiſſion to go himſelf and help them.</p>
            <p>And God proſper'd him—He went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd them in a moſt wonderful manner!</p>
            <p>O how happy for us if we had ſuch a friend in the Britiſh Court, who had ſuch influence with the King in this evil day! What great things might he, under God, do for us! But alas tho' we have, like the diſtreſs'd Jews, many enemies, yet we have no ſuch <hi>powerful friend</hi> to exert himſelf in our favour!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013758_0006_0F91AAEACD6B3228"/>
This <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> man now dwelt in <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> (ſaid to have been the pleaſanteſt city then in the world,) he dwelt in the king's preſence and was his <hi>favourite;</hi> and had great <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honor:</hi> yet he felt for the afflictions of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and choſe rather to go and ſuffer with them, that he might promote their welfare, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the pleaſures of that ſplendid court.</p>
            <p>Who can ſufficiently admire his excellent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and his excellent conduct amidſt his country's diſtreſſes!</p>
            <p>He came and encouraged the Jews, and ſet about repairing the city, and finiſhed it, though he was <hi>derided</hi> and <hi>counteracted</hi> and plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt continually; and though they were called <hi>rebels</hi> by many <hi>powerful enemies</hi> in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and even by a number of the NOBLES OF JUDAH, who join'd with their heathen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries againſt him.</p>
            <p>After this, though they were in their own land, dwelt again in their <hi>city</hi> Jeruſalem, and had the worſhip of the temple reſtor'd, yet they were in a <hi>poor, weak</hi> and <hi>diſtreſs'd</hi> condition to what they were before their late troubles.</p>
            <p>And therefore we read, in the beginning of this Chapter—<hi>That, in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Iſrael were aſſembled with faſting and with ſackcloths, and with earth upon them. And the ſeed of Iſrael ſeparated themſelves from all ſtrangers, and ſtood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their ſins and the iniquities of their fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013758_0007_0F91AAECC1248AA0"/>
Then they recounted the many ſignal favors to them and to their fathers, and the ill returns they had made: and then pray that God will put an end to their grievous troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Howbeit</hi> (ſay they) thou art juſt in <hi>all that is brought upon us; for thou haſt done right, but we</hi> have done <hi>wickedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the prayer concludes in the words of my text, wherein they recount their <hi>calamities,</hi> and promiſe to renew their <hi>covenant</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold we are ſervants this day; and for the land which thou gaveſt unto our fathers, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof; behold we are ſervants in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it yieldeth much increaſe unto the kings which thou haſt ſet over us, becauſe of our ſins. Alſo they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleaſure; and we are in great diſtreſs! That is,</hi> though we are, through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, in our own land; yet we are but <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>tributaries.</hi> We are not allow'd to call the country our own: The Lord, indeed, gave the good land to our fathers to improve and enjoy all the bleſſings of it: But now thoſe whom the Perſian Emperor hath placed over us—(whether by right or not) are our <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Maſters:</hi> And we hold all our bleſſings, even our <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> but as tenants at <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It yieldeth much increaſe (for it is a good land) unto the Kings, which for our Sins. God
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013758_0008_0F91AAEDD0F90C08"/>
ſuffers to lord it over us. But we can call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing our own: For, they claim abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Cattle</hi> and all that we have, to call for it and diſpoſe of it at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: So that in a word, <hi>we are in great diſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And, becauſe of all this, we make a ſure cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and write it; and our Princes, Levites and Prieſts ſeal unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That is,</hi> (as one expreſſes the ſenſe) "and though even what we now enjoy be much more than we deſerve; yet do thou ſtill caſt an eye of further pity upon the miſery of our condition, accept our preſent repentance, and that ſolemn engagement we now, all of us lay ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be obedient for the future, to thy holy commands."</p>
            <p>Upon theſe words, thus introduced, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhall make the following obſervations, <abbr>

               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>I. <hi>That ſome people may juſtly call the land they live in, their own, by a divine gift to their fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>That yet, ſuch is the tyranny and oppreſſion of the kings of the earth, that, where there is the cleareſt title, the owners are ſometimes deprived of it, or of the bleſſings of it, which is the ſame thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>That it is for a people's ſins, when God ſuffers this to come upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>That though a people are ſuffered to live in their own Land, and it be ever ſo good in itſelf, yet if they hold all their bleſſings only at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of others, and can call nothing their own, they are, ſtrictly ſpeaking, ſervants, and not freemen: and muſt be in great diſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:013758_0009_0F91AAEDF1790A00"/>
V. <hi>That it becomes ſuch a people to fly unto God by ſolemn faſting and prayer, for relief, even after they have done all they can for their own preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. <hi>If they would, on good grounds, hope for ſucceſs, they ſhould renew their covenant with God, or lay themſelves under the moſt ſolemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to be an obedient and holy people, for the time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. <hi>Then I obſerve—That ſome People may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the Land they live in, their own, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine gift to their fathers.</hi>

            <p>So Iſrael, in this prayer, call'd the land of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,—<hi>the land which thou gaveſt unto our fathers:</hi> And which therefore they implicitly call <hi>their own</hi> by inheritance from them.</p>
            <p>And ſure there was no room to diſpute their title, if God, the great Proprietor of the world had a right to diſpoſe of it: For he gave it to Iſrael for a poſſeſſion, as the ſcriptures abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtify; ſo that I need not ſtand to quote particular paſſages.</p>
            <p>This land therefore was indubitably <hi>their's;</hi> ſo <hi>their's,</hi> that no body under Heaven had a right to deprive them of it, nor could do it without wrong and injuſtice; for it was <hi>their's</hi> (as I may ſay) by <hi>deed of gift</hi> from <hi>the great Lord of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were they the only people in the world who could challenge a juſt right and title, yea a divine one, to the country they poſſeſs'd. For God originally gave the whole Earth to the ſons
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013758_0010_0F91AAEEBB479150"/>
of men to be <hi>divided</hi> among them. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any went and found any part of the Earth <hi>unpoſſeſſed,</hi> or <hi>fairly purchaſed</hi> of the <hi>rightful poſſeſſors,</hi> they alſo might juſtly call it <hi>their own land,</hi> their proper inheritance, given them by God; though not ſo expreſsly given as Canaan was to Iſrael. Nor will, or can this be denied by any who pretend to have any <hi>juſt poſſeſſions</hi> on Earth: ſo that I need not enlarge. But may proceed to obſerve—</p>
            <p>II. <hi>That yet, ſuch is the oppreſſion and tyranny of the Kings of the earth, that, where there is the cleareſt title, the owners are ſometimes depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it, or of the bleſſings of it; which is the ſame thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it was in the caſe before us. The <hi>King of Aſſyria</hi> came up againſt Iſrael, only from a luſt of <hi>power,</hi> and to ſpread his dominions; came up againſt Iſrael and diſquieted them in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the poſſeſſions which God had given them; yea deſtroyed their city and country, to which he had no pretence of right (unleſs it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>anceſtor</hi> of this nation anciently emigrated from <hi>Chaldea</hi> a part of his empire, which was too abſurd to mention) yet he came and carried them away captive; and <hi>ſeventy years</hi> detained them in his own land; and grievouſly afflicted them.</p>
            <p>But at length the Lord had compaſſion on his people, and ſtirred up <hi>Cyrus</hi> and afterwards other Kings to give them leave to return to their own
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013758_0011_0F91AAEF79B96F70"/>
land, and rebuild their <hi>city</hi> and <hi>temple</hi> in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous times.</p>
            <p>But yet even then they held them under tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and challenged the diſpoſal of them and of all they had, at their pleaſure; becauſe they had <hi>power</hi> ſo to do, though no pretence of <hi>right</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>For, if <hi>mere conqueſt</hi> gives right, then <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> muſt be the ſame thing: and ſo every <hi>man</hi> as well as a <hi>King</hi> muſt have a <hi>right</hi> to do whatever he has <hi>power</hi> to do. And then there could be no ſuch thing as <hi>oppreſſion</hi> in the world: which is moſt abſurd and impious to aſſert!</p>
            <p>And yet this has been (I may almoſt ſay the manner of the King's of the earth,) though they dare not avow the principle, yet they have acted as if they thought they had a <hi>right</hi> to do whatever they had <hi>power</hi> to do; without paying any regard to <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong.</hi> Where they were able to overcome their neighbours, and took a fancy to their poſſeſſions, they have made it their practice, time out of mind, to go and ſeize, by force, them and their land: ſometimes carrying them away <hi>captive;</hi> and at other times ſuffering them to live in their own land, as <hi>tenants at will</hi> under <hi>tribute:</hi> and ſometimes under ſuch cruel oppreſſion as to deprive them of all the bleſſings of a good and fruitful land. This is too plain and melancholy a truth to dwell upon.</p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to obſerve—</p>
            <p>III. <hi>That it is for a people's ſins when God ſuffers this evil to come upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:013758_0012_0F91AAF172437650"/>
So Iſrael acknowledged in the text, and thro' this whole prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It yieldeth</hi> (ſay they) <hi>much increaſe to the Kings which thou hath ſet over us,</hi> BECAUSE OF OUR SINS.</p>
            <p>And whoever conſiders the nature of God, and the righteouſneſs and kindneſs of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ſure that this is always the caſe: For, he doth not <hi>afflict willingly,</hi> nor needleſsly <hi>grieve</hi> the children of men. He cannot delight in tyranny and oppreſſion! No, his Soul abhors it; and though he ſometimes <hi>ſuffers</hi> it to puniſh an <hi>ungrateful</hi> people, who would not be drawn by the cords of a man and the bands of love; yet we ſee in the ſacred hiſtory, that after he had puniſh'd his people by ſome <hi>haughty tyrants,</hi> he took his time to puniſh them alſo for their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. And never do we find a people forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God who had not forſaken him firſt.</p>
            <p>And though we are ſtumbled at the ways of God, when we ſee the world groaning for ſo many ages under the crueleſt <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;</hi> yet I doubt not, could we ſee through the reaſons of it, we ſhould be ſatisfied with the divine proceedings. We ſhould ſee that they were firſt given up to ſuch <hi>ignorance</hi> or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> that it was neceſſary to curb them in this <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi> way.</p>
            <p>And when they are ſuitably humbled and brought to repentance, he delights in granting them deliverance, and never fails of doing it. The
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013758_0013_0F91AAF1B22A4900"/>
               <hi>Scripture hiſtory,</hi> and indeed <hi>all hiſtory,</hi> is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant witneſs of this: And thereto I appeal.</p>
            <p>And proceed—</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>To obſerve, that though a people are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live in their own land, and it be ever ſo good in itſelf,</hi> yet, <hi>if they hold all their bleſſings, only at the pleaſure of others, and can call nothing their own, they are ſtrictly ſpeaking,</hi> SERVANTS <hi>and not freemen: and muſt be in great diſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the very caſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the time of this <hi>Faſt.</hi> They were reſtor'd to their own land: But they were not allowed to call it <hi>their own.</hi> The <hi>Perſian Emperor</hi> had an abſolute power over them, and all that they had; ſo that they held all by the moſt precarious tenure—his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure.</hi> He claimed their <hi>Cattle,</hi> their <hi>Silver,</hi> their <hi>Gold,</hi> their <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Lands,</hi> and even their <hi>Perſons,</hi> and called for them and diſpoſed of them at his <hi>pleaſure.</hi> And therefore ſay they—<hi>Behold, we are Servants this day!</hi> And again—<hi>We are Servants in it!</hi>—that is in <hi>our own Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſure it was ſo. They were not <hi>Freemen,</hi> but perfect <hi>Servants,</hi> if a foreign power had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them and their ſubſtance. Such perſons really have no <hi>property</hi> at all. For how can we call that <hi>ours,</hi> which others may call for, and take away, when they pleaſe. Every <hi>Slave</hi> in the world may call himſelf a <hi>freeman</hi> as well as theſe: And moſt of them with greater propriety. For moſt of them are allow'd ſomething which they may call <hi>their's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013758_0014_0F91AAF269E38E78"/>
And they who cannot call any thing their own; let them live in a land like Canaan, it is almoſt nothing to them.</p>
            <p>It may <hi>yield much fruit,</hi> but if all beſides a bare ſubſiſtance, juſt to keep them fit for ſervice, muſt go to their maſters, they may be in <hi>great diſtreſs,</hi> in the midſt of the jollity of their taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters; and pine away, as many poor ſouls do, amidſt floods of <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>honey, wine</hi> and <hi>oyl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whoever looks over the world, will find, that where ſuch an <hi>abſolute</hi> dominion is claim'd over the people, they are almoſt univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to every kind of <hi>diſtreſs.</hi> The world which is now groaning under bondage is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy witneſs of this.</p>
            <p>Could you but look into the dark places of the earth, and ſee the habitations of cruelty, and hear the <hi>cries</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> of the <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> who have no <hi>comforter,</hi> becauſe on <hi>the ſide of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors there is power;</hi> it would make every tender heart ake and ready to burſt with grief! But I muſt forbear. And ſhall only add—That to hold our <hi>houſes,</hi> our <hi>lands,</hi> our <hi>cattle</hi> and <hi>goods,</hi> and all the <hi>comforts</hi> of life, and even <hi>life it ſelf,</hi> by ſo <hi>precarious a tenure</hi> as that of the abſolute <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> of <hi>unfeeling lawleſs maſters,</hi> ſo that we may be ſtrip'd of them all in a moment when they are out of <hi>temper,</hi> or even for every ſlight fault, is itſelf a <hi>great diſtreſs,</hi> and muſt <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter</hi> every <hi>comfort</hi> of life, and almoſt make <hi>life</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:013758_0015_0F91AAF36B002DC0"/>
itſelf a burden; eſpecially to thoſe who were <hi>born free,</hi> and were never in bondage to any man.</p>
            <p>And yet this is the beſt any can hope for, who are once depriv'd of <hi>liberty,</hi> or of the priviledges of freemen. I proceed to obſerve.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>That it becomes a people in ſuch a diſtreſs'd condition to fly unto God by ſolemn faſting and prayer for relief, even after they have done all they can for their own preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So did Iſrael here. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> like a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> man, did not ſit ſtill and preſume upon <hi>providence;</hi> but encourag'd the Jews to ariſe and build the wall of their city, and make it as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible as poſſible againſt the enemy; and gave orders to uſe all caution, ſo as not to give their enemies any advantage, by <hi>ſhutting</hi> and <hi>barring</hi> the <hi>gates</hi> in ſeaſon every night, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But, like a pious man, ſenſible that all ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the Lord, he counſel'd them not to depend upon their own <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>ſtrength;</hi> but to commit their cauſe to God. And therefore call'd a ſolemn faſt to humble themſelves before God, and to ſeek his face.</p>
            <p>And they aſſembled for this end, and <hi>mourned</hi> before him; and <hi>made confeſſion of their ſins,</hi> and poured out <hi>ſupplications</hi> to him to eſpouſe their cauſe, and deliver them from their <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> and from all their <hi>diſtreſſes;</hi> and reſtore them to that happy ſtate of freedom they once enjoyed.</p>
            <p>And what could be more reaſonable? For, to whom ſhall people go in their diſtreſs of any
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013758_0016_0F91AAF3E92E7EE8"/>
kind, but unto God, who can do all things for them? And, particularly, when they are groaning under the oppreſſion of the great and powerful, to whom ſhall they go for relief, but to him that is <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>higher</hi> than they, who ſetteth up kings, and putteth them down, and overturns kingdoms at his pleaſure, if it be neceſſary, to work deliverance for his people.</p>
            <p>The Lord is a <hi>ſure refuge</hi> in ſuch a time of trouble. He is a <hi>ſtrong tower,</hi> and whoſoever flies to him ſhall be ſafe, under the ſhadow of his wings, againſt all the powers on earth.</p>
            <p>Even the haughty <hi>Human</hi> ſhall fall before him, when he meditates miſchief to the people of God. And proud <hi>Senacherib,</hi> when he vainly boaſts of his <hi>numbers</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> ſhall be ſtruck, as by a flaſh of lightning, and his mighty hoſt, in which he truſted, become in one night <hi>dead corpſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He can even ſhut the mouths of <hi>hungry lions,</hi> or quench the hotteſt <hi>furnace,</hi> when his ſervants, who truſt in him, are to be preſerved.</p>
            <p>Only then let a people engage God on their ſide, and they need not fear what man can do unto them.</p>
            <p>And in order to this, God expects to be <hi>ſought</hi> unto, in a public ſolemn manner; and, that we <hi>humble</hi> ourſelves before him.</p>
            <p>And our Saviour has taught us, that prayer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>faſting,</hi> has peculiar prevalence with heaven; having ſaid (of the evil ſpirit)—<hi>this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and faſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:013758_0017_0F91AAF7AED04890"/>
And the people of God have practic'd it in all ages, and found the benefit of it: And ſo did <hi>Nineveh,</hi> when threatned with ſpeedy deſtruction, and were ſpared.</p>
            <p>And ſo have <hi>our fathers</hi> in their day, and we in ours.</p>
            <p>In this way a people make a ſolemn appeal to God, as the great governor of the world, when the powers of earth riſe up againſt them, and caſt themſelves upon him. And the Lord expects to be acknowledg'd, if we need his help: And we have no reaſon to look for it without.</p>
            <p>Moreover ſuch a day is deſign'd as a day of <hi>humiliation</hi> for our <hi>ſins,</hi> which have procur'd the evils which are upon us. And this, if ſincere, can't but be acceptable to God. And we know that he hath ſaid—<hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> xiv. II.) And if ſuch a day is not a day of ſincere humiliation, it is a mockery.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the next obſervation,</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>That if a people would on good grounds hope for ſucceſs, they ſhould renew their covenant with God; or lay themſelves under the moſt ſolemn obligations to be an obedient and holy people, for the time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So did Iſrael at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And becauſe of all this, we make a ſure cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and write it; and our Princes, Levites and Prieſts ſeal unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:013758_0018_0F91AAF8B57BFC70"/>
The covenant was ſign'd and ſeal'd by the principal perſons—And <hi>the reſt of the people</hi> took a <hi>ſolemn oath</hi> to do as the ſubſcribers had engag'd.</p>
            <p>What the covenant was, you ſee in the next chapter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in general they covenanted—<hi>to walk in God's law—and to obſerve and do all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord their God;</hi> and <hi>his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his ſtatutes:</hi> Particularly, that they would not intermarry with the heathen—that they would keep the <hi>ſabbath</hi> religiouſly—and the ſabbatical year—punctually pay their tribute to the temple—and give the Prieſts and Levites their due—and no more <hi>forſake</hi> the <hi>houſe of their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what can it ſignify to pretend to <hi>humble</hi> ourſelves before God, on ſuch a day, and to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſins,</hi> unleſs we alſo engage to forſake them, and do better for the time to come?</p>
            <p>And if a ſolemn covenant was drawn up, in which we ſhould bind ourſelves to God and one another to reform the groſs evils which are found among us, and to be in all things an <hi>obedient</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> people, it might be well.</p>
            <p>This formal and ſolemn renewing the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> has been practiced by ſome chriſtian ſocieties, and recommended by others. And I am ready to think it might have a good effect.</p>
            <p>But, the leaſt people can do on ſuch a day is, to <hi>reſolve</hi> and <hi>engage,</hi> in the moſt ſerious and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013758_0019_0F91AAF92FD4C810"/>
manner, to reform all our crying iniquities, which have provok'd God againſt us, and to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> him for the time to come. Without this, they do nothing at all to purpoſe, and can expect no bleſſing. Scripture and reaſon both conſpire to aſſure us of this; and no thinking man can doubt.</p>
            <p>Thus have I gone through with the ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from the words, and ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with ſome <hi>application</hi> and <hi>improvement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, methinks, almoſt every thing that has been ſaid, is naturally applicable to ourſelves in this evil day: And we can hardly help ſeeing the improvement we ought to make.</p>
            <p>However, I ſhall take a little pains to <hi>apply</hi> it, and to preſs the <hi>improvement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if any people on earth, ſince the Jews, have a right to call the land they live in <hi>their own,</hi> and to ſay <hi>God gave it to our fathers</hi>—we may ſay it.</p>
            <p>About <hi>an hundred and fifty-four years</hi> ſince, our fathers were driven by the then raging per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, out of the land of their nativity; and came to ſeek in the wilds of <hi>America</hi> (then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the new world</hi>) that liberty which they were denied at home, (but little thought they ſhould ever be denied here.) They came with the King's leave, tho' at their own expence. (and a vaſt expence it was, no leſs, by the faireſt and loweſt computation, than TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING, the ſettling this ſingle province.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:013758_0020_0F91AAF9EC01CEE0"/>
They ſound it an howling wilderneſs, <hi>deſtitute</hi> and <hi>doleful!</hi> And about half the number of the firſt adventurers died the firſt winter under the unparallell'd hardſhips they ſuffered.</p>
            <p>However, God was with them, and encourag'd them; and ſettled them in this land;—an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of men from whom, with ſome additions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, have ariſen this great multitude, who now occupy the land.</p>
            <p>And, as no body on earth had any title to this land but the <hi>original inhabitants</hi>—our fathers got leave of them to ſettle, and made peace with them, and fairly <hi>purchas'd</hi> their lands of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The king</hi> had no right to give it, nor the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England,</hi> for it was not their's to give. But God gave our fathers favour in the eyes of the people of the land; and they obtain'd <hi>their title</hi> to theſe lands; which was as good as the people of <hi>England</hi> have to theirs; or any other people under heaven. All pretences to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are vain and frivolous to the laſt degree.</p>
            <p>Surely then the land is <hi>ours.</hi> The Lord our God gave it unto our fathers: And we have it by <hi>inheritance from them.</hi> There is no better title this day on earth.</p>
            <p>And yet, if a title could be given by the king, we have that alſo, in our charter; which was a ſolemn <hi>covenant</hi> between <hi>him</hi> and our <hi>fathers;</hi> in which they engag'd to be his <hi>ſubjects,</hi> though remov'd out of his dominions to the ends of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013758_0021_0F91AAFACBBB4FA8"/>
earth, on condition of their enjoying by his means, <hi>all the rights and privileges of Britiſh ſubjects;</hi> (one of which be ſure was the ſafe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of our <hi>property.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And this they depended upon enjoying when they ventur'd their lives and fortunes to extend the Britiſh empire to this end of the world.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>ſacred</hi> as <hi>this charter</hi> was, and richly as we deſerv'd it, by the hardſhips we ſuffer'd, and the immenſe advantage we have been to the land of our forefathers nativity; yet, in a popiſh reign, (that of James the ſecond) our <hi>charter</hi> was taken away; and, ſo hard was our fate, after all our expenſive ſolicitations, only the ſhadow of it could be recovered; tho' it was the only one loſt in that general wreck of charters, which was not reſtored, at the revolution.</p>
            <p>And now, after we have render'd chearfully all the ſervice in our power to our nation—in reducing <hi>Cape Breton, Nova-Scotia</hi> and <hi>Canada:</hi> Some of which we did in a manner alone; and in the whole did much more than our proportion: Yet, becauſe we reap ſome benefit hereby, as ſoon as we have ſtruggled thro' innumerable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtreſſes for a century and an half, and begin ſome of us, to live a little comfortably in this wilderneſs, they envy us our happineſs, and thirſt after our inheritance. And becauſe they have ſquandered away the nation's money in the moſt ſhameful manner, and by this bad huſbandry are got immenſely in debt; behold, they threaten to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013758_0022_0F91AAFB82F337F0"/>
take away all our <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>property,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to <hi>ſlavery</hi> and <hi>beggary.</hi>

            <p>And, which is moſt aggravating, the king's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, it ſeems, is not helped by it.</p>
            <p>But the money extorted from us is given to <hi>placemen</hi> and <hi>penſioners</hi> here, who are to be our taſk-maſters to afflict us, and riot on our ſpoils!</p>
            <p>Is it merely then to impoveriſh us that we are to be thus fleec'd to the ſkin? No! The plot is deep, and worſe is yet behind! Theſe men are by this means to be attach'd hereby to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and to be their SPIES and INFORMERS againſt us from time to time.</p>
            <p>They expect letters from them like thoſe from the enemies of Judah in the days of <hi>Ezra.</hi> (See <hi>Ezra</hi> iv. 14.) <hi>Now,</hi> FORASMUCH AS WE HAVE MAINTENANCE FROM THE KING'S PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LACE, <hi>and it was not meet for us to ſee the king's diſhonour, therefore we have ſent and certified the king,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, their language ſeems to be that of the Egyptians concerning Iſrael, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 1. 10, <hi>&amp;c.) Come on, let us deal wiſely with them, leſt they multiply,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And their policy was much the ſame. They <hi>ſet Taſk-maſters over them, to afflict them. And made their lives bitter with hard bondage</hi>—and rigorous ſervice.</p>
            <p>But behold! how heaven counteracted them: For, <hi>the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

And when they ſaw that this did not do, being determin'd, if poſſible, by right or by wrong, to carry their point, (for tyranny once begun has no bounds) they took the moſt horrid method ever heard of: They ſent out a <hi>bloody decree,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the midwives to <hi>kill</hi> every <hi>male child</hi> as ſoon as it was born. Who could believe human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of this? Who can think of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror? Bleſſed be God it is not quite come to this with us yet. But who knows how ſoon it may?<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>murder-act</hi> ſince paſs'd, I think, comes but little ſhort of it: and might juſtify the very thing.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But did the <hi>midwives</hi> obey the <hi>King's decree?</hi> No! They <hi>feared God,</hi> and diſobey'd the King. And it was ſo far from diſpleaſing God, that he preſerv'd them from the wrath of the King, and <hi>proſper'd</hi> and <hi>bleſs'd</hi> them for <hi>ſearing God</hi> more than <hi>man.</hi> And ſo, I doubt not, if we fear God more than man, ſhall we alſo be preſerv'd and bleſs'd.</p>
            <p>But what a deplorable condition are we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to, by the <hi>tyranny</hi> of ſome that are over us!</p>
            <p>Many ways have been devis'd to oppreſs and enſlave us: But when we ſought the Lord, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd for us, and deliver'd us from one ſnare after another. The cruel decrees againſt us were repeal'd: and we hop'd again to ſee good days. For, tho' they kept up their exorbitant claim <hi>of making laws to bind us</hi> IN ALL CASES WHATE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER, which included a <hi>power</hi> to diſpoſe of <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>all that we have,</hi> at their will and pleaſure; yet
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013758_0024_0F91AB016EBFE158"/>
we flatter'd ourſelves they would never exerciſe this pretended right; but it would forever lay dormant.</p>
            <p>But we have found ourſelves miſtaken. They have fram'd laws to extort our money from us without our conſent; to raiſe a <hi>revenue,</hi> and ſo to make, at our expence, a ſwarm of officers, <hi>dependent</hi> on them and <hi>independent</hi> on us; which if continued, would no doubt alone eventually deſtroy all our liberties.</p>
            <p>And becauſe we would not pay this <hi>tax;</hi> but deſtroy'd the <hi>engine of oppreſſion,</hi> when no other way was left us—Behold they have now ſhut up our <hi>capital,</hi> ſurrounded it with <hi>ſhips,</hi> and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it with <hi>ſoldiers,</hi>—ſtop'd all their <hi>trade,</hi> and left them to ſtarve without remedy, except from the <hi>charity</hi> of their more <hi>humane brethren!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as if this was not enough to ſatiate their fury—<hi>bills</hi> have paſs'd the <hi>two houſes</hi>—and doubtleſs long ere now are ſign'd by the <hi>king,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The truth of this was ſoon confirm'd, and the <hi>Canada</hi> Bill added to them.</note> to take away every <hi>charter-right</hi> worth contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, too many to be enumerated; and too <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>oppreſſive</hi> ever to be borne by any free people, if Heaven puts any lawful means in their power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And what further is meditated by the men of blood, we know not: But many things are to be fear'd upon too good grounds. Particularly, many think there is a deſign, and will be an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013758_0025_0F91AB026C304180"/>
to ſeize our beſt friends, and carry them home for <hi>tryal!</hi> For <hi>tryal</hi> did I ſay? No! For <hi>execution!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice! He can, and, I truſt, will, prevent this horrid Inſult!</p>
            <p>May we not now adopt almoſt every word of my text—and ſay—<hi>Behold we are ſervants this day.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But, let us now ſeriouſly conſider, that it is for <hi>our ſins</hi> that God ſuffers all theſe evils to come upon us: He would never have thus <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> us, if we had not <hi>forſaken</hi> him firſt.</p>
            <p>O let us realize this, this day—and therefore fly to God by <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> by <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis God only who can help us; without him vain is all human <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>help.</hi> O that we were duly ſenſible of this, and would religiouſly caſt all our care upon him!</p>
            <p>We muſt indeed <hi>watch</hi> as well as pray: and not <hi>lie upon our faces</hi> and expect miracles: This was not the way which good Nehemiah took: They did all they could for their own ſafety, and then repair'd to the throne of grace, and caſt themſelves upon divine mercy. Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing more in which we muſt imitate them, or all is in vain at laſt: And that is—We muſt <hi>covenant</hi> or <hi>ſolemnly</hi> engage this day to <hi>reform our crying ſins,</hi> and to become an <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:013758_0026_0F91AB02EBAD07C0"/>
Don't let us trifle in this part of our duty this day! If we do we looſe all the reſt. For, if we ſtill regard iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear us.</p>
            <p>Yea, if we will not for all theſe terrible things be reformed, we have reaſon to fear yet ſeven times worſe (if it can be) till we are utterly conſumed.</p>
            <p>Oh, let us then, with one conſent, <hi>ſearch and try our ways and turn to the Lord.</hi> Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort one another, and ſay, with the Prophet—<hi>Come and let us return to the Lord, for he hath ſmitten, and he will heal us, he hath broken, and he will bind us up; after two days he will revive us, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have done nothing againſt <hi>men,</hi> our <hi>king</hi> or our <hi>brethren,</hi> to bring all this evil upon us, but what was judged abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our <hi>liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if there was any thing done amiſs, ſure it don't deſerve all this! From man therefore I take it to be clearly, <hi>unjuſt, oppreſſive</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> to the laſt degree: and find this acknowledg'd by many of the <hi>Britiſh parliament</hi> themſelves. And who can judge otherwiſe? For a <hi>whole city,</hi> nay, a whole <hi>province</hi> is deſtin'd to deſtruction, for the ſuppos'd fault of a few, without ever having been charg'd with that fault; nay, while our <hi>great enemy</hi> has publickly declar'd, that even <hi>the town,</hi> as ſuch, had no hand in it. And we are condemn'd UNTRIED, UNHEARD, contrary to the <hi>firſt principles</hi> of <hi>juſtice</hi> in all nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:013758_0027_0F91AB03ABECB870"/>
But, againſt God, we may not ſay—What have we done? But, rather,—What have we not done to provoke his pure eyes to anger?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men</hi> may do us wrong; but <hi>God</hi> can do none. He has not ſuffer'd all this evil to come upon us for nothing! No! But it is for our multiplied tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>And, if we would <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in our <hi>liberty,</hi> we muſt ſecure the divine favour: for in vain is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hoped for from any other quarter.</p>
            <p>God has done wonderful things for our land in times paſt, in ſubduing the Enemies before us, and in delivering us again and again from the yokes of bondage, which were prepared for us. And we rejoiced &amp; ſhouted abundantly. But, what ſuitable returns have we made? Did we become a <hi>holier</hi> and <hi>better</hi> people? No! verily! But we have been, and ſtill are, an evil and unthankful people. And, I fear we grew worſe after all our mercies. Wickedneſs of almoſt every kind, I fear, prevail'd more than ordinarily.</p>
            <p>What <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>religion</hi>—of his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>miniſters,</hi> and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to him!—What horrid <hi>profaneneſs</hi>—</p>
            <p>What <hi>filthineſs &amp; uncleanneſs</hi> among our youth, till many are become a deriſion!—What <hi>intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>—What <hi>injuſtice &amp; oppreſſion!</hi> What <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>backbiting!</hi> What unchriſtian <hi>ſtrife</hi> &amp; <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in <hi>towns</hi> and <hi>churches!</hi> What <hi>theſts</hi> and <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaries</hi>—Yea, what <hi>murders</hi> are found among us! 'Tis endleſs to reckon them up—it cannot be done!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:013758_0028_0F91AB0479323A28"/>
But let every one <hi>ſearch</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> the plague of his own heart—Yea let us ſearch out all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities till we find none. And let us be <hi>humbled</hi> and lay in the duſt—And mourn bitterly before God for all the abominations which are found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as well as cry mightily unto God. Yea, let the counſel of the Lord be acceptable to you this day—And let us break off from all our iniquities by righteouſneſs, and from our tranſgreſſions, by ſhewing mercy to thoſe who are <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>oppreſſed</hi> among us, if it may be a lengthning of our tranquility. Without this, all our cries and tears are but a mockery, and will procure us a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And unleſs God be better to us than we are to ourſelves, all the evils which hand over us will fall upon us, and perhaps ſeventimes more (if it can be) till we are reduc'd to the moſt miſerable ſtate of mortals, if not utterly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And, if you, and this people, will not hear, my ſoul, and the ſouls of all the godly in the land, ſhall weep in ſecret places for your <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſturbborneſs,</hi> and for all the <hi>calamities</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> which a few days more may bring forth.</p>
            <p>O my brethren,—come and let us return to the God of mercy, who delighteth to be gracious! Let us do it without delay! And who knows but the day in which our enemies hope to triumph in the overthrow of all our liberties, God may (as he did to his people of old, in the days of <hi>Human</hi>) make the dry of our <hi>deliverance</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:013758_0029_0F91AB0837E9D7C0"/>
and of the overthrow of our implacable enemies; and ſettle our <hi>rights</hi> on a firmer foundation than ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our fathers truſted in God,</hi> and <hi>he did deliver them.</hi> And the ſame Lord yet reigneth, therefore let New-England, yea let the <hi>earth rejoice!</hi> For, I firmly believe, that if we are not groſly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ourſelves, but commit our ſelves and our cauſe to the God of our fathers, in well doing, when we have ſuffer'd a while, he will alſo deliver us.</p>
            <p>But, if not, the Lord prepare us for the moſt evil days, which may be before us; and give us grace ſo to improve them, as to make us thirſt more earneſtly for a better world, where the <hi>wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi> and the <hi>weary are at reſt.</hi>
