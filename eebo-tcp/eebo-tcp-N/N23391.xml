            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAVING arrived at the laſt ſtage of this long and intereſting cauſe, it now becomes the duty of the court to ſum up the evidence, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the law ariſing upon it. A maſs of teſtimony has been brought forward in the courſe of the trial, the far greater part of which is altogether immaterial, and can be of no uſe in forming a deciſion. The great points, on which the cauſe turns, are of a legal nature; they are queſtions of law; and therefore for the ſake of the parties, as well as for my own ſake, they ought to be put in a train for ultimate adjudication by the ſupreme court. In the adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice it is a conſolitary idea, that no opinion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle judge can be final and deciſive; but that the ſame may be removed before the higheſt tribunal for reviſion, where, if erroneous, it will be rectified. For the ſake of clearneſs, I ſhall conſider,</p>

            <div type="title_of_defendant">
               <p>Such is the title, upon which the plaintiff reſts his cauſe.

                  <p>The title under Connecticut is of no avail. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the land in controverſy is ex-territorial; it does not lie within the charter-bounds of Connecticut, but within the charter-bounds of Pennſylvania. The charter of Connecticut does not over or ſpread over the lands in queſtion. Of courſe no title can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Connecticut. Here then the defendant fails.</p>

                  <p>The Indian deed, under which the defendant claims, bears date the 11th of July 1754. It has been obſerved, that this deed is radically defective and faulty; that fraud is apparent on the face of it, and, particularly, that the ſpecification or deſcription of the land is written on a razure. Of this, gentlemen, you will judge, as the deed will be given to you for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. Permit me to obſerve, that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, by which a deed may be avoided or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of no effect. One of theſe is by razure, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, interlining, or other alteration in any material part, if done after its execution. It is the province of the jury to determine, whether any ſuch alteration was made after the delivery of the deed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this deed appears to have been executed at different times; and not in that open, public, national manner, in which the Indians ſell and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their lands.</p>
                  <p>But if the deed was fairly obtained; if it has le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal exiſtence, then, what is its legal operation.</p>
                  <p>By the charter to William Penn, the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption attached, and was veſted in him to all the lands comprehended within its limits. The Penn family had excluſively the right of purchaſing the lands of the Indians; and, indeed, the Indians entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtipulation of that kind.</p>
                  <p>Again, this deed is invalid by the laws of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. The legiſlature of Pennſylvania,<note place="margin">1 Pennſyl. Laws 3.</note> by an act paſſed the 7th Feb. 1705, declare, <q>That if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſume to buy any land of the natives, within
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030962_0006_0FEA0AFF7A4CE570"/>
the limits of this province and territories, without leave from the proprietary thereof, every ſuch bargain or purchaſe ſhall be void and of no effect.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By an act paſſed the 14th Feb. 1729—30, it is further declared, <q>That every gift, grant, bargain,<note place="margin">1 Pennſyl. Laws, 157, 158.</note> ſale, written or verbal contract or agreement, and every pretended conveyance, leaſe, demiſe, and every other aſſurance made, or that ſhall hereafter be made, with any of the Indian natives, for any lands, &amp;c. within the limits of this province, without the order or direction of the proprietary or his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, ſhall be null, void, and of no effect.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The land in controverſy being within the limits of Pennſylvania, the Connecticut ſettlers were in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal eſtimation, treſpaſſers and intruders. They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the land without leave, and entered upon it without right.</p>
                  <p>They purchaſed and entered upon the land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the legiſlature of Connecticut. True it is, that the legiſlature of Connecticut gave a ſubſequent approbation, but this was poſterior to the deed executed by the Six Nations to Penn at fort Stanwix, and the principle of relation does not retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſo as to affect third perſons.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence is, that the Connecticut ſettlers derive no title under the Indian deed.</p>

Pennſylvania, commonly called the quieting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming act.

And of this high court, he adds, it may be truly ſaid, <hi>Si antiquitatem ſpectes, eſt vetuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima; ſi dignitatem, eſt honoratiſſima; ſi juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,

eſt capaciſſima.</hi> It has ſovereign and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable authority in the making, confirming, enlarging, reſtraining, abrogating, repealing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all poſſible denominations, eccleſiaſtical or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, civil, military, maritime, or criminal: this being the place where that abſolute deſpotic power, which muſt in all governments reſide ſomewhere, is entruſted by the conſtitution of theſe kingdoms. All miſchiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that tranſcend the ordinary courſe of the laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new model the ſucceſſion to the crown; as was done in the reign of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the eſtabliſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the land; as was done in a variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in the reigns of king Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afreſh even the conſtitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themſelves; as was done by the act of union, and the ſeveral ſtatutes for triennial and ſeptennial elections. It can, in ſhort, do every thing that is not naturally impoſſible; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome have not ſcrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. True it is, that what the parliament doth, no authority upon earth can undo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this paſſage it is evident, that, in England, the authority of the parliament runs without limits, and riſes above control. It is difficult to ſay what the conſtitution of England is, becauſe not being reduced to written certainty and preciſion, it lies entirely at
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030962_0009_0FEA0B07B5A9DE88"/>
the mercy of the parliament. It bends to every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermental exigency; it varies and is blown about by every breeze of legiſlative humour or political caprice.<note place="margin">Hob. 87. 12 Mod. 687.</note>Some of the judges in England have had the boldneſs to aſſert, that an act of parliament made againſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equity is void; but this opinion contravenes the general poſition, that the validity of an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be drawn into queſtion by the judicial department. It cannot be diſputed, and muſt be obeyed. The power of parliament is abſolute and tranſcendent; it is omnipotent in the ſcale of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal exiſtence. Beſides, in England there is no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conſtitution, no fundamental law, nothing viſible, nothing real, nothing certain, by which a ſtatute can be teſted. In America the caſe is widely different. Every ſtate in the union has its conſtitution reduced to written exactitude and preciſion.</p>
               <p>What is a conſtitution? It is the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, delineated by the mighty hand of the people, in which certain firſt principles or fundamental laws are eſtabliſhed. The conſtitution is certain and fixed; it contains the permanent will of the people, and is the ſupreme law of the land; it is paramount to the power of the legiſlature, and can be revoked or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered only by the authority that made it. The life-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle and the death-doing ſtroke muſt proceed from the ſame hand. What are legiſlatures? Creatures of the conſtitution—they owe their exiſtence to the conſtitution—they derive their powers from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution—it is their commiſſion; and therefore all their acts muſt be conformable to it, or elſe they will be void—The conſtitution is the work or will of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030962_0010_0FEA0B09DAC7FCD0"/>
people themſelves, in their original, ſovereign, and unlimited capacity. Law is the work or will of the legiſlature in their derivative and ſubordinate capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The one is the work of the creator, and the other of the creature. The conſtitution fixes limits to the exerciſe of legiſlative authority, and preſcribes the orbit, within which it muſt move. In ſhort, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the conſtitution is the ſun of the political ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, around which all legiſlative, executive, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial bodies muſt revolve. Whatever may be the caſe in other countries, yet in this there can be no doubt, that every act of the legiſlature repugnant to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is abſolutely void.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond article of the declaration of rights, which was made part of the late conſtitution of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, it is declared, <q>That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worſhip Almighty God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of their own conſciences and underſtanding:<note place="margin">Declaration of rights, Article 2.</note>and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or erect or ſupport any place of worſhip, or, maintain any miniſtry, contrary to, or againſt, his own free will and conſent: nor can any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be juſtly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious ſentiments, or peculiar mode of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip; and that no authority can or ought to be veſted in, or aſſumed by any power whatever, that ſhall in any caſe interfere with, or in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner control, the right of conſcience in the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of religious worſhip.</q>

In the thirty ſecond ſection of the ſame conſtitution it is ordained, <q>That all elections,<note place="margin">Conſtitution of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Could the legiſlature have annulled theſe articles reſpecting religion, the rights of conſcience, and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by ballot? Surely no. As to theſe points there was no devolution of power—the authority was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely withheld, and reſerved by the people to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If the legiſlature had paſſed an act declaring, that, in future, there ſhould be no trial by jury, would it have been obligatory? No—it would have been void for want of juriſdiction, or conſtitutional extent of power. The right of trial by jury is a fundamental law, made ſacred by the conſtitution, and cannot be legiſlated away. The conſtitution of a ſtate is ſtable and permanent, not to be worked upon by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the times, nor to riſe and fall with the tide of events: notwithſtanding the competition of oppoſing intereſts, and the violence of contending parties, it remains firm and immoveable, as a mountain amidſt the ſtrife of ſtorms, or a rock in the ocean amidſt the raging of the waves. I take it to be a clear poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if a legiſlative act oppugns a conſtitutional principle, the former muſt give way, and be rejected on the ſcore of repugnance. I hold it to be a poſition equally clear and ſound, that, in ſuch caſe, it will be the duty of the court to adhere to the conſtitution, and to declare the act null and void. The conſtitution is the baſis of legiſlative authority; it lies at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all law, and is a rule and commiſſion by which both legiſlators and judges are to proceed. It
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030962_0012_0FEA0B0E0D889D68"/>
is an important principle, which, in the diſcuſſion of queſtions of the preſent kind, ought never to be loſt ſight of, that the judiciary in this country is not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, but co-ordinate, branch of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Having made theſe preliminary obſervations, we ſhall proceed to contemplate the quieting and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act, and to bring its validity to the teſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of argument, the counſel on both ſides relied upon certain parts of the late bill of rights and conſtitution of Pennſylvania, which I ſhall now read, and then refer to them occaſionally in the ſequel of the charge.</p>

               </q>
               <p>From theſe paſſages it is evident, that the right of acquiring and poſſeſſing property, and having it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, is one of the natural, inherent, and unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights of man. Men have a ſenſe of property. Property is neceſſary to their ſubſiſtence, and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030962_0014_0FEA0B13EC4B2C20"/>
to their natural wants and deſires; its ſecurity was one of the objects, that induced them to unite in ſociety. No man would become a member of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, in which he could not enjoy the fruits of his honeſt labour and induſtry. The preſervation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty then is a primary object of the ſocial compact, and by the late conſtitution of Pennſylvania, was made a fundamental law. Every perſon ought to contribute his proportion for public purpoſes and public exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but, no one can be called upon to ſurrender or ſacrifice his whole property, real and perſonal, for the good of the community, without receiving a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in value. This would be laying a burden upon an individual, which ought to be ſuſtained by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety at large. The Engliſh hiſtory does not furniſh an inſtance of the kind; the parliament, with all their boaſted omnipotence, never committed ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage on private property; and if they had, it would have ſerved only to diſplay the dangerous nature of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited authority; it would have been an exerciſe of power and not of right. Such an act would be a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in legiſlation, and ſhock all mankind. The legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore, had no authority to make an act diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one citizen of his freehold, and veſting it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without a juſt compenſation. It is inconſiſtent with the principles of reaſon, juſtice and moral rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; it is incompatible with the comfort, peace, and happineſs of mankind; it is contrary to the principles of ſocial alliance in every free government, and laſtly it is contrary both to the letter and ſpirit of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. In ſhort, it is what every one would think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unjuſt in his own caſe. The next ſtep
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030962_0015_0FEA0B15B3595708"/>
in the line of progreſſion is, whether the legiſlature had authority to make an act diveſting one citizen of his freehold and veſting it in another, even with compenſation. That the legiſlature, on certain emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, had authority to exerciſe this high power has been urged from the nature of the ſocial compact, and from the words of the conſtitution, which ſays, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives ſhall have all other powers neceſſary for the legiſlature of a free ſtate or commonwealth; but they ſhall have no power to add to, alter, aboliſh, or infringe any part of this conſtitution. The courſe of reaſoning on the part of the defendant may be compriſed in a few words. The deſpotic power, as it is aptly called by ſome writers, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king private property, when ſtate neceſſity requires, exiſts in every government; the exiſtence of ſuch power is neceſſary; government could not ſubſiſt without it; and if this be the caſe, it cannot be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any where with ſo much ſafety as with the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The preſumption is, that they will not call it into exerciſe except in urgent caſes, or caſes of the firſt neceſſity. There is force in this reaſoning. It is, however, difficult to form a caſe, in which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a ſtate can be of ſuch a nature as to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe or excuſe the ſeizing of landed property, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one citizen and giving it to another citizen. It is immaterial to the ſtate, in which of its citizens the land is veſted; but it is of primary importance, that, when veſted, it ſhould be ſecured, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor protected in the enjoyment of it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution encircles, and renders it an holy thing. We muſt, gentlemen, bear conſtantly in mind, that the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030962_0016_0FEA0B1884F94508"/>
preſent is a caſe of landed property, veſted by law in one ſet of citizens, attempted to be diveſted, for the purpoſe of veſting the ſame property in another ſet of citizens. It cannot be aſſimilated to the caſe of perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al property taken or uſed in time of war or famine, or other extreme neceſſity; it cannot be aſſimilated to the temporary poſſeſſion of land itſelf on a preſſing public emergency, or the ſpur of the occaſion. In the latter caſe there is no change of property, no diveſtment of right, the title remains, and the proprietor, though out of poſſeſſion for a while, is ſtill proprietor and lord of the ſoil. The poſſeſſion grew out of the occaſion and ceaſes with it. Then the right of neceſſity is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and at an end; it does not affect the title, is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary in its nature, and cannot exiſt forever. The conſtitution expreſsly declares, that the right of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, poſſeſſing, and protecting property is natural, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, and unalienable. It is a right not <hi>ex gratia</hi> from the legiſlature, but <hi>ex debito</hi> from the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is ſacred; for it is further declared, that the legiſlature ſhall have no power to add to, alter, aboliſh, or infringe any part of the conſtitution. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is the origin and meaſure of legiſlative authority. It ſays to legiſlators, Thus far ye ſhall go and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not a particle of it ſhould be ſhaken; not a pebble of it ſhould be removed. Innovation is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. One incroachment leads to another; prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gives birth to precedent; what has been done may be done again; thus radical principles are gradually broken in upon, and the conſtitution eventually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Where the ſecurity, where the inviolability of property, if the legiſlature, by a private act, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030962_0017_0FEA0B1BA4094FB0"/>
particular perſons only, can take land from one citizen, who acquired it legally, and veſt it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The rights of private property are regulated, protected, and governed by general, known, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed laws; and decided upon by general, known, and eſtabliſhed tribunals; laws and tribunals not made and created on an inſtant exigency, on an urgent emergency, to ſerve a preſent turn, or the intereſt of a moment. Their operation and influence are equal and univerſal; they preſs alike on all. Hence ſecurity and ſafety, tranquillity and peace. One man is not afraid of another, and no man afraid of the legiſlature. It is infinitely wiſer and ſafer to riſk ſome poſſible miſchiefs than to veſt in the legiſlature ſo unneceſſary, dangerous, and enormous a power as that which has been exerciſed on the preſent occaſion; a power, that, according to the full extent of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is boundleſs and omnipotent. For the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature judged of the neceſſity of the caſe, and alſo of the nature and value of the equivalent.</p>
               <p>Such a caſe of neceſſity, and judging too of the compenſation, can never occur in any nation. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, indeed, and untoward muſt be the ſtate of things, that would induce the legiſlature, ſuppoſing they had the power, to diveſt one individual of his landed eſtate merely for the purpoſe of veſting it in another, even upon full indemnification; unleſs that indemnification be aſcertained in the manner which I ſhall mention hereafter.</p>
               <p>But admitting, that the legiſlature can take the real eſtate of A. and give it to B. on making compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the principle and reaſoning upon it go no further
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030962_0018_0FEA0B1D542808C0"/>
than to ſhew, that the legiſlature are the ſole and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive judges of the neceſſity of the caſe, in which this deſpotic power ſhould be called into action. It cannot, on the principles of the ſocial alliance, or of the conſtitution, be extended beyond the point of judging upon every exiſting caſe of neceſſity. The legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature declare and enact, that ſuch are the public exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, or neceſſities of the ſtate, as to authoriſe them to take the land of A. and give it to B.; the dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the eternal principles of juſtice, as well as the ſacred principles of the ſocial contract, and the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, direct, and they accordingly declare and ordain, that A. ſhall receive compenſation for the land. But here the legiſlature maſt ſtop; they have run the full length of their authority, and can go no further: they cannot conſtitutionally determine upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the compenſation, or value of the land. Public exigencies do not require, neceſſity does not demand, that the legiſlature ſhould, of themſelves, without the participation of the proprietor, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a jury, aſſeſs the value of the thing, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the amount of the compenſation to be paid for it. This can conſtitutionally be effected only in three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the parties—that is, by ſtipulation between the legiſlature and proprietor of the land.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By commiſſioners mutually elected by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the intervention of a jury.</p>

               <p>Shame to American legiſlation! That in England, a limited monarchy, where there is no written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, where the parliament is omnipotent, and can mould the conſtitution at pleaſure, a more ſacred regard ſhould have been paid to property, than in America, ſurrounded as we are with a blaze of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical illumination, where the legiſlatures are limited, where we have republican governments, and written conſtitutions, by which the protection and enjoyment of property are rendered inviolable.</p>

The caſe of the Iſle of Man was a fair and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtipulation; it partook of the ſpirit and eſſence of a contract: it was free and mutual; and was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the proprietors on equal terms. But if the buſineſs cannot be effected in this way, then the value of the land, intended to be taken, ſhould be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by commiſſioners, or perſons mutually elected by the parties, or by the intervention of the judiciary, of which a jury is a component part. In the firſt caſe, we approximate nearly to a contract; becauſe the will of the party, whoſe property is to be affected, is in ſome degree exerciſed; he has a choice; his own act co-operates with that of the legiſlature. In the other caſe, there is the intervention of a court of law, or, in other words, a jury is to paſs between the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and the individual, who, after hearing the proofs and allegations of the parties, will, by their verdict, fix the value of the property, or the ſum to be paid for it. The compenſation, if not agreed upon by the parties or their agents, muſt be aſcertained by a jury. The interpoſition of a jury is, in ſuch caſe, a conſtitutional guard upon property, and a neceſſary check to legiſlative authority. It is a barrier between the individual and the legiſlature, and ought never to be removed; as long as it is preſerved, the rights of private property will be in no danger of violation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſes of abſolute neceſſity, or great public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. By the confirming act, the value of the land taken and the value of the land to be paid in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, are to be aſcertained by the board of property. And who are the perſons that conſtitute this board? Men appointed by one of the parties, by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030962_0023_0FEA0B2858E615A0"/>
only. The perſon, whoſe property is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted and valued, had no volition, no choice, no co-operation in the appointment; and beſides, the other conſtitutional guard upon property, that of a jury, is removed and done away. The board of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, thus conſtituted, are authoriſed to decide upon the value of the land to be taken, and upon the value of the land to be given by way of equivalent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the participation of the party or the intervention of a jury.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The nature of the compenſation.</p>
               <p>By the act the equivalent is to be in land. No juſt compenſation can be made except in money. Money is a common ſtandard, by compariſon with which the value of any thing may be aſcertained. It is not only a ſign which repreſents the reſpective values of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, but is an univerſal medium, eaſily portable, liable to little variation, and readily exchanged for any kind of property. Compenſation is a recompence in value, <hi>a quid pro quo,</hi> and muſt be in money. True it is, that land or any thing elſe may be a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but then it muſt be at the election of the party; it cannot be forced upon him. His conſent will lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe the act, and make it valid; nothing ſhort of it will have the effect. It is obvious, that if a jury paſs upon the ſubject or value of the property, their verdict muſt be in money.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this part of the diſcourſe: It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the legiſlature muſt judge of the neceſſity of interpoſing their deſpotic authority; it is a right of neceſſity upon which no other power in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can decide: that no civil inſtitution is perfect;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030962_0024_0FEA0B2AB6B347D8"/>
and that caſes will occur, in which private property muſt yield to urgent calls of public utility or general danger. Be it ſo. But then it muſt be upon complete indemnification to the individual. Agreed. But who ſhall judge of this indemnification? Did there alſo exiſt a ſtate neceſſity, that the legiſlature, or perſons ſolely appointed by them, muſt admeaſure the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or value of the lands ſeized and taken, and the validity of the title thereto? Did a third ſtate neceſſity exiſt, that the proprietor muſt take land by way of equivalent for his land? And did a fourth ſtate neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity exiſt, that the value of this land equivalent muſt be adjuſted by the board of property, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the party, or the interference of a jury? Alas! how neceſſity begets neceſſity. They riſe upon each other and become endleſs. The proprietor ſtands afar off, a ſolitary and unprotected member of the community, and is ſtript of his property, without his conſent, without a hearing, without notice, the value of that property judged upon without his participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the intervention of a jury, and the equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent therefor in lands aſcertained in the ſame way. If this be the legiſlation of a republican government, in which the preſervation of property is made ſacred by the conſtitution, I aſk, wherein it differs from the mandate of an Aſiatic prince. Omnipotence in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation is deſpotiſm. According to this doctrine, we have nothing that we can call our own, or are ſure of for a moment; we are all tenants at will, and hold our landed property at the mere pleaſure of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. Wretched ſituation, precarious tenure! And yet we boaſt of property and its ſecurity, of laws, of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030962_0025_0FEA0B2DD7B57D10"/>
courts, of conſtitutions, and call ourſelves free. In ſhort, gentlemen, the confirming act is void; it never had conſtitutional exiſtence; it is a dead letter, and of no more virtue or avail, than if it never had been made.</p>

               <p>It is contended, on the part of the defendant, that on the paſſing of the act the eſtate was diveſted from the Pennſylvania claimants, and inſtantly veſted in the Connecticut ſettlers.

Sect. 1.

It is a known maxim, that where the eſtate is to ariſe upon a condition precedent, it cannot veſt till that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is performed: and this has been ſo ſtrongly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to, that even where the condition has become impoſſible, no eſtate or intereſt grew thereupon. Where a condition copulative precedes an eſtate, the whole muſt be performed before the eſtate can ariſe; or where an act is previous to any eſtate, and that act conſiſts of ſeveral particulars, every particular muſt be performed before the eſtate can veſt or take effect.</p>
               <p>The eſtate of the Pennſylvania claimants was not diveſted on the paſſing of the act; it was not diveſted on preſenting the claim on the part of the Connecticut ſettlers. Other acts were previouſly neceſſary, and in particular the commiſſioners muſt paſs upon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the claim before the eſtate is diveſted from the one party and veſted in the other. Theſe things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and muſt be done before any eſtate can veſt in the defendant; but they have not been, and therefore the eſtate remains in the plaintiff. This conſtruction correſponds with the meaning and ſpirit, the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſcope of the act itſelf. The intention of the legiſlature was to veſt in Connecticut claimants of a particular deſcription a perfect eſtate to certain lands in the county of Luzerne; but then it was upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; it was to operate upon, ſecure, and ſanctify ſuch claims only as ſhould be admitted and aſcertained, approved and eſtabliſhed by the commiſſioners. This is further evident from the powers and functions of the commiſſioners, who were to enquire, examine, hear
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030962_0032_0FEA0B403151A7F8"/>
proofs, &amp;c. reſpecting the claims; and for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? why, that they might admit and approve of ſuch as were ſupported by ſatisfactory evidence, and make return thereof to the executive council, who ſhould thereupon cauſe patents to be iſſued for their confirmation. Until the commiſſioners had decided in favor of a claim, it remained <hi>in ſtatu quo;</hi> the act did not cover and protect it. Further, if the act will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of two conſtructions, that one certainly ought to be adopted, which is in favor of the legal owner, and which will not diveſt his eſtate, till the terms ſpecified in the act ſhall have been fully complied with. When the legiſlature undertake to give away what is not their own, when they attempt to take the property of one man, which he fairly acquired, and the general law of the land protects, in order to transfer it to another, even upon complete indemnification, it will naturally be conſidered as an extraordinary act of legiſlation, which ought to be viewed with jealous eyes, examined with critical exactneſs, and ſcrutinized with all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of legal expoſition. An act of this ſort deſerves no favor; to conſtrue it liberally would be ſinning againſt the rights of property.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it was the manifeſt intention of the makers of the act, that a juſt compenſation ſhould be made in land to the Pennſylvania claimants; upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple the act proceeds; and therefore if it appear, that ſuch compenſation cannot be made, or that it is very dubious, whether it can be effected; the court ought not to give ſuch a conſtruction, as will deprive the owner of his eſtate, with little or no proſpect of being recompenſed in value. If either party ought to be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030962_0033_0FEA0B42115EDA88"/>
driven to the neceſſity of controverting the queſtion with the ſtate of Pennſylvania, it ought to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut ſettlers, who have no legal title to the land, and not the Pennſylvania claimants, in whom is veſted a good eſtate at law.</p>
               <p>Deeming the conſtruction, which has been put upon the act, to be the ſound one, it precludes the enquiry, how far a patent of confirmation was neceſſary to ſubſtantiate the claim of the defendant, ſo as to render it available in a court of common law.</p>

it. Their conſtitutional power reached to both, or to neither. By the act of the 28th of March 1787, the commiſſioners were to aſcertain and confirm the claims of the Connecticut ſettlers, upon the doing whereof the eſtate, if the law was conſtitutional, would become veſted in them. This has not been done; the claim in the preſent inſtance has not been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained and confirmed; and as this act ſuſpends or revokes theſe aſcertaining and confirming powers, it never can be done. Of courſe there is an end of the buſineſs. The parties are placed on their original ground; they are reſtored to their priſtine ſituation.</p>

But are they facts of any avail? Did they give any right, or veſt any eſtate? No—whether done or not done, they leave the parties juſt where they were. They create no intereſt, affect no title, change no property; when done, they are uſeleſs and of no efficacy. Other acts were neceſſary to be performed, but before the performance of them, the law was ſuſpended and then repealed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It impairs the obligation of a contract, and is therefore void. If the property to the lands in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been veſted in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, then the legiſlature would have had the liberty and right of diſpoſing or granting them to whom they pleaſed, at any time, and in any manner. Over public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty they have a diſpoſing and controlling power, over private property they have none, except, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in certain caſes, and thoſe under reſtrictions, and except alſo what may ariſe from the enactment and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of general laws reſpecting property, which will affect themſelves as well as their conſtituents. But
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030962_0038_0FEA0B4E10B32968"/>
it the confirming act be a contract between the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of Pennſylvania and the Connecticut ſettlers, it muſt be regulated by the rules and principles, which pervade and govern all caſes of contracts; and if ſo, it is clearly void, becauſe it tends, in its operation and conſequences, to defraud the Pennſylvania claimants, who are third perſons, of their juſt rights; rights aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, protected, and ſecured by the conſtitution and known laws of the land. The plaintiffs title to the land in queſtion is legally derived from Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania; how then, on the principles of contract, could Pennſylvania lawfully diſpoſe of it to another? As a contract, it could convey no right, without the owner's conſent; without that, it was fraudulent and void.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe the diſcourſe with a brief recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its leading points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The confirming act is unconſtitutional and void. It was invalid from the beginning, had no life or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is preciſely in the ſame ſtate, as if it had not been made. If ſo, the plaintiffs title remains in full force.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the confirming act is conſtitutional, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it have not been performed; and therefore the eſtate continues in the plaintiff.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The confirming act has been ſuſpended—and</p>
               <p n="4">4. Repealed.</p>
               <p>The reſult is, that the plaintiff is by law entitled to recover the premiſes in queſtion, and of courſe to your verdict.</p>
