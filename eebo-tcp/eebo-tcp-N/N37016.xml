            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A PAMPHLET has juſt been reprinted here, which every perſon of taſte attributes to you, and which no one can read without reſpecting its author. Your wiſhes are for peace, and you would perſuade the allied Powers not to ſcruple purchaſing it by very important conceſſions. In your wiſhes all Europe will unite; but many, I believe, will think, with me, that the means which you propoſe for accompliſhing them would be productive of the moſt dangerous conſequences. It is conſoling to ſee the milder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſtill cheriſhed in the boſom of one of the ſexes, while every thought of the other ſeems bent on deſtruction; but yet, a great deal too much is at ſtake to allow its being ſacrificed to the impatience of an exceſſive ſenſibility, whoſe triumph could only be preparatory to the bittereſt regret.</p>
            <p>I am too confident, perhaps, in entering the liſts againſt one who unites the ſeduction of ſentiment peculiar to her own ſex, with a courage in her political remarks which might rather be expected in the other,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:048483_0003_10252F41EDADB9C0"/>
and embelliſhes both with hereditary eloquence. But truth and facts are the beſt ſupport of an argument, and will make up for any other diſparity between the diſputants.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe I hope will not be miſtaken. Indeed it will ſoon appear that we really have both the ſame object; for who is there ſo unfeeling as not anxiouſly to wiſh for peace? not indeed a ſuſpicious and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſuſpenſion of war, diſguiſed under that name; but a peace equitable and durable, more ſo than can poſſibly be obtained by any conceſſions on the part of the Allies.</p>
            <p>Meaning to confine my obſervations to the actual ſituation, and the proſpects of the contending Powers, I ſhall ſay nothing of the picture which you have ſketched with ſo much ſpirit of the errors of the Coalition againſt France; but merely obſerve, that the view you exhibit of the errors committed by the combined Powers, will rather induce them to avoid ſuch conduct in future, than tempt them to repeat it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I could wiſh to think ſo (you may ſay); but, admitting that paſt errors do not neceſſarily lead to new diſgrace, if you would intereſt us in the ſucceſs of the Allies, we muſt firſt know exactly what uſe they will make of it. Will they again think of diſmembering France, of compelling an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſubmiſſion to the ancient ſyſtem, and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing thoſe who deſtroyed it? Will they again propoſe to bring back the emigrants in triumph to Paris, with their terrible train of vengeance, excluſive privileges, feudal rights, and partial taxation?</q>
            </p>
            <p>All ſuch ideas the events of the war have long ſince ſhewn to be viſionary. For a long time the object has been to ſave Germany from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered; and to prevent the aggrandiſement, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of attempting the partition, of France. The
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:048483_0004_10252F53D34C79B8"/>
object has been to compel it to give back its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and to keep ſo deſtructive a torrent within its proper limits: and, as probably the happineſs and peace of a century to come will principally depend on the equitable termination of the preſent conteſt, if the French cannot be conquered in the field, yet ſtill the war ſhould be continued till abſolute want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them to retire within their ancient boundaries.</p>
            <p>You appear to believe that a <hi>formal acknowledgement</hi> of their Republic would remove all difficulties, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate their fears, and lead to a general reſtitution; and you think that the Britiſh Cabinet perſiſts in waſting the blood and treaſure of the nation, merely to ſave the Kings of Europe from the humiliation of ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Perhaps you have not heard that three months ago<note n="*" place="bottom">January 26, 1795.</note> Mr. Pitt himſelf moved and carried the following reſolution in the Houſe of Commons: <q>That, under the preſent circumſtances, the Houſe of Commons feels itſelf called upon to declare its determination firmly and ſteadily to ſupport his Majeſty in the vigorous proſecution of the preſent juſt and neceſſary war, as affording, at this time, the only reaſonable expectation of permanent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and peace to this country: and that, for the attainment of theſe objects, this Houſe relies with equal confidence on his Majeſty's intention to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy vigorouſly the force and reſources of the country, in ſupport of its eſſential intereſts; and on the deſire uniformly manifeſted by his Majeſty, to effect a pacification on juſt and honourable grounds, <hi>with any Government in France, under whatever form,</hi> which ſhall appear capable of maintaining the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed relations of peace and amity with other countries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such has been, and ſuch ſtill is, the language of Mr. Pitt. But though you have ſaid a great deal of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:048483_0005_10252F74C87C5D00"/>
that Miniſter in your work, I ſhall ſay very little of him in mine. No one has leſs occaſion for an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious defender than he; and I do not ſee the uſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining ſo general a queſtion, and, when all other paſſions are ſo dangerouſly agitated, increaſing the miſchief by any perſonal reflections.</p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Whether the War has really been more diſaſtrous to the confederated Powers, than Neutrality would have been? Whether they ought to accede to any ſort of Treaty, which would leave the French in poſſeſſion of the ſmalleſt part of their Conqueſts? and whether the Chances of obtaining Reſtitution, and of ultimate Succeſs in the preſent Conteſt, are not in favour of that Party which has the moſt permanent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEFORE any diſcuſſion of the principal point in diſpute, it will be convenient to diſentangle it from ſome queſtions which have a tendency to perplex it.</p>
               <p>I do not mean (any more than M—) <hi>to go back to the origin of the war,</hi> or to inveſtigate its juſtice on the part of the two Princes who firſt united in ſupport of monarchy in France: I am afraid there is but too much reaſon to believe that it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to lead to the ſcaffold the King, whom they wiſhed to confirm on his throne, and to make thoſe very principles triumphant, which they intended to exterminate.</p>
               <p>But, whatever may be thought of preceding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it cannot be denied that Great Britain did not join the confederacy, until the principles of Anarchy were triumphant in France; until that nation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048483_0007_10252FB351A3ABB8"/>
had avowed its project of diſſeminating them univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, and until it had actually commenced hoſtilities againſt States with which Great Britain had defenſive alliances. In juſtice to the Britiſh Government, this circumſtance ought not to be overlooked; nor ſhould we judge of <hi>the policy of its conduct, by the bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which has hitherto attended it;</hi> but by the actual ſituation of Europe, at the time when this country acceded to the confederacy; when the people were generally taught to look upon the French Revolution as realiſing every airy viſion of political happineſs; while in truth it menaced mankind with a far more dreadful ſcourge than that under which we now ſuffer. We ſhould revert to the time when, in very many countries, the people ſeemed advancing, from admiration of the French theories, to an impatience for putting them in practice. If, at ſo dangerous a moment, there were Stateſmen cool enough to reſiſt the general enthuſiaſm, who foreſaw the inevitable conſequence of thoſe theories, and, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, adopted the bold meaſure of drawing on their country towards an evil, diſtreſſing no doubt, but neither unuſual, nor without remedy, with a view to ſave it from the irreparable miſchief of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary anarchy—Stateſmen wiſe enough to rouſe that popular zeal in defence of ſocial order, which elſe might have been ſeduced to ſubvert it; perhaps the gratitude of future ages will be in proportion to the courage with which they have dared to oppoſe the clamours of the day.</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Reflections on Peace,</hi> however, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reproaches them for not knowing how to avoid the ſcourge of revolutionary principles, but by the ſcourge of war, inſtead of <hi>lowering all their ſails during the ſtorm.</hi> But before we decide whether it was beſt boldly to bear up againſt it, or to let the veſſel drive before it, at the mercy of the waves, the burſting out of the ſtorm ſhould be conſidered. This
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048483_0008_10252FBCEEA16890"/>
ſame writer calls it <hi>a new aera.</hi> It was indeed a time, when an unheard-of and moſt dangerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was zealouſly propagated with a ſort of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic parade, which faſcinated many even of the thinking part of the world; and when conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it became the duty of thoſe who foreſaw the miſchief, to give a contrary direction to popular enthuſiaſm. If this ſo-much-blamed war, for which the French gave ſuch juſtifying provocation, or, if you inſiſt upon it, ſo ſpecious a pretence, has kept their neighbours under the reſtraint of law, prevented turbulence by giving employment, and ſtrengthened the exiſting governments, by uniting in their defence thoſe active ſpirits, which elſe might have been united for their deſtruction:—if, which is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, this political peſtilence has already coſt France ten times more lives than all the nations of Europe together have loſt, in defending themſelves from it by war:—but beyond all other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if the Britiſh Conſtitution has triumphed, and will deſcend unchanged to poſterity;—I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that future ages will look on the ſacrifices of the preſent day, as <hi>ſignal benefits.</hi>—Bloody they are, no doubt, and calamitous; but infinitely leſs ſo than the <hi>poiſoned preſent</hi> of the revolutionary ſyſtem which the French have offered to the world.</p>
               <p>If it is ſaid that the nations which have not made ſuch bloody ſacrifices to internal tranquillity, have neither felt the miſchiefs of war, nor been infected with this revolutionary contagion; I would aſk what advantages thoſe nations which are within the graſp of France have found, from a diſpoſition to neutrality? Was it any ſecurity to Savoy, Holland, or the Palatinate? But waving what might be ſaid reſpecting them, I wiſh to conſider what has really been the ſituation of thoſe other neutral States (ſo excluſively <hi>fortunate</hi>) to which the war has not reached, whoſe <hi>wiſdom and happineſs</hi> is ſo greatly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:048483_0009_10252FCCB0C1AC98"/>
extolled; and which are ſet up as patterns of the only line of conduct which the belligent Powers ſhould have adopted, and as inſtances of the profound ſecurity which would have been the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Next to Denmark, the Author of the <hi>Reflections on Peace</hi> mentions <hi>Sweden,</hi> which, we are told, <hi>owes its tranquillity to the ſyſtem of neutrality adopted by the prudence of the Regent.</hi> And yet, in the midſt of this <hi>tranquil Neutrality,</hi> this very Regent has detected a <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> which he repreſents as <hi>atrocious,</hi> and as having put the <hi>independence and the quiet of Sweden</hi> in imminent danger. Is it forgotten that, in claiming from the Court of Naples, the perſon accuſed of contriving this conſpiracy, the Regent of Sweden, in December 1793, repreſented that, <hi>in this diſaſtrous epoch, when Europe is agitated from one end to the other, the Courts of it ought to guard their common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts more vigilantly than ever?</hi> It is whimſical enough that the Regent of Sweden, ſo much praiſed for <hi>not</hi> having joined with the reſt of Europe, to <hi>guard vigilantly thoſe common intereſts,</hi> ſhould actually have addreſſed this language to Naples, a Court which has made very conſiderable exertions in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe. It is ſtill more ſo, that a Prince who can plead it as an <hi>undeniable truth, that whoever protects traitors, expoſes himſelf to become the victim of their attempts,</hi> ſhould be at the head of affairs in a country, which, if it has not actually given mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary aſſiſtance to the French Regicides, has at leaſt, in very many other reſpects, contributed largely to their reſources. But what is more ſtrange than all is, that the kingdom, whoſe <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil neutrality</hi> M— extolls ſo much, is the only one which, during its Neutrality, has ſeen one of its Kings aſſaſſinated, and an <hi>atrocious conſpiracy</hi> contrived againſt his ſucceſſor.<note n="*" place="bottom">I know that the whole of this conſpiracy is not yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or at leaſt has not been laid before the public: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is impoſſible to ſay, how much of it is imputable to French principles; but who is bold enough to affirm that it would have taken place, even though the Regent had put the nation into a ſtate of defence? or to congratulate her on the tranquillity of her neutrality?</note>

I admit it, and I am very far from bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them; but if they profit by the loſſes of the Old World, what a riſk have they not run of being torn in pieces by its Anarchy! Among them too the Convention has ſent emiſſaries commiſſioned to drive, if poſſible, the Patriarch of the New World from his ſenatorial chair. They failed, indeed, in completing their infernal work; but they ſucceeded too well in kindling a civil war, and obliging parents to arm againſt their children; while, at moſt, the belligerent Powers of the Old World have only been obliged to arm againſt a foreign enemy. Who can conjecture what might have been the conſequences of this civil war, if Waſhington had not been alive, to give energy to law, to unite and arm the body of American Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, who, under his direction, readily ſubmitted to the painful duty of a fatiguing march againſt their miſguided countrymen? In America they found the neceſſity of pulling up by the roots theſe trees of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Liberty which French Anarchy was beginning to plant in its remoteſt foreſts. And yet we are coolly told <hi>that the neutral States have been very far from imitating the example of the French!</hi> and we are to infer, that a people ſeparated from them by the Straits of Dover has been to blame for providing effectually againſt a contagion malignant enough to reach beyond the Atlantic! But when we ſee that France has repaid the ſincere unarmed neutrality of the New World by inſtigating its inhabitants to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſuicide, we may judge what would have been the fate of the governments in her vicinity, if they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:048483_0011_10252FEFB2EAB2D0"/>
had remained unarmed and unprepared for reſiſtance. Yet, by a ſtrange injuſtice, though in England every ſeditious movement has been eaſily ſuppreſſed by a ſlight exertion of civil authority; and in America, neutral from intereſt and upon principle, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has been forced to raiſe on a ſudden no leſs than 16000 men, to ſuppreſs an inſurrection entirely owing to doctrines of anarchy diſſeminated by French emiſſaries; yet the Britiſh Cabinet, in the perſon of Mr. Pitt, is reproached <hi>with having perſuaded the people of property in England, that nothing but war could protect the Nation from the contagion of French politics.</hi>

               <p>But (continues the author, page 8) has not Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland, at the very doors of the French Revolution, avoided its introduction, and eſcaped the horrors of war, by a prudent neutrality? No; it is certain that their diſpoſition to maintain peace would not have ſaved them, but for the concurrence of ſome other very particular circumſtances. A war was actually undertaken againſt them, notwithſtanding their avowed neutrality, and they were at one time in the moſt imminent danger. The French Republic had ſent poſitive orders to their General, Monteſquiou, to invade Swiſſerland; but this was prevented, in the firſt inſtance, by the little State of Geneva, which adopted meaſures of reſiſtance, and became a barrier between the army of the Alps and the Pays de Vaud, till the Helvetic Body had time to arm itſelf. The French General, too, had virtue enough to protract the execution of his orders, and ſucceeded in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them to be revoked; but not without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to ruin himſelf rather than decline repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to his employers <hi>the great injuſtice and the danger of the war which they were kindling.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Undoubtedly theſe are reaſons why an imitation of the French Revolution need no longer be dreaded: but if from theſe declarations, which ſo ſtrongly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that France is verging towards a regular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are to conclude, that becauſe the original object of the war is nearly attained, we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately propoſe a peace, in order that the new leaders of the French may be in a ſituation to effect the reforms which are neceſſary; and that Europe may enjoy the quiet for which ſhe has been fighting, and which ſhe ſo anxiouſly deſires;—To thoſe who argue in this way I anſwer, that, in the firſt place, we ought to aſcertain whether the new French leaders do ſincerely wiſh for a general peace, and whether in fact they are not internally convinced that it will deſtroy their authority. But, beſides that they have never yet expreſſed ſuch a wiſh, even if they had expreſſed it, the only pledge we can have of the ſincerity of ſuch profeſſions, will be an offer to make a complete reſtitution of their conqueſts.</p>
               <p>This conſideration leads to another not leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant— Whether, even in that caſe, any engagements made by the Girondiſt party, who once more take the lead, can be depended on? The author of this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet was one of thoſe who negociated and ſigned, on the part of Geneva, the firſt treaty made by the French Republic; and can give evidence from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, how little the good faith of that Republic, or any engagement entered into by its Girondiſt leaders, can be truſted. This very Faction, after giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Miniſter full powers to negociate a treaty with the Geneveſe, waited till the latter had executed it on their part, and then coolly told them, <hi>they ought to have been aware that the only admiſſible treaty was a communication of principles. It remains to be conſidered</hi> (ſaid Briſſot in his report on this ſubject) <hi>whether a

                  <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <p>The practices of the French Republic to <hi>prepare</hi> a Revolution at Geneva are now no longer a <hi>ſecret;</hi> and before we accede to the opinion that ſhe may ſafely be treated with, the following ſeries of facts which they offer ſhould be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt, The preſent Convention refuſed to ratify a treaty with Geneva, made and ſigned in her name by a General inveſted with full powers for that purpoſe, and approved by the Miniſters.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, She pretended to give a colour for this abuſe of power by decreeing the arreſt of her Plenipotentiary, Monteſquiou, though the Miniſters declared that he had only acted according to their orders.</p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, To give additional effect to this unexampled abuſe of power, the Convention took care to wait till the treaty was not only ratified, but almoſt completely executed, on the part of Geneva; and till the retreat of the Swiſs troops which had advanced to their aſſiſtance left them deſtitute of defence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4thly, The French Republic had no other object, in ſubſtituting negociation for force, but to deceive and diſarm the allies of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva; and to put it out of their power to prevent that derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſocial order eſtabliſhed there, which ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to effect at any riſk.</p>
                     <p n="5">5thly, Her meaſures were diſguiſed by ſolemn treaties, which there is proof ſhe intended to violate, at the very moment ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them; and which were violated only to bring about a Revolution i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Geneva, more miſchievous in its conſequences than any that could have followed from war.</p>
                     <p n="6">6thly, If for ſo inconſiderable an object as that of ſubverting the limited Democracy of Geneva, the Republic of France, while yet in her infancy, and previous to her victories, did not ſcruple to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace herſelf by an open violation of her firſt treaty, made with the weakeſt of her neighbours: then let that State which of all her neighbours is the moſt formidable to her, and whoſe conſtitution ſhe has avowed it is eſſential to her intereſts to deſtroy; and which nevertheleſs is perſuaded to diſarm itſelf, and to rely on the faith of treaties—let that State firſt have ſome ſecurity, that the French Republic, under the government of the ſame party, though not with the ſame chiefs, will treat with more honour, and execute its treaties with more fidelity.</p>
                     <p>I repeat it, there is but one ſecurity which can be given for this, or which ought to be accepted; I mean, the immediate reſtitution of all her conqueſts.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Since we know that ſuch principles as theſe induced the Girondiſt party, which at that time was all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in France, to violate and annul the firſt treaty ſigned by the French Republic, <hi>it remains</hi> perhaps <hi>to be conſidered</hi> whether it would be wiſe to place implicit confidence in any new treaties which that party may now be diſpoſed to enter into, with any Government which does not (in their opinion) <hi>derive its authority immediately from the people.</hi> Conſidering however that circumſtances are now very much changed; and aware too that their conduct may differ according to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:048483_0018_1025307381CF64E8"/>
the magnitude of the object; I will admit that in the preſent ſtate of things we may confide in the ſincerity of the French Republic; but I ſtill deny that we can rely on the ſolidity of any peace, unleſs ſhe will gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee it by a reſtitution of all her conqueſts; and I muſt add, that nothing leſs than ſuch a reſtitution will reſtore the balance of power in Europe.</p>
               <p>Whatever our new Preceptors may pretend, this balance of power is the ſalvation of Europe: it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its tranquillity, preciſely in the ſame way that the balances of the Britiſh Conſtitution preſerve the liberties of the people: it protects weak nations from the uſurpations of powerful ones, and provides a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſecurity againſt the abuſe of ſtrength in a general coalition to repreſs it. This admirable equipoiſe of the forces of Europe has now been for two centuries the palladium of her civilization. Formed by it into one extenſive and wealthy confederation, ſhe has been ſaved from the devaſtations of ſavage invaders.—It is only ſince the adoption of this ſyſtem (accompanied and aſſiſted by the Reformation) that barbariſm has vaniſhed from Europe. Like Greece during a ſimilar equipoiſe among her Republics, ſhe has ſince that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:048483_0019_102530859D8C0E70"/>
period enjoyed in an eminent degree the bleſſings of ſocial order, and protection from oppreſſion; and has cultivated with unexampled ſucceſs, the arts of which peace is the parent, and the ſciences of which ſhe is the nurſe. Favoured by this ſyſtem, the nations of Europe were hourly acquiring knowledge, freedom, and happineſs, when this new philoſophy appeared, to tell them that they were ignorant and ſuperſtitious ſlaves. It is nevertheleſs this equipoiſe of force that has given Europe ſuch a decided ſuperiority over the other two great diviſions of the ancient world, which though in many reſpects more favoured by nature, yet will never emerge from their preſent abject condition, until ſome diviſions of power are eſtabliſhed among them; ſome federal ſyſtem, adapted to their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which can ſecure them from conqueſt, and protect the independence of the weak from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtrong.</p>
               <p>Let us calculate, if poſſible, all the advantages which Europe has derived from this ſyſtem ſince the treaty of Weſtphalia, and then eſtimate the miſeries which ſhe brought upon herſelf by neglecting it when Louis XIV. firſt began his enterpriſes. Can any one who conſiders the ſubject, believe that the war which ravaged almoſt all Europe about a century ago, would ever have taken place, if in 1667 (the period of the firſt attack by Louis XVI.) the parties to the treaty of Weſtphalia had underſtood their true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts well enough to ſee, that then was the moment to unite againſt the ambition of France? The exertions which might have effectually ſtopped Louis in the beginning of his career, and compelled him to retreat within his own territories, would have been nothing in compariſon of the ſacrifices which they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vards obliged to make, merely to prevent him from paſſing the new boundary to which his firſt enterpriſe enabled him to extend his dominions.</p>
               <p>Who will deny that the French Republic is now what Louis XVI. was in 1667, with the ſame over-bearing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:048483_0020_1025308CEDC168D0"/>
temper, the ſame thirſt of dominion, the ſame paſſion for aggrandiſement? Who does not ſhudder at the proſpect of the torrents of blood which muſt ſlow for an age to come, if, by ceding to this military Republic any portion of its immenſe conqueſts, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate it with the ambitious deſire of increaſing them hereafter; or if we adopt the immoral policy of yielding at preſent, with the ſecret intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the conteſt at a more favourable opportunity?</p>
               <p>The reſtitution of her conqueſts—of all of them without exception, muſt be the only baſis of a ſolid peace; and now that the fury of the revolutionary ſtorm is ſo much abated, the ultimate object of the war, an object which Europe and Great-Britain ſhould never loſe ſight of, is to preſerve in full force the confederation of Weſtphalia. I do not heſitate to ſay that if the greater part of the allied Powers ſhould be puſillanimous enough to wiſh to purchaſe leave to retain what they have remaining, by finally abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they have loſt; ſtill the ſolemn engagements of Great-Britain, her dignity, and her intereſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of her to exert all the authority which ſhe derives from her preponderance in the alliance, in prevailing on them not to betray their own cauſe; and, under any circumſtances, to employ her whole force in defending it.</p>
               <p>But poſſibly her Allies, fatigued with the conteſt, may ſay, "If the French Republic perſiſt in refuſing to reſtore her conqueſts, muſt we have no alternative; but be obliged to allow her an opportunity of adding to them, by prolonging a war which has already given her ſo many provinces, and added ſo much to her reſources for purſuing it with increaſing ſucceſs?"</p>
               <p>As to her reſources, they no longer exiſt, or, at any rate, muſt very ſoon be totally exhauſted. It is upon this circumſtance that Europe ſhould fix its attention; for it inevitably leads to a complete reſtitution of the provinces which have been loſt.

of her enemies is abated, and the war differs from former wars in theſe reſpects only: 1ſt, That the German States complain of being exhauſted before they have ſuffered a third part of what the ſeven-years war coſt them; 2dly, That the French, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into action the whole of their reſources at once, and puſhing on with their national impetuoſity, have hitherto been irreſiſtible; and 3dly, That as to the relative ſituation of the conquerors and the conquered, the former are infinitely more exhauſted than the latter.</p>
               <p>If there be a political truth, which the hiſtory of modern Europe puts out of all controverſy, it is this: that every war is now more or leſs a war of finance, invariably terminating to the diſadvantage of that Power whoſe pecuniary reſources are ſooneſt exhauſted. The great Frederic learned this axiom from his father, never loſt ſight of it, and owed to it all his ſucceſs. If we read his works, we ſhall find, that it was only by an admirable management of his revenues, and by his care to have always new reſources in reſerve, that he was able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, for ſeven ſucceſſive years, and at laſt to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate with glory, a conteſt full of diſaſters, and during which his enemies overran the whole of his dominions. When at laſt he obliged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and to reſtore all that they had taken from him, it was becauſe they felt an inability to perſiſt in the war, the neceſſary conſequence of exhauſted reſources; while, with a foreſight which ſecured ſucceſs, the great abilities of Frederic had been directed as much to recruit his treaſures as his armies.</p>
               <p>It is true, that when the means of war altogether depended on the accumulation of treaſure, its duration might be more eaſily be calculated beforehand than now, that nations have diſcovered the dangerous ſecret of charging its expences on unborn gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:048483_0022_102530A756BCA5F0"/>
by additional debts. But ſtill, if, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the ſtrength of contending Powers, we add to their exiſting reſources, thoſe which are derived from credit, we may foretell with ſufficient certainty which of them will ultimately be the moſt powerful, and conſequently which has the beſt reaſon to expect ſucceſs from perſeverance. In the preſent war, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before a thought is admitted on the part of the Allies of buying a peace by ſacrifices, which muſt neceſſarily render it inſecure; before we give way to deſpondency, we ſhould examine whether our antagoniſt is not much nearer the end of his treaſures and his credit than we are; whether the diſtreſs reſulting from this circumſtance does not more than counterbalance any victory in the field; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſpite of his wide-extended acquiſitions, he is not on the point of being in a ſituation to ſay with Pyrrhus, <hi>One victory more, and I am undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An object then at preſent of the greateſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is to compare the military reſources, or, which in truth is the ſame thing, the finances and the credit of France with thoſe of Great Britain; for it is from ſuch a compariſon only that we can decide whether the latter ought to make any conceſſion for the ſake of peace.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That at preſent the only Reſource of France is her Aſſignats, on which even her future military exertions muſt excluſively depend; which are depreciating with a continually accelerating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and in a ſhort time muſt inevitably be of no value whatever.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Author of the <hi>Reflections on Peace</hi> begins with the following bold aſſertion: <q>The whole power of the French Revolution conſiſts in the art of exciting popular enthuſiaſm, and directing it to political pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</q> Page 1, line 1.</p>
               <p>This (though aſſumed, and afterwards relied on as a fundamental propoſition) I muſt deny without any heſitation. In the commencement of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution it might be true, but has long ſince ceaſed to be ſo: for, admitting that popular enthuſiaſm, with liberty for its object, was the inſtrument employed to overturn the French Monarchy, and to repel the attempts of the Combined Powers to reſtore it; yet the republican ſyſtem which ſucceeded it, could neither have been founded nor ſupported ſo long, but by a cauſe more ſimple, more durable, and more unremittingly active:—I mean ſelf-intereſt, which has been ſtimulated by the invention of aſſignats. In them, and in them only, conſiſts at preſent <hi>all the power of the French Revolution.</hi> It is by them that it has ſucceeded in bribing every perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. By ſtipends to civil officers, who are
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:048483_0024_102530C23A72A968"/>
every one preachers of the new-faſhioned doctrines, it has ſucceeded in ſpreading them to every corner of France. Even its foreign conqueſts are merely to be attributed to the aſſignats, which have hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for 1,200,000 ſoldiers; and no doubt ſo extraordinary a number muſt neceſſarily have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced extraordinary effects. If the conqueſts of the French Republic have been three times as extenſive as thoſe of Louis XIV. it is becauſe the aſſignats have enabled it to maintain armies three times as numerous.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the truth of this we have the following confirmations in the Convention, by Cambon, Feb. 8, 1795.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The nation is under great obligations to the Conſtituent Aſſembly for the creation of aſſignats. This territorial money has very much aſſiſted the Revolution, by bringing into circulation the value of the national domains, by enabling us to proviſion, equip, and maintain armies to the amount of <hi>1200,000</hi> men, to create fleets, to cultivate the lands for ſaltpetre! to manufacture arms, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This ſame Cambon, who remarked</hi> that a fifth part of the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive population of France had been engaged in the common defence, <hi>exclaimed on the 23d of November laſt, in this ſame Convention.</hi> Some of my colleagues have ſaid, that the economical ſyſtem of Louis XIV. ſhould be adopted; who, when he had to contend againſt a coalition of Powers, ſpent no more than <hi>219</hi> millions (<hi>9</hi> millions ſterl.) a year, while the expences of the preſent war are almoſt ten times as great; <hi>meaning to inſinuate that the Convention ſquanders the wealth of the nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> What we have to conſider is, whether the reſources of France have not been waſted with infinitely greater profuſion; and whether ſhe is not, in this reſpect, on the eve of a cataſtrophe, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably more violent than that which ſhe experienced in the beginning of this century; and whether ſhe will be able much longer to delay this cataſtrophe, by delaying the total depreciation of her paper money.</p>
               <p>So long as the aſſignats were iſſued in any ſort of proportion to the confiſcations which were pledged for them, they had a real value, and the project was greatly ſucceſsful. But from the time that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, intoxicated by a diſcovery ſo unexpected,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:048483_0025_102530D0AFAA7BF0"/>
and by means ſo immenſe, began to employ itſelf in contriving pretences for new wars, in order to bring them into action; when it began to work this rich mine, as if abſolutely inexhauſtible; every intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent obſerver foreſaw the rapid and complete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation of its produce. The calculation that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could prolong the exiſtence of aſſignats beyond two or three years, has indeed proved erroneous; but it has proved ſo, merely becauſe it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conjecture that ſuch extraordinary means would be adopted for ſupporting them; and that Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre would come forward to prop them up, when tottering, by his two additional projects of ſpoliation and terror.</p>
               <p>His proceſs is well known. He began by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which ſeized all the ſpecie that could be found, of every ſort, and paid for it with aſſignats. He then impoſed the <hi>Law of the Maximum,</hi> and that of <hi>Requiſitions;</hi> meaſures which, ſo long as they could be borne, gave this new money a forced circulation, and a pretended value. But as decrees ſo oppreſſive could not be enforced without having innumerable officers and informers,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following extract from a ſpeech of Cambon's, on the 4th of November, will give ſome idea of the expence incurred by Robeſpierre's ſyſtem of terror.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Government was formed which coſt</hi> 591 <hi>millions</hi> (almoſt 25 millions ſterling) <hi>annually, merely in inſpection. Immediately the huſbandmen and manufacturers left their uſual occupations, which made them uſeful citizens, to become members of Revolutionary Committees, where they had nothing to do, and by which they enjoyed a ſort of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and received five livres a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> to compel the people to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, he met the difficulties reſulting from this multiplication of expence, by contriving a new ſecurity for new emiſſions of aſſignats.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe the ſyſtem of terror was adopted in its fulleſt extent, merely as a meaſure of finance, in which view Robeſpierre undoubtedly conſidered it; and ſuch was the ſucceſs of his horrible proſcriptions,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:048483_0026_102530DDCFE69268"/>
that in ſome inſtances the very ſame eſtates have actually been three times confiſcated and ſold again. The aſſignats iſſued were but a ſort of bills of exchange, drawn on the Revolutionary Tribunal, and paid by the Guillotine, which Robeſpierre is ſaid to have called <hi>an engine for coining money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this way, as ſoon as the inferior and ſubaltern robbers of their country were grown rich enough to be worth plundering, the Guillotine transferred their wealth to the State, and furniſhed the ſecurity wanted for new emiſſions of aſſignats: this ſanguinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance had the deſired effect on the infatuated mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who imagined that their value would not alter, at leaſt in the interior of the Republic, as long as they could find any demagogues to load with riches one day, and to plunder on the next. It was by this terrible round of confiſcations, dilapidations of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic wealth, executions, and emiſſions of new paper, that the credit of the aſſignats was ſupported for more than a year, and the Republic was actually enabled to proviſion her fourteen armies at a cheaper rate, though with paper money, than the Allies could their forces with ſpecie. To produce this political miracle, coſt Robeſpierre nothing more than a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that half the property of France was to change its owners by violent means.</p>
               <p>However, thoſe who were thus enriched, not finding themſelves at all more ſecure than thoſe who were ſuffered to retain their property, began of courſe to unite with them for the deſtruction of a tyrant equally dangerous to both: almoſt a year elapſed before the object could be gained; but at laſt he, in his turn, was dragged to execution; and by his death began a new epoch in the hiſtory of aſſignats.</p>
               <p>Every preceding faction, however atrocious its meaſures, had been regularly ſupplanted by another propoſing meaſures ſtill more atrocious; but as it was impoſſible to go beyond Robeſpierre in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:048483_0027_1024A539B2A46E88"/>
cruelty, thoſe who ſupplanted him had no way to ſecure themſelves, but by promiſing to be more moderate; and particularly they found themſelves obliged to begin with aboliſhing the law of the <hi>Maximum,</hi> and leaving the Guillotine which had ſupported it, without employment.</p>
               <p>But though they could not but know that the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>maximum</hi> muſt be fatal to the aſſignats, yet they never once dreamt of propoſing a general peace; though it was the only meaſure which was likely to prevent further depreciation, by making further emiſſions unneceſſary. They obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in carrying on the war, though they were no longer able to fix the currency, or to keep up the value of the aſſignats, which they were obliged to iſſue for its expence.</p>
               <p>From that time their relative value has fallen, and muſt continue to fall in the compound ratio of the depreciation of the exiſting maſs (already much greater than can be brought into circulation), and of its continual augmentation. Nor is this all—for their depreciation is advancing with a rapidity continually and inevitably accelerated by this very ſimple cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that the lower thoſe which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready iſſued fall in one month, to the greater nominal amount muſt new ones be iſſued in the next, in order to defray equal expences; and the Convention can only bear up againſt the effect of their preſent progreſſive diminution of value, by means which haſten their ruin. By increaſing the quantity which they iſſue in one month, they condemn themſelves to iſſue a ſtill greater quantity in the next. I appeal, for the truth of this, to the laſt monthly report of their expenditure which we are acquainted with, that of <hi>Nivoſe,</hi> which, though by no means a time of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral military operations, coſt near eighteeen millions of pounds ſterling, almoſt twice as much as the month

                  </gap>ers of the Convention have taken to double their own ſalaries, which was done the 13th of laſt Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary. The principle on which they did it is juſt; and indeed, as Cambon obſerved at the time, the ſame principle might have allowed them to increaſe the ſum almoſt fourfold; becauſe, even then, the aſſignats were at a diſcount of no leſs than 73 per cent. No wonder then that, ten days after, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention found itſelf obliged to decree the ſame aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of pay to thoſe in all other civil employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it is rather ſurpriſing, that it has hitherto refrained from doubling in the ſame way the pay of its fourteen armies; and it would be ſtill more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, if it could avoid a progreſſive increaſe of all the ſalaries, according to the progreſſive depreciation of its paper money.</p>
               <p>The law of the <hi>maximum,</hi> and its train of terrors, gave an artificial credit to the aſſignats; and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when the Convention was reduced to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking away this only ſupport of them, their fall was proportionably rapid. The people no ſooner began to perceive this, than an unbounded ſpirit of jobbing ſhewed itſelf with reſpect to every ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, to every thing which could poſſibly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for paper; and this ſpirit has extended to every part of France, and to the loweſt claſſes of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Boiſſy d'Anglas repreſents this very forcibly to the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a ſpeech of the 3d of March.</hi> At a time when objects of commerce fail, and when requiſitions, pre-emptions, arbitrary regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of prices, and the abſurd law of the maximum, have diſcouraged cultivation, the citizens are irreſiſtibly led to ſpeculations which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an unbounded deſire of gain, and inſtead of commerce are mere gaming.</note> Goods of all ſorts changing their owners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day and every hour, are each time ſold for more and more aſſignats. Avarice cannot reſiſt the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:048483_0029_1025310617C2AFF8"/>
temptation of ſelling, for perhaps 150 livres, what a few days before coſt but 100; and yet theſe 150 livres are hardly in the pocket, before their value is ſo much fallen, as to make it an object to part with them again as ſoon as poſſible for ſomething elſe, whoſe value will riſe in proportion to their depreciation.</p>
               <p>It is true, that in the neutral towns, and on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of France, the diſcredit of the aſſignats has by no means been ſo rapid as in the interior; but the reaſon is obvious. In thoſe places they had before a regular exchange for ſpecie, the courſe of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon commercial opinion, uncontrouled by the <hi>maximum,</hi> or the <hi>guillotine;</hi> and inſtead of a forced value, they were previouſly ſubject to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which varied according to circumſtances. But as the exchange of aſſignats on the frontiers is the only rule to eſtimate their former value, or to gueſs at their future diſcredit, it is enough to obſerve, that between the 24th of January, and the 24th of March, 1795, they fell one half in Swiſſerland; having been at a diſcount, which, during that period, progreſſively increaſed from 80 to 90 per cent.; ſo that, in the ſhort ſpace of two months, they fell from a fifth to a tenth only of their original value.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of this rapidly progreſſive depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation muſt be obvious to every one; ſince there cannot be a doubt but, if they continue to fall at the rate of 50 per cent. every two months, in a very ſhort time the aſſignats now in circulation will not be worth the trouble and expence of iſſuing them. But ſuppoſe this event can be delayed to the end of the preſent year, or even beyond it, in the preſent ſtate of things it muſt inevitably h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>en; and when it does happen, I aſk what poſſible reſource the Republic will have for the preſervation of its conqueſts, and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion neceſſary for the numerous armies which maintain thoſe conqueſts; and which no longer conſiſt of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers and enthuſiaſts, but of forced levies, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:048483_0030_10253119A3C2D4B8"/>
mere diſciplined mercenaries. Its only ſtep muſt be to diſband its armies before they mutiny for want of pay, to reſtore its conqueſts before the troops deſert them, and offer a peace before they are compelled to ſue for it from abſolute neceſſity: ſo that a reſtitution of all the conqueſts made by the Republic, and a ſolid and laſting peace, muſt ſpeedily be the conſequence of the rapid and inevitable fall of the aſſignats, if the Allies will but have patience and ſteadineſs enough to wait the event without relaxing their military exertions.</p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>if the Allies have but ſteadineſs enough to wait the event without relaxing their military exertions;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is evident that the progreſſive fall of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignats ariſes principally from the neceſſity of iſſuing new ones. But ſince this neceſſity muſt continue as long as the war laſts, and muſt be urgent in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the exertions which the French are obliged to counteract, it ſeems evident, that the annihilation of this, their only remaining reſource for carrying on the war, or preſerving their conqueſts, will be the ſooner effected, in proportion as the co-operation of the Allied Powers is more active and perſevering; and that every one of thoſe Powers which withdraws itſelf from the confederation, poſtpones this total bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, in proportion as the Republic, by being able to leſſen its expences, is in a leſſer degree obliged to accelerate its own ruin by iſſuing new aſſignats. The defection, however, of ſome of the Allies can do no more than poſtpone this event, which it is impoſſible to avoid, but by a general peace, the only meaſure which can put an end to the neceſſity of new emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and till that neceſſity is at an end, no attempt to ſupport the credit of the exiſting aſſignats can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I know that, in reply to this reaſoning, it will be ſaid, that however ſeemingly well founded it may be, yet unhappily experience has conſtantly proved its falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:048483_0031_1025312CE7D6E210"/>
ſince France, far from being obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax her efforts, has hitherto from time to time found means to double them; and has alſo doubled her triumphs, in conſequence of this increaſing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But let us not loſe ſight of the circumſtance that it is preciſely this reduplication of her efforts which accelerates their termination. If thoſe who conſidered this ſubject four years ago were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in anticipating this event, it was becauſe they could not poſſibly take into the calculation the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate meaſures adopted by Robeſpierre; meaſures, not at all tending to prevent it; but only to make it ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately more dreadful, in conſequence of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſuſpenſion.

This infernal prodigy in the French Revolution never can be repeated; even the Nero of France, with his legion of executioners, did not make it laſt longer than fourteen months; and I am not afraid to aſſert that it would have been a thouſand times more eaſy for him to have prolonged its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence another year, than for his ſucceſſors, who owed their elevation to the abolition of it, to revive it for a ſingle day.</p>
               <p>I may alſo be told that Robeſpierre has left them an immenſe fund in the eſtates which, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confiſcated, have not hitherto been ſold, and which are a ſufficient ſecurity for new emiſſions of aſſignats. I know that ſuch has been their boaſt, and that in the beginning of this year they had the aſſurance to aſſert that there remained ſecurity enough for 6 or 8 milliards (250 to 330 millions ſterling) of new paper-money.</p>
               <p>But we want no better proof of the falſehood of ſuch an aſſertion than this, that, preciſely at the time when it was made, the aſſignats began to fall more rapidly than ever.

from public confidence—2dly, Their reign by the influence of the <hi>maximum</hi> and of terror—and 3dly, Their diſcredit after the repeal of the <hi>maximum</hi>—it is now time to advert to the fourth Act of this Drama, beyond a doubt the moſt important, becauſe it leads us to the cataſtrophe.</p>
               <p>I have already ſaid that Robeſpierre not having been able to ſupport himſelf but by the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the moſt flagrant injuſtice, his ſucceſſors had in fact no way of ſecuring themſelves but by abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely oppoſite meaſures: of any ſuch meaſures the ſafeſt for them was an union with the Federaliſts, whoſe faction, though it had been cruſhed and diſperſed by Robeſpierre, was ſtill both numerous and powerful. As a meaſure of party, nothing could be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than this union; but it muſt be allowed too that nothing could be more deſtructive to the aſſignats: for it was clearly impoſſible for the then prevailing members of the Convention to procure the ſupport of the Federaliſts, without reſtoring the vaſt poſſeſſions they had been deprived of.</p>
               <p>The decree for this reſtitution did not paſs without violent debates for ſeveral days. Duhem exclaimed, that <hi>this firſt reſtitution would aſſaſſinate the country, and be a decree of counter-revolution;</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">March 20, 1795.</note> others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that, in conſequence of it, the aſſignats would loſe the little value they ſtill retained; and that <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the whole of their property to the families which had been plundered, would be to reduce the public wealth to nothing. Public wealth,</hi> replied Boiſſy d'Anglas, <hi>built on private poverty, is a barbarous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm, invented in the ferocious den of the Jacobins, who have offered to your creditors as a ſecurity, eſtates which they well knew they had no right to mortgage.</hi> At laſt, when one of the Deputies, alarmed at the meaſure, aſked how they ſhould pay the expences of

the war. <hi>We are not at preſent,</hi> exclaimed Charrier, <hi>to enquire how the expence of the war ſhall be paid, but to do juſtice. We are to prove to the people of other States, that the Convention does not maſſacre her victims for the ſake of their wealth, as the governments</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">The next note will ſhew that Boiſſy d'Anglas went further, and had candour enough to vindicate the Governments in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this accuſation of Charrier's.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Induced by this eloquence, and by ſome reſpect for thoſe principles of equity which it had ſo long tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, at laſt, on the 20th of March, the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion decreed a <hi>ſuſpenſion of ſale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as a preliminary ſtep to a reſtitution of the property of all perſons condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the revolutionary tribunals of Robeſpierre.</p>
               <p>It was not however ſo much a returning ſenſe of juſtice which occaſioned this decree, as neceſſity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from a multitude of irreſiſtible cauſes, which continue to operate, and will, ſooner or later, bring on the reſtitution of the property of at leaſt one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of emigrants.<note n="§" place="bottom">

And to what purpoſe will the merchants and manufacturers be recalled, without reſtoring to them the means of carrying on their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment?</p>
               <p>Let it not be imagined that the Convention was taken by ſurpriſe, when they paſſed this important decree, and that, upon finding the total depreciation of the aſſignats attributed to it, that Aſſembly will be tempted to revoke it. They were perfectly well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed beforehand of this, which had been predicted with much force, by Le Cointre, ſo long ago as the 10th of laſt December. <hi>I now aſk you,</hi> (ſaid he to his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues) <hi>what will become of public credit, if you take but one ſtep backward reſpecting property judicially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, and applied to the uſe of the Republic?—What will become of the Finances?—In what a ſituation will you find yourſelves?—Confidence will be at an end; and where in that caſe will you find purchaſers?—If, with reſpect to the property in your hands, you but once look

back wards!—but I check myſelf—I leave you to your reflections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely the time when they were <hi>looking forward</hi> to theſe confiſcations, was the time when Le Cointre ſhould have awakened <hi>the reflections</hi> of his colleague Robeſpierre. It is not the decree of the 20th of March which has <hi>deſtroyed the aſſignats,</hi> by reſtoring <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions that the State had no right to mortgage,</hi> and which it could not poſſibly retain any longer: but it was Robeſpierre, who, acquiring thoſe poſſeſſions by <hi>rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> in order to have ſecurity for new aſſignats, and then waſting theſe new aſſignats to extend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the Republic—it was Robeſpierre <hi>that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed a Counter-revolution, and aſſaſſinated the Republic:</hi> for at preſent I do not ſcruple to aſſert that it will periſh, as the Monarchy periſhed, BY THE RUIN OF HER FINANCES.</p>
               <p>It is to no purpoſe that the greater part of thoſe who have ſucceeded Robeſpierre, perſiſt in attempting to deceive their countrymen, and Europe;—to no purpoſe that they ſtill talk of ten or twelve milliards (4 or 500 millions ſterling) which they pretend the property of the emigrants will produce, and which, they would perſuade the world, is a ſecurity enough to redeem all the aſſignats in exiſtence, and all that they may have occaſion to iſſue. They themſelves well know that nothing can be more untrue; for by their own calculations it may be proved, that all the confiſcations which remain unſold are really not worth a fourth part of ſuch a ſum.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Johannot, who ſeems to have more integrity than any other perſon who has had the management of the Revolutionary finances, in his report on that ſubject, of the 22d of December, ſays, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their amount may be, yet the ſecurity for them is much greater. Accurate calculations prove that this ſecurity is more than</hi> 15 <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liards</hi> (i. e. more than 625000,000 ſterling). <hi>The yearly income of the national property which remains unſold, is about</hi> 300,000,000 (12,500,000 ſterling), <hi>which, eſtimated at forty years purchaſe, the current price of that property, gives a real value of</hi> 12 <hi>milliards</hi> (500,000,000); <hi>which, with the eſtates not let, and the unproductive property, (both together at leaſt worth two milliards) and one milliard which will revert to the nation by eſtates that would have deſcended to emigrants, form an actual value of</hi> 15 <hi>milliards</hi> (625,000,000). <hi>Never had any paper-money ſo ſolid a baſe!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I undertake to meaſure <hi>this baſe,</hi> I preſume I ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to lay out of the account the two milliards <hi>at which eſtates not let, and unproductive property, are valued;</hi> and to reaſon merely upon Johannot's aſſertion, that laſt December the amount of the annual income of the confiſcated eſtates which were not ſold, was <hi>about</hi> 300,000,000 (12,500,000). Now admitting this eſtimate as true, we have a tolerably accurate rule to value the capital of thoſe 300,000,000 of income by, not in aſſignats, which ſoon will have no exiſtence, but in ſpecie.</p>
                     <p>Every one knows that formerly, in France, landed property ſold from about 28 to 30 years purchaſe; and it will not be diſputed, but that while ſo great a maſs of it is in the market, it muſt be difficult to find buyers who will go beyond 25 years purchaſe in ſpecie. But in fact, it will be impoſſible to find them at that price: 1ſt, becauſe the rent itſelf is eſtimated by aſſignats; 2dly, becauſe a great part of this property is in houſes, which are every day fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to decay; 3dly, becauſe we know, from the ingenuous confeſſion of Cambon, on the 28th of February, <hi>that eſtates are ruined if they remain in the hands of the Republic; and if ſold, intriguers take care to be the beſt bidders, and, as ſoon as they get poſſeſſion, ſell the timber, ſtrip the eſtate, and when the ſecond payment ſhould be made, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is obliged to ſell them again at the exorbitant loſs occaſioned by theſe dilapidations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee then by theſe recent acknowledgements, that it is theſe <hi>intriguing</hi> purchaſers which have enabled the Convention to boaſt of the enormous prices given for national property; and of which circumſtance it has from time to time made ſuch a parade; taking care however not to mention their being left on hand, and reſold at <hi>an exorbitant loſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I believe, when theſe circumſtances are conſidered, no one will diſpute with me, but that, if even the Republic ſhould be ſettled, and all the confiſcated eſtates ſhould remain at her diſpoſal, it will hardly be able to get more for them than even twenty years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in ſpecie, if calculated upon the rent paid in aſſignats; a price which, in ſpecie, it is now very improbable they can ever bring. But ſuppoſing it ſhould be able to ſell them at this price, the whole of them would not fetch more than 6 milliards (250 millions ſterling). Now, from theſe 6 milliards in ſpecie, for which at preſent we hypothetically admit that the eſtates let for 300,000,000 currency may be ſold, we muſt in the firſt place deduct the immenſe reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to the Federaliſts and others, conformably to the decree paſſed on the 20th of laſt March: and though, to leſſen the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to this decree, thoſe who propoſed it, affected to aſſert that theſe reſtitutions would not amount to more than one milliard (41,666,666), I apprehend that the confiſcations during the tyranny of Robeſpiere, may, without the leaſt exaggeration, be computed at a third of the property which laſt December remained unſold; particularly when we are informed by the lateſt news-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers from Paris, that, in the month of April, the Committe of Finance propoſed <hi>an abſolute reſtitution of the property of all but the Emigrants;</hi> ſo that, after this deduction, only two-thirds of the whole ſum, or 4 milliards, remain.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe 4 milliards, muſt be paid the immenſe debts of the Emigrants, debts which <hi>the State is charged with,</hi> by a decree of the Convention, made January 1, 1795. And as Cambon decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at that time, that the Emigrants had not fewer than about <hi>a million of creditors;</hi> and as the Committee of Finances has ſince eſtimated thoſe debts at 1 milliard 800,000,000 of livres; this will reduce what remains to the State to ſomething more than two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liards.</p>
                     <p>With theſe two milliards, it has to pay all the aſſignats now in circulation; and which, if Cambon may be believed, amounted to 6 milliards 400 millions, ſo long ago as the 4th of laſt Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and which, notwithſtanding ſome of them have ſince been taken out of circulation, yet, by the additions that have ſince been made, cannot now amount to leſs than 8 or 9 milliards. It has alſo to pay all the new aſſignats which muſt be iſſued as long as the war laſts: and who can calculate the amount to which, in conſequence of depreciation, they muſt be iſſued by next December, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Beſides all this, before the maſs of aſſignats can be redeemed, proviſion ought to be made for the annuities purchaſed during the monarchy, which amount to about 100,000,000 a year (more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Suppoſing this debt to be paid with a daſh of the pen, yet it will not be quite ſo eaſy to ſtrike out the great promiſes which have been made to a million of ſoldiers, for whom the Committee of Finance propoſes to reſerve a milliard, as the reward of their ſervices. Nor is this all; for a conſideration more preſſing than any even of theſe is, to repair what Echaſſeriaux <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Let their tranſient Republic continue then, if it will, to inſcribe on its new aſſignats the pompous phraſe of NATIONAL DOMAINS: no intelligent perſon can help ſubſtituting inſtead of it this alarming acknowledgement:—<hi>Exhauſted Finances!—Security overloaded!—Reſtitution begun!—New emiſſions of Paper!—and continued Depreciation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I preſume a further explanation would be unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to ſhew the way in which each effect of this
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:048483_0040_1025328F2C0B9E98"/>
continued depreciation of aſſignats, becomes, in its turn, a cauſe accelerating their ruin, which muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with increaſing rapidity, that nothing can check but a general peace. I would willingly believe that the preſent leaders of the Revolution have more integrity than their predeceſſors; but, as I cannot believe that they have greater ability, I am convinced they cannot diſcover any other way of carrying on the war than by new emiſſions of depreciated aſſignats. I defy them to give any ſort of permanent value to that immenſe maſs which has been iſſued, but by a general peace; or to put off much longer the day when their people, wearied with miſery, will compel them to abandon all projects of aggrandiſement, and to ſacrifice all their conqueſts, for ſo neceſſary an object; eſpecially if Great-Britain will but honourably perſiſt in rejecting any overture which does not propoſe a complete reſtitution of all the French conqueſts, as a prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary article.</p>
               <p>Some perſons however, either intereſted in miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the queſtion, or poſſibly deceived by the quackery of the French Committee of Finance, ſeem to imagine that ſome or other of the viſionary ſchemes which that Committee either entertains, or wiſhes its conſtituents to entertain, may be practicable—ſchemes <hi>which are to bring back the aſſignats into the public trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury by means purely voluntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then, as to the idea of Johannot, in a report of the 12th of laſt December, <hi>that the value of the mortgaged property increaſes in exact proportion to the multiplication of aſſignats, and that it is to this conſtant inverted ratio between the value of the republican money, and that of the national property, that the French are indebted for thoſe inexhauſtible reſources, which have aſtoniſhed Europe, and have prepared the means of triumph for fourteen armies.</hi> But I muſt deny that there has been ſuch a <hi>conſtant inverted ratio</hi> between the fall of the aſſignats, and the riſe in the price of national property. If this progreſſion had exiſted at the time when Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannot
<pb facs="unknown:048483_0041_102532A600869908"/>
made this report, aſſignats being then at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of about 75 per cent. or only a fourth of their firſt value, eſtates paid for in aſſignats would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have ſold at four times the uſual price: one, for inſtance, which at thirty years purchaſe, (the uſual value before the war) would have ſold for 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> in ſpecie, would laſt December have ſold for 6000<abbr>l.</abbr> in aſſignats. But in the ſame ſpeech, he ſays, that the national domains ſell at only forty years purchaſe; ſo that, by his own acknowledgement, the value of eſtates had only riſen a fourth, while that of aſſignats had fallen three fourths.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly ſome perſons may attribute this aſtoniſhing fall of the aſſignats, not to their want of a real value, but ſolely <hi>to the quantity of this repreſentative of wealth, multiplied in ſuch a degree, as to deſtroy all proportion between it and the objects which it repreſents;</hi>

               <p>It is now five months ſince this object engaged the attention of the Committee of Finance, and that they declared ſuch a diminution indiſpenſable: but after having preſented report upon report, and project upon project, all that they have really done, has been to increaſe the enormous maſs of aſſignats, by forcing almoſt as many new ones into circulation as they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to withdraw from it.

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:048483_0042_102532BE0BA23DB0"/>
Cambon obſerved, that the loſſes by the law of the <hi>maximum</hi> had been too great to allow of entertaining ſuch a project; and as to <hi>revolutionary taxes,</hi> he avowed ingenuouſly on the 3d of February, that the forced loan of about a milliard (about 41 millions ſterling) had only produced between 180 and 200 millions (about 8 millions ſterling). A ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcation, eſpecially when we recollect that it was while the ſyſtem of terror was in its full force!</p>
               <p>A ſecond project was a lottery of four milliards (about 165 millions ſterling), which was to induce the holders of aſſignats to bring them into the public treaſury, on receiving inſtead of them, in the ſhape of prizes, effects which the Republic found itſelf unable to ſell in any other way. But then, ſaid Cambon, <hi>we muſt offer ſome premium</hi>—and he calculated that by allowing 10 per cent. it would coſt the nation 390 millions, and an annual intereſt of 131 millions.— A curious way of relieving the finances! Beſides, whether as a lottery or as a tontine, the project is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for either the purchaſe of tickets muſt be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, in which caſe a ſecurity would be expected for their value, that does not exiſt; or elſe this reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of aſſignats muſt be effected by force, and, far from improving the credit of any new emiſſions, would only be evidence of their fate.</p>
               <p>The third of Cambon's projects was <hi>a forced reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nominal value of aſſignats</hi>—But, ſaid he, very candidly, if we arbitrarily reduce the value of thoſe already in exiſtence, what credit will the new emiſſions have? We ſhould find it <hi>abſolutely impoſſible to carry on the war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Force, however, is by no means neceſſary to bring about this reduction of value. The <hi>bankruptcy</hi> is

begun, and wants no decree to complete it: the only difference is, that it will not be openly confeſſed, until the Convention finds, as it ſoon muſt find, its new aſſignats ſo entirely without value, that nobody will take them.</p>
               <p>But as to Cambon's obſervation, that in this caſe the Republic will find it <hi>impoſſible to carry on the war</hi>— ſome perſons imagine perhaps, that as the Convention muſt long ſince have foreſeen the total depreciation of its paper-money, it muſt of courſe have made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for that event, out of the immenſe quantity of of treaſure which it procured by the pillage of the churches. With reſpect to this treaſure, the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf admits that it has been ſquandered with the ſame thoughtleſs profuſion, as the paper-money; and Cambon declared on the 2d of November, that the whole of the plate taken from the churches, and of which Europe had heard ſuch exaggerated accounts, <hi>did not produce more than between</hi> 25 and 30 <hi>millions</hi>

Conſidering the ſort of half-confeſſion of Cambon, I very much doubt whether the preſent receipts amount to more than 150 millions (6,250,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling); and in aſſignats, not very likely, I ſhould ſuppoſe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any great ſurplus to borrow upon.

               <p>But to anticipate at once any ſpeculations on the means which the French may be ſuppoſed to adopt for protracting the war—let us imagine, that by a ſtretch of authority the Convention actually reduces the nominal value of the aſſignats, or that the people, by general conſent, agree to give up half or three-fourths of thoſe in their hands, to retrieve the value of the remainder. Whatever reſource might be found in ſuch meaſures, after a general peace; yet, while the war continues, they would be uſeleſs: for nothing but a general peace can take away the neceſſity of new emiſſions: and beſides, to propoſe ſuch a meaſure to the French, in order to continue the war, would be modeſtly aſking them to burn half their fortunes, only to give the Convention an opportunity of annihilating the remainder—exhauſting the little life that is left, in graſping for a few months more Savoy and Belgium, and putting off for a ſhort time longer the return of the Stadtholder.</p>

Such a bankruptcy of the State will moſt ſenſibly affect all the poorer claſſes, and particularly the ſoldiers, whoſe abſence has deprived them of the opportunity of employing their paper in purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lands at a low rate, and who, when they return, will find no public property remaining to divide among them, as they were promiſed. If their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at finding their paper fortunes of no ſort of value, ſhould induce them to require the annulling all the ſales of eſtates which have been made by the Convention, and which the Jacobins at home have purchaſed for almoſt nothing, while they have been bleeding on the frontiers;—ſuch a meaſure would be ſtrictly equitable, and would give the means of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome indemnification, both to them, and to the former proprietors. But, as it would produce nothing towards carrying on a war; then, and poſſibly not till then, the illuſion on that ſubject will ceaſe. Her Revolution will then leave France nothing to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, but the miſery of her people, the ruins which cover her, and the madneſs with which her dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues have waſted a reſource, which, if prudently managed, would have effected and ſecured the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the improvements in her government which ſhe wanted.

the phantoms of military glory, and territorial aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement. But what is paſt cannot now be remedied; and of her preſent miſery the only cure is <hi>Peace,</hi> and her only future hope <hi>Economy.</hi> Theſe words every Frenchman will very ſoon ſubſtitute inſtead of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> and <hi>Democracy.</hi> Having experienced that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of wealth, and of cultivated underſtanding, which is inherent in a pure Democracy, makes it the moſt ignorant of all forms of government, while the multitude and the avidity of its agents makes it the moſt expenſive, they will direct all their wiſhes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one leſs burdenſome, more ſimple in its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, and more powerful in its protection; in ſhort, they will fly for refuge to the arms of a Monarchy.</p>
               <p>I do not deny that this concluding ſcene of the French Revolution may be more or leſs delayed by different meaſures, and particularly by a peace; but the propoſition which I have undertaken to examine, does not relate to the termination of the Revolution, but to that of the War: whether, if it be protracted, any thing can poſſibly delay much longer the annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the paper-money, which, on the part of the French, is its only ſupport; and whether Great-Britain ſhould loſe ſight of this circumſtance.</p>
               <p>The caſe of America, however, is ſeemingly an example which directly contradicts all theſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by the ſure teſt of experience; and may poſſibly influence many opinions in this country.</p>

A ſimilar illuſion led us to perſiſt in the American war. At a great expence we perſevered, till at laſt the paper-money there was much more depreciated than that of France has yet been, or perhaps ever will be; and yet, at that very time, the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:048483_0047_1025330DA3CDFC30"/>
Congreſs was able to augment its forces, inſtead of diminiſhing them. To what purpoſe did we oppoſe our real to their artificial treaſure? The 140 millions which we ſpent, enabled us only to ſpin out the war, which the Americans carried on againſt us with increaſing ſucceſs. They ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all obſtacles, made an advantageous peace; and now, that hardly twelve years have elapſed, their public credit is reſtored, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues greatly exceed their expences, and their future proſperity ſeems incalculable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This repreſentation is true, ſo far as it applies to America, and ſo far only; for between that country and France there is no ſort of analogy. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance is there between America, engaged in a conteſt at home, by no means expenſive, and in which all Europe was on her ſide; and France ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſiſting in a foreign war, in which her finances are oppoſed by almoſt all the wealth of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope? What reſemblance between a Congreſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting property by the principal proprietors, ſupported gratuitouſly by the armies and fleets of France, Spain, and Holland, who made her cauſe their own—and the French Convention, a mob, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by a mob; which, ſo far from having a ſingle ally, has been obliged to ſpend very large ſums in purchaſing the inactivity of ſeveral of the governments which ſhe had not provoked to take part againſt her? The Congreſs, when the depreciation of their paper currency made it requiſite to negociate foreign loans, had France and Holland ready to guarantee them, and immenſe tracts of unappropriated land to offer as a ſecurity; a property which, with ſome moderate taxes, has proved an ample fund for diſcharging their debt, and of courſe has raiſed it to its original value. But where are the perſons who will now advance any money to the French Convention? Where are the Governments which will guarantee the repayment? and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:048483_0048_1025332146CE2060"/>
what is the ſecurity which it can offer? In her ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for independence, America was not at one twelfth part of the expence of her antagoniſt; while France, on the contrary, ſpends at preſent eight or ten times as much as the whole Coalition againſt her. In America the expences both of her friends and her enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed very much her circulating ſpecie; but in France gold and ſilver have almoſt vaniſhed. Paper-money was indeed depreciated in America; but it was the provincial money which fell almoſt to nothing, and never recovered itſelf; while that iſſued by the Congreſs never loſt three-fourths of its original value, and was reſtored to it by means of which France is wholly deſtitute.</p>
               <p>But indeed what poſſible reſemblance can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered between America, with reſources conſtantly improving, even during the conteſt, by a reproduction of the neceſſaries of life, far greater than the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her own people; reſources directed all along by the ſame leaders, men previouſly practiſed in the arts of government, to one uniform object, and in a war at home—and France, with wants continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, with reproduction greatly reduced, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changing its leaders, and its arrangements; and fighting at a diſtance, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rely for aggrandiſement by conqueſts, much more expenſive to preſerve, than difficult to make?—What reſemblance between the French, who have hardly advanced a ſtep without ſome novelty in wickedneſs, and whoſe ſucceſſes, by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſequence, give full ſcope to domeſtic ſtrife; and the Americans whoſe union was cemented by danger, who regulated their conduct as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by the eſtabliſhed laws of civilized nations, and who were anxious not to diſgrace their cauſe by the licentious ferocity of ſavages?</p>
               <p>Any compariſon of the ſituation, reſources, and the conduct of theſe two nations, proves that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one another in nothing, but that each was
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:048483_0049_1025332880179AF8"/>
diſtreſſed by a revolutionary ſtruggle; which the one had means of bringing to a ſucceſsful concluſion, of which the other is totally deſtitute. A contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the progreſs of the American Revolution proves that paper money is not a permanent reſource; and the circumſtances attending that of France prove that, when her paper-money fails, ſhe will find no ſubſtitute.</p>
               <p>I cannot too often repeat that nothing ſhort of this failure will convince the French of the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of agreeing to a full reſtitution of their conqueſts. Whatever may be the military events of the war, this object will be obtained by the perſeverance of the Allies; and upon it depends the only reaſonable hope they now have of terminating it on equitable and ſafe conditions.</p>
               <p>A Peace on ſuch conditions, I conſider as ſo ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably valuable, and as ſo certain a reward of fortitude on their part, that even if we were to begin this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign with the melancholy certainty that at the end of it there would be no material alteration in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſituation of the two armies,—yet ſtill, no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſhould be ſpared, becauſe no ſacrifices can be too great, when the object is to drive back and confine within their own country theſe modern Goths and Vandals, who have already conceived the deſign of overrunning the reſt of Europe. At preſent indeed they ſeem to have ſuſpended their deſign; but the national character of the French will never allow them to relinquiſh it, if an example of diſunion, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating conceſſion, ſhould ever give them a proſpect of ſucceſs; and reduce the reſt of Europe, either to the neceſſity of becoming their Allies, and thereby gradually falling into the deplorable ſituation of thoſe iſlands which under that name ſubmitted to the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering inſolence of the democracy of Athens; or of maintaining a perpetual ſtate of warfare, in defence of their independence, againſt French violence and French intrigue.</p>

               <p>In the above expenditure, it will be obſerved, is included the annual million applied by Mr. Pitt's bill, which paſſed in 1786; by the operation of which, with the application of an additional ſum, as above ſtated alſo, ſince 1792, of 200,000<abbr>l.</abbr> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the falling in of annuities, there was paid off, of the national debt, on the 5th of January 1795, 14,912,400<abbr>l.</abbr> of the capital; and the ſum now annually applied for the reduction of the debt, is, in the whole, 1,965,992<abbr>l.</abbr> which will neceſſarily continue to increaſe from the intereſt of the debt paid off, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities falling in, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, The nation, inſtead of being obliged to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the operations of this fund during the war, has not only found no difficulty in borrowing 33,500,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, for that purpoſe, in the laſt three years; but has laid new taxes adequate to pay the intereſt of this new debt, and to augment the above fund in a due proportion to the augmentation of the debt, by an addition of 1 per cent. per ann. on every 100<abbr>l.</abbr> of capital created in conformity with the proviſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the act paſſed in 1792.—And though theſe new taxes are calculated as likely to produce the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſum of 2,785,000<abbr>l.</abbr>

               <p n="4">4thly, The uſual effect of war is, that while the conſumption of national wealth increaſes, the ſprings are diminiſhed by which the reſervoir is repleniſhed; and yet in the year 1794, the commercial balance in favour of Great-Britain amounted to 4,446,000<abbr>l.</abbr> no leſs than 2,704,000<abbr>l.</abbr> more than the average of the four proſperous years of peace, which immediately preceded the war.</p>
               <p>Nor does this favourable commercial balance ariſe merely from the difference between exports and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, each of which have diminiſhed; but it is between exports and imports, each moſt rapidly increaſing even under the preſſure of the war.

               <p>And this, notwithſtanding ſuch a number of men have been taken from their common employments, that her army is now greater than in any former period by more than eighty thouſand men: and if unuſual means have been adopted to procure ſailors for her navy, it has been becauſe the uſual means have been leſs rigorouſly enforced, becauſe the navy too is greater and more numerous than at any former period, and becauſe the commerce conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing far more extenſive than in any former war, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily retains a far greater number of ſailors.</p>

Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney too is ſo plenty, that the ſubſcribers to this loan have taken an unuſual advantage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count allowed, as on former occaſions, for prompt payment, and advanced more than ten millions, ſoon after the depoſit, inſtead of waiting to pay that ſum by the regulated inſtalments.</p>
               <p>This conciſe view of the preſent reſources of Great-Britain, is drawn from well-known facts, and authentic accounts; and is, I imagine, quite enough to decide on her ability to continue the war as long as it can, by any poſſible means, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by her enemy.</p>

curſed Great-Britain with a national debt; a gulf which, inſtead of being filled up, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually growing wider and wider, and into which this vain nation is falling, which believes herſelf the richeſt in Europe, only becauſe all Europe does not contain ſo much money as ſhe owes herſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nearly ſuch as this was the language of Dr. Price at about the ſame period of the laſt war; and which has been ſo completely refuted by experience. Theſe antiquated declamations on the national debt of Great-Britain, which are ſtill ſo faſhionable abroad among the partizans of the French, may be completely anſwered, by obſerving—1ſt, That ſhe cannot be diſtreſſed by a ſudden call upon her for the capital of the debt, becauſe it is not demandable; 2dly, That effectual means have been provided for its extinction; and, 3dly, That the payment of the intereſt is perfectly ſecure. When we wiſh to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain which of two individuals is in the beſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we do not limit ourſelves to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that one of them has a mortgage on his eſtate, while that of the other is unencumbered; but if the firſt, after deducting the intereſt of his mortgage, has ſtill the greater income, we can have no doubt that of the two he is the richer.</p>
               <p>But another objection is faſhionable with the ſame claſs of political arithmeticians, on the continent.— <q>If (ſay they) the taxes of Great-Britain, of which the produce has hitherto been adequate to her preſent debt, go on increaſing continually in a proportion adequate to the increaſe of that debt; if, notwithſtanding their preſent immenſe amount, they are added to year after year; they muſt at laſt become more inſupportably heavy than thoſe taxes which have occaſioned inſurrections in other countries; and can it be expected that the people will then ſo patiently ſubmit to them? And,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:048483_0056_1025335DDD9EA058"/>
beſides, if this pretended public wealth reſults entirely from privations to which the individuals who compoſe the State muſt ſubmit, the whole is merely a confuſion of ideas.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Either I am very much miſtaken, or there is no other confuſion than what reſults from mis-ſtating the argument; which may be eaſily put in a clearer point of view by conſidering, that the comparative burden of taxes on any families or nations, is not to be eſtimated by the ſterling amount of the ſums which they pay, but by the proportion which thoſe ſums re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively bear to the incomes which they derive from property or induſtry.</p>
               <p>Let this rule be applied to the taxes paid by the people of Great-Britain; and it will be found that though their amount, when compared with the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is perhaps greater than in any conſiderable country, Holland excepted, yet there is no country which ſupports its government almoſt entirely by public contributions,<note n="*" place="bottom">The words <hi>which ſupports its government almoſt entirely by public contributions,</hi> are introduced into the text, becauſe in ſome countries the whole, and in others a great pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, in fact, the people of Great-Britain feel leſs than any other the burden of taxation, for the following reaſons: 1ſt, It is the only country where thoſe who are poor pay leſs in proportion to their incomes than theſe who are rich. 2dly, This takes place in a wiſe gradation, from the loweſt to the higheſt of the community; many taxes being aſſeſſed in an increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ratio, regulated by circumſtances which indicate a proportionate increaſe of wealth, and others being of a nature which confines their operation almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to the opulent. 3dly, There is no country
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:048483_0057_1025336B80AB18C8"/>
where the mode of collecting them is ſo little vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or the means of providing for the demand, ſo ready; in conſequence of a facility in exchanging property, or procuring money on its credit, which in moſt other countries is unknown.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>It may urged as an objection to my argument, that the great proprietors of Germany and Italy pay much leſs in proportion than thoſe of the ſame claſs and deſcription in England: but this objection does not meet my argument, and indeed proceeds upon a miſapprehenſion of it. What I mean is, that it is not the poſitive weight borne by any individual in Great-Britain, that gives ſuch an advantage to the ſyſtem of taxation adopted in that country, over that which prevails in every other part of Europe; but it is the equity with which the public burden is diſtributed in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the abilities of thoſe who are to bear it.</p>
                     <p>This equitable principle of taxation is every year more and more attended to; and its operation is ſuch, that there is good reaſon to believe, that the great labouring body of the community, whoſe expences, reckoned by families, are generally from twenty to thirty pounds a year, do not pay more to the State than at the rate of three per cent.—If we aſſume the next claſs as made up of thoſe who, by families, expend from thirty to fifty pounds a year, and which includes the higher order of artizans, inferior farmers and tradeſmen, &amp;c. what they contribute may be averaged at about five or ſix per cent.—The rate of contribution goes on in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſing progreſſion to the higheſt claſſes, ſo that the families included in them, which if their revenue ariſes excluſively from real property, and they ſpend the whole of it, do not pay to the State leſs than from thirty to fifty per cent.</p>
                     <p>The effect of a wiſe diſtribution of taxes (provided the revenue derived from them returns to the community) is ſuch, that they bear heavily on no individual, becauſe a general circulation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that revenue in ſuch a way, that each man's income improves in proportion as he contributes. Not that this circumſtance, which is true only to a certain extent, ſhould operate as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lay on additional burdens, or make Government indifferent as to the manner in which they are laid on; on the contrary, it muſt not be forgotten, that taxes, particularly when laid on the poor, diminiſh the means of reproduction, and conſequently t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e reſources of taxation, which it is of ſuch importance to reſerve for extraordinary emergencies.</p>
                     <p>This hypotheſis, I am aware, involves a queſtion of mere political economy, and may be more or leſs conteſted. But to return to the main queſtion, whether thoſe claſſes of ſociety, which in Great-Britain bear the greateſt ſhare of the burden of taxes, are not able to ſupport an increaſe of that burden, and even willing to do it; in anſwer to this queſtion, I appeal to the following circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That the taxes of the preſent ſeſſion, amounting to 1,645,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling a year, fall almoſt excluſively on thoſe claſſes, and yet no taxes ever met with leſs oppoſition: That the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inſtitutions ſupported by public ſubſcription, which in this country are infinitely more numerous than in any other, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the wealth as well as the charitable diſpoſition of the country, which was never more univerſal, or more abundant, than during the late ſevere winter. If the incomes of the rich were injuriouſly diminiſhed, the inclination might have remained, but the means would have been wanting; whereas thoſe contributions were ſo great, particularly in towns, that many perſons think the poor were even better provided for, than in common winters, when they could work with more convenience.</p>
                     <p>As there can be no ſtronger proof of the opinion which they who ſupport the greater part of the burden of the war, entertain of the neceſſity (under the preſent circumſtances) of continuing it, than their cheerfully ſubmitting to an addition of taxes, to the annual amount of 2,785,000<abbr>l</abbr>, impoſed within the ſhort ſpace of three years; ſo there can hardly be a ſtronger proof of the wealth of this nation, and of the increaſe of that wealth, notwithſtanding the war, than that ſcarce any of thoſe works which increaſe the reſources of a nation, by facilitating reproduction, ſuch as canals, &amp;c. &amp;c. have either been ſuſpended, or carried on with leſs activity, than before the war. The capital which the war has hitherto diverted out of its channel, is not that which is uſually employed in increaſing the wealth of a country, by facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the means of reproduction; but it is principally that which is uſually ſpent in increaſing the comforts, and adding to the elegancies of life.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the queſtion, from which I perhaps appear to have been wandering: there are two other ways of determining whether the Engliſh nation, taken at large, is more or leſs taxed than others.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, to compare the annual revenues of the inhabitants, with the ſum which they pay to the State. Now, many political calculators eſtimate the annual reproduction of Great-Britain (meaning the whole income derived from lands, induſtry, and money) at nearly double the amount of that of France, in her days of proſperity; and they ſupport this eſtimate by the circumſtance that Great-Britain, after having ſupplied its own conſumption, exported a ſurplus produce twice as great as that of France, which amounted only to about twelve millions ſterling; whereas the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orts of Great-Britain amounted, in 1792, to twenty-five millions ſterling. But let us even ſuppoſe the incomes of the two nations only equal; then, as the public revenue of France, before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, amounted to about twenty-four millions ſterling, and that of Great-Britain, before the war, to about ſixteen millions, it is clear that the former, even admitting the incomes of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to be equal, paid 124/100 while the latter paid no more than 16/100. But admitting what was probably the fact, that the income of Great-Britain was double that of France, the ſum actually raiſed upon the former, would be to that raiſed upon the latter, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of 8/100 to 24/100, that is, in proportion of one to three.</p>
                     <p>If this mode of compariſon ſhould appear uncertain, there is another more ſure, and which leads to a concluſion ſtill more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Great-Britain; it is, to compare the ſum ſhe pays to Government, with the balance of her trade. Thus if Great-Britain in the year 1792, increaſed, I do not ſay her circulating ſpecie, which is not to the purpoſe, but her productive capital, to the amount of 5,245,842<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, by the balance of her foreign trade; this balance amounted to nearly one third of all that was paid to Government. And here another obſervation ſhould be made, that this annual augmentation of the public wealth, increaſes the means of paying the public contributions in the ſucceeding year.</p>
                     <p>Next to England, France was the State whoſe commercial ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance was the moſt favourable, and Necker ſuppoſed that it amounted annually to near three millions ſterling: the French therefore had to add to the profit they derived from their foreign trade more than ſeven times its amount, in order to pay the public contributions, whereas Great-Britain has only to add twice as much.</p>
                     <p>Let the other nations of Europe, who talk of the heavy taxes of Great-Britain, ſubmit their own to the ſame teſt.</p>
                  </note> If theſe reaſons
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:048483_0058_10253373E4E04AD8"/>
are inconcluſive, we muſt admit that the Savoyards, who, though the amount of their taxes, compared with
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:048483_0059_1025337E1F385AF8"/>
their population, was trifling; yet, comparing that amount with their poverty, were perhaps the moſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved by them of any people in Europe; that they muſt be conſidered as being taxed only one twelfth part as heavily as Great-Britain, becauſe, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their number, their taxes were but one twelfth part as productive.</p>
               <p>The only way of judging in what degree the taxes in any country are burdenſome to the people, and to what extent they may be increaſed upon emergencies, is, firſt to aſcertain the actual opulence of that country, and then inveſtigate the ſources of that opulence, in order to diſcover whether they are likely to become more abundant, and to be permanent. If ſuch an inveſtigation gives reaſon to believe that the opulence
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:048483_0060_10253382C69958A8"/>
of Great-Britain has increaſed in any period to a given extent, her inhabitants need not be alarmed, if at the end of that period they find her public burdens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in a proportionate extent.</p>
               <p>The value of the reproductions in Great-Britain, and of the accumulation of every ſpecies of wealth within her, has been for many years increaſing with a rapidity which has refuted the preſages of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly politicians, and excited the envy of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and in ſuch a ſituation, ſhe ought not ſo much to be afraid of ſacrifices which her proſperity enables her to make, as to be cautious, that neither the violence of her enemies, nor the indiſcreet impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the advocates of immediate peace, ſucceed in depriving her of thoſe ſources from which her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is derived. They are, at home, her agriculture and her manufactures, protected and encouraged by her Conſtitution; and abroad, her commerce, of which the balance of power in Europe is the ſhield.</p>
               <p>Europe is the beſt market for her commerce; and her acceſs to that market upon equal terms, as well as the opulence of thoſe who trade with her in it, and which conſtitutes the value of it, depend, immediately, upon the tranquillity and independence of the nations which inhabit it; and ultimately, on the balance of power, by which that tranquillity and independence is eſſentially protected; ſo that the principal ſource of Britiſh opulence, that ſtream which fertilizes her fields, and moves the various mechaniſm of her mines, and manufactures, may be loſt for ever, if ſhe ſuffers the moſt formidable nation in Europe to increaſe an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, always hoſtilely directed, by any augmentation of her territory; or by allowing her to retain any politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſcendency which ſhe has gained by her preſent ſucceſs. The culpable laſſitude which could purchaſe peace on ſuch conditions, would certainly be puniſhed by a decay of foreign trade, and a diminution of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wealth, as rapid as its late increaſe has been.</p>

                     <p>A political and military view of what wars of invaſion have coſt the aggreſſors ſince the balance of power has been attended to in Europe, would, if well done, be a valuable monitor to nations and princes. The moſt ſucceſsful of them perhaps was that which gave the late King of Pruſſia poſſeſſion of Sileſia; an acquiſition which, however, beſides the original war of conqueſt, coſt him a ſeven years devaſtation and depopulation of his paternal domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and which, after all, would hardly have been retained till this time, but for the particular intereſt which the Germanic body has in ſtrengthening the ſecond of its members in point of power, at the expence of the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                     <p>And as to the French, though hitherto ſo ſucceſsful, do they imagine that even if a peace ſhould now be made with them, leaving them in poſſeſſion of their conqueſts, it would be more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or that poſſeſſion leſs deſtructively conteſted on the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, than that of Sileſia was with Frederic? Do they think that the Princes from whom thoſe conqueſts are made, and thoſe to whom the power of France is an object of alarm, will not, on the firſt conſciouſneſs of returning ſtrength on their part, and of debility on the part of their enemies, league together again to drive them back to their former boundary? How is it that they do not yet obſerve that the meaſures which they are purſuing can lead to nothing more than a peace in name; but, in fact, a mere jealous ſuſpenſion of war; and that the perſeverance of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Government is a demonſtration that the peace which it wiſhes for, is not a truce, a mere ceſſation of hoſtilities, till means can be found to renew them with greater advantage, but a peace which will be ſincere and durable.</p>
                     <p>In fact, it is the ambition of territorial aggrandizement, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born paſſion of France, which at preſent induces her to detach, one by one, the Powers who are at war with her, by partial compromiſes. The leaders of that nation well know that the Britiſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will never allow the territorial aggrandiſement of France in a general Congreſs for Peace; and therefore their object is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the quiet poſſeſſion of the conqueſts which they wiſh to retain, by previous and partial treaties.</p>
                     <p>If this be really their motive, let us examine the good policy of it. For the precarious poſſeſſion of a few deſolated provinces, the French condemn themſelves to perſiſt in a conteſt with the moſt formidable member of the league againſt them; to remain with harbours blocked up, proviſions intercepted; and entangled in a ſpecies of war, for which, of all others, they are the moſt unfit; and for which, of all others, they have the feweſt internal means of providing the materials, and conſequently can derive the leaſt aſſiſtance from their aſſignats.</p>
                     <p>They have not perhaps yet diſcovered that, in proportion as their plan of partial treaties is adopted, Great-Britain becomes relieved from the moſt burdenſome part of the war. Once freed by the defection of her Allies from the obligation to make a common cauſe with them, ſhe would be left free to exert all her force in the way moſt advantageous to herſelf. Though the iron frontier of France has proved impenetrable to the armies of Europe, yet her coaſts are no where inacceſſible. The diſtant poſſeſſions of France muſt inevitably become a permanent acquiſition to Great-Britain: 1ſt, Becauſe ſhe would be under no obligation to reſtore them, as the condition of any reſtitution to be made by France; 2dly, Becauſe the conqueſts once made, by ruining the trade, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently deſtroying the nurſery of the marine of France, would deprive her of the means of ever regaining them; 3dly, Becauſe thoſe diſtant poſſeſſions having little or no influence on the balance of power in Europe, France would never be materially ſupported by the great Continental Powers in her attempt to regain them.</p>
                     <p>Another circumſtance which they overlook, is the ſmall value of their conqueſts, when compared with that of the poſſeſſions which in that caſe they muſt loſe, the one not being in their full extent one-fourth part as valuable as the other We find by the report of Johannot, made the 22d of December, that the returns from their colonies are now ſuſpended, which by the ſame report amounted, in 1788, to 235 millions (9,791,666<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling).</p>
                     <p>Soon perhaps the Convention will find that their people will open their eyes to this circumſtance, and the words of Mr. Necker, will every where be repeated. <hi>What would be the conſequence, if by neglecting ſuch valuable poſſeſſions, or by loſing them, France ſhould find herſelf deprived of that balance of commerce, which ſhe annually gains by exporting the produce of her colonies? What would be the conſequence, if, beſides this, ſhe ſhould be obliged to purchaſe from other nations, that part of their produce which ſhe wants for her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption? Such a Revolution would ſend out of France annually more ſpecie than ſhe now receives.</hi> Adminiſtr. of Fin. Vol. II. ch. 3.</p>
                     <p>But the abſurdity of the preſent leaders of the French, is not greater than the injuſtice with which the Author of <hi>Reflections on Peace</hi> reproaches Mr. Pitt <hi>with not being frightened at the very riches of Great-Britain, which have only been accumulated by the ruin of her Allies.</hi> p. 30.</p>
                     <p>If ever Great-Britain gave inconteſtable proofs of moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and diſintereſtedneſs, it is ſurely in the preſent war. I appeal to the ſincere exertions ſhe has made, and the lives and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe has ſacrificed to preſerve Holland from the ruin to which France had devoted it. That ruin is conſummated, and the French have ſung their ſongs of triumph; but it will not be long ere they find out that they have done Great-Britain the moſt ſignal ſervice; and that, by attacking the territory of the United Provinces, and getting poſſeſſion of it, they have given her a double opportunity to do herſelf honour by defending her commercial rival ſincerely, though unſucceſsfully; and to enrich herſelf by the preſent ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Dutch trade,—an advantage which the late alliance between the French and Batavian Republics will give the Engliſh a right to extend as far as poſſible; and which is certainly far more valuable than any pillage which the French have obtained under the name of <hi>Requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> But ſurely the queſtion is not whether the war is miſchievous to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:048483_0062_1025339B69A66638"/>
Great-Britain; for no one can doubt it. Still leſs can it be a queſtion whether peace is deſirable; for
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:048483_0063_102533A3B135F620"/>
who is there wicked enough to deny it? But it is to promote the duration of peace, by preferring of two evils (to one or the other of which we are compelled to ſubmit) that which will moſt effectually contribute to its ſolidity. And this queſtion clearly hinges on the four points which I have attempted to examine. 1ſt, Whether the preſervation of the ſources of Britiſh proſperity, does not eſſentially depend on the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe, the independence, and the tranquillity of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope? 2dly, Whether that equipoiſe will not be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſtroyed, and her independence and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be continually in danger, from the moment that France is left in poſſeſſion of any part of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts? 3dly, Whether the near annihilation of the only reſource which, during the war, ſhe can make productive, does not give a better chance of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her of her conqueſts by perſeverance? 4thly, Whether the reſources of Great-Britain alone are not
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:048483_0064_102533CBC0873930"/>
fully adequate to the expences of the war, during any probable calculation of its continuance; and whether their condition is ſuch, as to give the French any ſhadow of reaſon for the hope which they ſo fondly cheriſh, of accompliſhing their ruin, by protracting the war; a hope which has inſtigated a great part of their unprecedented exertions; and which now is the only probable cauſe of their apparent unwillingneſs to terminate the war, at leaſt with Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>I am aware that many perſons on the Continent, who know no more of Great-Britain than what they read in the parliamentary debates, believe literally all the melancholy predictions of Oppoſition, and all thoſe tales of misfortune, on which, as uſual, ſo much ſtreſs is laid, whenever thoſe who are adverſe to the meaſures or the members of Adminiſtration, think proper to paint the diſaſtrous effects of a war which they blame, and the immediate urgency of a peace which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend. Struck, no doubt, with the eloquence with which Mr. Fox has deſcribed the abyſs into which the obſtinacy of Adminiſtration is plunging this country, by prolonging ſo hopeleſs a war—the Author of <hi>Reflections on Peace</hi> brings him forward to corroborate <hi>the evidence of the dangers</hi> of every kind, internal as well as external, from which nothing but a peace can preſerve Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>So much reſpect is due to the authority of Mr. Fox, that I would readily let the opinion of the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of my ſtatement of the reſources of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſt on his teſtimony. I go farther:—if Mr. Fox had been at the head of adminiſtration, and it had been proved to him that the French were determined to retain any part of their conqueſts; that the leaders of the Convention do not deſire a general peace, or at leaſt that they do not wiſh for it but <hi>by partial ones;</hi> that if they no longer perſiſt in declaring that they will not ſign it <hi>but on the ruins of the modern Carthage,</hi> yet they ſtill tell their countrymen <hi>that the true guarantee of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:048483_0065_102533D4DD7E1C20"/>
univerſal peace is to trace with a ſtrong hand the limits of their Republic</hi>

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See Barrere's Speech, Aug. 20, 1794.</note>—I very much doubt whether Mr. Fox would admit the authority of ſuch a demarcation on one ſide <hi>by Nature,</hi> and on the other <hi>with a ſtrong hand</hi> by the armies of France. I rather imagine that, if ſuch a map of France were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him for his ſignature, he would not have the leaſt difficulty in affirming on his part, that, rather than ſubmit to ſuch terms, Great-Britain ought to continue her preſent expence for years to come; that ſhe is able, and will be able to do ſo; and that ſhe muſt not put the evils which ſhe has already borne, or may ſtill be obliged to bear, in competition with the far greater, though not ſo immediate evils which they enable her to avoid. I believe too, that, inſtead of fancying that <hi>multiplied diſaſters would wear out Europe and England within a year</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Reflections on Peace, <hi>p. 23.</hi>
                  </note>, Mr. Fox would exert all his talents to prevent thoſe diſaſters, by doubling the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary exertions of the country, if neceſſary; and would not conſent to ſheath the ſword, until, holding it with a <hi>ſtrong hand,</hi> he had <hi>traced the limits of the French Republic;</hi> that is, until he had deprived her of all her conqueſts, and deſtroyed her influence in Holland. I am led to this opinion by his decided approbation of the conduct of Mr. Pitt in 1787 for taking an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part, in concert with Pruſſia, againſt the Anti-Stadholderian party in Holland. He not only went ſo far as to call that party <hi>uſurpers;</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <p>At the riſk perhaps of being thought preſumptuous, I will not diſſemble that the conduct of the Britiſh Miniſter, on that occaſion, has always appeared to me to be leſs diſtinguiſhed by his uſual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and foreſight, than any other of his meaſures.</p>
                     <p>It is not for having interfered in the Dutch Revolution that I think him to blame; for in that he was fully juſtified in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious interference and abſurd intrigues of that weak, but buſy Miniſter, the Count de <hi>Vergennes,</hi> who took the ſame pains to carry Democracy to exceſs in Holland, as to cruſh the limited De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy of Geneva. But did Great-Britain, after deſtroying the French intereſt in Holland, avail herſelf of her influence with the Dutch, as ſhe might have done, to induce them to adopt a form of government better adapted to the intereſts of both nations? This I doubted long before the events which have lately happened, and which have changed thoſe doubts to certainty. If I venture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my reaſons now, it is becauſe I think it cannot be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame circumſtances will recur.</p>
                     <p>The greater part of the Dutch Patriots were men of real inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. The object which they meant to gain was liberty; and they ſet out with very good intentions, but in a road of which they had very little knowledge. They complained of the authority of the Stadtholder as a yoke; and did not diſcover that if it was a yoke, the reaſon of its being ſo was becauſe it was poſſeſſed of certain powers by no means ſuited to his ſituation as Supreme Chief, and which he might be tempted to miſuſe; while at the ſame time he was not allowed other prerogatives, much more eſſential to that ſituation, and which can only be employed to the public advantage. They exclaimed againſt Great-Britain, and accuſed her of meaning to make the Houſe of Orange among them what the Houſe of Hanover is here; and the prejudice of party hindered them from ſeeing that the greateſt poſſible ſervice which ſhe could have rendered them, would have been preciſely to have deſerved this accuſation, by inducing the Stadtholder to exchange his political powers, for the prerogatives of the Britiſh Kings, and perſuading the people at large that the exchange would be for its advantage.</p>
                     <p>This ineſtimable uſe I have thought that the Britiſh Miniſter might poſſibly have made of the immenſe influence he had in the Revolution of 1787. That Revolution terminated only in the momentary defeat of a numerous party; whereas it might have ended in a ſolid improvement of the ſituation of the Houſe of Orange, and of the people, ſatisfying almoſt equally both parties, and conſolidating the connexion between the two countries.</p>
                     <p>So noble an enterpriſe would, no doubt, have been ſubject to many difficulties in the execution; but which might, I imagine, have been ſurmounted by judicious conduct, and lenient meaſures. The triumphant party was ſo completely under the influence of Great-Britain and Pruſſia, that it could not have reſiſted, even if it could be ſuppoſed ſo ignorant of its own intereſts as to have attempted it. As to the other party, it thought of nothing but eſcaping the conſequences of defeat; and I am much deceived if thoſe who compoſed it would not then have accepted the Engliſh Conſtitution with tranſport. I am ſtill more miſtaken if that Conſtitution, once in activity, would have allowed itſelf to have been ſupplanted by the Tree of French Liberty.</p>
                     <p>However, another opportunity may ſoon offer. Heretofore the Hollanders have complained of the Stadtholderian Ariſtocracy; they have now experienced the far greater oppreſſion of the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy of 1795: now more than ever they may be diſpoſed to unite in forming a rational Conſtitution, protecting them from both; and the beſt pattern they can imitate is the Britiſh Conſtitution, which it would have been ſtill more eaſy to introduce in Holland than in France.</p>
                  </note> but he added,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:048483_0066_102533D98CB40F58"/>
that it was not an object with him to inveſtigate ſcrupulouſly which of the two parties in Holland
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:048483_0067_102533EB337F74D8"/>
was moſt in the right. <q>It was ſufficient for him and for the Houſe to conſider which party in the Republic of the United Provinces was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be friendly to Great Britain, and to renew the natural alliance with this country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He reminded the Houſe <q>how repeatedly he had urged the treachery of France in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her influence in foreign States, even by arguments which had frequently been thought too ſtrong;</q>—how often he had urged his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the views of aggrandiſement entertained by her, of her perfidious ſyſtem of politics, and her adroit perſeverance in intriguing, to gain an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the governments in her neighbourhood, and of the extreme danger of truſting to her profeſſions of good faith. <q>As for him, (added he) he did not wiſh to reſt upon French declarations, or upon any French profeſſions, whether perfectly made, or clearly expreſſed or not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the preſent occaſion, he gave his full aſſent to the addreſs, which he conſidered as a public avowal from the Throne, and as public an acknowledgment on the part of that Houſe, that thoſe ſyſtems of politics, which had, at preceding periods, been called romantic, were ſerious ſyſtems, and ſuch as it was the true intereſt of the country to be governed by; ſyſtems eſtabliſhed on that ſound and ſolid political maxim, that Great-Britain ought to look to the ſituation of affairs upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and to take ſuch meaſures, upon every change
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:048483_0068_102533EF0C30DD68"/>
of circumſtances abroad, as ſhould tend beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the balance of power in Europe. Upon that maxim he had founded all his political conduct; and convinced as he was of its juſtneſs, he ſhould continue to adhere to it, and conſequently could not withhold his ready and ſincere aſſent to an addreſs admitting the maxim ſo completely. It was now confeſſed by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it was neceſſary to come to the lower orders of the people, thoſe who were labouring under the heavieſt burdens, thoſe who paid for their candles, their windows, and all the various neceſſaries of life, and ſay—<q>Severely taxed as we know you are, you muſt nevertheleſs contribute ſomething towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of keeping political power upon a balance in Europe.</q> This was open and manly; it was dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by ſound policy. Let therefore the expence of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and enforcing the late meaſures in the Republic of Holland have been what it might, he ſhould think the money well laid out, and would give any aſſiſtance in his power to the voting it cheerfully and freely.</hi>

                  <hi>He had always thought it his duty, and the duty of every member of Parliament, to conſider himſelf as the Repreſentative of the people of Great Britain, and to attend to the intereſts of Britons, let them be where, in what country, and at what diſtance they might.</hi>

few friends, light as they, fall from the Conſtitution; yet its branches will not bend before the blaſt.— Any hurry which ſuch a deſcent might occaſion, would be the effect of animation, not of terror; every ſword would fly to the place of danger as by polar attraction; every petty jealouſy, every party diſtinction, would be extinguiſhed; every man would devote himſelf for his country. A deſcent might poſſibly ſpread through ſome ſmall diſtrict the devaſtation of barbarians: in a village or two the demons of diſcord might dance round their tree of anarchy; for a decade or two, the worſhippers of God might be driven from his temples: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation would repel the invaders; the ocean would cloſe upon them; children's children would liſten to their crimes and to their fate; and the names of Frenchman, Anarchiſt, and Atheiſt, be united in deteſtation for ever.</p>
               <p>There can be no danger which Britain need decline; there can be no ſacrifices wanted which are beyond her ability to make: and will ſhe then, herſelf ſecure, united, armed, and opulent, deſert her Allies, and leave them impoveriſhed, weakened, divided, and deſpoiled? Regard for herſelf and for Europe, even benevolence to future generations in France, obliges her to compel the preſent generation to renounce all its conqueſts. Love of peace obliges her to think of no other, than one which can be ſincere and ſolid: I repeat it, and I think I have proved it, that ſuch a peace can only be ſigned on the former frontiers of France.</p>
               <p>Should ſome of the Allies, by the events of war, find themſelves again on thoſe frontiers; ſhould they, elated by ſucceſs, attempt once more to paſs them, once more become invaders, and try to dictate laws to France;—ſhould political writers again propoſe <hi>a war of ſubjugation,</hi> and talk of chaſing the <hi>Monſter

Then it will be ſeaſonable to appeal to <hi>leſſons taught by an experiment,</hi> which no one would wiſh to <hi>try over again.</hi> Then the wiſe and the truly pacific, in every country, will join in requeſting the Author of <hi>the Reflections on Peace,</hi> to exert all his eloquence in ſupporting the cry of nations, and contributing to the triumph of humanity, by putting a ſtop to the effuſion of blood. But till then, I conjure him and thoſe who feel as he appears to do, to liſten to the voice of reaſon, and reject the dangerous ſuggeſtions of impatience. On the energy and ſteadineſs of the Britiſh character depends at this important moment the fate of the Chriſtian world. The prudence which is recommended would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful puſillanimity. The peace which Great-Britain is ſolicited to purchaſe from France, by ſuffering her to retain but a portion of her conqueſts, would be a preparation for new wars in Europe, new invaſions of Germany, and new taxes at home.

               <argument>
                  <p>Inſurmountable Obſtacles prevent France from remaining a Republic. It is of the utmoſt importance to her to avoid an elective Chief; and to return to a Monarchy, hereditary, but limited.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WILL the Republic, one, indiviſible, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic, be eſtabliſhed in France? Will that great political body divide itſelf into Cantons, confederated like Swiſſerland? Will it adopt an elective Chief like the United States of America? Will not the French go back to their Conſtitution of 1791? Will they not, when weary of change, ſeek a refuge in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deſpotiſm? Will they not imitate the hereditary and limited Monarchy of Great-Britain?</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe queſtions is the only one on which I think we may, as yet, give a decided judgment; and if, with reſpect to that, I venture an opinion, after ſo many ſpeculations have failed, it is becauſe I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the third year of the French Republic has furniſhed <hi>data</hi> from which we can almoſt with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty affirm that the curtain will ſoon drop before this Republican Drama.</p>
               <p>Let it not be ſaid that their language is as repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican as ever; for, as to the French nation, what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the opinion of to-day, compared with the events which may change it to-morrow?

Paris, many more royaliſts, concealed under the diſguiſe of republicans, than there were republicans four years ago under the diſguiſe of royaliſts. I have for ſome time ſuſpected that even the preſent le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ders of the Convention are not ſo republican as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; for if they were, they ſurely would not dream of extending the territory of France, already, beyond a doubt, ſo large as to be an inſurmountable difficulty in the way of their ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>If thoſe leaders were ever ſincerely attached to that ſyſtem, it could only be in the commencement of their revolutionary career; for the miſery, the fears, and the perſonal dangers which thoſe who ſurvive of the Girondiſt faction have undergone, muſt have opened their eyes long before the public diſtreſs was great enough to open the eyes of the multitude. I would aſk thoſe Frenchmen of character and principle, who became Democrats only from exaggerated notions of human virtue,—do they ſtill believe that the virtues and the talents which ſecure admiration and deference in private life, will be equally preeminent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in a crowd? I would refer this queſtion to the conſcience of that member of the Convention who, about three months ago, once more ſolicited his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues to haſten the <hi>magnificent enterpriſe of forming a Democracy of twenty-four millions of men;</hi> or rather, I would decide it by that ſame member's eloquent deſcriptions in his diſcourſe <hi>on terror.</hi> Every page of the hiſtory of every great Republic, will decide it; for there virtue is ſeen ſuffering and ſilenced, while the ſelfiſh paſſions only diſplay themſelves, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
               <p>One truth by this time the French ought to have learned in their ſchool of adverſity—that they have, in no reſpect whatever, the moral character which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable for a popular government. To be fit for it, a nation muſt have education and moral habits unknown in France, and which can only be acquired
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:048483_0075_102534885D9F2CF8"/>
by a long uſe of liberty; and in ſome degree even by its abuſes. A republican ought to have that ſort of diſcernment which can diſtinguiſh between faction and patriotiſm; between thoſe who would agitate the people, and thoſe who would protect them: he ought to have modeſty enough to reverence the experience of age, and to give place on all occaſions to ſuperior talents. A republican government requires the ſtricteſt and moſt conſtant obſervation of ſocial duties; it requires that parental and conjugal authority, that every domeſtic virtue, ſhould come in aid of public force; it requires the moderated warmth which animates debate, and the wiſe circumſpection which reſtrains it within due limits. A Republic, to ſupport itſelf, muſt conſiſt of a people which knows where to ſtop, when party degenerates into faction;—of a people auſtere in manners, grave in character, not haſty in giving its confidence, or changing its opinions; a people which has either the phlegm of the Dutch, the tardineſs of the Swiſs, the ſagacity of Genoa, the prudence of Venice, or the information which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica has derived from the Engliſh ſchool of Liberty. If ever the French ſhould attain to ſo many qualities foreign to their nature, it will be a moſt extraordinary metamorphoſis; one which nothing can ever effect but the gradual operation of a free Monarchy. Let them however once enter that port, and I am convinced they will not leave it again, but to return in a very ſhort time, as the Engliſh did, and moor in it for ever.</p>
               <p>If they ſhould be ſo fortunate as to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that harbour, how much will they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they ever took the Republican Author of the <hi>Social Contract</hi> for their firſt guide to liberty, who, of all political writers, had leaſt ſtudied and leaſt underſtood the nature of mixed monarchy, and repreſentative governments? The latter, if we are to believe him, are derived from the <hi>unjuſt and abſurd

                  <hi>The Sovereignty of the People cannot be repreſented; the People is not free but during the election of its repreſentatives; as ſoon as they are elected, it is a ſlave, it is nothing.</hi>

               <p>If, after commencing, in his Social Contract, by preferring ſmall States to great ones, Rouſſeau had confined to the former, his advice to adopt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government as being the beſt for them, this would have been conſiſtent.<note n="†" place="bottom">The only way in which the partiſans of the Social Contract can defend its author, is by repeating what he ſays himſelf, that he did not wiſh for any but ſmall States.

                  </note> But when, afterwards, with his mind always full of Sparta and Geneva, he ſtates the <hi>monarchical form as in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect inferior to the Republican;</hi> when he conſtantly recommends to great nations all thoſe vexatious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions which are the ſecurity of ſmall ones, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſtartle them at even the ſhadow of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, hereditary chief; then he miſapplies all his obſervations, and finds himſelf out of his ſphere, for he is always wide of the queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>Kings,</hi> he ſays, <hi>always deſire to be abſolute.</hi> But have not Senates, National Aſſemblies, and any ſort of popular bodies, the ſame deſire? And when they

gain their point, is their domination leſs oppreſſive than that of an abſolute Monarch?</p>
               <p>So obvious a remark, one ſhould have ſuppoſed, would have led Rouſſeau to examine ſeriouſly, to which the neceſſary powers of government may be confided, with the beſt means of preventing their abuſe, whether to a King, a Senate, or the People? and to a ſtill more important queſtion—Whether the beſt way of preventing the abuſe is not, to divide thoſe powers between all three with a ſort of equality? But ſuch an enquiry might have brought Rouſſeau to the queſtion of Free Monarchies,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the 8th chapter of the Social Contract, where he perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contraſts <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Every one,</hi> he adds, <hi>knows what follows, when Kings employ ſubſtitutes.</hi> A thing much better known is, that Kings can never do without them; and when they try to do without them, it is ſo much the worſe for their ſubjects. But what ſort of political authority is there where they are not neceſſary? The people of France, that Nation of Kings! have not they too em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſubſtitutes? have they been leſs numerous, more enlightened, leſs expenſive, or more moderate, than thoſe of their laſt unfortunate King?</p>

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>This is Rouſſeau's own expreſſion in ſpeaking of the Engliſh Peerage; and one would think, from it, that he underſtood its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Unfortunately it is in a romance that he introduces it, after having attacked it in his political works. In the ſixty-ſecond letter of his New Eloiſa, Vol. I, he makes an Engliſh Peer ſay, <q>We are not the ſlaves of the Prince, but his friends; we are not the tyrants of the people, but its chiefs. Guardians of liberty, ſupporters of our country, and pillars of the throne, we form an inſuperable barrier between the people and the King. Our firſt duty is to the nation; our ſecond, to the Prince who governs it. We do not conſult his will, but his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Supreme miniſters of the laws in the Houſe of Peers, and <hi>ſometimes even Legiſlators,</hi> we do juſtice equally to the King and to the people; and we allow no one to ſay, <hi>God and my ſword,</hi> but <hi>God and my right.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we have a declamatory period, containing a great deal of truth, but certainly not accurately deſcribing the parliamentary duties of the Houſe of Peers; which are—in their judicial character to decide definitively on appeals; to ſit as a Court of Juſtice on impeachments by the Commons; and on criminal proſecutions of any of their own members, upon the univerſal principle of Engliſh juriſprudence, that every man ſhould be tried <hi>by his Peers.</hi> But their more common duties are, as Legiſlators, to frame bills of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended laws on any ſubject, not implicating in any way taxation, which are then referred to the Houſe of Commons for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, approbation, or rejection; to examine, amend, reject, or approve bills originating in the Lower Houſe. Rouſſeau's miſtake conſiſts in confounding the Parliament of Great-Britain with the French Parliaments, whoſe ordinary functions were thoſe of Courts of Juſtice, and who were very ſeldom called upon to exerciſe any legiſlative power (if legiſlative power it could be called) by regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering or refuſing to regiſter the King's edicts. Of them he might have truly ſaid, that they were <hi>ſupreme Miniſters of the Laws, and ſometimes Legiſlators.</hi>

               <p>Rouſſeau continues—<hi>A Miniſter of real merit in a Monarchy, is almoſt as rare as a fool at the head of a Republican Government.</hi> With what degree of truth this applies to abſolute Monarchies, it is not at preſent worth while to enquire; but if Rouſſeau had choſen to look to the Britiſh Monarchy, he might have ſeen, that a man of eminent and acknowledged merit, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obſcure or low his birth, is almoſt as ſure of riſing to a high ſituation, as he would be ſure of being excluded from it in the greater part of modern Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics; while, on the conrary, a man deſtitute of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, however high his rank, can never have much political conſequence. Here we always ſee at the helm of adminiſtration, either the man whom public
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:048483_0079_102534F555614828"/>
opinion ranks firſt in ability, or one whom it conſiders as equal or little inferior to the firſt: and the leſs favoured candidate cannot be conſidered as unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor the State a ſufferer: for though he does not direct the courſe and the ſhip, yet he watches the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the pilot, with the jealous vigilance of a rival, and, if he can convict him of miſmanagement, is ſure to be put in his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereditary crowns</hi> (Rouſſeau ſtill goes on) <hi>expoſe a nation to have monſters and fools at its head.</hi> Such an event is not impoſſible, and, I acknowledge, is diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but human wiſdom cannot deviſe a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt this evil than the checks of a limited Monarchy. The great object of that ſyſtem is, to give the State rather an oſtenſible than real chief; and to depoſit in other hands, ſuch an influence over his appointment of Miniſters, that the nation may ſecurely confide in their abilities; and, whatever benefit it may derive from his virtues, may have little or nothing to fear from his vices. And, not to mention the tempeſtuous interregnums where crowns are elective, if it be true that by that ſyſtem a fool rarely ſits on the throne, it is equally true that intrigue is the only way to it: intrigue almoſt always elevates to it ſome man of dangerous am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; frequently ſome mean inſtrument of the enemies of his country, who raiſe him to the throne for the purpoſe of ſubjugating it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Princes</hi> (Rouſſeau goes on) <hi>are either men of narrow capacity, or bad principles, when they come to the throne, or the throne ſoon makes them ſo.</hi> My anſwer to this new objection is the ſame as to a former one; that a limited Monarchy, foreſeeing the poſſibility of theſe two caſes, provides againſt the inconveniences of both. In fact, it provides ſo perfect a ſecurity againſt the immorality of the ſupreme Chief, that I ſhould be almoſt diſpoſed to be more apprehenſive of his virtues if too ſplendid, than of his vices. With ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:048483_0080_102535011B1DECD0"/>
let the crown be placed on the head of a woman, or a child, it is comparatively of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo it be placed ſomewhere, and previouſly ſettled. In truth, though the Monarch holds the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and in the choice of thoſe whom he employs as his ſervants is under no legal reſtraint whatever, yet in the exerciſe of that choice he is neceſſarily ſo much ſwayed by prudential conſiderations, that he not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently finds himſelf obliged to give up his own wiſhes in the nomination of his Miniſters, and to be guided in it by preeminence of talents and public opinion.</p>
               <p>We muſt then come to this concluſion, adds Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau; <hi>we muſt declare that the King can do no wrong.</hi> And what is there ſo alarming in this fiction (if it can be called a <hi>fiction</hi>), when effectual precautions have been taken to prevent his doing any wrong; when his ſubjects are better able to reſiſt an attack, than he is to make it; and when he can do no act of government without his Miniſters, and of courſe the whole reſponſibility falls upon them?</p>
               <p>"If it be ſo," the partiſans of the <hi>Social Contract</hi> will reply <q>where is the uſe of this regal pomp, and of the immenſe burden of a Civil Liſt?</q> The anſwer may be contained in a very few words. To avoid civil wars, and reconcile what Rouſſeau con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as not to be reconciled, Liberty and Peace; to prevent the birth of ambition; to ſave the people from the terrible convulſions which a great State is expoſed to, whenever the firſt place in its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vacant; to ſave it from a conſtant and violent ſucceſſion of Syllas, Cromwells, and Robeſpierres<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>One of the moſt anti-miniſterial publications which has lately appeared in England, has the following paſſage: <q>I ſay, ſo fearleſs of miſrepreſentation; for my letters prove that I am no enemy to Kings, who are formed to give great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to an old government, in conſequence of having a deep ſtake in it, and who, by pre-occupying the poſt of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, ſerve to quiet the attempts of all pretenders; for as to the expence of Kings, it is to be held as nothing to a great State, and eſpecially if it is the price of tranquillity.</q> 
                        <hi>Calm Obſerver,</hi> p. xxxvii.</p>
                     <p>This author is perfectly right in the obſervation contained in the preceding ſentence: in Great-Britain the whole civil liſt, conſiderable as the ſum is, does not amount to more than one per cent. of the income of the people, computing it at the loweſt rate; but, upon a much more probable conjecture, not to ½ per cent. And this is the only fair way of comparing the civil expences of any two countries. But that civil liſt is not (as many foreigners imagine, and as is ſometimes inſinuated at home) excluſively employed to ſupport the majeſty of the throne; but is ſtrictly a civil, and not a royal liſt including the ſtipends of a very great number of perſons in the ſervice of the State, in offices without which no ſort of government can exiſt; ſuch as Judges, Secretaries, Ambaſſadors, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>There is a book of another Genevan, not leſs valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and particularly adapted to the French; but which unfortunately did not reach them till they were no longer in a ſtate to comprehend it.

               <p>I need not ſay that by ſuch a Chief, Mr. Adams does not mean, either that ſhadow of Royalty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the French Conſtitution of 1791, a King in name, but in fact nothing more than an expenſive and uſeleſs penſioner; nor the office of Stadtholder in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

to which, in contradiction to common ſenſe, no powers belong, but thoſe which the people is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in reſerving to itſelf, becauſe it is able to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them itſelf without inconvenience. They have given the Stadtholder the right of appointing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the civil magiſtrates of the towns; but they have not allowed him any one of thoſe powers for the exerciſe of which the office ſhould have been conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; ſuch as to declare war, to make peace, to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Ambaſſadors, Generals, Judges, &amp;c. to have a negative upon every propoſal of a new law; and, if he ſanctions it, to enforce its execution. Mr. Adams ſpeaks of no Chief but one, decorated with theſe attributes of Royalty. Such a Chief may have the modeſt appellation of <hi>Preſident,</hi> may be called <hi>Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Protector,</hi> the name ſignifies nothing; the important object is, that he be inveſted with every prerogative of the Chief Magiſtrate of Great-Britain and of America: and who can tell whether Holland would have been conquered, or even attacked, if ſhe had had a Chief to defend her, inveſted with ſimilar authority?</p>
               <p>What! (ſome of the French will ſay, with their uſual air of triumph before victory) is the abſurd inſtitution of a ſingle ſupreme Chief, reduced to find its beſt defenders in three <hi>apoſtate</hi> Republicans! The aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is odd, and I agree that the idea may have ſome truth; but ſo much the worſe for Republics properly ſo called, if whatever is odious in the terms of <hi>apoſtate Republican</hi> belongs to the latter word only; for the real or pretended <hi>apoſtacy</hi> of theſe three authors, proves nothing but that they have learned by experience a truth which Abbé Sieyes formerly boaſted of having diſcovered by the mere force of meditation, when he ſaid he had gone through Republics without finding them free, or at leaſt without finding in them the union of Liberty and Law.</p>

I know of no plan which they can adopt ſo likely to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their misfortunes, or which would at leaſt protract them as long as ſuch a ſyſtem would be endured. I admit that there is the ſame reaſon for calling the American Republic a veiled Monarchy, as for calling the Britiſh Monarchy a diſguiſed Republic; but I once more repeat, that the name is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for beſides that this veiled Monarchy is elective, the numerous functions which the people exerciſe under their different Conſtitutions in the United States, are in no reſpect <hi>applicable</hi> at preſent to the French, who, in my opinion, are far from being ripe for the full exerciſe of the rights which belong to the people under the Britiſh Conſtitution. The time may come when they will be worthy of ſuch a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but to qualify them for it will not certainly be the work of a day; and their progreſs muſt be like that of the Engliſh themſelves,—from the rigour of an almoſt unlimited Monarchy, to a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which the ſubject enjoys rights gradually acquired, and the Sovereign ſubmits to reſtrictions gradually impoſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>What enlightened friend of liberty would think of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the people of France to be preſent at the parliamentary debates, as the Engliſh are? In England no miſchief ariſes from this indulgence, becauſe the profoundeſt and moſt reſpectful ſilence is always obſerved; nor is their preſence any reſtraint on the ſpeakers. So completely, indeed, is it an indulgence, that any member whatever may, without conſulting, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wiſhes of the reſt, order the galleries to be cleared. But were it poſſible for an equal number of Frenchmen to be ſilent, and to refrain from murmurs or applauſes, yet the mere circumſtance of their preſence would intoxicate half their Senate; and the debates would ſoon degenerate into rhetorical declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, addreſſed, not to the chair, but to the galleries, and more calculated to gain popularity than to ſerve the country.</p>
                     <p>Again, can any one think that the preſs, at preſent, ſhould be as little reſtrained in France as it is in England? From the manner in which Marat employed it, and from the deſtructive influence it gave him, we may judge whether what is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for one nation, will not be, perhaps, for many years, a poiſon to the other. The liberty of the French, at preſent, is like a ſpirituous liquor given for the firſt time to a young ſavage; the effect of it is madneſs: experience, however, and habit, will teach him how much he may drink of it, to raiſe his ſpirits and ſtrength, without defeating his purpoſe.</p>

What have been the effects of elective monarchy in that country? A perpetual and bloody ſtruggle between the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, during which, though the people has acted with zeal, yet its intereſts have been conſtantly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; ambition has been ſometimes gratified, but oftener diſappointed; the country has been deſolated; and the domination of Ruſſia, firſt introduced under the diſguiſe of protection, has at laſt been avowed by open ſubjugation.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:048483_0090_102535989D140BC8"/>
pride. Far from ſuffering themſelves to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the political reveries of Rouſſeau, whoſe dying advice to them was to attach themſelves more and more to their republican forms, and never to give up the right of electing their ſupreme chief; but reduce him, by little and little, to a mere image of a King—far from being miſſed by ſuch ſuggeſtions, they at laſt begun to have true notions of liberty, and directed their political views to a Conſtitution approaching to that of Great-Britain. Hardly was the ſtandard of real liberty raiſed among them, before all their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous competitions were forgotten, and the proudeſt of their ariſtocracy ranged themſelves under the banners of Koſciuſko, in defence of a Conſtitution which controuled their own ambition, and was full of happy proſpects for the people. If in the enfeebled ſtate of that nation there was any thing like a hope of ſucceſs in their attempt to ſubſtitute a rational Conſtitution for a turbulent Ariſtocracy and an elective Monarchy, it certainly was the ability and intrepid moderation of their leader. He failed in <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>"One thing in your cuſtoms ſhocks me," ſays Rouſſeau to the Poles, <q>and appears to me quite oppoſite to the genius of your Conſtitution: it is, to ſee it ſo far ſuſpended, and almoſt annihilated, on the death of the King, as that all the tribunals are ſhut up on that occaſion; as if the adminiſtration of juſtice depended ſo much on the life of the King, as that the death of the one muſt be the deſtruction of the other. <hi>It ought to be exactly the reverſe: on the death of the King every thing ſhould go on as if he were alive; one ought hardly to perceive that a part of the machine is wanting, conſidering how little eſſential that piece is to its ſolidity.</hi>

                        <p>How many abſurdities are contained in theſe few lines! <hi>Royalty,</hi> in Rouſſeau's opinion, is <hi>little eſſential,</hi> even to a large political <hi>machine!</hi> Was it his intention, in adviſing the Poles to retain it in their government, to teach them how to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, or to conſider it as dangerous?</p>
                        <p>In pointing out this ſtrange miſtake of Rouſſeau, in his work on Poland, it would be great injuſtice not to acknowledge the high merit of almoſt all the reſt of that work. I conſider it, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, as the beſt antidote to his Social Contract. In the latter, Rouſſeau was wandering in an ideal world; but afterwards his political judgment was matured, and his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſubject became much more extenſive. Obſerve how cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, in his former work, he paſſes by all his abſtract principles, or at leaſt with what uncommon prudence he modifies them, ſo as to adapt them to the circumſtances of the Poles. Preſerve every thing, he ſays to them, overturn nothing; correct at firſt only that which eſſentially wants correction, and that which will enable you gradually to improve the reſt. Let the French meditate on that excellent work, and then aſk themſelves what would have been the author's advice to them, if he had been called upon to give to their nation, as well as to the Poles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for a new Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>If this political writer, whoſe eloquence has given him ſuch an influence over the opinions of the age, had but lived long enough in England to obſerve the practical effects of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, how much might it have contributed to introduce true liberty on the Continent?</p>

the attempt, and the independence of his country did not out-live his captivity. The Poliſh nation is extinct; but the laſt page of her annals is the moſt honourable; for no people ever ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more worthy of independence than they did at the very moment when they loſt it; and from the ſtruggle they made to preſerve it, poſterity may infer the uſe they would have made of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In this glorious effort the Poles had but one avowed ally; and, will it be credited? that ally was France! France, who was at that time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in deſtroying her own hereditary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous monarchy, and endeavouring to eſtabliſh on its ruins the competition of equals, and to kindle the very paſſions which Poland was endeavouring to extinguiſh! The latter wiſhed to preſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and to make the monarchy hereditary; the former overturned an hereditary throne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the nobility which ſupported it. The Poles were anxious for a limited government, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Britiſh Conſtitution; the French
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:048483_0092_102535AA349E0C08"/>
never ſpoke of that Conſtitution but with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain which uſually accompanies ignorance, and rejected every attempt to introduce it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtriking contraſt the French either will not, or cannot obſerve. But, inſtead of adviſing them to imitate America, the friends of ſocial order would do better to direct their attention to the annals of Poland; and endeavour to convince them that liberty does not depend on making the laws and the rulers of a nation ſubject to the people, but in making the people and their rulers ſubject to law; and that, in a great nation, a limited monarchy is the only way to unite liberty with authority; for a vacancy of the firſt place in any government is a ſource of inevitable competition, diſcord, and civil war.</p>
               <p>After having refuted the opinion of Rouſſeau in favour of elective monarchies, I ought not to omit, that attached as he was to a republican government, yet it would have been the laſt of ſyſtems which he would have recommended to the French; knowing, as he did, the capricious levity of their character; and always aſſerting, as he did, that republican liberty cannot be maintained but by auſtere manners, and the moſt rigid virtue.</p>
               <p>How much it is to be regretted that he could not foreſee that the French would be the firſt to adopt his principles! that they would be the firſt to put themſelves under the <hi>heavy yoke</hi> of a Republican Government! and that, with a view to realiſe his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful theories, they would, with their uſual inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate levity, take upon them a burden under the weight of which they have ſunk! And how much it is to be regretted that he cannot now take a view of the nation which, for theſe laſt four years, has been raiſing altars to his ſyſtem!</p>

At the time when Robeſpierre triumphed over the Federaliſts, and thought that he had put all their leaders to death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>o would have thought that Federaliſm would again raiſe its head in the very Convention which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it? Who could have foreſeen that the intrepid Charette would have ranged himſelf under the banners of the regicides; or that they would have proclaimed him Lieutenant-General of La Vendée? And yet all theſe events are but of yeſterday; and ſince we can no longer doubt that the great body of the French deſire ſome new change, and ſince any change muſt be for their advantage, who will be bold enough to affirm, that, before this year is at an end, the word Republican will not be as much execrated in France as the word Jacobin is now?</p>
               <p>Among the various conjectures to which the preſent ſituation of France naturally gives birth, there is one which I feel a pleaſure in entertaining, if not as the moſt probable, yet as certainly the moſt favourable to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:048483_0095_102535D50E294E20"/>
that country. It is, that the nation, weary of the preſent Convention, indignant at its ſcandalous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and ſhocked at the miſery which it has brought and ſtill brings upon their country, will oblige it to diſſolve itſelf, to make room for thoſe Members of the Conſtituent Aſſembly who ſtill ſurvive; ſubſtituting men who were only guilty of errors, inſtead of men whoſe whole conduct has been full of crimes. Could the ſcattered remains of that body be but ſincerely reconciled; could they be brought to forgive one another; could Malouet, Cazales, La Fayette, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metz, Mounier, Lally, Monteſquiou, D' André, now aſſemble, after this terrible leſſon of misfortune, with that knowledge of mankind, and thoſe habits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, which are taught by experience; with diſtruſt of thoſe theories and ſpeculations in which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo much confided; how different would their language now be to the people! Once little better than rhetoricians, they might now be fit to be ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. No doubt their very firſt act would be to ſet aſide their own abſurd Conſtitution of 1791, too republican for a Monarchy, too monarchical for a Republic. No doubt they would think that the moſt effectual mode of ſecuring liberty, is by enſuring obedience to legal authority. They commenced their political career with a declaration that France re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This great point once accompliſhed, they might then employ themſelves in that important work, which the preſent leaders, though willing, cannot ſafely undertake; and which they have not power enough either to promote, or to prevent; though they are conſtantly exclaiming, in contradiction to their own conſciences, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:048483_0096_102535E3241E0860"/>
But the oftener they repeat in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are not at all alarmed or afraid of the commencing cry of royalty, the more evident it is that they obſerve its progreſs.</p>
               <p>For that happy moment when this commencing cry ſhall run from one end of France to the other, all Frenchmen who are friends to Monarchy ſhould prepare themſelves by uniting together, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to any ſlight ſhades of difference in their opinions on the ſubject. But the firſt object of them all ſhould be to unite themſelves to that reſpectable party of converted Republicans, who now hate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy as ſincerely as they adored it before they were acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>And ſince the preſs has hitherto ſo much influenced the fluctuating opinions of the French, all thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who like M— are yet attached to France by endearing recollections of former connexion, or by the ties of intereſt, ſhould take advantage of the firſt moment which ſuch a change in that nation will allow, to bring back its attention to the diſcuſſion with which it began, and which was not decided by argument, but declamation; that of a ſupreme here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Executive Power, and a Legiſlative Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two diſtinct Houſes.</p>
               <p>The ſureſt way to accelerate this deſirable event, would be to enlighten the French nation, with reſpect to ſome great errors in their notions of the Britiſh Conſtitution; the object which they ought always to have kept in view. Their preſent leaders endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to confirm them in thoſe errors; becauſe they believe, and with reaſon, that their power depends on keeping the people in ignorance of the way to true liberty; an object to which they know that nothing conduces more than repreſenting the Engliſh as (to uſe their own expreſſion) <hi>ſlaves at home, and tyrants on the ſeas.</hi> How happy ſhould I be, if I could in any degree accelerate liberty in the one nation, by doing juſtice to the enjoyment of it in the other!</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of ſome Prejudices of the French reſpecting the Britiſh Conſtitution.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AMONG the great number of well-informed men in France, before the preſent Revolution, nothing was more uncommon than to find any who had tolerably correct ideas of the Britiſh Conſtitution; and it muſt be owned that in general the Engliſh who travelled there took no great pains to inform them on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Whether it is that the Engliſh are too much inclined to believe that few foreigners can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the principles of ſo complicated ſyſtem; or that, with a view to complete the contraſt between the character of the two nations, the Engliſh ſtudiouſly affect to be indifferent to the opinion of foreigners; or that, from a principle of humanity, they are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when abroad, to remind other nations of their want of liberty; and on that account are afraid of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing too ſtrongly the conviction which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in every thought, and manifeſted in every action of an Engliſhman, <hi>that he, and he only, is free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Till Mr. De Lolme publiſhed his work, thoſe of the French who had any opinion at all on the ſubject, were almoſt all extravagant in praiſing the Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or equally extravagant in condemning it.</p>
               <p>The former conſidered it as a ſyſtem truly divine, unconnected with any human paſſions, the perfection of political virtue; while, on the contrary, it goes ſo
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:048483_0098_102535FE797ACC48"/>
entirely upon a conſciouſneſs of human imperfection, that it may very properly be called a complete ſyſtem of <hi>human correction.</hi> It does not proceed upon the impoſſible ſpeculation of eradicating the paſſions, or governing without them; but its arrangements are adapted to limit their career, to direct them to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſocial life, and even to govern by their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Next came the cenſurers, who formed their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, partly from writers as ignorant as themſelves; and partly from the parliamentary debates, in which they underſtood every hyperbolical, metaphorical, or declamatory expreſſion, in a literal ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt they gravely told you <hi>that the King is always carrying on a ſecret war againſt the Conſtitution;</hi> which has very little other meaning than that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has provided effectually againſt open hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>Next they told you <hi>that the Houſe of Peers is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a ſort of advanced poſt to the Crown, where the Nobles act the part of ſentinels ana ſpies;—that the Peerage is evidently a ſatellite of the Crown, and only ſerves to ſtrengthen it againſt the nation.</hi> Now, no one diſputes but that the Peers are intended to guard the Crown, and that their ſituation does make them a ſort of advanced poſt for its protection; but that poſt is defenſive only: they have no privileges which give them the ſmalleſt power of attacking the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rights of the Commons; and their political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, as a body, depends as much on preventing the deſpotiſm, as on maintaining the prerogatives of the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No matter,</hi> ſay the French of the preſent day; <hi>an hereditary Nobility is nothing but a great impoſition upon ſociety; it is an infringement of thoſe equal rights which all men derive from nature.</hi> But admitting it is ſo, does it not prevent many other greater, and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous infringements? Are not eminent talents an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement made by nature herſelf, of that perfect equality of right which is the foundation-ſtone in the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:048483_0099_1025360D4324CF40"/>
new ſyſtems of government? Can any human regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations prevent that <hi>Ariſtocracy of talents</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This Ariſtocracy was the firſt which offended French vanity, after it was ſuppoſed that the titled and privileged Ariſtocracy was annihilated. In ſome ſitting of the preſent Convention, but on what occaſion I do not recollect, a member roſe to move <hi>That Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet ſhould not be ſuffered to cruſh it with the weight of the Ariſtocracy of his talents.</hi>
                  </note> complained of in the Convention? Can we conceive a ſociety which can prevent the Ariſtocracy of riches? and does not this latter even increaſe in proportion as a State is well governed? Is it leſs greedy, or more enlightened, than an hereditary Nobility? Is not this latter ſpecies of Ariſtocracy the beſt, indeed the only counterpoiſe, in a great State, to the former? Is the arrogance of upſtarts leſs grating to the people, from among whom they came, or is their familiar inſolence leſs inſulting, than the haughty diſtance of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Nobility?</p>
               <p>Certainly there is in the Britiſh Conſtitution, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or rather an hereditary Peerage; I will add too, that the ſingle privilege which it poſſeſſes, is by its nature much ſuperior to the whole multitude of petty privileges belonging to the nobles of all other countries in Europe: and let the French mention, if they can, any of the privileges of the Britiſh Peerage which are burdenſome to the people, or in any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to it.</p>
               <p>The French are much miſtaken, if they think that in this country wealth is enough to procure nobility; or that, if wealth could purchaſe it, it would give that exemption from taxes which is the ordinary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it in moſt other countries. The Britiſh Peerage can hardly be ſaid to poſſeſs more than one excluſive privilege,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>As members of one of the Houſes of Parliament, Peers are exempt from arreſt for debt; but their property may be ſeized for the uſe of their creditors, without any diſtinction even of the Princes of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>And though the Peers have the privilege of being tried by their own body for criminal offences, yet their puniſhment, if convicted, is the ſame as that of a commoner. Henry V. while Prince of Wales, was impriſoned by order of a Judge, of the name of Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne, for having aſſaulted him on the Bench. Should any foreigner conſider this example as of too remote a date, they may be referred to another. While this publication was writing, an Engliſh Peer was under impriſonment by ſentence of the Court of King's-Bench, for having publiſhed a libel on an Attorney, in a news-paper.</p>
                  </note> which no doubt is a very great
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:048483_0100_1025361CF286FB78"/>
one, and that is, the hereditary right of ſucceeding to a ſeat in the Houſe of Lords. I acknowledge that this is a privilege of great importance: but before it is cenſured as improper, it may be worth conſidering whether that hereditary ſucceſſion has not a ſtrong tendency to defend the fundamental principles of the Conſtitution, as well as to preſerve certain great maxims of State, which might elſe be in danger, in caſe of the coincidence of a general election, with any violent popular agitation. No one can be ignorant of the effect which popular agitation muſt always have, in a greater or leſs degree, on an aſſembly elected by the people. The moſt zealous friend even of Democracy will not deny, that it often prevents ſound judgment, and that any check upon its innovating ſpirit is wiſe, and ſhould be adopted.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be recollected that the Britiſh Peers are by no means numerous<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Houſe of Lords conſiſts at preſent of 274 members, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Biſhops and the ſixteen Scotch Peers. The French Nobility was certainly blind to its own intereſts, in not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſcreen itſelf from the ſtorm, before it was too late, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing into France, inſtead of their uſeleſs privileges, a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their body in a houſe analogous to the Britiſh Houſe of Lords; either partly hereditary and partly elective, or elſe entirely elective.</p>
                     <p>On this Note the Tranſlator wiſhes to remark, that he doubts whether an elective repreſentation of any particular claſs in a State, eſpecially if periodical, has not a tendency to create a diſtinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt by no means conſiſtent with the common good. In the preſent inſtance, an hereditary Upper Houſe, formed by a ſelection from the French Nobility, would certainly be more favourable to the aſcendancy of a Lower Houſe, repreſenting the People, than a periodically-elective repreſentation of the Nobility, and perhaps than any other ſpecies of Senate which can be invented. A peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical or occaſional election of repreſentatives of the Ariſtocracy of a country, under whatever name or form, gives it one common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and a diſpoſition to act in concert for ſupporting it: whereas the Britiſh Conſtitution divides the Ariſtocratic influence, by having a ſmall political Ariſtocracy diſtinct from, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon, that general Ariſtocracy, which is founded in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient family, and extenſive landed property; which, in a tranquil ſtate of ſociety, no poſſible arrangements can long prevent; and which no political folly can be greater than the adoption of any regulations for preventing.</p>
                     <p>The Nobles of the preſent generation in France, who are really men of ancient families and extenſive poſſeſſions, and who muſt neceſſarily have been excluded from all immediate chance of the Peerage, might, from prejudice of habit, feel themſelves degraded; but their poſterity would feel the advantage of the full influence of a ſuperiority derived from thoſe circumſtances, unimpaired by any artificial diſtinctions, or any privileges tending to excite the jealouſy of the people, and keep the two parties in a ſtate of perpetual political warfare. But whatever might be decided as to the mode of forming an Upper Houſe, the members of it ſhould on no account, if elective, be all at once renewed, or be elected for a ſhort period.</p>
                  </note> enough to eclipſe the people; that,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:048483_0101_1025363071EBD0D0"/>
as the bulk of the eſtate uſually goes with the title, their fortune gives them the means of a good education; and that, as their privilege is limited to judicial and political functions, it is only by a good education, and by the knowledge and the decorum of character, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in thoſe functions, that they can hope to derive any material advantage from their privilege. Education and practice create ability; and one may judge from this circumſtance only, that, as a body, the Britiſh Nobility can never preſent, what is but too often ſeen in other countries, ignorance, pride, and poverty united. The ſame circumſtance too gives them the ability to manage their private affairs better than the Nobility of other countries; and obliges them to be more attentive to character, becauſe their conſequence depends ſo much on public opinion.</p>
               <p>Nor is this all: for the younger branches of their families, by being blended with the general maſs, form a durable connexion between the Commons to whom they belong, and the Peers from whom they are ſprung.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:048483_0102_1025366779B77788"/>This is the kind of Nobility which the Conſtituent Aſſembly ſhould have endeavoured to ſubſtitute, when, in their firſt delirium, they agitated the fatal decree which ſuppreſſed the rank of Nobility in France; a decree which, in its conſequences, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the deſtruction of thoſe who had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be of that order: for it led to the erection of all thoſe bloody tribunals which ſent them to the ſcaffold.</p>
               <p>But, at that important criſis, nothing would have more effectually quieted the fears and diſſipated the jealouſy of the <hi>Tiers Etat,</hi> than telling them, that though there is an order of Nobility eſtabliſhed in England, yet in point of taxation, or in any other reſpect, there is no difference between them and the Commons; that the word <hi>Commoner</hi> has no debaſing ſenſe attached to it, nor is a noble family conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as diſgraced by an alliance with one of that claſs:<note n="*" place="bottom">The original is, "there are no words in the language of that nation for <hi>roture</hi> and <hi>méſalliance.</hi>"—The obſervation is perfectly juſt, and accounts for the paraphraſe to which the Tranſlator has been obliged to reſort, in order to expreſs the author's meaning.</note> that ſeats in the Houſe of Peers are often the reward of diſtinguiſhed talents; and that thoſe who are ſo introduced into it, are not treated as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts and intruders, but with the reſpect due to their merit; and that, at the very time wher the National Aſſembly was declaiming againſt the haughty Houſe of Peers, the two individuals of that body who were next, in point of rank, to the Royal Family, were both born of parents not above the middle claſs of life.<note n="†" place="bottom">One of them, the late Lord Chancellor, when according to the rules of the Houſe of Peers he delivered in his pedigree, only mentioned in it the names of his father and mother. The defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his opinion has not been leſs, becauſe his pedigree was not longer.</note> It is not now, perhaps, too late to preſent the following obſervation to the <hi>Tiers Etat</hi> of France, which has often excited my own admiration; I mean, that Great-Britain, where, without doubt, Nobility
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:048483_0103_102536734559DF80"/>
is more valuable, and therefore more deſirable than in any other country, is yet the only one where there are a number of ancient and opulent families who have little or no inclination to be raiſed to that rank. Such is the effect of a Conſtitution which makes every rank reſpectable, and which can beſtow its honours without humbling thoſe who do not partake of them!</p>
               <p>But, in fact, thoſe who declaim, in France, againſt the Britiſh Conſtitution, inveigh chiefly againſt the Houſe of Commons. <q>That Houſe," ſay they, holds the ſtrings of the purſe; and if it is clamorous at any time, it is only with the hope of having its mouth ſtopped with gold. Thanks to the civil liſt, which it occaſionally takes care to increaſe, the Miniſters have always the means of bribing its members, and making them vote juſt as they pleaſe. If they do not give them money, they give them places; and when they have made their bargains, they can, with impunity, ſet public opinion at defiance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some truth perhaps there is in this, mingled with a great deal of error; and a few explanations are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to diſtinguiſh the one from the other.</p>
               <p>Without doubt, there exiſts a miniſterial influence; and partly by conferring places, partly by promiſing them, that influence is very extenſive. But before it is blamed, three points ſhould be conſidered: 1ſt, Whether a majority of the members are under that influence? 2dly, Whether that influence, to the extent under which it exiſts, is more pernicious than uſeful? 3dly, Whether it can be exerted in caſes which affect the liberty of the nation?</p>
               <p>With a view to a ſolution of theſe queſtions, I ſhall conſider the Houſe of Commons as divided into three claſſes. The firſt is compoſed of thoſe who ſupport the Miniſter, either from conſiderations of perſonal attachment, or as holding places under Government, or as looking forwards to them. The ſecond claſs
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:048483_0104_1025368982793978"/>
includes the Oppoſition, and conſiſts of thoſe who wiſh to ſupplant the Miniſtry, and of their intimate connexions, who would follow them into power, and participate in their adminiſtration. The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of thoſe who are not deſirous of taking an active part in government, whoſe ambition is to ſhew the pride of independence, and to watch over the intereſts of the nation, without caring much which party is at the helm.—This claſs is uſually more numerous than the Oppoſition, but perhaps leſs ſo than the immediate friends of Adminiſtration; and is a kind of neutral power, joining ſometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the one, ſometimes the other party, as it thinks moſt for the public good, and is ſure to carry victory with it. On unimportant queſtions it thinks it a duty not to oppoſe Adminiſtration, even though not entirely ſatisfied with it;<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is not only true of thoſe members who are independent of party, but even, in many inſtances, of thoſe who happen to be in Oppoſition; who, with whatever violence they may attack the members of Adminiſtration and their meaſures, yet, on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occaſions, conſider it as a maxim not to impede the ordinary progreſs of Government.</note> but if it be diſſatisfied on important queſtions, it then exerts its whole influence, and the Miniſter muſt give way to it.</p>
               <p>This is what deceives foreigners, when they think that the majority is entirely compoſed of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial party; though in fact the object of a very large proportion of that <hi>majority</hi> is, not to ſupport the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but only the Government. The members who conſider themſelves as independent of both parties, no doubt, cannot be exempt from the partialities of human nature; and may, from various circumſtances, have a preference for men or for meaſures, which may incline them more to one party than to the other; but their object is to act without being under the influence of either.</p>
               <p>Whether Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox be at the head of affairs, is not with them the moſt material point; but
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:048483_0105_102536969090B900"/>
that the intereſts of the nation do not ſuffer, and that the rights of their conſtituents are not infringed—This claſs is particularly attentive to the public opinion; and though it checks the current of it when proceeding too much from popular agitation, yet it always adopts it, when clear and decided; and always ſucceeds in obliging the Miniſter, either to change his meaſures, or to quit his place, if he obſtinately perſeveres in them.</p>
               <p>A majority muſt not be condemned in the maſs as corrupt, unleſs that majority ſupports the Miniſter on important queſtions, with the ſame implicit confidence as in the common buſineſs of government: but that is by no means the caſe: for, not to go any farther back than the preſent adminiſtration of Mr. Pitt, if foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers think that his name, his place, and his abilities, are magnets which draw to him on every occaſion an invincible majority, it is perhaps becauſe they have not obſerved that even Mr. Pitt, whom they conſider as ſo all-powerful, has ſeveral times been in a minority; and that ſeveral times, on having propoſed meaſures which he conſidered as important, but to which the public opinion was hoſtile, the very members who ſo generally ſupport him, have ſtrongly oppoſed him, and obliged him to withdraw them.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Thus, the Miniſters, in 1791, ſtopped their preparations for war againſt Ruſſia; and Mr. Pitt himſelf propoſed the repeal of the ſhop-tax, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If againſt this it is alledged, that the American war was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed in oppoſition to the general wiſh of the nation; I anſwer, that the American war was at firſt extremely popular, and ſtill more ſo when France took part in it; but as ſoon as it was become decidedly unpopular, the majority of the Houſe of Commons op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Lord North, and obliged him to reſign; ſo that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample confirms the aſſertion, inſtead of contradicting it. The peace which terminated that war, confirms it in a ſtill more ſtriking manner. It is now generally acknowledged that Lord Shelburne, who negociated that peace, did his country a moſt eſſential ſervice by it; yet, at the time when it was concluded, it occaſioned a great deal of diſcontent; the reſult was, that the Houſe of Commons again ſacrificed the Miniſtry to the public opinion.</p>

               <p>Another complaint is, that this Houſe repreſents the people unequally. This is not denied;<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is much more eaſy to diſcover an imperfection, than to apply a remedy. An imperfection in theory, no doubt it is; but it may be queſtioned whether it is ſo in practice. Mr. De Lolme ſays nothing on the ſubject; and Mr. Adams ſays no more than this: <q>If the people are not equally repreſented in the Houſe of Commons, this is a departure in practice from theory; if the Lords return members of the Houſe of Commons, this is an additional diſturbance of the balance: whether the Crown and the people, in ſuch a caſe, will not ſee the neceſſity of uniting in a remedy, are queſtions beyond my pretenſions.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I certainly agree with Mr. Adams, that the repreſentation of the people in the Houſe of Commons is not agreeable to the uſually-received theory of repreſentation; but I go no farther with him. For a little obſervation will ſhew that this abuſe in theory receives a great many uſeful modifications in practice; and one is aſtoniſhed to diſcover in it intereſts counterbalancing one another, which writers upon the ſubject have neglected to mention. For inſtance, I am much inclined to believe, that if the laſt project of parliamentary reform which came before the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had been adopted, an abſolute preponderance in that Houſe would have been given to the ancient and opulent families. That perhaps might have do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> no harm; but yet, it muſt be obſerved, that the rotten borough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, as they are called, give an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to many men of merit, with moderate fortunes, and little popular intereſt, of coming into Parliament, who would otherwiſe hardly find admiſſion there. In what way but this did both Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox begin their parliamentary career ſo young, in which both of them have rendered ſuch eſſential ſervices to their country?—But I abſtain from entering into a queſtion which, like Mr. Adams, I feel to be above my pretenſions, and which it would perhaps be unbecoming in a foreigner to attempt to diſcuſs.</p>
                     <p>Though the Author declines entering into the queſtion, the Tranſlator, as an Engliſhman, may be allowed to introduce a few remarks on ſo eſſential a part of the government of his country as the Conſtitution of the Houſe of Commons. It ſtrikes him that perhaps that even the theories of repreſentation, which are uſually adopted, are not free from imperfection in conſequence of more attention being given to the form than to the utility of the inſtitution. If in any inſtance utility is the chief object, then the conſideration of the moſt effectual means of promoting that utility ſhould be principally attended to; and if thoſe means are not morally wrong, they muſt be politically right. What then, I think, might theoretically be wiſhed for, in an Aſſembly repreſenting the people, is, 1ſt, That the perſons compoſing it ſhould be influenced by public opinion, on all ſubjects, where the circumſtances are ſo much within the ſcope of general obſervation that the judgment of the public can be found and deciſive; 2dly, That they ſhould not be under the controul of popular agitations; 3dly, That no particular deſcription or claſs of the people ſhould have a dangerouſly-preponderating influence over them.</p>
                     <p>In theory then, the conſtruction of a national repreſentative body ſhould be ſuch, that amid the rivalries of different occupations, and of different ranks, no one ſhould have a preponderance over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e others. If either population, landed property, commerce, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>anufactures, have ſuch a preponderance, the deciſions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ected body muſt be proportionably partial; and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on the injuſtice, it is enough to conſider the impolicy of ſuch a ſyſtem.—If again an attempt is made, as in ſome ſmall Republics it has been made, to give to each deſcription of perſons a right of electing a fixed proportion of the whole elected body; this moſt evidently conſtitutes it, in a way which forms a demar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the different intereſts, and by which the repreſentatives become rather the agents and committees of their reſpective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, than men acting with one common motive, to one common end—the public good.</p>
                     <p>Without entering into a detailed application of theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Britiſh Houſe of Commons, I will only obſerve, that the very different conſtruction of the electoral bodies, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderance of different ranks and occupations in different electoral bodies, actually give a repreſentation of each, and in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree a repreſentation by each; while, at the ſame time, this is done without at all marking out the different deſcriptions of people, as by a cenſus; without proclaiming hoſtilities between them; and with ſuch ſhades of difference as prevent the prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of any one deſcription, to the injury of the reſt. Such practically is the Britiſh Houſe of Commons: how far the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate influence of each claſs is ſuch as beſt contributes to the common good, the experience of its conduct will determine better than any abſtract ſpeculation; and that will moſt evidently prove, 1ſt, That the perſons compoſing it are influenced by public opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on all ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Theſe reſtrictions and limitations have been ſo far from weakening the ſtrength of Government, that they have tended very conſiderably to increaſe it, by increaſing the confidence of the public, which is too well aſſured of its freedom, and too conſcious of its ſtrength, to be terrified or impoſed upon by thoſe who
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:048483_0111_10253799A8341570"/>
for their own purpoſes, would wiſh to keep it in a ſtate of conſtant alarm. The nation at large cares very little who is Miniſter; and is, perhaps, leſs attentive to his conduct than it would otherwiſe be, if it did not know that the Oppoſition is ever on the watch for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to recommend itſelf to favour, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of the ſlighteſt appearance of danger; and if it did not alſo know that the independent party in Parliament is ever at hand to interfere, and to prevent the danger (if there be any) from becoming fatal.</p>
               <p>Whence come ſo many important ameliorations, and within ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, but from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the Conſtitution which renders it capable of ſelf-improvement, as well as ſelf-protection? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that the Parliament, though unequally elected, either is ſo corrupt, or ſo diſpoſed to indulge corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is ſometimes believed: this principle in the Conſtitution puts it out of danger of thoſe convulſions which <hi>regeneration</hi> has occaſioned in France, and gives it a ſlow, but ſure, and uninterrupted tendency towards every ſort of amelioration; and makes it what D'Argenſon called the perfection of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a <hi>perpetual innovation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This chain of happy alterations ſufficiently proves, in my opinion, that the conſtruction of the Britiſh Parliament diſpoſes it, of its own will, to adopt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of improvement depending on times and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; for it muſt be obſerved, that none of theſe meaſures were forced upon it by any popular commotions, and all of them were well conſidered and deliberately adopted.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of ſuch a Conſtitution, containing a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf-improvement, Abbé Sieyes has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the opinions of the French Nation in favour of the American ſyſtem of Conventions. In his diſcourſe on the <hi>Veto,</hi> he ſeems to pity the ignorance of the Engliſh in not diſcovering ſo infallible a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal remedy; whereas the very ſecurity of the Britiſh
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:048483_0112_102537C244545278"/>
Conſtitution ariſes preciſely from its never wanting it; from there being a well-conſtructed and well-balanced Legiſlature, and from this Legiſlature being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlimited in the uſe of its powers. <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whether occaſional, or periodical, anſwer no other end but to produce a public fermentation, to which ambitious men will look forward, and by which they will endeavour to advance themſeves by ſowing trouble and diſcord: their tendency is to diminiſh the confidence of the people in their regular Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſemblies; to impede public buſineſs by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual doubts of their competency to treat it; to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the formation of a conſtitutional law, of which that body can beſt determine the propriety, to a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly, which can neither have the ſame general experience, nor the ſame means of judging of the convenience or neceſſity of the propoſition.— Beſides, whenever a Convention meets, every thing muſt neceſſarily be in commotion; all ideas are revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary, and ſober deliberation is at an end. A Convention, and eſpecially a French Convention, would think it a point of honour not to part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing ſomething; and innovations would be made, merely to avoid the diſgrace of not having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated. Not one of theſe inconveniences attends the Britiſh Parliament, which enjoys the plenitude of legiſlative power. None conteſt its authority; it has no diſtinct political body behind it, to ſuſpend, or modify, or reverſe its decrees; and it is always able to change the exiſting laws, or adapt them to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>It is really aſtoniſhing that experience has not yet corrected this erroneous opinion of the French on the nature of Conventions. By the new plan which Cambaceres lately preſented, it may be obſerved that they ſtill retain the abſurd notion of limiting the powers of the legiſlative body, and of not permitting it to touch any of the conſtitutional laws. If they

ſtill perſiſt in having Conventions, either extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or periodical, they may be aſſured that Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution muſt ſucceed Revolution, and the nation be perpetually on the eve of civil war.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid reſpecting the Britiſh Conſtitution, as it appears in practice, I am ſenſible, is but an imperfect ſketch; for the ſubject, even if I were capable of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more accurately, is much too extenſive, as well as too profound, for the limits of a pamphlet, written in haſte, and on the ſpur of the occaſion. My only object, in this Chapter, has been to turn the attention of the French to the abſurdity of that declamatory abuſe of the Britiſh Conſtitution, which, for five years paſt, has been employed to prejudice them againſt it, and induce them to think it as vicious in practice, as it is perfect in theory. All I deſire is, to be able to correct ſome of the prevailing errors among them on this ſubject, and to induce them to believe it worth a fuller examination, and to read the publications which develope the elements of it. The moſt complete work on this ſubject is certainly that of Mr. De Lolme; none more clearly explains its principles, or is more explicit, on the manner in which its different branches are a check upon one another, and on the ſecurity it gives to perſonal liberty.</p>
               <p>In France, I hardly know more than two authors who have comprehended, or have done juſtice to it;<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is plain that Monteſquiou admired the Britiſh Conſtitution, and was well acquainted with its excellencies; but perhaps he thought it prudent not to diſcloſe them in France.</p>
                     <p>Lately, in the Conſtituent Aſſembly, ſome of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed members of that body, Malouet, Mounier, and Lally, recommended it, and propoſed the adoption of it; but the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which they were ſilenced, ſufficiently proves, how little the French were at that time prepared for a political Revolution.</p>
                  </note> I mean, Mr. Necker, and Mr. de Calonne. Of thoſe, the former has undoubtedly conſidered the ſubject with moſt attention, and underſtands it beſt; and he too can ſay, with Mr. De Lolme:—"Born in a free
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:048483_0114_102537F38297BA10"/>
State, though of a ſmall extent, I not only have a native love of liberty, but have heard all the queſtions diſcuſſed which relate to it.—Is not the vital principle the ſame in an inſect, as in an elephant? Is any one leſs able to ſtudy the republic of beavers, becauſe he has long been employed in ſtudying that of the bees?" Mr. de Calonne's reſidence in England gave him an opportunity of ſeeing the Britiſh Conſtitution in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and he openly recommended it to his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without recollecting that they would probably anſwer: "<hi>Genius invents, and ſcorns to imitate;</hi> we will not condeſcend to tread in the footſteps of the Engliſh."</p>
               <p>It is a circumſtance worthy remarking, that the two firſt writers who attempted to recommend the Britiſh Conſtitution to the French, were rival Miniſters of Finance. Oppoſite and hoſtile on every other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; in this, and in this only, they agree, that the Britiſh Conſtitution, which both have ſtudied, and both admire, may by ſome modifications be gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally introduced into France.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the moſt unfortunate ſtep of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Aſſembly, is one for which it has been very little cenſured; I mean, its having voted the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, exactly as the Convention has ſince voted the Republic,—by acclamation. If that Aſſembly had but calmly and gravely debated the important queſtion of limited Monarchy; ſuch a diſcuſſion, if carried to a ſufficient extent, and cloſely inveſtigated, might have ſhewn the French a great number of valuable political truths, which they were at that time ſtill capable of attending to, and which might then have made a deep and laſting impreſſion. But another opportunity may ſoon offer. Equally diſſatisfied with the extremes of abſolute Monarchy, and lawleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, it is impoſſible but that the great majority of the nation ſhould now wiſh for ſomething between
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:048483_0115_1025380F12A97B28"/>
both. France, by the reflux of public opinion, may be brought back to the leaders with whom ſhe began, and whoſe wiſh was a limited Monarchy: if that ſhould ever happen, it is to be hoped that dear-bought experience will have taught them to deliberate before they decide.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>PEACE is the univerſal and earneſt prayer of all the Powers at war with France. Why will not the French then at laſt ſee the abyſs into which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the preſent Convention is precipitating them? Can it be poſſible that they ſtill deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Do they ſtill imagine that a government can be renovated amid the din of arms, and the dangers of war? or that famine at home can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by employing the ſtrength of their country in maintaining a precarious poſſeſſion of deſolated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts?</p>
            <p>What can they hope to gain by prolonging this bloody conteſt? Is it glory? They have already borne down all oppoſition. Do they wiſh for more conqueſts? Thoſe they have already made have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured them more than a diminution of territory would have done. What then prevents them? Falſe ſhame. They will not ſubmit to the humiliation of reſtitution. But which is leaſt humiliating—a retreat from choice, or a retreat from evident neceſſity? What humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can there be in reſtoring what they have taken, to enemies whom they have vanquiſhed? And as to Great-Britain, can they doubt a moment but that ſuch an unequivocal proof of their pacific diſpoſition would produce a ſimilar diſpoſition in her? Do they fear that the Princes at war with them will take advantage of ſuch reſtitutions, to renew the conteſt on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier?
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:048483_0117_1025384741DD3FC8"/>
That <hi>frontier of iron</hi> is an impenetrable ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt any ſuch enterpriſe. Europe is more than ever convinced of the defenſive ſtrength of France, and the military ſpirit of its inhabitants. They need fear nothing but from themſelves; none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ever be able to deſolate that fertile country, deſtroy its population, and deaden its induſtry; none but themſelves can ever make her the prey of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, by making her too feeble for reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Six months have elapſed ſince their leaders avowed that the nation <hi>longs for internal tranquillity, and the happineſs it gives.</hi> This has been openly avowed in the Convention itſelf; and yet not one ſtep has been taken by that body, that indicates a deſire of peace with Britain; without which, <hi>internal tranquillity</hi> is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The Convention not only ſees, but publiſhes to the world, the deſtitute condition of France; and yet, inſtead of making any advances towards the only peace which can give them a chance of relief from abroad for the want they feel at home, they perſiſt in repreſenting <hi>a war at ſea againſt Great-Britain, as abſolutely neceſſary.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Obſerve what Pelet ſays of the views of the Committees, as to Great-Britain, in a ſtatement of the interior and exterior ſituation of France; which the Convention ordered to be printed, April the 8th.—"<hi>We hoped to have no longer more than one</hi> NECESSARY <hi>war to ſupport; that is, a war at ſea againſt England, whoſe power and inſolence our united force would he ſufficient to cruſh.</hi> Is it by ſuch language that the leaders of the Convention mean to diſarm Britain and her Allies!</p>
                  <p>If ſuch language could diſarm the Engliſh, I imagine that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after their <hi>pride</hi> would not often be talked of! Impartial perſons may decide which of the two nations is at preſent moſt infected with this vice, by comparing the declarations of the Convention, and the ſpeeches and reports printed by its order, with the vote of both Houſes of Parliament—"<hi>That they rely on the deſire uniformly manifeſted by his Majeſty, to effect a pacification on juſt and honourable grounds, with any Government in France, under whatever form, which ſhall appear capable of maintaining the accuſtomed relations of peace and amity with other countries.</hi> If the Convention had wiſhed at all for peace with England, this gave an opening, which, if it had been followed by ſome equally conciliatory counter-declaration, might have probably led to additional proofs of a diſpoſition to treat, on the part of this country. But the more this country deſires a peace, the more active the Convention is in taking meaſures to make it impoſſible. A ſufficient proof of this is the inflammatory proclamation addreſſed by it on the 29th of May, to the Toulon fleet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brave Seamen! War, war with the Engliſh! It is they who ſeek to divide you, and to corrupt you. It is they who, afraid to encounter you at ſea, have endeavoured to detain you in port.</hi> WAR, WAR, <hi>with the Engliſh!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worth obſerving, that nearly at the time when the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was thus proclaiming war againſt the Engliſh, the two Houſes of Parliament were debating whether it would not be proper to make further advances towards a reconciliation.</p>
               </note> It is, I acknowledge, abſolutely
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:048483_0118_102538632E61C398"/>
neceſſary to the ambition of thoſe who lead the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and to the exiſtence of the Republic they have made; for they ſtill retain the ſpirit, though they dare not, as a body, <hi>avow</hi> the language of their incendiary decree of the 19th of November, 1792.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>This decree, it is well known, was the work of the Giron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt party, which is now again triumphant, and which acting upon it in its fulleſt extent, in the affair with Geneva, refuſed to ratify a treaty, by declaring, <hi>that the only one admiſſible was a communication of principles.</hi> Though the authors of that decree have ſuffered it to ſleep, yet, every now and then, they diſcover their intention of bringing it into action again whenever it ſuits their convenience. Of this, I think, the following ludicrous tranſactions in the Convention, on the 26th and 27th of April, are clear evidence.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th, Gregoire concluded a pompous harangue, by propoſing <hi>a declaration of the Rights of Nations,</hi> much in the ſame ſtyle as that <hi>of the Rights of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 4th Article declares, <hi>that nations, when at war, ſhould do one another as little miſchief as poſſible;</hi> and this extremely philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic article was applauded by the very ſame men who have been barbarians enough to ſend a ſquadron to deſtroy the humane eſtabliſhment of Sierra Leone; the object of which was a gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous attempt to prevent, what they talk ſo much of preventing— Slavery.</p>
                  <p>The 14th Article declares, that <hi>treaties which have for their object an offenſive war, are high treaſon againſt the family of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> And this too, the Convention applauded, though they well knew that at that very time their Deputies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting an <hi>offenſive</hi> as well as defenſive alliance with the United Provinces.</p>
                  <p>The 7th Article declares, <hi>that a nation has no right to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere in the government of other nations.</hi> What is meant by <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the next article explains; which expreſsly declares, THAT NO GOVERNMENTS ARE CONFORMABLE TO THE RIGHTS OF NATIONS, BUT ONLY SUCH AS ARE FOUNDED ON LIBERTY AND EQUALITY.</p>
                  <p>The next day, however, Merlin of Douay mounted the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune in great haſte, and announced in the name of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Public Safety,</hi> 
                     <q>That all Europe having heard their declaration, never to examine, much leſs never to cenſure, the fundamental principles, or the organization of foreign governments; it is material to the Republic, and poſſibly to the ſafety of all Europe, to repeal the decree of the preceding evening, that ordered the printing of a ſpeech, and of a declaration of the rights of nations which had been read in that Aſſembly. The Committee, ſaid he, has obſerved in both, <hi>principles which you cannot</hi> AVOW. I need not mention what might be the conſequences of ſuch opinions ſpread through Europe <hi>in the preſent moment.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>"As it is imagined that my ſpeech contains ſomething improper,"</hi> ſaid Gregoire, <q>I ſecond the motion; but I ought to mention, that perhaps, by this time, it has appeared in ſome of the papers;</q>
which was really <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I may, perhaps, be told, that theſe ought to be conſidered as two additional recanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ns. But are theſe recantations much leſs alarming than the decree? Neither the ſpirit of this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor the intentions of the propagandiſt, Gregoire, are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. <hi>They are pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amity with Great-Britain might teach their people the means of obtaining true liberty. The declaimers in the Convention are for ever talking of a war with Great-Britain, and yet for ever confeſſing their inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to maintain it. Their firſt and laſt reſource muſt ſoon be at an end: and yet ſtill they can ſay, with an air of ſurpriſe, <hi>The Engliſh Miniſtry feign a belief that France is exhauſted.</hi> The Engliſh Miniſtry, then, is not to believe their own declarations; and is unable
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:048483_0120_1025388129039688"/>
to obſerve with what haſty ſteps France is now veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the remark of La Reveillère, about three months ago, in the Convention: <hi>Revolution follows Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, when the whole circle is gone round, we come back to the point from which we ſet out—Deſpotiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every ſitting of the Convention, every debate proves that the Republic is already falling to pieces, and that its ruin is inevitable. One day the conquerors of the Baſtille come to announce to the Convention, that they <hi>almoſt regret what they have ſacrificed for the Republic.</hi> Then comes a Section to aſk for <hi>bread!</hi> while another orders it <hi>to make haſte, and reſtore the aſſignats to their original credit.</hi> A third comes with a requeſt which is not leſs impoſſible, <hi>to clear up the inextricable labyrinth of the finances.</hi> A fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts againſt the Democratic Conſtitution of May, 1793, to which that Section had ſworn fidelity; and inſiſts, <hi>that it is a virtue to break a wicked oath.</hi> The unhappy people at laſt begins to open its eyes, and will ſoon find that revolution and equality have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to penury, famine, and perjury.</p>
            <p>What then are we to think of the caution with which the Author of <hi>Reflections on Peace</hi> has avoided ſaying a word on the finances of France? After ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>England as a cultivated country, which trembles under the feet of Mr. Pitt,</hi> why did not ſhe ſtrengthen her argument, by diſplaying the means which France has in reſerve for continuing a war, which, we are to believe, will, if continued, aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize her ſtill more than at preſent, by conqueſts more extenſive. A few words on the ſubject ſhe does ſay, (p. 7): <hi>As to the treaſures of the Convention, they are the fortune of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ruling party, is the brilliant diſcourſe of Pelet, the 8th of laſt April, which was printed by order of the Convention. After citing, word for word, ſome paſſages from this favourite publication, <hi>the Reflections on Peace,</hi> and, among others, that which I have juſt quoted, he adds, with the thoughtleſsneſs of a true Frenchman: <hi>Theſe pompous terms</hi>—<q>public good, and love of our country,</q> 
               <hi>are in every one's mouth; yet few of us think it honourable to be virtuous and poor; all want to be rich. The moſt dangerous enemy we have, is an unfeeling and BARBAROUS SELFISHNESS. The dearneſs of every ſort of commodity is beyond calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; a month, a day, an hour raiſes the price to a degree which proves the moſt alarming and immoral avarice, a real dearth, the want of public confidence, diſſatisfaction with the preſent, and fear of the future.</hi> WHERE WILL THIS ALARMING PROGRESSION END? Not with partial peaces; not while the ſtrength of their country is exhauſted in defending conqueſts; not till there is real amity with Great-Britain.— And yet in this ſame ſpeech, which I imagine he did not wiſh ſhould be unheard of in London, he ſtill propoſes <hi>to cruſh England!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh I had no greater complaint againſt my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent than errors of thoughtleſsneſs, and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments as theſe. But what can excuſe her grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying her paſſion for making an impreſſion on the Continent, by inſinuating that the Britiſh Parliament rejects a peace for no other reaſon, but that <hi>perhaps Mr. Pitt muſt reſign the conduct of the negociation into other hands. A peace,</hi> ſays M —, <hi>would recall Mr. Fox to the Miniſtry: Mr. Pitt's only alarm ariſes from this dilemma. Is it for the nation to think as he does? Cannot England exiſt, unleſs Mr. Pitt be the Miniſter?</hi>

               <pb n="121" facs="unknown:048483_0122_102538A292648EA0"/>On this ſubject M— may be perfectly eaſy: whether the nation prefer Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox; at any rate, it will not allow France, or the friends of France, to dictate who ſhall be its negociator. And as to the exiſtence of England, it does not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depend on either the one or the other. Great as the talents of both are, the kingdom is not quite ſo deſtitute of men of ability, judgment, and integrity, as that it muſt ceaſe to be a nation if it loſes them both. The great body of the nation which ſupports the war, and <hi>which is accuſed of ſupporting it only for the ſake of Mr. Pitt,</hi> has not ſo entirely loſt its uſual ſtrong ſenſe and ſound judgment, as not to diſcover plain facts, which do not want ſplendid talents to point them out, and which the moſt ſplendid talents cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.—That the French were the aggreſſors in this war; that the miſery to which it has reduced them, and of which modern times cannot furniſh another example, renders them abſolutely unable to carry it on, againſt the Britiſh dominions, with any advantage; and that, in point of equity, the aggreſſors ſhould firſt offer to terminate hoſtilities, and, if ſacrifices are to be made, ſhould be the firſt to make them. The inhabitants of theſe iſlands are not children in the ſchool of politics; ſound judgment, formed by long practice of political diſcuſſion, has convinced them, that Britain muſt, at any riſk, prevent the aggrandiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of France, and leave nothing undone to preſerve the balance of power in Europe.</p>
            <p>Self-evident as theſe propoſitions are, we now hear them called with contempt, the <hi>old-faſhioned maxims of an antiquated ſyſtem;</hi> and the Britiſh Parliament has of courſe, either from corruption or ignorance, been blind for more than a century. Can it then have no other reaſons for ſupporting Mr. Pitt, but a ſcramble for places? Can its firm adherence to the preſent Miniſtry, be no otherwiſe accounted for, than by reducing the firſt Senate in the univerſe, to the

            <p>And it is at the foot of the mountains of Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that theſe ſtrange inſinuations are haſarded! Does an author at that diſtance preſume to ſpeak ſo confidently and ſo lightly of the diſpoſition and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a great nation, of intrigues which direct the deliberations of its Parliament, and perſonal motives which influence its Miniſters?—Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with having recourſe to ſuch groundleſs aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe conjures up ſupernatural aid. <hi>Shade of Lord Chatham, appear from the bottom of thy tomb, and demand back thy name from thy ſon!</hi> A name to which that ſon has not added leſs celebrity, than it received from his father, who expired while conjuring his country to oppoſe the aggrandiſement of France!

theſe pernicious prejudices againſt him, which are the real cauſes of the continuation of the war with England? Why not ſhew them the free Conſtitution which Corſica has adopted, ſince her emancipation from France; and which is ſurely a ſufficient proof that no idea is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this country, of compelling other nations to adopt the letter of her own Conſtitution, or of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving any people who wiſh to be free? But what is at preſent carefully concealed from the French, and which, notwithſtanding it is of the utmoſt importance they ſhould know, is, that the preſent war neither is, nor ever has been, on the part of this country, a war of ambition, or envy, but of mere ſelf-defence: there is not a man in it, with any pretenſions to good ſenſe, who has joined in the war on any other ground than a conviction of its neceſſity; who does not ſincerely regret that there is ſtill the ſame neceſſity of continuing it; who does not think it the beſt policy this country can adopt, to make, if poſſible, a laſting peace with France; and does not ſincerely wiſh that the latter ſhould be happy and tranquil, neither diſturbed by her neighbours, nor extending her frontiers at their expence.</p>
            <p>I know well that the Committees of the Convention need not be informed of theſe truths.—They have been aware of them a long time; and the only reaſon why they conceal them from the people is, to have one pretence more for protracting the war. But as it is plain that their object, in protracting the war, is to preſerve their own political exiſtence, and to retard the return of the armies; to put off the dreadful day when they will be made to account for all the blood which has been ſo unneceſſarily ſhed abroad, and ſo baſely ſhed at home; the armies ſhould be excited to accelerate the work of peace, and give freedom to their country.</p>

            <p>THE original of this Tranſlation having been ſent to the preſs more than a month ago; and various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances having happened in the interval, to prove the moderation of my calculations, and the truth of my hypotheſis; it may not be uſeleſs to give a ſummary view of thoſe events, which I ſhall divide under two principal heads.</p>
            <p>1ſt, The Fall of the Aſſignats. 2d, The Fall of the Republic.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Fall of the Aſſignats.</head>
               <p>Every debate of the Convention on this ſubject proves, that, far from having been betrayed into any exaggeration, I was even more moderate than was neceſſary, in the greater part of the inductions which I made in the Second Chapter, relative to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively-increaſing emiſſions, the rapid depreciation, and the probable annihilation of the aſſignats.</p>
               <p>With an intention of avoiding any ſort of exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration, I only aſſumed that the remaining expence of the preſent year, might require an emiſſion of aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats in the proportion of the month of Nivoſe, and that ſuch an emiſſion would add about five milliards to the maſs. But it now appears that the deficiency of the two months of Pluvioſe and Germinal was
<list>
                     <item>Of Pluvioſe, 443 millions of livres.</item>
                     <item>Of Germinal, 660 millions of livres.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>So that aſſignats to the amount of very nearly forty-four millions ſterling muſt have been iſſued, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:048483_0128_10253988FACB73E0"/>
the expences of thoſe two months only. From every appearance, we have reaſon to think, that the month of Floreal, which ended on the 20th of May, muſt have required an emiſſion of a milliard. So that, inſtead of withdrawing four milliards of the old aſſignats from circulation (a meaſure which, laſt December, the Convention allowed to be indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable), it will have added, between that time and the 20th of May, about three milliards to the ſeven or eight which were then in circulation. And, as to the progreſſive loſs of their remaining value, I ſaid (page the 28th) that, <hi>if they continue to fall at the rate of</hi> 5 <hi>per cent. every two months, in a very ſhort time they will not be worth circulating.</hi> But as, during a Revolution, circumſtances may happen to defeat the moſt plauſible conjectures, I allowed that this event might be <hi>delayed to the end of the year, or beyond it.</hi> The higheſt calculations however have proved neareſt to the truth; for, from the laſt accounts received from different provinces of France, it appears that, between the end of March and the end of May, the aſſignats loſt more than one half of their remaining value.</p>
               <p>If we add to the above-mentioned circumſtances, that thoſe who have purchaſed the confiſcated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, become daily more inſecure, and, from what Chenier ſaid on the 1ſt of May, are already conſidered as ſacrilegious; we may, I think, fairly conclude, that the time is not far diſtant, when the Convention will no longer find dupes enough to ſpeculate in thoſe purchaſes, or to take its aſſignats. The time probably is not far diſtant, when the latter will be treated like ſome of the provincial paper in America, which at laſt was thrown away as uſeleſs, when no one could be found to take it at the thouſandth part of its nominal value.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of what I have already ſaid on this ſubject, I ſhall cite, verbatim, a part of a ſpeech made by Dupuis the 7th of April, in the Convention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:048483_0129_102539C28D9F84B0"/>
                  <hi>The plate for printing aſſignats was found infinitely more convenient than an aſſeſſment of taxes; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any longer calculating expences, the Conſtituent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly tranſmitted this faithful plate to the Legiſlative Aſſembly, who paſſed it on to us. With it, thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies tranſmitted the burden of public debt, infinitely more heavy than they received it; and bequeathed us a war, with all its expences, and with reſponſibility for their error. In creating a new ſpecies of money, our predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thought of the means of beginning a Revolution,</hi> BUT DID NOT THINK OF ANY FOR FINISHING IT.</p>
               <p>We are yet to learn what means the Convention will find to <hi>finiſh the Revolution,</hi> and terminate the war with Great-Britain, which, it ſays, was <hi>bequeathed</hi> to it by the preceding Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>All the perſons coming from France agree in ſaying, that the general opinion againſt the duration of the Republic, ſhews itſelf moſt decidedly in the ſale of the confiſcations. Monaſtic property, it is ſaid, is ſtill bought with eagerneſs and confidence; and next to that, the property of the church. As to the Crown lands, it is difficult to find purchaſers for them; and as to the eſtates of the emigrants, ſtill fewer perſons will have any thing to do with them: beſides this, a marked difference is made between property confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Conſtituent, and by the ſucceeding Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>Such ſhades of opinion on this ſubject, can only proceed from a general impreſſion, that the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is at its laſt gaſp, that all it has done will periſh with it, and the Republic no longer exiſt. To keep out of ſight the ſymptoms of diſſolution, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention have formed a ſcheme of ſelling the houſes and buildings belonging to the emigrants, by way of lottery, in order to get rid of them at once, and to avoid thoſe diſtinctions which the public opinion makes reſpecting them. I very much doubt whether this lottery will ever be filled. But if the property ſhould
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:048483_0130_102539EF4C51BF60"/>
ever paſs to thoſe who purchaſe tickets; and if they ſhould keep poſſeſſion of their prizes for any length of time, they will indeed be more fortunate than wiſe.</p>
               <p>That it will be impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult, to fill ſuch a lottery, appears to be the opinion of the Committee of Finance: for when the ſcheme of a lottery was adopted, that Committee propoſed other ſchemes quite as impoſſible, which would, as it ſaid, withdraw in a very ſhort time the ſum of aſſignats neceſſary to be taken out of circulation.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſchemes were in number no leſs than 15. It would be uſeleſs to enter into a detail of them, or to ſhew their abſurdity: I ſhall only repeat what was ſaid on the ſubject by Bourdon de l'Oiſe, the 21ſt of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This morning a project of finance has been diſtributed among you. Many of my colleagues, and myſelf, intend to diſpute ſeven eighths of it. Formerly, when you traded with all Europe, you had not a fourth part of the currency you have at preſent; and now that it is increaſed four fifths, you have no trade but with yourſelves. This cannot laſt. It is clearly demonſtrated, that nothing</hi> FETTERS <hi>our Revolution ſo much as the</hi> FINANCES.</p>
               <p>With the hope of extricating themſelves from this ſituation, the Convention thought fit to reject the propoſitions of Johannot, made in the name of the Committee of Finance,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following paſſages are extracted from Johannot's Report.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>All your power cannot, by any exertion of authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the diſcredit of your money, or promiſſory notes; though thoſe promiſſory notes have a real and ſufficient ſecurity,</p>
                        <p>Every thing demonſtrates that the difference between paper-money and ſpecie is independent of the will of the Legiſlature.</p>
                        <p>So long as that natural difference exiſts, it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to hinder the citizens from attending to it in their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with each other. They muſt not be placed in a dilemma between truth and law. The diſtinction in bargains as payable in ſpecie or in aſſignats, muſt neceſſarily take place; and for that reaſon ſhould be left without reſtrictions, that the legiſlative power may not be committed.</p>
                        <p>It would be abſurd to deny that there is an actual differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between ſtandard ſilver and paper-money. A courſe of exchange between them exiſts, but is continually varying more and more to our diſadvantage.</p>
                        <p>All our efforts ſhould be directed to re-eſtabliſh the balance between the receipt and the ordinary expenditure. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the preſent ſtate of things, that the diſcredit of the aſſignats conſiderably augment our expences, while our receipts remain the ſame, or rather diminiſh, in conſequence of this diſcredit. The public treaſure is exhauſted, without any means of repleniſhing it in equal proportion. One of the conſequences of the revolution is, that we pay ſalaries to a greater number of agents than all the reſt of Europe put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Johannot compoſed this report about the ſame time that the part of this work was written, which relates to the aſſignats; and a fuller confirmation of my aſſertions cannot be deſired.</p>
                     <p>One would hardly have expected to find in a report which contains ſo much plain truth, ſuch abſurdities as the following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the war ſhould laſt two years larger, there will ſtill remain of the funds deſtined for ſupporting it, a ſum amounting to ſeveral milliards; which, after the peace, may be applied to the uſeful purpoſe of diſcharging the conſtitutional debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If it ſhould not be quite ſufficient, experience has more than ever proved the utility of a ſinking fund. That mode might be applied to extinguiſh progreſſively all the public debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We propoſe to you then, to make aſſignats to the amount of three milliards; to decree, that beyond this quantity none ſhall ever be made or iſſued; and publicly to deſtroy the inſtruments for making them. Theſe three milliards, thus made, only by way of precaution, will never be iſſued; or, at moſt, only in part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, follows the enumeration of 15 operations of finance which he propoſes; and then he adds,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is no longer time to do things by halves; we muſt advance towards a regeneration with the ſame perſeverance as for eighteen months paſt we have been going to deſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We ſhall finiſh by the ſame obſervation with which we began— That the ſecurity of the finances depends on a firm and ſtable govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So long as that remains uncertain, nothing can be propoſed to you reſpecting them but inefficient theories.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> and adopt two others,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:048483_0131_102539FAEF2467B8"/>
more immediate in their effect, but not leſs deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The firſt deſtroyed the currency of near two
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:048483_0132_10253A11FB60B2E8"/>
milliards of aſſignats of the royal impreſſion, by decreeing that they ſhould no longer be admitted but in payment for national property. By the ſecond, the Convention decreed, <hi>that every citizen ſhall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to demand from the directory of his diſtrict, any part of the national domains of which the ſale is not already commenced, on payment of</hi> 75 <hi>times the rent of thoſe lands in the year</hi> 1790. <hi>The property ſhall be adjudged to the purchaſers on the day of demand, or that immediately following, on condition that the purchaſe-money ſhall be made good in three monthly payments,</hi> &amp;c. When this decree was made, the crown of ſix livres ſold for 105 livres in aſſignats; ſo that 75,000 in aſſignats could be procured for 4,285 (omitting the fraction) in ſpecie: and an eſtate which would return 1000 livres in 1790, may now be bought of the Convention for a little more than four and a quarter years purchaſe in ſpecie. So that the Convention is reduced to ſell its beſt eſtates at about a ſeventh part of the price which they bore before the revolution; or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to offer them to ſale; becauſe there is little reaſon to believe that they will find many purchaſers, even on thoſe terms.</p>
               <p>The degree in which the French themſelves are alarmed at the preſent ſituation of their finances, mey be judged by the following extract from the <hi>Courier Univerſel,</hi> publiſhed at Paris the 24th of May. <hi>The ſpectacle which France preſents at this moment is horrible. The Government cannot pay its creditors; the debtors to the State cannot pay the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the citizens cannot pay one another. This is the neceſſary conſequence of uncertainty and arbitrary rule, the unfortunate reſult of repeated and extravagant emiſſions of aſſignats, and of the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſappearance of ſpecie.</hi>

               <head>Fall of the Republic.</head>
               <p>The fall of the Republic is as rapid as that of the Aſſignats; and every incident, ſince the publication of this pamphlet, corroborates the aſſertion in page 35, <hi>that the Republic will periſh, as the Monarchy periſhed, by the ruin of its finances.</hi> The myriads who have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſupported this ſyſtem from <hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> will ſoon find, that there can be no more confiſcations to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and that republican ſalaries are no very tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bribe, when paid in republican money.</p>
               <p>The preſent ſyſtem, unable to give protection to thoſe who have property, and unable to gratify the avidity of thoſe who deſire it, is evidently haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to a diſſolution. There is one indication of the prevailing belief at Paris, that Royalty will ſoon be re-eſtabliſhed, which appears to me almoſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; I mean the marked preference given to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he aſſignats which were iſſued during the Monarchy. <hi>La Croix</hi> complained in the Convention, on the 6th of May, that a republican aſſignat of 10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ivres was publicly exchanged for a royal aſſignat of 5. This circumſtance, together with the reluctance ſhewn by purchaſers to ſpeculate in eſtates confiſcated ſince the diſſolution of the Conſtituent Aſſembly, prove, not only a prevailing expectation of the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Royalty; but more than this, an opinion that every power that has been exerciſed in the mean time, will be conſidered as uſurpation, and all its acts reſcinded. No wonder that Le Sage, ſhortly after this complaint by La Croix, exclaimed in the Convention, <hi>We have had our Cromwell; let us take care that we have not our Charles the Second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to conceal, as much as poſſible, this evidence of the public opinion, the Convention found itſelf reduced to the neceſſity of ſtopping the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all the royal aſſignats: a meaſure which increaſed the irritation of the populace, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:048483_0134_10253A3F204F3998"/>
very conſiderably to the ſtruggle which took place at Paris, between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e different factions, on the 22d, 23d, and 24th of May. Perſons who have but ſuperficially conſidered the war of factions, and the hiſtory of republics, may poſſibly imagine that victory implies ſtrength; and that the exiſting ſyſtem in France is likely to be more durable, from the iſſue of this formidable attack. But, in fact, this very victory, both from its neceſſary effect on the defeated party, and from the means by which it was gained, will probably contribute to increaſe the ſilent but rooted averſion to the Convention.</p>
               <p>The defeated party are the Jacobins and their inſtruments; the leaders without principle, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ferocious, deſperate, and irritated to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by diſappointment and want. The ſame inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the ſame practices, were reſorted to againſt the Convention as againſt Louis XVI. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of the Baſtille, the Fauxbourgs of St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau and St. Antoine, the men who dragged the late unfortunate King from Verſailles, the furious bands of the tenth of Auguſt, the murderers of the ſecond of September, the very populace to which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention owed its exiſtence, were, on this occaſion, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to deſtroy it. The ſame ſyſtem of inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was adopted; the National Gens-d'Armes, the Pretorian Guard of the Convention, were ſeduced (as the Royal Guards were in the firſt inſurrection), and joined the conſpirators. However, the victory of the Convention was complete: the Gens-d'Armes were caſhiered, and the populace of Paris entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed.</p>
               <p>The Convention owed its victory to the armed force of Paris, which had lately been eſtabliſhed for the very purpoſe of repreſſing the Jacobin faction; and to the dread of the ferocious outrages of that faction, which united all parties, oftenſibly to ſupport the Convention but really for their own preſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:048483_0135_10253A5D365506F0"/>As thoſe who conducted the conſpiracy againſt Robeſpierre formed a coalition with the Girondiſts; ſo, on this occaſion, the Convention was obliged to have recourſe even to ſuſpected Royaliſts for ſupport: and as that firſt victory over the Jacobin faction, gradually, but inevitably, led to the reſtoration of the Girondiſts; ſo, from exactly the ſame cauſes, this ſecond victory will probably lead to the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Royalty.</p>
               <p>This event the Girondiſts will, no doubt, uſe every endeavour to prevent; and it is not impoſſible but that the Conſtitution which they are now framing may be ſo far accommodated to preſent circumſtances as to poſtpone it: but what probability is there that the third Conſtitution will laſt longer than the firſt or the ſecond? In proportion as the new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſembles thoſe eſtabliſhed in America, it may, for a time, ſatisfy the more moderate friends of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; but a ſyſtem ſo inconſiſtent with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and ſo oppoſite to the habits of the French, cannot long ſubſiſt. No barrier can long prevent the reflux of popular opinion; and between that ſyſtem and Royalty there is nothing intermediate.</p>
               <p>If it is objected, that the <hi>cry of Royalty</hi> was not heard amid this violent tumult; this very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I think an additional argument in favour of my opinion. No one can deny that the Royaliſts are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous at Paris; and their not appearing as a diſtinct party, on this occaſion, is the ſtrongeſt of proofs that their meaſures are ſyſtematically conducted. The Girondiſts were not heard of as a party, at the time of Robeſpierre's defeat; their principles were ſtrongly diſavowed for a long time after it; and it was but ſtep by ſtep that they gradually returned to power But that return, though oppoſed by every effort o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Royaliſts are now what the Girondiſts were then: prudent, and taught by misfortunes, they have aſſiſted the weaker to deſtroy the more powerful of their enemies; and have not riſked the iſſue of a battle againſt the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins, by premature cries of Royalty. From the populace, defeated, diſarmed, but irreconcilably irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, the preſent leaders of the Convention can no longer look for aſſiſtance; and from the armed force which has now ſaved them, they can look for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance no longer than while that force finds it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to give it.</p>
