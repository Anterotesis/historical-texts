            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the religion of Jeſus is the greateſt ornament of our nature, and a ſource of ſublime pleaſures to men, will not be denied, by any, who know its author, underſtand its nature, or have felt its happy effects. The influence of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity has the directeſt tendency to correct the errors of the heart, and to make the life better. Its doctrines and precepts are calculated to make us what we ſhould be, to God, ourſelves, and our fellow-men, in every relation of human life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024563_0005_0FC7BE114B57F9F8"/>
IT is, notwithſtanding, very apparent, that, through the malignity of its oppoſers, chriſtianity has been loaded with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and calumnies; and <hi>eſpecially</hi> with the odium of being unfriendly to peace and good government, and an enemy to Caeſar. Hence, the public inſtructors of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were ſtigmatized with every oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious character; as turbulent fellows, ſowers of ſedition and ſtrife, and treated by ſome, as common enemies to mankind.</p>
            <p>THESE calumnies were greatly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rigorous attachment of the Jews to a ſyſtem of ceremonial obſervances; in oppoſition to which, and agreeably to the purity and plainneſs of goſpel worſhip, the apoſtles taught a glorious liberty in Chriſt, and charged chriſtian profeſſors not to be entangled again with that yoke of bondage.</p>
            <p>To wipe away the odium of theſe groundleſs aſſertions from the beſt of cauſes, and to prevent a miſconſtruction of that liberty into licentiouſneſs, which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024563_0006_0FC7BE12F15F9660"/>
the apoſtles had preached among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the author of this epiſtle takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the chapter where our text is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, to enjoin ſubjection to civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on all claſſes of men: and he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this duty, from the important conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of its being an ordinance of God. Hence, "Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."</p>
            <p>THUS, though civil government be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ordinance, it is alſo of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore ſubjection to it, is enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only "for wrath," or fear of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; but from chriſtian motives, and "for conſcience ſake."</p>
            <p>I PRESUME that the apoſtle does not <hi>here</hi> treat of the form of government, nor of the manner in which perſons ought to be inveſted with power; but of the origin and riſe of government itſelf; which he ſays is of God, and ordained by him.—Sometimes the way, in which perſons arrive at pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024563_0007_0FC7BE1632F810B0"/>
is by uſurpation and oppreſſion; and ſuch generally govern in a tyrannical and oppreſſive manner. This was the caſe at the time to which our text and context re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. This is no otherwiſe of God; than as he permits it, for the puniſhment of national offences againſt himſelf. And though it muſt be acknowledged, that people have a perfect right to reform ſuch a government at pleaſure; yet when the means of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſuch as would juſtify reſiſtance are not at all in their power, it is then their duty to ſubmit ſo far, as may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend conſcience; becauſe government in ſome ſhape or other, is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the exiſtence of ſociety.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe we may ſuppoſe, the apoſtle ſpoke, when he ſaid, "The powers that be, are ordained of God: and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God: and ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation."</p>
            <p>THE ſcriptures do not ſeem to direct men, to any one particular mode or form of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024563_0008_0FC7BE1799986610"/>
government, the excluſion of others. We are left to make choice of that mode of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that may be moſt agreeable to our own minds; whether Monarchy, Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy, or Democracy. The dictates of reaſon and common ſenſe teach us, that all men are originally equal and free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by the voice of the people, which we are to revere as the voice of God; ſome men ought to be raiſed from the common level and inveſted with power, to act in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Rulers.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred page is very explicit in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording us information concerning the ſource of civil authority, which is of God: and concerning its end among men, which is their good: hence Rulers are called God's miniſters, and his miniſters for good: and laſtly concerning our duty to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is ſubjection to it, and honor to its adminiſtrators. Agreeably to this view, the apoſtle farther enforces our duty to government by the words of our text; which informs us, what rulers are in the end and ought to be in the exerciſe of their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024563_0009_0FC7BE1C4F2F9A90"/>
office. FOR RULERS ARE NOT A TERROR TO GOOD WORKS, BUT TO THE EVIL.—They are a terror, but not to good men. Whatever terror may appear about civil government, there is nothing in its genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine nature and deſign, of which a virtuous and well doing citizen need be afraid. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are a terror to bad members of ſociety only. The neceſſity of civil Government ariſes from the wickedneſs of men. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly perſons are enemies to ſociety; their conduct tends to injure mankind, and to diſſolve the ſocial union. Rulers are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the protection of mankind, and the preſervation of the ſocial union; therefore they are a terror to diſorderly perſons only.</p>
            <p>CIVIL <hi>Fathers</hi> of the State, I am well convinced I have not been invited to this deſk to explain State policy, or to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the government of nations. Any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this kind would be arrogance in <hi>me,</hi> and a reflection upon the profeſſional knowledge of the leaders of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. I hope therefore, I ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024563_0010_0FC7BE20D77449A8"/>
in that unfavorable light, while I beg leave to ſubmit to your candid atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a few obſervations, in which I ſhall endeavor to ſhow, how, or by what means, Rulers are a terror to bad members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and to them only. After which, I ſhall conclude, with ſome <hi>ſuitable</hi> improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I proceed then to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> THAT a good plan of government greatly tends to make rulers a terror to bad members of ſociety, and to them only.</p>
            <p>WHEN a conſtitution is founded on the true principles of moral government, the exiſtence of a God, and the propriety of religious worſhip and formed according to the principles of equal liberty; virtuous rulers act with freedom and ſpirit againſt vice; virtuous citizens are encouraged; and the vicious part of ſociety alone, are diſmayed, and fear the conſequences of ſuch a fair foundation, for the adminiſtration of juſtice, in the ſuppreſſion of immorality and vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:024563_0011_0FC7BE237179BDB0"/>
WHEN there are any remarkable defects in a form of government, bad men have their eyes fixed on thoſe, as open, though back doors, at which they eſcape with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, in the practice of vice. Every good man, can boldly plead the benefits, and advantages of a good conſtitution; and the ruler can with grace and propriety, protect him in the enjoyment of them. On the other hand, bad men are ever ready to plead the defects, and greateſt imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a bad conſtitution, in favor of their licentious conduct; and in ſuch caſes, it is not always poſſible, nor eaſy at any time for the moſt virtuous rulers on earth to prevent bad conſequences.</p>
            <p>THE baneful influence of a bad plan of government ſeldom opens the door, for one ſpecies of oppreſſion, and injuſtice, alone. Perſecution for conſcience ſake, oppreſſion in civil liberty, with acts of common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and private injury, generally go together. They flow from the ſame ſource; are carried on by the ſame means; and are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024563_0012_0FC7BE274FFF7580"/>
equally ſubſervient in their turn, to the ſame wicked purpoſes of deſigning men.</p>
            <p>A GOOD conſtitution is formed for the preſervation of men in their natural rights, and is calculated to ſecure them againſt the moſt diſtant fears of an invaſion, upon what is valuable to men; whether as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of civil, or religious ſociety, and is the beſt and moſt neceſſary foundation for the formation of good laws. Which in the</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> PLACE, are equally neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rulers to be a terror to diſorderly members of ſociety. A code of laws, in uniſon with a good conſtitution, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the voice of the people, is ſimilar to a fortreſs upon a rock: It raiſes rulers above enemies to order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and gives them every advantage, to diſplay dignity and terror; or clemency and favor, as the happineſs of ſociety, or juſtice and reaſon may require.</p>
            <p>THE protection of life, liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, is the principal object of law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024563_0013_0FC7BE28D95CB4D0"/>
Could theſe be preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out government, there would be no need of laws. Theſe bleſſings are ſo inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected, that one cannot be fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without the reſt. When liberty is loſt, life grows inſiped, and is not worth the wearing; for, in that caſe, we have nothing we can call our own. A luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power and property, is natural to men in general, and a prevailing paſſion with bad men. It is therefore evident, that theſe important bleſſings, are expoſed to conſtant invaſion by ſuch characters; and laws are abſolutely neceſſary for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The more juſt and reaſonable laws are; the more ſecure, may we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the innocent and induſtrious citizen is, in the quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of all his rights, and enjoyments. In this view, laws are no terror to a good man; they are his ſafety, deſigned for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as a man, and his proſperity as a member of ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE vicious and diſorderly <hi>only,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of good laws. For as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024563_0014_0FC7BE2E88384F20"/>
of death, in the day of battle, are kept conſtantly pointed againſt the enemy; ſo are good laws directed againſt evil doers, as enemies to the common good. They are made to lay ſuch characters under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſtraints, or to puniſh them, when the power of reſtraint fails to prevent their criminalty. In this reſpect, the law is not made for the righteous; but for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and diſobedient.</p>
            <p>GOOD laws have, therefore, penalties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, ſuited to the nature and aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of crimes. The ableſt Legiſlators in apportioning puniſhments in law to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, muſt be guided by reaſon, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of injury which they carry, in their nature and conſequences, to ſociety. To puniſh with leſs ſeverity, than the nature of the offence requires, may be conſtrued as an encouragement to offenders: To let the puniſhment exceed the nature of the crime, is to eſtabliſh iniquity by law: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to extend capital puniſhments beyond due bounds, fruſtrates their deſign, by deſtroying their terror, in making them too
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024563_0015_0FC7BE2F52C8EA08"/>
familiar to our minds: all extremes ſhould be avoided.</p>
            <p>YET no ſyſtem of laws can be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to leave no room for after amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Time and experience in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of certain laws in ſociety, beſt diſcover their imperfection, or their worth. In ſome inſtances, acts formed by very wiſe legiſlatures, have been found to have very different effects, from what were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended in their formation. Among ſuch muſt be numbered all laws of human authority, eſtabliſhing a preference of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious tenets and denominations. This conduct, according to the hiſtory of paſt ages, has ever been found, ſo far from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the promotion of real religion and benevolence: that it has been, a fertile ſource of eccleſiaſtic oppreſſion, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.—Such laws have a tendency to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and diſtort the mind, to deſtroy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence in the heart, and preclude free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of enquiry from the human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. God alone, is lord over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and good laws never, never aſſume the reins of government over it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024563_0016_0FC7BE30D8407F00"/>
BUT ideas of religious liberty ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be carried ſo far, as to drop religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from government. To do this, is to drop the idea of the exiſtence of God. For, the immutable and eternal principles of reaſon concur with revelation, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that God is an object of religious worſhip. We cannot realize his exiſtence, without admitting his exiſtence as an object of worſhip. To deny either, is to deny both, and at once deſtroys the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of conſcience, and all moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it. No oath could be adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a ſociety of this complexion. A government of this character is a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for abſolute atheiſts only. No man can plead liberty of conſcience, thus far, without pleading againſt the very exiſtence of conſcience at the ſame time; and ſurely it muſt be erroneous to argue for ſuch a conſcience, as does not conſiſt with the exiſtence of a moral world.—But not to digreſs.</p>
            <p>WHEN experience, which has diſcovered the errors of ſome laws, has clearly evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024563_0017_0FC7BE34F30E1180"/>
the unneceſſary nature of others; it may be proper to expunge ſuch, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of legiſlation. To continue laws of leſs importance, than can be carried into execution by the ruler, with dignity and reaſon, is tempting ſubjects to treat law with contempt, and ſpeak evil of dignities. If they are continued, and not carried into execution; they may ſink into oblivion, in the minds of good men, and may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be improved, by vicious and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, to injure the beſt of citizens. From theſe and the like obſervations, it appears very obvious, that the promotion of knowledge and literature, is a proper object of law and government. It has the greateſt influence, to cultivate morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virtue. Where the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the human mind is overlooked, by thoſe who ought to promote it; the people ſink into ignorance and vice, and ripen faſt for barbarity and bondage.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, in thoſe ſtates where the means of knowledge are ſupported by good laws, the people are enlightened: They
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024563_0018_0FC7BE3725546580"/>
know the excellency of virtue, and the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of vice: They love and practiſe the former: They hate and deſpiſe the latter, as highly injurious to ſociety—good laws are therefore eſſentially neceſſary.—They are a defence to ſociety: are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to promote the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: wear the ſtamp of reaſon: are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ſpirit of the conſtitution; are founded upon the voice of the people. They encourage knowledge, virtue, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and oeconomy: They diſcourage ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, vice, and indolence; and when properly adminiſtered, are a terror to bad men. This naturally ſuggeſts in the</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> PLACE, that rulers are a terror to diſorderly perſons, by the juſtice and fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their adminiſtrations. When theſe are wanting in rulers, the beſt laws on earth, may be wreſted to injure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the innocent, and to exculpate and even reward the guilty. In ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bad men fear not, ſo much the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of the law, as they do the honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the judge. Hence, the proverb, "A
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024563_0019_0FC7BE3873DA8170"/>
man guilty of a crime, fears a judge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of uprightneſs."</p>
            <p>THE loſs, ariſing from remiſſneſs in men of power, and from unfaithfulneſs in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officers, cannot be reſtored by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the laws, nor by the excellency of a conſtitution; but the deficiencies of laws, and imperfections in a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be greatly made up, by the faithfulneſs and juſtice of rulers, in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. To promote the intereſt of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety is ſtill more in their power, when the conſtitution and laws harmoniſe in their favor.</p>
            <p>ENERGY, accompanied with juſtice in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is always pleaſing to good men: and the contrary affords ſatisfaction to the baſeſt part of ſociety. ¿To whom under <hi>God,</hi> the ſupreme governor, ſhall the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part of the community look, for the exerciſe of both; but to their rulers? Want of energy in government, is anarchy, and want of juſtice, oppreſſion; but integrity preſerves from both evils. Should the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024563_0020_0FC7BE3BE0F32288"/>
days come when the eyes of the judge can be blinded by a gift; or men in place be ſwayed by prejudice and party ſpirit; then may we ſee wickedneſs in the place of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in the place of righteouſneſs, that iniquity is there.—"When laws are well made, they ſhould be inflexibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted."</p>
            <p>A GOOD degree of a diſintereſted and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit is an important idea, to conſtitute a faithful and honeſt ruler. Man is not made for himſelf. The apoſtle, forbids looking to our own things on a narrow ſcale, and enjoins, that we extend our views to the things of others. Of all men on earth, a ruler in a democratic government, is the leaſt made for himſelf: And with a luſtre peculiar to his office, he ſhines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of a diſintereſted concern, for the public good.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to remark</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> THAT penetration and abilities in judgment, are no leſs neceſſary to make
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024563_0021_0FC7BE3FD6311760"/>
rulers a terror to evil doers; than a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt heart. The word of God pronounces miſery upon the nation, whoſe rulers are weak-minded. "Wo, unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child." i. e. When he is weak, and devoid of the abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities neceſſary for the effectual diſcharge of his office. Enemies to peace and order, are not always confined to the claſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior parts. Weakneſs does not always accompany wickedneſs; though we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wiſh it forever might. The latter is no infallible evidence of the former. We can eaſily conceive of a very vicious mind, endowed with great ſegacity, and force of underſtanding. Beſides, the advantages of a good education, are not beſtowed on friends to morality and virtue, to the excluſion of others: theſe favors are frequently flung away, on men of diſhoneſt hearts, and make them able in eloquence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly great in argument. Rulers have often to combat powerful opponents. Men of inferior abilities, however honeſt in heart, are not equal to confront with dignity, and to confound with clearneſs, the ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024563_0022_0FC7BE414C81EF50"/>
arguments which may be advanced in favor of wickedneſs. Want of abilities in rulers, has an evident tendency to bring government into contempt; and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible government, is hardly ever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in doing good.</p>
            <p>EVEN an offender is not ſtruck with much terror, when he knows, that a well formed harangue, ſhall prevail, over the credulous and weak, though upright mind of his judge. Moreover, matters of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nature, are ſometime ſo complicated, that men of the beſt abilities, in connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with undiſſembled faithfulneſs, find it difficult enough to concert meaſures an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the beſt ends of good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>IT was thought a ſevere judgment upon the Jews, when they made public officers of the meaneſt of the people; and there is no reaſon to conſider it as any thing leſs upon any nation.</p>
            <p>WHEN God is about to do any thing great, and good for a people; he raiſes up
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024563_0023_0FC7BE42CB8CB210"/>
good and great men to govern in their public councils; but, when he is about to puniſh a people for their crimes; or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them for their tranſgreſſions, he has nothing more to do, than to permit the reins of government, to fall into the hands of the weak or the wicked: and in either caſe, the ruin of the nation is inevitable. We may further obſerve,</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> THAT rulers are a terror to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and vice, when their characters are adorned with a virtuous life, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The badges of ſtate in a ruler, never appear to ſuch advantage, as when united to the beauty of his virtues.</p>
            <p>WE may fear his power in the former, but, can never revere and reſpect his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without the latter. Vice is the great diſturber of public happineſs: the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lion, that goeth about ſeeking our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: and thoſe rulers alone, ſupport the dignity of their character, and diffuſe happineſs among mankind, who oppoſe vice, and encourage virtue: who honor
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024563_0024_0FC7BE485571DA58"/>
God by keeping his commandments, and ſubject their power to the ſovereign laws of morality and reaſon.</p>
            <p>THE conduct of rulers has a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on thoſe, they govern. We natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline to imitate men in higher ſpheres of human life. When we have choſen men to govern us, it preſuppoſeth our high eſteem of, and expectations from them. We have conferred upon them the higheſt honors we had to beſtow. It is not more natural for children, to look up with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honor to their parents, than it is for a virtuous people, under an energetic government, to honor and reſpect virtuous rulers.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſhould vice actuate the ruler in his private life; or ambition and avarice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in his public councils: he ſullies his honor—his reputation is loſt—his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſtroyed; and the people left to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail their diſappointment, and to deteſt the object of their own election, as a terror to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024563_0025_0FC7BE498DDE75F8"/>
good works; but none to the evil. When a ſelfiſh and vicious ſpirit ſtamps the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ruler, the ſelfiſh and vicious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, with a familiarity peculiar to a ſimilarity of diſpoſition, and they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtrengthen each other in their wicked conduct. "The wicked walk on every ſide, when vile men are exalted." To theſe obſervations, permit me to add in the</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>th.</hi> PLACE, that a juſt ſenſe of religion, and the fear of God in a ruler contribute much to the terror of bad men. This is the fountain in the heart from whence all genuine virtue in life flows. How ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the ruler whoſe goodneſs as a man we admire and love, more than we dread his power as a magiſtrate! How pleaſing is that obedience, which flows from a unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regard to the excellency of the citizen, and the dignity of his office! Under ſuch impreſſions, with what ſolemn, melting, death inſpiring eloquence, does king David pray for piety to his ſon, and ſucceſſor in the kingdom of Iſrael! "Give unto Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024563_0026_0FC7BE4B0C8569F0"/>
my ſon, a perfect heart to keep thy commandments, thy teſtimonies, and thy ſtatutes." Nor is he leſs particular in his charge to Solomon himſelf. Thus we hear the venerable monarch, with all the pathos of parental affection, ſoothing his dying pillow, in his laſt addreſs, to one of the wiſeſt of princes. "And thou, Solomon, my ſon, know thou the God of thy fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind, for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the thoughts: If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off forever."</p>
            <p>¿ What heart, that is not hard as adamant, can read the following deſcription of a pious ruler, and not feel the ſenſations of delight and joy? "The God of Iſrael ſaid, the rock of Iſrael ſpake to me; he that ruleth among men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God; and he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſun ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024563_0027_0FC7BE509F97DC30"/>
by clear ſhining after rain." Civil rulers of this character, are here juſtly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extenſive bleſſings, as the ſun and rain to ſociety. The influence of their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, flowing from a juſt ſenſe of religion and the fear of God; will reſemble the cheriſhing beams of the ſun, and ſatisfying ſhowers of rain deſcending from the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of their ſtation, to nouriſh and fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify mankind. Good people will eſteem them miniſters of heaven, and ordained of God for good.—They are nurſing fathers to the church of God: Setting a high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon their own rights, as chriſtian members of ſociety, they are ever ready to defend the ſacred rights of others.—Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing the worth of religion to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they do nothing to hinder; but every thing in their power, and conſiſtent with their office, to promote its general ſpread and preſervation. Conſcious that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be long happy, or free, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its benign aid; they are willing and even zealous to encourage inſtructors of morality and religion. Being highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024563_0028_0FC7BE51DBFE90A0"/>
with the advantages of chriſtianity themſelves, they dread as an unpardonable crime, the neglect of tranſmitting its bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precepts, to ſucceeding generations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſerved from ignorance and infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they fear the diſmal conſequences of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the youth in a community, to grow up under the diſadvantages, peculiar to nations, not favored with public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. You will pardon my zeal, ye civil <hi>Fathers</hi> of the State; if I ſay that the fear of God is a protecting, and nurſing parent, for order and good government.—It unites the ſeveral parts of ſociety, by the ſtrongeſt ties of benevolence and love—it diſpoſes all orders of men, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their engagements abroad, honeſt and induſtrious at home—it ſweetens the power of the ruler, and effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a conſcientious obedience from the ruled. From this mutual harmony, ariſe the ſtrength, beauty, honor, and ſafety of a nation; and public happineſs is a promiſed bleſſing. "For righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a nation."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:024563_0029_0FC7BE534B6E0680"/>
ON the other hand, ¿ What is it that ripens a nation for ruin? The ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles concur with the experience of all ages in informing us, that "ſin is a reproach to any people." The voice of the moſt high is, "If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be deſtroyed."</p>
            <p>THE conduct of providence, to public communities in this world, is frequently <hi>very</hi> different, from that which he diſpenſes to individuals. A veil of darkneſs covers the face of providence, in diſpenſing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and adverſity, to particular perſons in this life. Sometimes a man of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed goodneſs, is oppreſſed with afflictions and poverty; while another is triumphant in wickedneſs, and poſſeſſes more than his heart can enjoy. There is, however, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, in which all this apparent differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may be adjuſted. But, in a general way, national ſins are puniſhed with nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal calamities; and when vice becomes predominant among rulers; the infection
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024563_0030_0FC7BE58D93B88A0"/>
goes by an eaſy deſcent, to the lower ranks of the people, and tends to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A diſorder, in the vitals of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is ſoon diſcovered in its remoteſt members, and indicates the political ſyſtem to be in a mournful decay. Once more, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7th</hi> PLACE, the eminent nature of their office, affords rulers every neceſſary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to diſcourage wicked and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men in the practice of immorality. They are God's deputies on earth.—They repreſent his moral government among men.—"They are called gods."—And it is ſaid, that God ſtandeth in their aſſembly, as in the congregation of the mighty, and judgeth among the gods. They are called gods, from the power with which they are cloathed by the people, from God, to make laws. They are awful, from their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by providence, to ſit in judgment, and deliberately doom to death at the bar of juſtice. They are irreſiſtible, to carry into the fulleſt execution, every degree of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024563_0031_0FC7BE5A17EB3EC8"/>
puniſhment preſcribed by law, where gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is in force and energy. Thus, civil rulers, whether legiſlative, judicial, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, are repreſentatives of the Supreme Ruler, whom the prophet ſtyles, our <hi>Judge,</hi> our <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and our <hi>King.</hi>—The more agreeable the adminiſtration of government is, to the moral perfections of God, the greater is its terror to wicked members of ſociety. And as it is an unqueſtionable truth, that God is terrible, to immoral men, both in time and eternity: it is equally obvious that rulers inſpired with the ſpirit of their office, are a terror to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious men, in every department of the community. Miſerable and wicked men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſh there were no God; and they are of the ſame deſcription who wiſh there were no government.</p>
            <p>IT remains that we finiſh this diſcourſe by the propoſed improvement. And</p>
            <p>LET me remark, if I have ſaid any thing in the foregoing obſervations, worthy the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024563_0032_0FC7BE5B8CF611C8"/>
notice of rulers; upon proper reflection, we may find ſomething ſuitable for the attention of the people. When a ſociety is happy, each member of the community endeavours to know his duty, and to act his part, with fidelity and reaſon.</p>
            <p>MY friends and fellow citizens, ſince the eſtabliſhment of a free government does us honor, let us never do diſhonor to ourſelves, by diſobeying its legal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional commands. Let us never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an impatient diſpoſition under the neceſſary reſtraints of good government. Theſe reſtraints are our ſafety. Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to a government like ours tends to ruin. Neither let us be meanly jealous of men whoſe political exiſtence is but temporary, and derived from the people. Let us guard our elections well, and ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize with contempt, every mark of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and corruption. But when we have choſen men to rule by a clear majority, let even the minority truſt them with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024563_0033_0FC7BE61CEB307F0"/>
charity, and treat them with reſpect and honor.—This is their due.—It is much to the diſhonor of a free community, to reſemble an ill bred family, by quarrelling among themſelves, or ſpeaking evil of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. We may reſt aſſured, our rulers have many motives to excite their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but few, very few to lead to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Every principle of duty and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſpire to make them what they ſhould be. It cannot be expected, but, that the characters of candidates for places of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and truſt, ſhould undergo an inſpection by the public eye. If they are found fair, they have the better proſpect for public honor, in new elections: but if not; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates know that they will, and know that they ought to be neglected, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. In a republic, the majeſty of the people is great, and their bar tremendous. If we know and exerciſe the power that belongs to us under God as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government, rulers can never be loſt to us, unleſs they are loſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This leads</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:024563_0034_0FC7BE634BB61BA0"/>
2<hi>dly.</hi> To obſerve, that as the promotion of knowledge and literature is an object of law with good rulers; ſo it alſo ought to be an object of univerſal attention among the people. Ignorance is the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the happineſs of any nation. It puts an end to purity of manners, real religion, and good government. Wicked and deſigning men, go abroad without fear, as beaſts of prey in the night, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy under the clouds of ignorance.—Knowledge is neceſſary to give us a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per view of our rights as men, and of our duty, as members of ſociety.</p>
            <p>AN ignorant people, even in the full poſſeſſion of their rights, are apt to carry liberty into extremes, and ſoon degenerate into anarchy and confuſion.

Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs is as great an enemy to its true genius on the one hand, as deſpotiſm is on the other. He is as real a political robber, who would fire a nation againſt a free government by the former, as the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that would aſſume government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent, on the latter. A luſt of boundleſs power and liberty, is the ſource of both their wickedneſs.

            <p>AGAIN, let it not be thought inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the ſpirit of my preſent duty, or offenſive to your delicacy to hint, that it affords ſatisfaction to every good mind that the neceſſary expences of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be diſcharged with cheerfulneſs. "Render to all their due, tribute to whom tribute is due." He that repines at the performance of this part of his duty to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024563_0037_0FC7BE6BA360FDD8"/>
government, has not juſtly eſtimated its value, and betrays his ignorance of its real worth. The ſupport of government ſhould be without regret in the ſubject, and bear ſome degree of uſeful proportion to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the office and nature of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the ruler; but let us never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the luxury, pomp or oſtentation of monarchial governments. Theſe are the enſigns of pride, wickedneſs and vanity.</p>
            <p>LET us my dear countrymen, rejoice this day in the poſſeſſion of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where our eyes behold our rulers, not as a terror to good men; but to the evil. While clouds of hereditary rights, ſhadows of ariſtocracy, and the darkneſs of monarchial governments involve other nations in ſlavery, we are free. Let us rejoice that rays of our riſing light and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty are darting to other nations and promiſing a benign influence over the world. O, bleſſed land of light and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where every genius has a ſpring and acts itſelf. Our heart ſhould heave with
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024563_0038_0FC7BE6D233B6CA8"/>
gratitude to God, the giver of every good, and governor of nations!</p>
            <p>BUT, let all orders of men guard againſt the abuſe of privileges. When the Jews kept the covenant of their God, they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over their enemies. But when they forſook him, he forſook them, and they were carried captives to diſtant nations. Public vice and irreligion may ſoon ruin us. The declivity of public vice, is like a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of ice, and hurls headlong to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is much eaſier to ſhun than to get ſafe off the ſlippery precipice. Let not the tables of intemperance, luxury, or gamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which end in huts, hoſpitals and gaols, enſlave our ſouls from our God, or ſteal our time and talents, from our duty. And may we ever ſtamp that iniquitous ſpirit of avarice and ſpeculation, wherever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, with every ſign of contempt, that has lately done diſhonor to a principal city<note n="*" place="bottom">NEWYORK.</note> in our continent, ruined ſome private citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and even threatened to injure our
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024563_0039_0FC7BE705A4DB420"/>
character as a nation. Public virtue and religion are ornaments to the human mind, and cannot fail to ſhow their effects on ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. The boaſted glory of ancient Rome is aſcribed to her public virtue and her fall to her vices. Her rulers are ſaid to have payed the greateſt attention to the public good. They renounced private eaſe for the welfare of the commonwealth. It was high treaſon to employ the public revenues for any other purpoſe than the intereſt of the republic—ſhe roſe—empires depended upon the voice of the ſenate, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions revered her reſolves.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, her fall in which ſhe left her offspring the ſlaves of a race of tyrants is aſcribed unto the following vices. A ſelfiſh mind takes place of a public ſpirit. Ambition advances by intrigue into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic truſt without any regard to merit. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance weakens her bodily ſtrength and debaſes her once renowned courage—cruel avarice plundered her provinces to ſupport the pride of individuals. All orders of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024563_0040_0FC7BE7504141CF8"/>
men become venal. The ſeeds of diſorder are univerſally ſown in Rome—her ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors betray her—her generals deny their aid, and turn the edge of their ſwords againſt her that bear them—ſhe is del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uged in the blood of her own children. The miſtreſs of the word meanly bows—"ſues for chains and owns a conqueror." The experience of all nations may teach the neceſſity of public virtue and religion to give permanency to our government, and to prolong our happineſs as a nation.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, my fathers in government, if I have not already quite exhauſted your patience, ſuffer me to obſerve, that as the great concerns of the community are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care, no one claſs of men has the increaſe of our happineſs, or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo much in their power. You are a ſource of univerſal joy or grief, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you are qualified for, and faithful in your duty or not. "When the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous are in authority, the people rejoice—but when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn." ¿ What political bleſſing can any
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024563_0041_0FC7BE75E9723EA8"/>
people reaſonably expect from their rulers, that we your conſtituents may not expect from you, conſidering your advantages for being a terror to evil doers? ¿ What pains can we feel or fear of political evils? You are acting upon the firm baſis of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution founded under God upon the voice of the people. You are in the poſſeſſion of a code of excellent laws, with full power to amend whatever your experience and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior diſcernment may ſee amiſs in them.</p>
            <p>BY the free ſuffrage of your fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, you have the fulleſt evidence of the confidence of your country in your abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and faithfulneſs for government. A powerful part of the community will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as ominous of continued proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our ſtate and nation, that you enter on the important buſineſs of legiſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the fear of that God, whoſe miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters you are, and whoſe moral government you repreſent.</p>
            <p>ANIMATED by ſuch noble motives, you will realize the ſuperintending preſence of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024563_0042_0FC7BE77D87A6350"/>
the <hi>Supreme Ruler,</hi> to whom you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable in all your deliberations. In this way, you will anſwer the benevolent deſign of your honorable office, in being a terror to every ſpecies of political wickedneſs and other vices among men; and a praiſe to virtue.</p>
            <p>ACTING on the political ſtage of your country under the influence of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime principles, you will ſhine as lights while you are on it; and obtain the higheſt applauſe of your conſtituents when you leave it; and O! Fathers, when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment arrives, that you muſt forever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſeats of honor on earth, your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories will remain embalmed in ſociety when the name of the wicked ſhall rot.—And the teſtimony of a good conſcience will enlighten your chambers in death—ſcatter the gloom of the grave—direct and ſweeten your paſſage to ſeats of honor and glory immortal.</p>
