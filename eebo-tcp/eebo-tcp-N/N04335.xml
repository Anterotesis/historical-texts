         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Printer to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THIS Version of CICERO'S Tract <hi>de Senectute,</hi> was made Ten Years since, by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Learned Mr. LOGAN, of this City; undertaken partly for his own Amusement, (being then in his 60th Year, which is said to be nearly the Age of the Author when he wrote it) but principally for the Entertainment of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then in his grand Climacteric; and the Notes were drawn up solely on that Neighbour's Account, who was not so well acquainted as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Roman History and Language: Some other Friends,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005361_0003_0000000000000000"/>
however, (among whom I had the Honour to be ranked) obtained Copies of it in M.S. And, as I believed it to be in itself equal at least, if not far preferable to any other. Translation of the same Piece extant in our Language, besides the Advantage it has of so many valuable Notes, which at the same time they clear up the Text, are highly instructive and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I resolved to give it an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, being confident that the Publick would not unfavourably receive it.</p>
            <p>A certain Freed-man of <hi>Cicero's</hi> is reported to have said of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Well, discovered in his Time, wonderful for the Virtue of its Waters in restoring Sight to the Aged, <hi>That it was a Gift of the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:005361_0004_0000000000000000"/>
bountiful Gods to Men, to the end that all might now have the Pleasure of reading his Master's Works.</hi> As that Well, if still in being, is at too great a Distance for our Use, I have, <hi>Gentle Reader,</hi> as thou feest, printed this Piece of <hi>Cicero's</hi> in a large and fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that those who being to think on the Subject of <hi>OLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AGE,</hi> (which seldom happens till their Sight is somewhat impair'd by its Approaches) may not, in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the <hi>Pain</hi> small Letters give the Eyes, feel the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the Mind in the least allayed.</p>
            <p>I shall add to these few Lines my hearty Wish, that this first Translation of a <hi>Classic</hi> in this <hi>Western World,</hi> may be followed with many others, performed with
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005361_0005_0000000000000000"/>
equal Judgment and Success; and be a happy Omen, that <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> shall become the Seat of the <hi>American</hi> Muses.</p>

            <head>THE CATO MAJOR Of M. Tullius Cicero, OR His DISCOURSE OF OLD - AGE, ADDRESSED TO <note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Titus Pomponius Atticus,</hi> to whom this Discourse is address'd, was of an ancient Family of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Equestrian Order, the second in Dignity amongst the <hi>Romans.</hi> Of all <hi>Cicero's</hi> Friends He appears to have been the most intimate and the most esteemed: For of the 36 Books now extant of <hi>Tully's</hi> Epistles, there are no less than 16, composing a distinct Tome, directed to <hi>Atticus</hi> alone. His Character in Life, as left us by his intimate Friend <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> may be justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the most beautiful we have received from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of either Greek or Roman. Nor does it appear to have been parallel'd in any Age: For tho' he liv'd in the Times of the greatest Factions and Divisions in <hi>Rome,</hi> as those of <hi>Sylla, Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna, Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> with <hi>Anthony, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Octavius</hi> (afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Augustus,</hi>) he conducted himself with such consummate Prudence and Integrity, that tho' caress'd by all, he neither joined with, nor offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any of them. But being possess'd of a vast Estate, neither acquired on his Part, nor improved by any lucrative Measures whatsoever; for his Patrimony was about the Value of 160 thousand Pounds Sterling; and by the Will of a surly Uncle, whom none besides could please, he receiv'd about 800 thousand more, with many other Legacies from his Friends and Admirers: Of this vast Estate, I say, besides his annual Expence on a genteel and hospitable, yet frugal Table, he spent the greatest Part in relieving the Distressed of every Party (as each had their Turns, <hi>octavius</hi> excepted) without any other Distinction than that of their Worth and Wants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and without any Conditions or Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Retribution. In his Youth, to avoid being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by his Friends in the Contentions with <hi>Sylla,</hi> he retired to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he spent most of his Time in Study, and the Income of his Estate in public and Private Benefactions; and became so dear to the People there, that they almost adored him; yet he would never allow them to erect so much as one Statue to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, tho' it was their constant Practice to all such as deserved well of their State. From hence it was he took the Name of <hi>Atticus</hi> (or <hi>Athenian,</hi> for so the Word imports) here alluded to by <hi>Cicero.</hi> But his Life may be read more at large in the mentioned Author <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Nepos,</hi> now in English. I shall therefore only add, That he was about two Years older than <hi>Cicero,</hi> but survived him 12 Years, dying in his 78th Year, in the 722d after the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and about 30 Years before the Birth of our Saviour; <hi>Cicero</hi> being put to Death by <hi>M. Anthony's</hi> Order, in his 64th Year, and in the 710th of <hi>Rome.</hi> That his Sister was married to <hi>Quintus Cicero,</hi> Brother to the Author; his Daughter to the Emperor <hi>Augustus's</hi> great Friend and Favourite <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> whose Daughter by her was the first and the beloved Wife of <hi>Augustus's</hi> Successor the Emperror <hi>Tiberius;</hi> but he was obliged to part with her, to marry his Father-in-Law <hi>Augustus's</hi> Daughter, the infamous <hi>Julia.</hi> I shall, in relation to both <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Atticus,</hi> add a Sentence of <hi>Seneca's,</hi> in his 21st Epistle to <hi>Lucilius.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Cicero's</hi> Epistles (says he) will not suffer <hi>Atticus's</hi> Name to die. His Son-in-Law <hi>Agrippa,</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-in-Law <hi>Tiberius,</hi> or his Grand-Nephew <hi>Drusus Caesar,</hi> would have avail'd him nothing; amongst all those great Names and Assinities he would not have been remembred, had not <hi>Cicero</hi> grasted him into his own Fame.</q> Yet <hi>Attieus</hi> wrote some valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Books himself, but they are all lost.</note> TITUS POMPONIUS ATTICUS.</head>

Improvements, the most consummate Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Humanity. And yet, to be free with you, I cannot but think you are sometimes touched with the same Pains at Heart, that, I assure you, deeply affect me. <note n="4" place="bottom">From the late Revolution in the State, by the Usurpation of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> who, without any other Right or Pretence to it, than that of the Power of his Army, the Subjects as well as himself of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth, instead of obeying the Senate's Order to disband, he made War on his native Country, Pursued <hi>Pompey,</hi> who commanded the Army of the Senate, into <hi>Greece,</hi> and at <hi>Pharsalia</hi> in <hi>Thessaly</hi> intirely routed him; made himself, on his Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> perpetual and absolute Dictator, and became the first of the Roman Emperors. For tho' about three Years after, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy of <hi>Brutus, Cassius</hi> and others, in Hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their Liberties, he was stabb'd in the Senate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House; yet his Sister <hi>Julia's</hi> Grandson <hi>Octavius,</hi> a Youth then, but of about 18 Years, whom he had by Will made his Heir, found Means to get into the same Seat, and cloath himself with the same Power; and from him it was continued (tho' only for four Successions in his own, or rather in his Wife <hi>Livia's</hi> Family, who all proved Tyrants, and two of the four, <hi>Celigula</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> meer Monsters of Cruelty) till <hi>Rome</hi> itself became a Prey to the <hi>Goths,</hi> or other Northern Nations. But on mentioning this first of the Roman Emperors, it may not be amiss here to observe of him, that tho' he was a Person of the sublimest Genius, adorned with every Accomplishment of Nature or Art, and not at all of a cruel Disposition, but on the contrary of a Temper truly clement and generous; yet by the Iniquity of the Times, he seemed to have been sent into the World for the Destruction of Mankind: For <hi>Pliny,</hi> after a most exalted Character of his Abilities [<hi>Nat. Hist. L.7.c.</hi> 25.] tells us, that he himself acknowledged he had in his Wars destroyed the Lives of 1,192,000 Men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of these that sell in those horrid Civil Wars he engag'd his Country in; for which <hi>Lipsius,</hi> on men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this, [<hi>De constantia, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 22.] justly calls him <hi>Pestem perniciemque generis bumani,</hi> The Pest and Plague of Human Kind. And tho' the Numbers of those that fell in their Civil Contentions, are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aioned, yet they may be guessed at, by comparing the two last Census taken of the Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> that are mentioned by <hi>Livy</hi> in the Epitomes of his Books still extant; for 'tis noted in that of his 98th Book, in the 682d Year of the City, that the Number was no less than 450 thousand Men, but in the Year 706, on <hi>Caesar's</hi> Return from his Victory over <hi>Pompey,</hi> the Number was reduced to 150 thousand; so that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> alone, and chiefly by these Contentions, lost two full Thirds of her People, and she still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to lose by the ensuing Wars after <hi>Caesar's</hi> Death, carried on by <hi>Octavius</hi> (afterwards <hi>Augustus</hi>) and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> against <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> &amp;c.</note> But these are Matters of a more
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005361_0013_0000000000000000"/>
important Weight, that require Arguments from a deeper Fund to support us under them; which may hereafter be applied to them. The Subject I have now chose to write on, is OLD AGE; which, as it is advancing on us both, and in a little Time must unavoidably seize us, I would look out, and endeavour to find the best and surest Means, to make the Burthen of it sit as easy on us as possible. Tho' for your Part, I am well assured, that as you

bear all Accidents and Events with the greatest Firmness and Moderation; so you will equally dispense with all the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that can attend this State. But as I resolved to write on the Subject, you <hi>(Atticus)</hi> of all Men appeared to me the most worthy and proper to direct it to; for being made yours, we may in common apply it to our Use together. <note n="5" place="bottom">In what Year of his Life <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent little Tract, does not clearly appear.

                     <hi>Marcus Porcius Cato]</hi> of which Name there were two Persons very famous in the Roman History: And the Lives of both are in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and Author now in the Hands of most <hi>English</hi> Readers of History. But of the Eldest, who is the Person intended here by <hi>Cicero,</hi> I shall add the following Account from the great Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Livy,</hi> whose Work is not yet so common in our Language. In Bo. 39. c. 40. speaking of the Election of Censors, in the 570th Year of the City, for which there stood six Candidates of the Nobility, and as many of the Commons, of whom <hi>Cato</hi> was one; (and he was Perfectly <hi>Novus Homo,</hi> a New Man; so they called those of obscure Families who got Offices in the State; but new as he was, he had been Consul 11 Years before, in the 36th of his Age:) The Historian, I say, having named the 12 Candidates, proceeds thus: <q>But <hi>Marcus Porcius Cato</hi> had vastly the Advantage of them all, as well of the Patricians as the Plebians of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Families.</q> [For there were Illustrious ones of the latter as well as of the former.] <q>This Man (says he) was Master of such natural Abilities, and of so much Spirit, that where-ever he had been born, he would have made his Fortune. He was skill'd in every Art, both of publick and private Life, and equally in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of both City and Country. Some have rose by their Knowledge in the Law, others by Eloquence, and others by their military Atchievements: But he was so equally qualified for them all, that one would think him born to that alone, whatever it was, that he took in Hand. As a Soldier he was brave, and signalized his Courage in many Engagements; and when advanced to the highest Posts, a no loss con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate General. In Peace, when consulted in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Right, he shewed the highest Skill; and in pleading a cause, no less Eloquence. Nor did this appear during his Life only, as in those whose Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in that Way flourish and die with them; for His remain and live consecrated to Futurity in his Writings of every kind; as his extant <hi>Orations,</hi> as well in Defence of himself, as both for and against others, fully shew: For he gave his Adversaries Work, both by his Impeachments and his Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And indeed he was rather too much engaged in Contention: Nor is it easy to say, whether the Nobility bore harder on him, or he on the Nobility: For his natural Temper, it must be owned, was somewhat of the harshest, and his Tongue of the fre-est. But then he had a Soul impenetrable to all the Allurements of Pleasure; most rigidly honest and unblemished, above courting the Favour of Men, and no less contemning Riches.

                     <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius.</hi>] There were two Pairs of illustrious Romans of these Names, noted for their mutual Friendship. The first flourished in the Time of, and acted very great Parts in the 2d <hi>Punic</hi> or <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> War: For this <hi>Scipio</hi> was the Man, to whom <hi>Rome</hi> not only ow'd its own Deliverance and Safety, but nearly all her Advantages and Conquests over the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> who, after they had brought that City to the very Brink of Ruin, were afterwards obliged, and principally by the Conduct of <hi>Scipio,</hi> to submit to hard Conditions of Peace; [see Note 24 &amp; 29.] For which he afterwards bore the Name of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> as the Conqueror of <hi>Afric:</hi> And in all these Actions <hi>Laelius</hi> was his almost inseparable Companion. But the Pair of the same Names here intended by <hi>Cicero,</hi> were two Generations younger. This <hi>Scipio</hi> was the real Son of the Great <hi>Paulus AEmilius,</hi> whose Life is amongst those of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> [see Note 24.] but was, after the Manner of the Romans, adopted by the Son of the first Great <hi>Scipio Africanus;</hi> who, being himself but of a weakly Constitution of Body for a Son to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, chose one of that illustrious Family of the <hi>AEmilii:</hi> Hence laying down his paternal Name, he, according to Custom, took that of the Family he was grafted into; and afterwards, for his Conquest and Demolition of <hi>Carthage</hi> in the 3d <hi>Punic</hi> War [see Note 29.] he also bore the Name of <hi>Scipio Africanus;</hi> but to distinguish him from his Grandfather, he was called <hi>Africanus Junior,</hi> and frequently from his own Father's Name, <hi>Scipio AEmilianus.</hi> He had also the Title <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantinus</hi> given him, from his Reduction, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the utter Destruction of the famous (the glorious) City of <hi>Numantia</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> in which, as brave a People as ever were known on Earth, and who as little deserv'd it, were utterly destroyed, Men, Women and Children; not in open Battle, nor by taking the Place by Force; for the Romans durst not engage them; but by hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them in with greater Numbers, and utterly starv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Yet this <hi>Scipio</hi> was in himself a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Person, and in all other Respects, save in these two inhuman Atchievements, the Destruction of <hi>Carthage</hi> and of <hi>Numantia,</hi> which were done in Obedience to the State, and were in those Times accounted glorious; he appears to have deserved the Character given him by the before-mentioned <hi>Paterculus,</hi> L. I. C. 12. which is this: <q>A Man who equall'd the Virtues of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>Scipio,</hi> and of his own Father <hi>Paulus AEmilius;</hi> who, for every Accomplishment, either for the Sword or Gown [War or Peace] for his natural Abilities, and his vast Improvements of these, was undoubtedly the most eminent of his Age; who, in the whole Course of his Life, never did, spoke or thought a thing that was not worthy of Praise.</q> But having opposed the Party of that turbulent Tribune <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> Brother to his Wife <hi>Sempronia,</hi> and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the first Great <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> before-mentioned, by his admired Daughter <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and consequently this <hi>Scipio's</hi> own First-Cousin, as was shewn before, by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option; after he had been waited on home in full Health by the principal Senators, he was the next Morning found dead in his Bed, strangled as some thought, or, as others, poisoned, and not without his Wife's Privity: Nor was his Death further inquired into; such was the Confusion of the Time. Thus ended that very Great Man, in the 56th Year of his Age, and in the 625th of the City. <hi>Vell.

               <p>SCIPIO. <hi>Laelius</hi> here with me, <hi>Cato,</hi> as we greatly admire your Wisdom and vast Compass of Knowledge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, so we have been particularly wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to see how very easily and chearfully you bear your Age; for we can't perceive it gives you any Manner of Trouble; while we have observed others complaining of theirs, as if the Burthen were unsupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. CATO. Indeed, my Friends, you place your Wonder on a Matter far below deserving it, a Business in which there is little or no Difficulty at all; provided proper Measures be taken in it. For know this, that those who have no Aid or Support within themselves, to render their Lives easy, will find every State irksome: While such as are convinced, they must owe their Happiness to themselves, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005361_0023_0000000000000000"/>
that if they cannot find it in their own Breasts, they will never meet with it from abroad; will never consider any thing as an Evil, that is but a necessary Effect of the established Order of Nature; which Old Age most undoubtedly is. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly strange, that while all Men hope they may live to attain it, any should find Fault with it, when it comes their Share. Yet such is the Levity, Folly, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness of Mankind, that we see there is nothing more common. But, oh! they say, it has crept on us too fast, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken us sooner than we thought or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. In the first Place, pray who put them on thinking wrong? How can they say, Old Age creeps faster on Manhood, than Manhood succeeded Youth and Childhood? Or how would it sit lighter at the Age of Eight Hundred Years, if that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005361_0024_0000000000000000"/>
were the Term of it, than at Eighty? For the longer Duration of the preceeding Age, when once 'tis past, abates Nothing from the Effects of Old Age, when come; nor affords any Relief against the Follies and Weakness of such as sink under it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you have, as you say, admired my Wisdom, (which I wish were equal to your Opinion of it, and that I truly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the Name I bear) I know nothing it consists in more effectually than this, that I follow Nature, my most excellent Guide, as my God, and submit to his Power in all things; who if, thro' his Conduct, all the preceeding Parts of Life have been well performed, it is not probable, that he will suffer the last Act, as 'tis common with bad Poets, to wind up ill. But it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, that some Term, some Period should be set; and that, as it is with the Fruits of Trees, and of the Earth, Seasons should be allowed for their Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Growing, Ripening, and at last to drop. This wise Men will submit to, and chearfully bear: Nor could any thing else be meant by the Stories told of the Giants Warring against the Gods, than Men's

Rebelling against Nature and its Laws. LAELIUS. But, <hi>Cato,</hi> you would highly oblige us both (for I may venture to speak for <hi>Scipio</hi> as well as myself, since we both hope, or doubtless wish at least, to live to be old in our Turn) if you would be pleased to instruct us before-hand, how, and by what Methods, we may avoid the Inconveniencies that generally attend Old Age, so as to render it the more easy to us, when we reach it. CATO. With all my Heart, <hi>Laelius,</hi> in case you both desire it. SCIPIO. We both earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, <hi>Cato,</hi> if not too troublesome; for as you are now well advanceed towards the End of a long Journey, which we probably are to travel after you, we would gladly know of you, how you find it, in the Stage you are arrived at.</p>

               <p>CATO. Well, I shall do my best to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you.

But to me such Men appear to lay their Charge intirely wrong; for if what they complained of, were owing only to their Years, the Case must be the same with me, and all others of the like Age: Yet I have known several who have lived to be very old, without complaining at all; for they appeared not only easy, but pleased at their being delivered from the Tyranny of their former youthful Passions; and far from finding themselves slighted, were still honoured and revered by those about them. But the true Ground of such Complaints lies wholly in the Manners of the Men: For such as take Care to be neither
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005361_0027_0000000000000000"/>
peevish, humoursome, nor passionate in Old Age, will find it tolerable enough; but a perverse Temper, a fretful or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Disposition, will, where ever they prevail, render any State of Life whatsoever unhappy. LAELIUS. That is very true, <hi>Cato,</hi> but may not some alledge, it is your easy Circumstances in Life, with your Power and Dignity, that produce this happy Effect, and render your Old Age in particular so easy; but these, you know, are Articles that fall but to very few People's Share.

               <p>BUT on considering the Subject we are upon, I find there are four Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies charged on Old Age, which, they say, render it unhappy.

They might with as much Justice assert, that a Pilot on board a Ship does nothing, because he neither mounts the Shrowds, hawls the Ropes, nor works at the Pump; but without any bodily Labour, minds only the Steerage, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005361_0044_0000000000000000"/>
directs the Helms-Man; which is of more Importance to the Ship's Preservation, than the Work of all the rest besides. For 'tis neither by bodily Strength, nor Swiftness, nor Agility, that momentous Affairs are carried on; but by Judgment, Counsel, and Authority: The Abilities for which are so far from failing in Old Age, that they truly increase with it. Unless you imagine that I, who, when I was in the several Stations of a Soldier, of Tribune, of Lieutenant General, and of Consul, personally active in the War, am now idle and do nothing, because I am no longer, as formerly, in the Field. But tho' not there, it will be allowed, I believe, that I am employed, at least, to full as good Purpose at home. I now direct in the Senate what our Armies are to do abroad, and lay down the Plan before-hand, how our dangerous Rival, <hi>Carthage,</hi> that I am sure has been long meditating further Mischief, is to be prevented in her Designs, and effectually humbled. For I shall ever think, while that Place stands, it will be contriving our Ruin; and that short of its total Destruction, <hi>Rome</hi> can never be

                     <hi>Carthage</hi> ('tis said) was built by <hi>Dido</hi> from <hi>Tyre,</hi> about 70 Years before <hi>Rome.</hi> Both these Cities increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vastly in Strength and Power, became jealous of each other.

Sterl.] and to give up all their Claim to the Islands between <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Afric,</hi> as <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> &amp;c. Tired with this Tribute 24 Years after the Peace, at the Instances of <hi>Annibal,</hi> a second War was commenced, in which that General led an Army of 100,000 Foot and Horse, from <hi>Spain</hi> thro' <hi>Gaul</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> and gaining many great Battles, and over-running the whole Country, had nearly put an End to <hi>Rome.</hi> In <hi>Spain</hi> also the two <hi>Scipio's,</hi> endeavouring to prevent <hi>Hasdrubal</hi> from marching to join <hi>Annibal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> were with their Armies cut to Pieces, [See Note 97.] after which none caring to venture thither, <hi>Publius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Scipio,</hi> mention'd before at Note 7, Son of <hi>Publius</hi> one of those <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and Nephew to the other, being then but 24 Years of Age, offered himself; and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting some few Forces over thither, with the few seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Remains of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he collected, he had in five Years Time such Success, that he not only intirely defeated <hi>Hasdrubal,</hi> but expelled all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> from <hi>Spain:</hi> He then proposed to transport the Army into <hi>Asric,</hi> to draw <hi>Annibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy;</hi> but the Senate, thinking the Attempt too desperate, would not furnish him either with Men or Money for the Expedition: Upon which, borrowing Money on his private Credit, and perswading many who admired his Virtues, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, he made up a small Army of Volunteers, failed over to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as they had begun before this Battle to sue for Peace, on the Loss of it submitted to the hard Terms the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> imposed on them, in the 17th Year after his second War began. But the City flourishing in Trade, and still growing in Wealth and Power, gave some of <hi>Rome</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Apprehensions, left some Turn of Fortune might enable them to be even with <hi>Rome</hi> again: Amongst whom this <hi>Cato</hi> was the principal; but he was opposed in his Endeavours, to bring the Senate to a Resolution to destroy the Place, by <hi>Scipio Nasica,</hi> and many others; who look'd farther before them, and formed to foresee, that when-ever all Danger from that Rival Power should be intirely removed, and <hi>Rome</hi> should have none capable of giving them any further Jealousy or Fear, all Discipline would be lost, Vice and Luxury would prevail, and, as it truly prov'd, introduce such Seditions, as would at length utterly sink and ruin their whole Liberties. However 53 Years after the last Peace, in the 605th Year of the City, a third War was declared against <hi>Carthage,</hi> on Pretence of their disturbing that near Ally and good Friend of <hi>Rome, Masinissa.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Submissions to divert it; they delivered three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Hostages, and all their Arms, to obtain Peace: After which they received the Terms from the Senate; one of which being that <hi>Carthage</hi> itself should be demolished and razed to the Ground, and that they should not build again within less than ten Miles of the Sea. The People enraged at this, resolved rather all to lose their Lives, and die in their native Place. With the deepest Indignation therefore, and in a Fury, they set to make themselves new Arms; they cast up new Works; built Ships, and gave the <hi>Romans</hi> their Hands full for three Years. But this <hi>Scipio,</hi> having in the 2d Year of it been sent Commander against them, took and destroyed the Place, the 4th Year after the War began, which was about 3 Years after this is supposed to have been spoke to <hi>Scipio.</hi>

from us; but his glorious Actions will perpetuate his Fame for ever. He died the Year before I was Censor, nine Years after my Consulate, under which at the ensuing Election he was chosen again, and made the second time Consul.

proved burthensome to him? He would not then indeed, as formerly, have given Proofs of his Abilities in youthful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, as Racing, Leaping, Tilting or Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; but he would have done it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by Strength of Reason, cool Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mature Counsel.

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005361_0048_0000000000000000"/>
it is, that because it has been constantly observed, that Old-Men principally excell in these, therefore our Ancestors gave the great Council of the State the Title of <hi>Senate,</hi> as consisting of a Body of <hi>Senes,</hi> or Old-Men, as the Word imports.

                     <hi>Sophocles</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> a famous Tragic Poet, is allowed by all to have lived to a great Age, but Authors do not agree in the Length of it.

But you see that Old Age is so far from becoming languid and unactive, that it is always stirring, ever employing itself about something or other; generally indeed about such Things as the Person has been most conversant in, in the former Part of his Life. Nay some are so very averse to Idleness, that they rather choose to be learning something new, as <note n="45" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Solon,</hi> one of those seven, called the Wise-Men of <hi>Greece,</hi> was Archon or Praetor of <hi>Athens,</hi> the 3d of the 46th Olympiad, 594 Years before <hi>Christ;</hi> and having done many great Services for that Republick (tho' he was himself a Native of <hi>Salamis,</hi> an Island not far from <hi>Athens</hi>) the People would have given him the absolute Command, but he refused it. [<hi>Diog. Laert.</hi>] At <hi>Athens</hi> as formerly at <hi>Rome,</hi> Debtors who could not pay, were made Servants or Slaves to the Creditors; <hi>Solon</hi> having 7 Talents [£.1312. 10. Sterl.] due to him, remitted it; and caused all the Citizens in the same Manner to remit their Debts. The City at that Time had only <hi>Draco's</hi> Laws, said (because of their Severity) to be wrote in Blood: These he abolish'd, and gave the People new ones, many of which were excellent. He foretold <hi>Pisistratus's</hi> Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, but was not believed: When that Man got Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Government, <hi>Solon</hi> went to <hi>Craesus,</hi> King of <hi>Lydia;</hi> his Conversation with whom is well known: <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistratus</hi> proved moderate in his Government, and invited <hi>Solon</hi> back, but he declined to come. He wrote many Elegies, some Fragments of which are extant. He died in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> at 80 Years of Age; <hi>Lucian</hi> says 100: His Body was by his Order carried to <hi>Salamis,</hi> and buried in a Corn-Field, which he required to be plowed over him. See further, Note 92.</note> 
                  <hi>Solon</hi> we see glorying of himself in his Elegies, that <hi>daily learning something, he grew old:</hi>

As I also did, who, when I was well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in Years, applied myself to learn Greek, and studied both the Language and their Literature with such Eagerness, as if my Thirst for them were never to be satisfied; for I longed to be satisfied; for I longed to be acquainted with their Affairs, and gain'd so much Knowledge in them, that from thence I have been able to cite the several Examples you have heard from me: Nay so strong a Bent I had that Way, that hearing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in his Old Age had learned to play on the Fiddle (for Music with them was a reputable Exercise) I had almost got into the Humour of learning that too, but I declined it: However I took true Pains in their other Studies.</p>

               <p>BUT allowing it, that Old People lose their Strength, I say again, they do not want it. The Laws, their Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Institutions and Discipline of our Ancestors, publick and private, are their proper Business; but from Employments that require Strength of Body in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, we are exempted. It is therefore so far from being the Case with us, that more is expected from us than we are able to perform, that, to say the Truth, there is much less. But it will be alledged,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005361_0081_0000000000000000"/>
perhaps, that some People are so weakned with Age, that by it they are rendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of every kind of Business whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: To which I answer, That this is not so much the Fault of Age, as of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or the want of Health, which happens to all Ages. How weakly was <hi>Publ. Africanus's</hi> Son, he who adopted you, <hi>Scipio:</hi> He was all his Life so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly infirm, that he scarce ever knew what Health was: Tho' had he not been unfortunate in that particular, he might otherwise have proved another Glory to

our State; for he had not only all his Father's Greatness of Soul, but the further Advantage also of having that adorn'd with the politest Literature. What Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it then, if some Old Men labour under Weakness, since the Youngest, we see, cannot escape it? We must prepare ourselves, my Friends, against Old Age; and as it is advancing, endeavour by our Diligence to mitigate and correct the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Infirmities that attend it: We must use proper Preservatives, as we do against Diseases; great Care must, in the first Place, be taken of our Health; all bodily Exercise must be moderate, and especially our Diet; which ought to be of such a kind, and in such Proportion, as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:005361_0083_0000000000000000"/>
and strengthen Nature, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it. Nor must our Care be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to our Bodies only; for the Mind requires much more, which without it will not only decay, but our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will as certainly die away in Old Age, as a Lamp not duly supplied with Oil. The Body, we know, when overlaboured, becomes heavy, and, as it were, jaded; but 'tis Exercise alone that supports the Spirits, and keeps the Mind in Vigour. Hence it is, that you see Old Men disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously represented by <hi>Caecilius,</hi> and other Comic Poets on the Stage, when the Characters of weak and credulous, or dissolute Old Fellows, are exposed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Ridicule: But these are the Vices only of such as, when grey with Years, abandon themselves to Idleness and Extravagance, and not of Old Age itself. For as Wantonness and loose Desires are more peculiar to Youth than to the Aged; and yet not to all Youth, but to such only as are by Nature viciously inclined, or have been loosely educated; So that silly Dotishness, that is imputed to Old Age, will be found only in Persons of weak and

"The greatest Curse, the heaviest Plague, said he, derived on Man from Nature, is bodily Pleasure, when the Passions are indulged, and strong inordinate Desires are raised and set in Motion for obtaining it. For this have Men betray'd their Country; for this have States and Governments been plunged in Ruin; for this have treacherous Correspondences been held with publick Enemies: In short, there is no Mischief so horrid, no Villany so execrable, that this will not prompt to perpetrate. And as Adultery, and all the Crimes of that Tribe, are the natural Effects of it; so of course are all the fatal Consequences that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:005361_0088_0000000000000000"/>
ensue on them. 'Tis owned, that the most noble and excellent Gift of Heaven to Man, is his Reason: And 'tis as sure, that of all the Enemies Reason has to engage with, Pleasure is the most capital, and the most pernicious: For where its great Incentive, Lust, prevails, Temperance can have no Place; nor under the Dominion of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, can Virtue possibly subsist. That this might appear more plain, he desired his Hearers to form to themselves the Idea of a Person in the highest Raptures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the most exquisite Pleasures that could be conceived; and then try whether they could so much as imagine, such a Person in that State of Enjoyment, capable of Reflection, or making any more Use of his Reason, than if he were intirely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of it. He therefore insisted, that nothing was more detestable, nothing more

directly destructive to the Dignity of Man, than the Pursuit of bodily Pleasure, which it is impossible to indulge to a Height, and for a Continuance, without damping or extinguishing all the brighter Faculties of the Soul, and all the Powers and Light of the Understanding.

The <hi>Romans</hi> thus shut up, and in a manner besieged, could find no possible Means of extricating themselves, or to prevent their starving. The <hi>Samnite</hi> General <hi>Pontius</hi> having them at this Disadvantage, sent to his Father <hi>Herennius Pontius,</hi> who was in great Repute for his Virtue and Wisdom, for his Advice what he should do with the Enemy then in his Power. The Father advised his Son to dismiss them honourably, and make a Peace with <hi>Rome;</hi> for this generous Action would for ever engage the Friendship of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Son could not think of intirely giving up such an Advantage, and therefore sent to his Father again, desiring him to consider further of it. He then advised the General to put them all to the Sword; for by this, <hi>Rome</hi> would for a long Time be so weakned, that their Neighbours might for that Time at least live in Peace. This last Advice the Son thought too cruel, and, by the Advice of the Army, sending for his Father, prayed his Presence; who being very old, to oblige his Son, came to the Camp in a Waggon, and there supported both Parts of his Advice with Reasons, said he knew no Medium, and returned. But the Son, resolving to take a middle Course, gave all the <hi>Romans</hi> their Lives concluded Articles of Peace, to be confirmed by the Senate; took Hostages; but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed them all, and obliged the whole Army, with the Consuls, to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And thus they all returned home disarmed, in the utmost Confusion; which was also greater in the City, than if they had been utterly defeated or destroyed. <hi>Postbumius</hi> the Consul hereupon told the Senate, they were not obliged by what he and his Collegue <hi>Veturius</hi> had done; advised that they who signed the Articles, might be sent back bound to the <hi>Samnites,</hi> with the Officer called a Fecial, a kind of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, to deliver them. This being done, and these Men delivered to <hi>Pontius</hi> bound, <hi>Postbumius</hi> said, he was now no longer a <hi>Roman,</hi> but a <hi>Samnite;</hi> and having his Feet at Liberty, kick'd the Fecial Officer, and said, Now <hi>Rome</hi> has just Cause to make War on the <hi>Samnites,</hi> since one of those People (meaning himself) had violated the Law of Nations, and abused a sacred Officer of the <hi>Romans. Pontius</hi> justly provoked at this Fraud and Prevarication of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in a most reasonable Speech [as <hi>Livy,</hi> the Roman Historian, himself gives it, <hi>lib.</hi> 9.c.11.] refusing to receive the Consuls, highly upbraided the <hi>Romans</hi> for their Breach of Faith, loudly expostulated with those present, and insisted, That if they had any Regard to Justice, Honour, or for the Gods they swore by, they should either ratify the Peace made on his giving the Army their Lives and Freedom, or they ought to return to the same Place they had been by his Favour delivered from, where their Arms should be all restored to them, to use again as they pleased. And then he ordered those who were bound to be untied, and, telling them he had nothing to say to them, the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> would now insist on the Articles, which was all they had in Exchange for the whole Army of <hi>Rome;</hi> bid them go about their Business. Accordingly they went home. The <hi>Romans</hi> immediately carried on the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, in which <hi>Pontius</hi> had many Engagements with them; but at length, upon an intire Defeat of his Army, by <hi>Fabius Gurges,</hi> whom he had vanquished but a little before, he was taken Prisoner by him, led in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph at <hi>Rome</hi> 25 Years after the other Action, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generously there put to Death.—There is another Case in the Roman History, exactly parallel to this; when <hi>Mancinus</hi> the Consul, being with his Army caught by the <hi>Numantines</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> much in the same Manner, for making a Peace that displeased the Senate, was sent back, and in the same Manner delivered to that People, but refused by them; and then by a fresh Army, under the Command of this great Man, but ill employed, <hi>Scipio AEmilianus,</hi> they were famished to Death, and utterly destroyed; on no other Pretence, than to cover the Scandal the Romans conceived they underwent in being so shamefully beaten.</note> who

and which all good Men would, in Despite of all the Allurements of Pleasure, for its own sake pursue, and labour to obtain. Thus I judged it necessary to be the more full on this Head of Pleasure, and shew the Dangers of it, to the end you might clearly see, it is so far from being a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to Old-Age, its Palling our

Inclinations to Pleasure, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is rather a great and valuable Blessing. For if it is in a good Measure dead to the Enjoyments others find in Banqueting, sumptuous Feasts and Carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, it is freed at the same time from all the troublesome Effects of these; as Fumes, Crudities, uneasy Sleep, or the want of it; with divers other such like Disorders. Yet as Nature has so ordered it, that Pleasure should have a very strong Hold of us, and the Inclination to it appears deeply founded in our very Composition, (and 'tis with too much Justice that the divine <hi>Plato</hi> calls it

the Bait of Evil, by which Men are caught as Fish with a Hook;) therefore, though Age is not taken, nor can well bear, with those splendid sumptuous Feastings and Revels, yet we are not so insensible to the Pleasures of Life, but that we can indulge ourselves, and take a real Delight in sober and temperate Entertainments with our Friends. I remember, when I was a Boy, I often saw <note n="69" place="bottom">The Romans having had great Success for four Years against the Carthaginians, in their first War with them, by Land; but lying exposed to them by Sea, as having no Fleet, resolved to build one; and ordered the Consuls, of whom this <hi>Duillius</hi> was one, to proceed to the Work; and in sixty Days (<hi>Livy</hi> says) after the Timber was fall'n, they had [<hi>incredible</hi>] 160 Ships of War compleated, and at Anchor: To furnish which with Men, those designed for the Service, were taught all the Motions and Management of Oars, in which, while their Ships were building, they were exercised on shoar. But finding on Trial these Ships much more unwieldy than those of their Enemies; to ballance this, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived an Engine placed at their Heads, by which, when closed in with another Ship, they would grapple and hold her so fast, that she could not possibly get clear. They framed also on the Engine a kind of Platform to stand on, and enter other Ships by it. Thus they fought at Sea, as if they had been on Land, Hand to Hand with their Enemies: And in the first Engagement, <hi>Duillius</hi> sunk 14 Ships, killing 3000 Men, and took 31 Ships more with 7000 Prisoners; for which he triumphed.</note>

And I think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much obliged to my Age, that it has encreased my Inclination for Discourse and Conversation, and rendred the Business of Eating and Drinking a Matter still of more Indifferency to me. Yet where others take a Pleasure even in these, that
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005361_0105_0000000000000000"/>
I may not be thought to declare War against all Gratifications of Sense, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires Refreshment, and Old-Age is not without its Relish; I think such Entertainments even for the sake of good Cheer, so far as this is comfortable to Nature, are very allowable, and may sometimes be indulged, when duly limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Bounds of Moderation. But what now gives me the greatest Pleasure in these Cases, is to practise the Method instituted by our Ancestors, that is, That the Conversation should turn on Subjects proposed by the Master of the Feast, and that the Cups should be moderate and cooling, in a cool and shady Place in Summer, as in that of <note n="71" place="bottom">In <hi>Xenophon's</hi> Works there is a Tract called the <hi>Symposion,</hi> or Feast, consisting of the pleasant Discourses of the Guests; which is more natural than that of <hi>Plato's.</hi>

It is alledged that Old Age is not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to that Titillation of Pleasure, that is found in the other Parts of Life; which is certainly true: But at the same time it has this great Advantage to ballance it, that it does not so much as wish to have it. <hi>Saphocles</hi> said well, who, when he was asked at a great Age, whether he had yet any Acquaintance with <hi>Venus,</hi> answered, Heavens forbid! I thank the Gods I am got rid of that Tyranny. Such as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to those Pleasures, will think it hard to be debarred of them; but others, who have gone through, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> past them, find themselves happier in being deprived of the Inclination. Nor can any one be said to want, what he does not so much as wish for. And this State, I say, of not desiring, is preferable in itself even to that of enjoying. 'Tis true, that Men in their Prime have a greater Gust to all Pleasures; but then most of these are, in the first

Place, but mean in themselves; and in the next, if Old Men have not the same to such a Height, they either desire them not at all, or they have a competent Share of such as are fit for them. As those, perhaps, who sit in the Pit at the Theatre, have more of the Pleasure in seeing <note n="72" place="bottom">

For how solid, how sincere, think you, must that Pleasure be to the Mind, when, after it has happily work'd thro' the ruffling Tides of those uneasy Passions, Lust, Ambition, Emulation, Contention, and every strong impetutous Desire, it finds

But if it has the further Advantage of Literature and Science, and can by that Means feed on, or divert itself with some useful or amusing Study, no Condition can be imagined more happy than such calm Enjoyments, in the Leisure and Quiet of Old Age.

Here our whole Business is with the Earth, the common Parent of us all, which is never found refractory, never denies what is required of it, nor fails to return back what is commited to it with Advantage, sometimes indeed with less, but generally with a very large Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. Nor is it the View of this Increase only which yields Delight, but there arises yet a greater from a Contemplation of the Powers of the Earth, and Vegetation: For to me it is most affecting to behold, how, when the Soil is duly laboured and mellowed, and receives after harrowing the scattered Seed into its genial Bosom, warmed with due Heats and Vapours, it there cherishes it in its vital Embraces; and then opening, shoots it upwards, and rears it into a verdant Blade; which tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast Hold with its fibrous Roots below,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005361_0113_0000000000000000"/>
Springs up into a jointed Stalk, preparing new Seed again in its Cells, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually enlarges from the Ear, with the Grain exactly ranged in decent Rows; and is secured with Awns, to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end it from the Rapine of the little Birds, that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise assail and make Prize of it. But why should I enter into Particulars, or observe upon the first Planting, Shooting and Growth of the delicious Vine? I should never have done, if I indulged myself in representing at large the Pleasure I take in these Solaces of my Old Age. Nor must I dwell on that plastic Power seen in all the Productions of the Earth, which from so small a Grain in the Fig, or the little Stone of a Grape, or from the minute seeds of others, raises up such bulky Trunks with their shady Heads and extended Branches. But who can consider the Variety in the Methods of Propagation, by Shoots, Sprouts, Loppings, Quicksets and Slips, without being seized at the same time with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Delight? The Vine, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally runs low, and cannot rear itself without a Support, is for this end provided with Tendrils, by which, like so many
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005361_0114_0000000000000000"/>
Hands, it lays hold on every thing it meets with, that may raise it; and by these Aids expands, and becomes so luxuriant, that to prevent its running out into useless Wood, the Dresser is obliged to prune off its superfluous wandring Branches: After which, from the standing Joints, in the ensuing Spring, the little Bud, called the Gem, pushes out the new Shoot, whereon the tender young Grape is formed; which gradually swelling by Nourishment from the Earth, is at first austere to the Taste, but, guarded with Leaves around, that it may neither want due Warmth, nor suffer by too scorching Rays, it ripens by the Sun's enlivening Beams, and acquires that delicious Sweetness and beautiful Form, that equally please both the Taste and Eye; and then enriches the World with that noble Liquor, the Advantages of which I need not name. Yet it is not the Sense of these, nor of all the Advantages of Husbandry, as I have said, that so nearly affects me, as the Pleasure I find in their Culture alone: Such as ranging the Vines, and their supporting Perches in exact and even Rows, in arching and binding their
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005361_0115_0000000000000000"/>
Tops, lopping off the woody and barren, and training and encouraging the fruitful Branches, to supply every Vacancy; and then contemplating the Beauty and Order with the Process of Nature in the Whole. What need I mention the Pleasure of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the more barren Grounds, and rendring them fruitful, by bringing down Water in refreshing Rills, on the over-dry; and as carefully carrying it off from the wet and sunken; or by digging, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly trenching, to render them mellow? Or of the Advantages of Manure, of which I treated in my <note n="78" place="bottom">This Book of <hi>Cato's, de Re Rustica,</hi> is still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and is the oldest Book in Prose, that we have in the Latin Tongue; but does no great Honour to the Author.</note> Book of Husbandry, tho' the learned <note n="79" place="bottom">We have one, or as some account them, two short Books of <hi>Hesiod's,</hi> called <hi>Works and Days,</hi> with two others, in which, among some other Things, he lays down several Rules for Husbandry: And from these <hi>Virgil</hi> copies in his <hi>Georgies,</hi> but very much enlarged and far exceeded him.</note>

Hopes of softning him, sent him a large Present of Gold; but he with a brave Disdain rejecting it, sent back the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers with this Answer only, That he wanted none of their Gold, but thought it much more glorious to command those who valued it, than to possess it himself. Now, could so great a Soul fail, think you, of making his Years easy to himself, and agreeable at any Age? But to return to a Country-Life, that I may not quit the Subject I am upon, I mean, my own Old-Age: In those Days the Senators, that is, the <hi>Senes,</hi> or Old-Men of the State, dwelt in the Country, and lived on their Farms, <note n="82" place="bottom">

On this Farm the Messenger sent to him from the Senate, found him at Work; who desiring him to put on his Gown, that he might receive the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Senate, he left his Plow, and called on his Wife <hi>Racilia</hi> (for her Name is also remembred) to bring it to him; he put it on, and was then saluted by him, <hi>Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator;</hi> an Office so high, that it superseded all the other Powers, as has been noted before. <hi>Livy, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 26. pursues the Story, the Sum of which was this: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Rome,</hi> raised Levies, marched against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who then besieged the Consul with his Army in the Camp; subdued, and made them all pass <hi>sub jugo,</hi> a Mark of Subjection; triumphed for his Victory; and, having settled Affairs, laid down that great Office, which of Right he might have held for 6 Months, the 16th Day after he entred on it. But the other Part of the Story, of his causing <hi>Maelius</hi> to be put to Death, was 20 Years after, when in a great Old Age he was chose Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator again, on purpose to quell that Conspiracy. <hi>Livy,</hi> Bo. 4. c.13, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> has the Story.

                  <hi>L. Quinctius Cincin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> was at his Plow, when he was called

or War: And from hence it is, that the Serjeants or Messengers that wait on the Senate, first had, and to this Day retain their Name of <hi>Viatores,</hi> or Way-Men. Now, can we imagine that those great Men found themselves distressed by Old Age, while they would thus in the Country give themselves up to all the Variety of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Employments, that the Business of it either furnishes or requires? As for me, I must own, I think it impossible that any other kind of Life whatever can exceed it. For besides that Mankind cannot possibly subsist without it, there is not only a vast Pleasure derived from viewing and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Particulars I have mentioned, but it also fills the Heart with Joy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how by proper Care and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every thing is produced in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that can be subservient either to the Support and real Necessities of human Life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But I shall wind up, with observing, That as there is nothing more profitable, so there is not in Nature, in my Opinion, any thing more beautiful or affecting, than to behold a Plantation, with all the Parts of it, in compleat and perfect Order. And this, as I have said, is a Pleasure, that Old-Age is so far from being uncapable of enjoying, that it is by a kind of Impulse of Nature solicited and drawn to it.

only their Opinions when declared, but even their Looks and Nods carried an Awe with them, and in a manner commanded Submission. Old-Age in a Person graced with Honours, is attended with such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Authority, that the Sense of this alone is preferable to all the Pleasures Youth can enjoy.</p>

               <p>YET in all I have said, I desire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to mean the Old-Age of such Persons only, as have in their Youth laid solid Foundations for Esteem in advancing Years; for on no other Terms ought we to expect it. And hence it was, that what I once said in a publick Speech, met with so general an Applause, when I observed, That miserable was that Man's Old-Age, who needed the Help of Oratory to defend him. Grey Hairs and Wrinkles avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to confer the Authority I am here
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005361_0129_0000000000000000"/>
speaking of: It must be the Result of a Series of good Actions, and nothing but a Life honourably and virtuously led, thro' all the advancing Steps of it, can crown Old-Age with this blessed Harvest of its past Labours. Nor are those common Marks of Respect, tho' but of little Moment in themselves, to be altogether slighted; such as Morning-Salutations; to have the <hi>Way</hi> or Upper-hand given; to be waited on home or from home, and to be consulted; which, both with us and in all well-regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated States, in Proportion as they are more or less so, are most strictly observed and practised. <hi>Lysander</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> whom I lately mentioned, was wont to say, That <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was of all Places the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Sanctuary for Old-Age: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the World is a greater Deference paid to Years, and in no Place Grey Hairs more reverenced and regarded. I find this also related, That a very old Man coming into the Theatre at <hi>Athens,</hi> to see the Play, and the Throng being so great, that he could find no Room nor Seat among his own Citizens, passing along to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Part where the Embassadors
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005361_0130_0000000000000000"/>
of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> then present, were placed; they all immediately rose up to give him a Seat: The <hi>Athenians</hi> observing this, clapt, and much applauded the Action; upon which one of the <hi>Spartans</hi> passed this just Reflection, That the <hi>Athenians</hi> (he perceived) knew very well what was right, but they knew not how to do it. There are many good Institutions in our College of Augurs, and particularly in this I am now speaking of, that the oldest Man always leads, and all the Members deliver their Opinions according to their Rank in Years; the Ancientest always taking Place, not only of such as have been in higher Posts that themselves, but even of those, who at the time bear the supream Command, and are at the Head of Affairs in the State. Now, what Satisfaction, think you, can all the Pleasures of Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken together, yield, that will bear a Comparison with those the Mind must feel, from the Returns of reverencial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect paid to the Authority of such an honourable Old Age? Which whoever enjoys and rightly applies, seems to me to have well and happily performed in acting

his Part in the Drama of Life, and at last like an approved Actor, he makes his last Part the best, and quits the Stage with an universal Plaudit. But it is said, People as they grow in Years, become more peevish, morose and passionate; and you may add covetous too: But, as I have said, these are the Faults of the Men, and not of Old Age. Yet something of a little Moroseness might probably, tho' not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together justly, be excused; for they may sometimes be apt to think themselves slighted and play'd on; and further, a frail Body can bear but little, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be the sooner offended. But all this may by proper Application be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or remedied: For by Reflection and a watchful Guard kept on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heart, natural Temper may be sweetned, and our Conduct softned. Of this we see frequent Instances in Life, and on the Stage a remarkable one in the two Brothers <note n="88" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mitio</hi> and <hi>Demea,</hi> Characters directly opposite in two Brothers; the latter of whom ruined his own Son by his Moroseness: The other by his mild Treatment of his Nephew, Brother to that Son, made him a fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Terence was contemporary with <hi>Cato,</hi> and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the <hi>Adelphi</hi> was first acted in the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 594, by the Names of the Consuls in the <hi>Didascalia</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it.</note> in <hi>Terence's Adelphi.</hi>

How rough and peevish is the one, how mild and good the other? And so the Case will generally hold. Some Wines four with Age, while others grow better and richer. A Gravity with some Severity is to be allowed; but by no means Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature. What Covetousness in Old Men can mean, I must own, I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; for can any thing be more sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly absurd, than that the nearer we are to our Journey's End, we should still lay in the more Provision for it?</p>

                  </abbr> The Aproach of Death, which 'tis certain can be at no great Distance. But miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the Case of that Old Man, who in so long a Course of Years, has not laid in a sufficient Provision against those Fears, and enabled himself to contemn Death,

which is either to be slighted, as being in Reality nothing in itself, in case it puts an intire End to us, Soul as well as Body; or else, it is to be valued, and to be desired and wish'd for, if it leads us into another State, in which we are to enjoy Eternity: And between these there can be no Medium. What then am I to fear in Death, if after it, I am to have no Sense, and therefore can feel no Pain; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise am to become immortal in another State by the Change? But again, can there be any one so void of Sense, as to think himself sure of living even to the next Evening? Nay, Youth in its greatest Vigour is subject to many more Casualties, and exposed to much greater and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Dangers that may shorten Life, than Old Age itself, which is allowed to be drawn so near its End. Their Heat of Blood, and the frequent Changes of Heats and Colds, which they undergo, render them more liable to Fevers and other Fits of Sickeness, which, when they happen, bear heaviest on the strongest Constitutions; nor have they generally, when sick, the Patience to be so carefully nursed, as more

elderly and experienced People. And from these and such like Causes it is, that we see so few attain to Old Age. But happy would it be for the World, if more lived to reach it: For as Prudence and Skill are gained by Experience, and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on, and is enlarged by Length of Days; we might from greater Numbers of People grown old in such Experience, expect to see the Affairs of Life, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, more regularly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred: And indeed without some such, Government could scarce subsist at all. But to return to the Consideration of Death impending.

that has a certain Period fixed: For when that is once come, all the past is over and gone; and in the Business of Life, when that is run out, nothing remains to us, but what results from past good and virtuous Actions. The Hours, and Days, and Months, and Years, all slide away, nor can the past Time ever more return, or what is to follow be fore-known. We ought all to be content with the Time and Portion assigned us.

that they are over, than the Husbandman repines that the Spring is past, and the Summer-Heats come on; or after these the more sickly Autumn. The Spring represents Youth, and shews what Fruits may be expected; the following Seasons are for ripening and gathering in those Fruits: And the best Fruits of Old Age are, as I have repeatedly said, the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, and, as it were, seeding on the Remembrance of that Train and Store of good and virtuous Deeds, of which, in the Course of Life, we laid in a kind of Provision for this Season. But further we are to consider, that as all we enjoy is from Nature, whatever proceeds from, or is conformable to the established Laws of This, must in itself be good. Now, can any thing be more agreeable to those Laws, than that People in Old Age should die, since, more inconsistently with the Order of Nature, we find the same thing happens to Youth, even in the Prime of their Years? But the Difference is great; for Young Men seem to be forced from Lift, as Fires are extinguished by great Quantities of Water thrown on them;

when on the contrary, Old Men expire of themselves, like a Flame when all its Fuel is spent. And as unripe Fruit requires some Force to part it from its native Bough; but when come to full Maturity, it drops of itself, without any Hand to touch it: So Young People die by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing violent or unnatural; but the Old by meer Ripeness. The Thoughts of which to me are now become so agreeable, that the nearer I draw to my End, it seems like discovering the Land at Sea, that, after the Tossings of a tedious and stormy Voyage, will yield me a safe and quiet Harbour.</p>

The People hereupon, to secure him for the future, granted him a Guard of fifty Young Men. On the Foot of this Grant, he added what Number he thought fit; and then possessing himself of the Citadel, he usurped the Government; yet made no Change either in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy or the Laws, save that he made himself Sovereign. But he was soon expell'd; recover'd it again by a stranger Contrivance; expell'd a 2d time, reinstated himself a 3d time, died possessed of it, and left it to his Children, who were expelled totally by <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> to whom Statues in Remembrance of this Action were erected.</note> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, on what Foundation he built his Presumption in so boldly opposing him,

then done by much the easiest. Thus Old People, for the little Remainder of Life that is left them, should stand loose and indifferent, neither anxious to have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, nor precipitantly or without just Cause to shorten it; remembring the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> That no Man should quit his Post, but at the Command of his General, that is, of God himself. And in regard to those we are to leave behind us, tho' some have commended <hi>Solon</hi> for saying—He wish'd not to die unmourned and unlamented by his Friends; in which his Sense doubtless was, that he desired while he lived to be loved and valued by them; Yet I know not but that of <hi>Ennius</hi> is altogether as just,</p>

And after it, there is either no Sense at all, (as I have said) or such as we have great Reason to wish for. But this is a Subject which concerns not Old Men alone: It is the Business of the Young as well as the Old, to meditate on Death, and to make the Thoughts of it so familiar to them, that in every Age they can despise it, and so guard themselves against it, that it can never surprize them. Without this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion 'tis impossible at any Stage of Life, to have the Mind free and easy; since no Man can be ignorant that he must die, nor be sure that he may not that very Day. How then can such as dread Death have, under such absolute Uncertainties, so much as one quiet Minute? But I need not dwell on this Head, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on our own History, and consider, not only such Examples of Intrepidity and a noble Contempt of Death; as that

[So sacred was an Oath by their Idols held by those Heathens, that are now so little regarded, even by Christian Princes, as well as others.] Coming to the Senate, <hi>Regulus</hi> behaved as a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> whose Subject he said he was; but being required to give his Sentiments as a <hi>Roman,</hi> he advised both against a Peace and an Exchange. See <hi>Horace,</hi> Bo. 3. Ode 5. on this Subject. His Friends on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate's taking his Advice, used their utmost Endeavours to disswade him from returning with the Embassadors, since he could expect nothing but the most cruel Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor would the Senate either encourage his Return or his Stay. But, his Oath and plighted Faith, he said, was of more Weight with him, than the Fear of Tortures or Death. He was unmoveably fixt, refused to see his Wife and Children, and embarked and returned in the same Company he came in. Upon his Arrival, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians incensed against him, caused him (as 'tis said) to be tormented to Death, by cutting off his Eye-lids, placing him erect on his Feet in a narrow Wooden Case drove full of sharp Spikes with their Points towards his Body; that he should not lean, or sleep, or rest, without running upon them; and exposing him in that Condition with his Face turned all Day to the Sun, till he expired.

From which Passage in so faithful an Historian, <hi>Palmerius</hi> concludes, that the Family of the <hi>Atilij (i. e.</hi> of <hi>Reguius)</hi> to excuse that Barbarity, framed this Story of <hi>Regulus's</hi> Death, which, being to the Dishonour of the Nation they were at War with, and greatly hated, easily obtain'd Credit, and passed afterwards for Truth. Which indeed is not improbable. <hi>J. le Clere,</hi> in a Note on <hi>Freinsheimius's Suppl.</hi> to <hi>Livy, (lib.</hi> 18.) joins in this with <hi>Palmerius.</hi>—But tho', for the sake chiefly of this late Discovery, I have already dwelt too long on it here; I cannot forbear adding, That <hi>Palmerius</hi> ought not to have said, that <hi>Polybius</hi> has given the History of this War largely or prolixly (<hi>fuse ne dicane prolixe,</hi>) for he professes to give only a summary Account of it, as but preparatory to that of those Actions, with which he designed to begin his History: And therefore, tho' that War continued near 24 Years, and was, as he himself says, the greatest and most terrible that had ever been known, (the Romans, who had not one large Ship when it began, having lost 700 of five Banks of Oars, that is, of 300 Rowers each, and the Carthaginians 500 such, besides vast Numbers of others; and, as near as I can judge, not less than 300,000 Men on each Side;) yet <hi>Polybius</hi> bestows but about two Thirds of his first Book upon the Whole. <hi>Livy</hi> gave it 4 Books, from the 16th to the 19th inclusive; but these, with all the rest of his 2d Decad, from 11 to 20, are lost, and only the Arguments saved. <hi>Appian's</hi> History of it is also lost, and he only barely mentions it, with <hi>Regulus's</hi> Death, in his Beginning of that of their 3d War. <hi>Diodor. Siculus's</hi> Account of it is also lost; for of his 40 Books we have but 15, with that Fragment mention'd before, and some other few Scraps.

Now, if Young Men, or those in the Vigour of Life, and many of them not only uncultivated by Learning, but meer Rusticks, who never had the Opportunity of Instruction, could so easily contemn Death; shall Old Men who have had the Advantage of Literature and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, be afraid of it? By living long we come to a Satiety in all things besides and this should naturally lead us to a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety of Life itself. Children we see have their particular Diversions; and does Youth, when past Childhood, pursue or desire the same? Youth also has its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Exercises; and does full Manhood require these as before? Or has Old Age the same Inclinations that prevailed in more vigorous Years? We ought then to conclude, That as there is a Succession of Pursuits and Pleasures in the several Stages of Life, the one dying away, as the other advances and takes Place; so in the same Manner are those of Old Age to pass off in their Turn. And when this Satiety of Life has fully ripen'd us, we are then quietly to lie down in Death, as our last Resting-Place, where all Anxiety ends, and Cares and Fears subsist no more.</p>

               <p>BUT why should I not speak freely, and without Reserve communicate my whole Thoughts on this Subject; of which as I am now drawing nearer to it, I seem to have a clearer Sense and View? I must say then, I am clearly of Opinion <hi>(Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius)</hi> that those great Men, and my very good Friends, your Fathers, tho' dead to us, do now truly enjoy Life, and such a Life as alone can justly deserve the Name. For while we are closed in these mortal Frames, our Bodies, we are bound down to a Law of Necessity, that obliges us with Labour and Pains to attend to the Discharge of the several incumbent Duties it requires. But our Minds are of a heavenly Original, descended from the blissful Seats above, thrust down and immersed into these gross Habitations of the Earth, a Situation alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unsuitable to a divine and eternal Nature. But the immortal Gods, I believe, thought fit to throw our immortal Minds into these human Bodies, that the Earth might be peopled with Inhabitants proper to contemplate and admire the Beauty and Order of the Heavens, and the whole
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005361_0157_0000000000000000"/>
Creation; that from this great Exemplar they might form their Conduct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their Lives, with the like unerring Steadiness, as we see is unvariably pursued, not only in those celestial Motions, but thro' the whole Process of Nature. Nor have I been led into this Belief from my own Reasonings only, but by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of those great and exalted Souls, the Philosophers who have lived before us. For I have heard, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> whom I may call our <note n="101" place="bottom">They resided in the South-east Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> formerly called <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ux or Portion of the Divine Universal Mind, that governs the Whole. I have also seen and considered the <note n="102" place="bottom">In <hi>Plato's Phaedon, now in English from <hi>Dacier's</hi> French Version.</hi>
                  </note> Discourse that <hi>Socrates</hi> held with his Friends, the last Day of his Life,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:005361_0158_0000000000000000"/>
concerning the Immortality of the Soul: That Great <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was judged by <hi>Apollo's</hi> Oracle to be the wisest of Men. But my Conclusion is thus, and I am fully perswaded in myself, That a Being so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and so swist in Thought, as to be consined by no Distance of Time or Place; that treasures up in Memory such Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Varieties of Things past, and from these also can form a Judgment of what is to ensue; that can comprehend within itself so many different Sciences and Arts; strike out new Inventions, and by fresh Discoveries still add to what has been known: Such a Being, I say, as is capable of all this, I am fully perswaded, can never be of a mortal Nature. For, as it is ever in Motion, yet is not put into it by any thing extrinsic to itself, but it is It-Self the Spring of all its Motion; therefore, since it cannot depart or go out from itself, it must necessarily ever continue, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not end. Again, as it is in Nature simple and unmixt, without any Composition of different or dissimilar Parts, it cannot therefore be divided; and if not divided, it cannot be dissolved and die. This
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:005361_0159_0000000000000000"/>
seems also to be an Argument for the Pre-existence of Souls, and that they were endued with Knowledge, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on this Stage; that Children so readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend Things altogether new to them in this Life, learn many difficult Arts, and take in the Notions of Things, as if they were natural to them, and they were not now learning any thing new, but were only recollecting what they had known before. Thus <hi>Plato</hi> argues.</p>

                  <hi>Xenophon, Cyrus</hi> the Elder in his last Discourse to his Children, expresses himself thus: Do not, my dear Children, imagine, that when I leave your, I shall be no more: For in the Time I have been with you, you could never see my Mind, but only knew by my Actions, that it was lodged in this Body. Be you therefore perswaded, that tho' you no longer see its Lodging, yet it still as surely exists, as before. For even the Fame and Honours of illustrious Men, could not, as we see they do, continue after Death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less their Souls, by their Existence, in some
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:005361_0160_0000000000000000"/>
Measure contributed to their Duration. I never indeed could persuade myself, that Souls confined in these mortal Bodies, can be properly said to live, and that when they leave them, they die; or that they lose all Sense when parted from these Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles: But, on the contrary, when the Mind is wholly freed from all corporeal Mixture, and begins to be purified, and recover itself again; then, and then only, it becomes truly knowing and wife.—Further, when the Body is dissolved by Death, it is evident what becomes of all the several Parts of it; for every thing we see returns to the Elements of which it was formed: But the Mind alone is never to be seen, neither while it is actuating the Body, nor after it leaves it.—You may further observe, that nothing so much resembles Death, as Sleep: But the Soul in Sleep, above all other Times, gives Proofs of its divine Nature: For when free, and disengaged from the immediate Service of the Body, it has frequently a Foresight of Things to come: From whence we may more clearly conceive what will be its State, when intirely freed from this

Now, if the Case be thus, you are then to consider and honour me, as a Knowing Spirit: But if my Mind should also die with my Body, let it be your Care, first to pay all Reverence to the Gods, who support and govern this mighty Frame; and also, with a due and pious Respect for my Name, keep me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in your Remembrance. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> on his Death-Bed.</p>

               <p>AND now, to mention some of our own People. No Man, <hi>Scipio,</hi> shall ever prevail on me to believe, that either your Father <note n="*" place="bottom">Mentioned in Notes 24, 8, and 97.</note>

exist, and to be Sharers as well as Witnesses of their Fortune. Do you imagine, that even I (for as I am an Old Man, I must talk a little of myself;) I say, that I would have undertaken such hazardous Attempts, and undergone such Fatigues by Day, such Toils by Night, at home and abroad, if I had supposed the Glory of my Actions must terminate with my Life, and all my Sense of it end with my being here? For if I had no further Views, might it not have been more eligible to me, to have past away my Days in Quiet and Ease, free from Toils and Care, and without Labour or Contention? But my Spirit rousing in itself, I know not how, had Futurity always so much in View, as if it were assured, that as soon as it quitted this Life, it would then truly live, and not before. And were it not really so, that our Souls are immortal, why is it that the greatest of Men so ardently aspire to immortal Glory? Or why are the Wisest ever the most easy and content to die, and the Weak and Foolish the utmost unwilling? Is it not, think you, because the most Knowing perceive, they are

going to change for a happier State, of which the more Stupid and Ignorant are uncapable of being sensible? For my Part, I have a passionate Desire to see your Fathers again, whom I loved and honoured while here; and I not only long to meet those I knew and loved, but those illustrious Souls also, of whom I have heard and read, and have with Pleasure mention'd them in my Writings. Nor would I now on any Terms agree to be stopt in my Passage to them; no, not on Condition to be restored to the Bloom and Vigour of Youth again: Or should any heavenly Power grant me the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of turning back, if I pleased, from this Age to Infancy, and to set out again from my Cradle, I would absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it; for as I have now got well nigh to the End of my Race, I should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly unwilling to be called back, and obliged to start again. For, if we consider Things aright, what is there in Life to make us fond of it? or that we can on solid Judgment pronounce truly valuable? Or who is there, or ever has been, who has not at some Time or other met with
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005361_0164_0000000000000000"/>
Trouble and Anxiety sufficient to make him weary of it? This Comfort however attends the Thought, that the more the Satiety grows upon us, the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to its End. I am therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar from being of the Mind of some, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them we have known Men of good Learning, who lament and bewail the Condition of human Life, as if it were a State of real Misery: For I am not at all uneasy that I came into, and have so far passed my Course in this World; because I have so lived in it, that I have Reason to believe, I have been of some Use to it; and when the Close comes, I shall quit Life as I would an Inn, and not as a real Home. For Nature appears to me to have ordain'd this Station here for us, as a Place of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, a transitory Abode only, and not as a sixt Settlement or permanent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. But Oh the glorious Day, when freed from this troublesome Rout, this Heap of Confusion and Corruption below, I shall repair to that divine Assembly, that heavenly Congregation of Souls! And not only to those I mentioned, but also to my dear <hi>Cato,</hi> than whom a more virtuous

Soul was never born, nor did ever any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in Piety and Affection. His Body I committed to the Funeral Pile, which he, alas! ought to have lived to do by mine: Yet his Soul did not forsake me, but keeping me still in View, removed to those Abodes, to which he knew, I was in a little Time to follow. I bore the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction indeed with the Fortitude that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me, to outward View, tho' inwardly I severely felt the Pangs of it; but in this I have supported myself, that I knew our Parting was to be neither far nor long, and that the Time is but short till we shall happily meet again.</p>
               <p>Now, these, <hi>my Friends,</hi> are the Means (since it was these you wanted to know) by which I make my Old-Age sit easy and light on me; and thus I not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm it of every Uneasiness, but render it even sweet and delightful. But if I should be mistaken in this Belief, that our Souls are immortal, I am however pleased and happy in my Mistake; nor while I live, shall it ever be in the Power of Man, to beat me out of an Opinion, that yields me so solid a Comfort, and so durable a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

And if, when dead, I should (as some minute Philosophers imagine) be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all further Sense, I am safe at least in this, that those Blades themselves will have no Opportunity beyond the Grave to laugh at me for my Opinion. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immortal or not, or whatever is to be our future State; as Nature has set Limits to all its other Productions, 'tis certainly fit our frail Bodies also should at their proper Season be gathered, or drop into their Grave. And as the whole Course of Life but too much resembles a Farce, of which Old-Age is the last Act; when we have enough of it, 'tis most prudent to retire, and not to make a Fatigue of what we should endeavour to make only an Entertainment. This is what I had to say of Old-Age; which I wish you also may live to attain, that you may from your own Experience, witness the Truth of the several Things I have now delivered you in this Conversation.</p>
