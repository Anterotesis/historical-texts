            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN we take a survey of Mankind in general, and of the several requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites by which life is rendered comfortable and desirable, the productions of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Kingdom are amongst the foremost; as affording the principal necessaries, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and luxuries of life.</p>
            <p>It is in this view, that the Science of Botany, or that branch of natural History which teaches the right knowledge of Vegetables, and their application to the most beneficial uses, is an object which not only merits the attention and encouragement of every patriotic and liberal mind, but undoubtedly deserves a place amongst the first of useful pursuits. That it is an object highly deserving the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Mankind in general, cannot be denied; but in a particular manner of the inhabitants of this Commonwealth, the author wishes to make appear more obvious.</p>
            <p>Those who are conversant in trade well know the continual enormous expence we are at in purchasing foreign Teas, Drugs, Dye-stuffs, &amp;c. The diminution of this, ought to be the care and concern of every friend to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's welfare. And we presume it will appear evident, that the most eligible and obvious 
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:019068_0004_0FAA0DE8751D4E28"/>
means of obtaining this desirable object, will be by a proper attention and application to Horticulture and Botany. In this view, the following considerations more particularly present themselves.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The introduction and cultivation of foreign useful and valuable plants.</hi> Our extent of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, our diversity of Climate, of Soil, and of Stuation, leaves not a doubt but that we might introduce and cultivate to advantage, many of the same articles, whose importation at this time, is to us, a considerable expence. The <hi>Thea viridis &amp; bohea,</hi> the true green and bohea Tea plant, formerly accounted different species, but now known to be the same, and one of the greatest drainers of our wealth; may be procured either from its native place of growth, or from Europe where it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pretty common; and we have every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, from its being the spontaneous produce of the same parallel of latitude, and from other considerations respecting its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural history, that it might thrive well in our Southern States. In this same view the Vine, the Almond Tree, Fig Tree, Liquorice, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Rhubarb, deservedly require our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many other <note n="*" place="bottom">See Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. I. Page 155.</note> foreign useful plants might be enumerated, and the advantages that may be derived to this Commonwealth from their introduction, encrease and culture, must appear sufficiently obvious.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:019068_0005_0FAA0DE881AF7CF0"/>
II. <hi>The discovering the qualities and uses of our own native Vegetable productions, and applying them to the most useful purposes.</hi> Our extent of luxuriant unexplored territory, is an object which here in a particular manner occurs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with promising advantages. Our being able to discover a plant of equal general usage with the <hi>Potatoe, Tobacco,</hi> or <hi>Ginseng;</hi> or good substitutes for <hi>Tea, Coffee</hi> and <hi>Peruvian Bark;</hi> would be advantages surpassing all adequate estimation.</p>
            <p>It is true, we may gain by tedious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or stumble by chance upon many useful discoveries respecting the uses and medicinal virtues of plants, but it is from our observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and researches founded upon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by, a <hi>knowledge of Botany,</hi> that we can alone hope for certain success. From the writings of the celebrated LINNAEUS this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule is sufficiently established; that plants of the same habit and appearance, and those which agree in the disposition of their flowers and fruit, have likewise similar virtues and properties. From this observation we deduce an obvious inference; that the more general knowledge we obtain of the characters and appearance of plants, the more likely we shall be also to encrease our knowledge of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, qualities and uses.</p>
            <p>This subject has been much urged and long dwelt upon from a conviction of its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and promising advantages: the author, influenced by these considerations, and from 
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:019068_0006_0FAA0DE94601DF50"/>
a belief that it might contribute in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to render a knowledge of this subject more familiar and easy, has been induced to draw up this Alphabetical Catalogue of the Forest Trees and Shrubs, natives of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican United States, as mentioned by the best authors, or since discovered by ingenious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers. In this Catalogue are contained their Linnaean Generic and trivial names, (or new formed ones where these have been wanting) together with their most common and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed English ones; the particular distinguishing characters of each Genus; a plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar description of the appearance, manner of growth, &amp;c. of their several species and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties; and also, some hints of their native soil and situation, uses in Medicine, as Dyes and in domestic oeconomy.</p>
            <p>As terms peculiar to the science frequently and unavoidably occur, it was judged neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, in order to render the work more useful and complete, to prefix a general explanation of the Linnaean system of arrangement, as also of the useful and unavoidable scientific terms; for this and other purposes the author has availed himself from the best writers, of what has been judged most applicable and conducive to his design. The whole forming an useful <hi>Vademecum Botanicum,</hi> or Botanical Companion.</p>
            <p>In this my <hi>Countrymen</hi> are presented at one view with a concise description of their own native Forest Trees and Shrubs, as far as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto discovered. And those whose fancy 
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:019068_0007_0FAA0DEA0BF38A30"/>
may lead to this delightful science, may by a little application, from hence be enabled scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifically to examine and arrange, not only those of the shrubby, but the several and various species of the herbaceous class. The <hi>foreigner,</hi> curious in American collections, will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by better enabled to make a selection suitable to his own particular fancy. If he wishes to cultivate timber for oeconomical purposes, he is here informed of our valuable Forest Trees: if for adorning his plantation or garden of our different ornamental flowering shrubs.</p>
            <p>The author would have been happy, could he have given also a descriptive Catalogue of our native herbaceous plants. At present, circumstances oblige him to confine himself to Forest Trees and Shrubs; however he has such a work in contemplation should this meet with the encouragement of the public.</p>
            <p>He is well aware that many improvements might have been made, with regard to the form and manner of description, as well as by the addition of Synonyms, Notes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, &amp;c. but, upon reflecting that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of his Readers would have been more embarrassed and confused than profited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he was determined to use the most plain and familiar method and language, in order to render the work as generally useful as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; this being the chief end and design of the undertaking.</p>

            <head>An Explanation of the different parts of Fructification.</head>
            <p>FRUCTIFICATION is a temporary part of vegetables, appointed for the purpose of generation, terminating the old vegetable and beginning the new. The parts of fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification are the seven following, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

               <item>7. The <hi>Receptacle,</hi> or base on which all the other parts of the fructification are connected.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>calyx</hi> (which is the termination of the outer bark of the plant, presenting itself in the fructification, in this form) comprehends the seven following species, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>perianthium,</hi> the <hi>involucrum,</hi> the <hi>amentum,</hi> the <hi>spadix,</hi> the <hi>glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> the <hi>calyptra,</hi> and <hi>volva,</hi> of each of which in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>perianthium,</hi> the flower-cup or empalement properly so called, is the most common species of calyx, and situated close to the fructification. If it encloses the <hi>stamina</hi> and <hi>germen,</hi> it is called the <hi>perianthium</hi> of the fructification. If it encloses the <hi>Stamina</hi> and not the <hi>germen,</hi> it is the <hi>perianthium</hi> of the flower. If it includes the <hi>germem,</hi> and not the <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> it is the <hi>perianthium</hi> of the fruit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>involucrum</hi> or cover is situated at the bottom of an um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, at some distance from the flower. It is called an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>involucrum</hi> or cover, if it is situated at the bottom of an universal umbel; and a partial <hi>involucrum</hi> or cover, if at the foot of a partial umbel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>amentum</hi> or katkin is that sort of calyx, which consists of a great number of chaffy scales proceeding from a common receptacle or slender thread, as in hazel, alder, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>spatha</hi> or sheath is a sort of calyx which bursts length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and puts forth a stalk supporting the flowers; as in <hi>narcissus,</hi> snow-drop, <hi>arum,</hi> indian turnep &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>gluma</hi> or chaffy husk, is that sort of calyx peculiar to grasses, composed of thin scales or valves, which are often terminated by an <hi>arista,</hi> a beard, or awn.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>calyptra</hi> a veil or hood, is a sort of calyx peculiar to 
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:019068_0014_0FAA0DF0C09D0F08"/>
mosses, placed over their <hi>antherae,</hi> and resembling a monk's cowl, or rather an extinguisher.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>volva</hi> is a sort of calyx peculiar to the <hi>fungi</hi> or mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room tribe, involving or inclosing their fructification. It is membranaceous and torn quite round.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>corolla,</hi> literally a wreath or garland, (serving together with the calyx as covers to the parts they inclose) is the termination of the inner bark of the plant presenting itself in this form, and consists of the <hi>petalum</hi> and <hi>nectarium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>petalum</hi> or petal is the corrollaceous covering of the flower. If the flower is monopetalous, <hi>i. e.</hi> consists of one petal, the lower hollow part of such a <hi>corolla</hi> is called <hi>tubus,</hi> the tube, and the upper part which spreads wider is called <hi>limbus,</hi> the limb or border. And from its different figure it is called either,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bell-shaped,</hi> without any tube below,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Funnel-shaped</hi> or conical, with a tube,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saucer</hi> or <hi>salver-shaped,</hi> with a tube,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wheel shaped,</hi> without any tube below; or</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaping,</hi> lipped or masked.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>corrolla</hi> be polypetalous, <hi>i. e.</hi> consists of many petals, the lower part of each petal is called, the <hi>unguls,</hi> or claw.</p>
            <p>And the upper part which is wider, is called the <hi>lamina,</hi> or thin plate.</p>
            <p>Again this upper part or <hi>lamina,</hi> is either</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cross-shaped,</hi> of four equal spreading petals; or</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Butter-fly-shaped,</hi> irregular and of four petals; the upper one of which is called the <hi>standard;</hi> the two side ones <hi>wings;</hi> and the under one the <hi>keel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>nectarium</hi> is that part of the corolla which contains the honey; having a wonderful variety both as to shape and situation, and is sometimes united with the petals, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times separate from them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>stamina</hi> are those parts of a flower appropriated to the preparation of the <hi>pollen,</hi> or fecundating dust, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of the <hi>filamentum,</hi> the <hi>anthera,</hi> and the <hi>pollen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>filamentum,</hi> the filament or thread serves to elevate the <hi>antherae,</hi> and connect it to the flower.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>anthera,</hi> or summit of the <hi>stamen,</hi> is that part which contains the <hi>pollen</hi> or fecundating dust, and discharges it when ripe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>pollen,</hi> or impregnating dust, is that fine powder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the <hi>antherae,</hi> or tops of the stamina, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed when ripe, upon the female organ, for impregnating the same.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:019068_0015_0FAA0DF1A34655A0"/>
IV. The <hi>pistillum,</hi> pointal, or female organ, adheres to the fruit, and is that part appropriated for the reception of the <hi>pollen,</hi> spoken of above. It consists of the <hi>germen,</hi> the <hi>stylus,</hi> and the <hi>stigma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>germen,</hi> or seed-bud, is the base or lower part of the <hi>pistillum,</hi> containing the rudiments of the unripe fruit, or seed, in the flowering state of the plant,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>stylus,</hi> or style, is that part of the <hi>pistillum</hi> which stands upon the <hi>germen,</hi> and elevates the <hi>stigma</hi> or summit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>stigma,</hi> the summit, or top of the style, is that part which receives the fertilizing dust of the <hi>antherae,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits its <hi>effluvia,</hi> through the style into the middle of the <hi>germen,</hi> or seed-bud.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The <hi>pericarpium,</hi> or seed vessel, is that part which contains the seeds, and discharges them when ripe. It comprehends the eight following species, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>capsula,</hi> the <hi>siliqua,</hi> the <hi>legumen,</hi> the <hi>conceptaculum</hi> or <hi>folliculus,</hi> the <hi>drupa,</hi> the <hi>pomum,</hi> the <hi>bacca,</hi> and the <hi>strobilus;</hi> of each of which in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>capsula,</hi> a capsule or little casket, is a dry hollow seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessel, that splits or opens in some determinate manner. Capsules, when opened or split, are divided outwardly into one or more pieces, called <hi>valvulae,</hi> or valves, the parts which divide the capsules internally into cells are called <hi>dissepimenta,</hi> or partitions. And the substances which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the partitions to the seeds, are called <hi>columellae,</hi> or little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars. The empty spaces for containing the seeds, are called <hi>loculamenta,</hi> or cells.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>siliqua,</hi> or pod is a seed-vessel with two valves, having the seeds fixed along the joining or edge of both valves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>legumen,</hi> or cod, is a seed-vessel with two valves, having the seeds fixed along the edge of one of the valves only.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>conceptaculum,</hi> a receiver; or <hi>folliculus,</hi> a little bag, is a seed-vessel with one valve, splitting length-ways from top to bottom, and has no seam for fastening the seeds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>drupa,</hi> drupe, or stone fruit, is a pulpy seed-vessel, which has no valve, or external opening, and contains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it a stone or nut.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>pomum,</hi> or apple, is a pulpy seed-vessel, which has no valve or external opening, and contains within it a capsule.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>bacca,</hi> or berry, is a pulpy seed-vessel, which has no valve, and contains seeds which are naked, or have no other covering than the pulp.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:019068_0016_0FAA0DF245D1D670"/>
8. The <hi>strobilus,</hi> or cone, is a seed-vessel composed of woody scales, laid over one another like tiles; it opens only at top, the scales being fixed below to the center of the cone.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Semen,</hi> the seed, is a deciduous part of the plant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the rudiments of a new vegetable, and fertilized by the sprinkling of the male dust. Under this head are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the seed properly so called, the <hi>nut</hi> and <hi>propago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>nut</hi> is a seed covered with a hard bony skin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propago,</hi> the seed of the mosses, which has no tunic or covering.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The <hi>receptaculum,</hi> or receptacle, the seventh and last part of the fructification on which the other six are connected, comprehends the <hi>receptaculum proprium,</hi> the <hi>receptaculum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune,</hi> and the <hi>spadix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>receptaculum proprium,</hi> or proper receptacle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the parts of a single fructification only. It is called the receptacle either of the <hi>fructification,</hi> when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both flower and fruit; of the <hi>flower,</hi> when the parts of the flower only are fastened to it without the <hi>ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> of the <hi>fruit</hi> when it is a base for the fruit, and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the receptacle of the flower; or of the <hi>seeds,</hi> when it is a base to which the seeds are fixed within the <hi>pericarpium</hi> or seed-vessel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>receptaculum commune,</hi> or common receptacle, is that which connects several florets together; as in compound flowers; and is either <hi>paleaceum</hi> chaffy, <hi>i. e.</hi> with thin membranaceous chaffy plates rising between the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>orets, or <hi>nudum</hi> naked, without chaffy plates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>spadix</hi> is the receptacle of the palms, and is always branched. It is also used to signify the flower stalk of every plant, which was originally contained within a <hi>spatha</hi> or sheath; but in this last case it is often simple.</p>

            <head>Explanation of the Modes of Flowering.</head>
            <p>The <hi>peduncle</hi> or foot-stalk of the flower is a partial trunk, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fructification only, but not the leaves.</p>
            <p>When branched or divided, each of the divisions is called <hi>pedicellus,</hi> or a little flower-stalk.</p>
            <p>Flower-stalks are distinguished from the place of the plant where they grow, into,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>radical</hi> flower-stalk, when they proceed immediately from the root.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>cauline</hi> flower-stalk, which proceeds from the stem.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="xix" facs="unknown:019068_0017_0FAA0DF333604478"/>
3. The <hi>branch</hi> peduncle, which proceeds from the branches.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>axillary,</hi> or bosom flower-stalk, which comes out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the leaf and stem, or between the branch and stem.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>terminal</hi> flower-stalk, which comes from the extremity of the branch or stem.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Solitary</hi> peduncle, when there is only one in the same place.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Scattered</hi> peduncles, when a great many grow together without any order.</p>
            <p>Flower-stalks are also distinguished from the different modes in which flowers are borne and connected on them, into the <hi>uniflorous, biflorous, triflorous,</hi> or <hi>multiflorous</hi> peduncle, that is, which bear one, two, three, or many flowers.</p>
            <p>Flowers are also collected or borne in the ten following modes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>fasciculus,</hi> a bunch or bundle, when peduncles are erect, parallel, placed close to one another, and all of the same height, as in <hi>sweet-william.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>capitulum,</hi> a little head, where many flowers are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a head, at the extremity of a peduncle, as in <hi>globe amaronthus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>spike,</hi> where the flowers sit close without foot-stalks, and are placed along a common flower-stalk. A spike is called <hi>secunda,</hi> single ranked, when all the flowers are turned to one side; or <hi>dislicha,</hi> double ranked, when the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers look to both sides, or stand two ways.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>corymbus,</hi> where the lesser flower-stalks of unequal lengths are produced along the common peduncle on all sides, and rise to the same height, so as to form a flat or even surface at top, as in <hi>spiraea opulifolia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>panicle</hi> where the fructifications are dispersed upon foot-stalks variously subdivided, as in oats, &amp;c. a panicle is said to be <hi>diffuse</hi> when the partial foot-stalks diverge, and the fructifications hang loose; or <hi>straight</hi> and narrow; when the foot-stalks approach near to one another.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>thyrsus</hi> is a panicle contracted into an oval or egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaped-form, somewhat resembling the cone of a pine; as in <hi>lilac, horse chesnut,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>racemus</hi> or cluster, consists of a common peduncle, having short lateral branches, all nearly of equal length proceeding from it; as in the <hi>vine, currants</hi> &amp;c. It is called <hi>racemus secundus,</hi> or a one ranked cluster when all the foot-stalks incline to one side; as in the <hi>sorrel-tree</hi> and most of our <hi>andromedas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="xx" facs="unknown:019068_0018_0FAA0DF3CC0C3698"/>
8. The <hi>verticillus,</hi> or whorl, where the flowers are produced in rings at each joint of the stem, with very short foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalks; as in <hi>mint, horehound,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>umbella</hi> or umbel, where a number of small flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalks rise from the same center to an equal height and form an even surface at top. It is called a <hi>simple umbel,</hi> when the flower-stalks are simple or undivided; and a <hi>compound umbel,</hi> or sometimes an <hi>universal umbel,</hi> when all the foot-stalks are subdivided into smaller umbels, commonly called <hi>partial umbels</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The <hi>cyma,</hi> or irregular umbel, where the foot-stalks rise from a common center, and to an equal height, as in the umbel; but the secondary or partial foot-stalks are irregularly dispersed, without order as in <hi>elder, viburnum</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <note place="bottom">§ <hi>The Reader is requested to observe that the names of the Species, under which the words,</hi> Bartram's Catalogue <hi>immediately occur, are not found in Linnaeus's Species Plantarum, but are taken from a Sheet Catalogue published by John and William Bartram, Botanists in Kingsessing; containing the names of Forest Trees and Shrubs, growing in, or near their Garden.</hi>

                  <p>This grows naturally upon the mountains in the back parts of Pennsylvania. The stems are slender, rising to the height of six or eight feet, and sending off several opposite branches. The leaves are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, pretty much sawed on their edges, and placed opposite upon pretty long footstalks. The flowers terminate the stalks in a pretty long erect <hi>racemus</hi> or bunch; they are small, of an herbaceous colour, and in part succeeded by small conjoined winged seeds.</p>

                  <p>This tree grows frequently to the height of fifty or sixty feet, with many spreading branches. The leaves are five-lobed, somewhat toothed, or deeply and irregularly sawed on their edges: they are of a lucid green on the upper side and a bright silver co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour on their under. The flowers are produced in little umbels at the foot of the leaves; they are of a deep red colour, and are succeeded by large winged seeds, which fall off early in the summer. This is perhaps the Acer rubrum of Linnaeus.</p>

                  <p>This tree is dioecious, or having male and female flowers upon different trees; it is but of middling growth, rising perhaps to the height of twenty or thirty feet. The leaves something resemble those of the Ash, but are generally trifoliate or quinquefoliate, or consisting of three or five lobes; which are oval, somewhat pointed, and a little notched towards their extremities. The flowers of the male are produced 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:019068_0021_0FAA0DF5FB81B038"/>
upon pendulous bundles of very long fine threads or footstalks, each having a small flower-cup at its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, containing five or more stamina. The female produces flowers at the extremity of the small branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in long loose bunches; they have long footstalks, with a small deciduous empalement; containing a compressed germen, with scarce any style, but two reflexed stigmas.</p>

The leaves are divided into three very sharp pointed lobes, and very finely sawed on their edges. The flowers are produced in solitary bunches, with shortish footstalks; having pretty large petals and empalements, containing generally eight stamina or filaments; and in hermaphrodite flowers two reflexed stigmas. The flowers and seeds are of a greenish yellow colour.</p>

                  <p>This grows to a pretty large size in a rich soil. The leaves are three and sometimes nearly five lobed, and sawed on their edges. The flowers are produced in little umbels closely surrounding the small branches, and are of a scarlet colour. The footstalks of the hermaphrodite flowers, shoot out to a considerable length; they are of a scarlet colour, each sustaining two joined winged seeds, somewhat of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.

The leaves something resemble the Silver-leaved Maple, but are not so large, nor deeply lobed; or of so fine a silver colour. It flowers in manner of the Scarlet Maple, but the flowers are of an herbaceous colour; and produces large joined winged seeds. The back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants make a pretty good sugar, and in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity, of the sap of this and the Silver-leaved Maple; and though these have generally been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, yet all our Maples yield a sap which affords a pretty good sugar.</p>

The flowers are produced in spikes terminating the stalks; they are sessile, and each furnished with a bractea or floral leaf, which is ovate, rough externally, longer than the empalement and sitting close at their base; they are produced early in the spring and being thick set, make a beautiful appearance with their long, snowy white stamina.

                  <head>(Bartram's Catalogue.)</head>
                  <p>This beautiful flowering, tree-like shrub, rises with an erect trunk to the height of about twenty feet; dividing into branches, alternately disposed. The leaves are oblong, narrowed towards the base, sawed on their edges, placed alternately, and sitting close to the branches. The flowers are produced towards the extremity of the branches, sitting close at the bosom of the leaves; they are often five inches in diameter when fully expanded; composed of five large, roundish, spreading petals, ornamented in the center with a tuft or crown of gold coloured stamina; and possessed with the fragrance of a China Orange. This newly discovered, rare, and elegant flowering shrub, was first observed by John Bartram when on botanical researches, on the Alatamaha river in Georgia, Anno 1760; but was not brought into Pennsylvania till about fifteen years after, when his son William Bartram, employed in the like pursuits, revisited the place where it had been before observed, and had the pleasing prospect of beholding it in its native soil, possessed with all its floral charms; and bearing ripe seeds at the same time; some of which he collected and brought home, and raised several plants therefrom, which in four years time flowered, and in one year after perfected ripe seeds.</p>
                  <p>It seems nearly allied to the Gordonia, to which it has, in some late Catalogues, been joined; but William Bartram, who first introduced it, believing it to be a new Genus, has chosen to honour it with the name of that patron of sciences, and truly great

and distinguished character, Dr. Benjamin Franklin. The trivial name is added from the river, where alone it has been observed to grow naturally. It delights in a loose, sandy and moist soil.</p>

                  <p>This tree often rises to the height of fifty or sixty feet, and to three feet or more in diameter, covered with a dark furrowed bark, and dividing into many branches, furnished with winged leaves, composed of ten or twelve pair of lobes, and an odd one; these are smooth, oblong, sharp pointed and sawed on their edges; and upon being bruised emit a strong aromatic flavour, as doth also the external covering of the fruit.

                  <p>This tree resembles the former so as scarcely to be distinguished from it, except by its fruit, which is oblong or oval; the shells or coverings are rougher, harder, and of a deeper green colour. The timber of both sorts is much used by Joiners, &amp;c. in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tables, drawers, book and clock-cases, &amp;c. Coffins are also generally made of it.

                  <p>This often grows to the height of twenty or thirty feet and to eighteen inches or more in diameter, with a smooth light coloured bark. The branches are garnished with leaves composed generally of eight or nine pair of lobes and an odd one, which are villose, oblong egg-shaped, sharp pointed, slightly serrated, and larger than those of the other kinds. The fruit, when ripe, is villous and covered with a viscid clammy substance, by which it almost sticks to the fingers when handled. It is long and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pointed at the ends, and freed of its hull, or covering, is very rough and deeply furrowed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a soft, oily, sweet kernel. An extract of the bark of this tree affords a mild and safe cathartic. The bark and shells of the nuts dye a good brown colour, scarcely ever fading.</p>

                  <p>This tree grows to the height of forty or fifty feet, and to eighteen inches or two feet in diameter. The leaves are generally composed of three or four pair of lobes and an odd one. The nuts with their covers are about two inches in length and above one in diameter. The covers, or hulls, generally open into four parts, disclosing their nuts, which are white, hard and thick shell'd, having seams oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site the divisions of their hulls. The kernel is small and not very sweet.</p>

                  <p>This generally grows pretty large, sometimes to the height of eighty feet or more, and above two feet in diameter. The bark of young trees is smooth, but when older becomes rough and furrowed. The leaves are generally composed of five pair of lobes and an odd one, which are mostly narrower than those of many other kinds. The fruit is small and roundish, and covered with a very thin husk or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, opening in divisions. The shell of the nut is also very thin, and easily cracked with the teeth; the kernel plump and full but very bitter. The timber of this is not much esteemed.</p>

                  <p>This tree grows as large as the Pig-nut Hickery, and much like it in appearance. The nuts are small, round, and thin shell'd, the kernel sweet. The branches are slender and flexible. There is, I think, a variety of this, with a rougher furrowed bark, bearing broader leaves and larger nuts, having
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019068_0087_0FAA0E3744EEB200"/>
thicker outer covers, as well as inward shells, with the kernel generally small and shrivelled.

                  <p>This tree delights in a rich moist soil, generally growing by creeks and rivers, often to the height of seventy or eighty feet, and above two feet in diameter. The bark is rough and shelly or scaly. The leaves are generally composed of two pair of lobes and an odd one, they are narrowed towards the base, oval, and pointed at the extremity, and sawed on their edges. The fruit is roundish, but rather slatted and indented at the ends. The outer cover very thick and dividing into four parts, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing its nut, which is not very thick shell'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining sweet kernel, preferable to the other kinds.

I have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed in some Species from one to three styles, in others from three to five, but not having observed any to be constant with two, agreeably to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Crataegus, have ranged none under that Genus.

The leaves are pretty large, of an oval, spear-shap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed form, generally entire, but sometimes somewhat toothed, and covered underneath with a whitish down: they are joined to long, slender footstalks, and affixed to the branches in somewhat of a verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillate order, presenting a beautiful varied foliage. The berries are near the size and shape of small olives, and are preserved in like manner by the French inhabitants upon the Mississippi, where it greatly abounds, and is called the Olive tree. The timber is white and soft when unseasoned, but light

                  <p>This is a small plant, seldom rising above four or five inches high, with slender ligneous stalks. The leaves are ever-green, oblong and pointed, of a thick consistence, with a few sharp serratures on their edges; smooth and of a dark green on their upper sides, but marked with a broad, branching, longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal vein or streak, of a whitish or paler colour; and somewhat reddish underneath.

               <div type="species">
                  <head>1. QUERCUS alba. Common American White Oak.</head>
                  <p>This grows very common, and with age arrives to the size of a large tree of seventy or eighty feet in height, and of three, four, five, or more feet in diameter; dividing into many large branches, and covered with a whitish scaly bark. The leaves are narrowed towards the base, but spreading and deeply sinuated obliquely, towards the ends; the sinuses ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse, the angles, or productions unequal in length, entire and obtuse. They are of a glaucous, or light green underneath and have very short footstalks. The acorns are middling sized, sitting in small shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cups. There are some varieties of this, differing in the hardness and toughness of the timber, and somewhat in their acorns or fruit. It affords a hard, tough, useful and valuable timber, which is hewed into beams, &amp;c. for frame buildings; sawed into plank, &amp;c. for ship building; and applied to various other useful purposes. Our swine are often wholly fatted upon the several kinds of acorns, but for these and Chesnut Oak they seek most diligently.</p>

                  <head>2. QUERCUS alba minor. Barren White Oak.</head>
                  <p>This grows generally upon poor, barren, or waste land, rising perhaps to the height of thirty or forty feet, covered with scaly greyish bark. The leaves are somewhat rough, but of a shining green above, somewhat paler underneath; they are sinuated deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, most obtusely, and irregularly; the lobes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. (if I may be allowed the expression) are obtuse, often somewhat angular, and very irregular. The acorns are small and striped. The timber is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted very durable for posts, to set in the earth; otherwise not much esteemed unless for fuel.</p>

               <div type="species">
                  <head>3. QUERCUS alba palustris. Swamp White Oak.</head>
                  <p>This becomes a pretty large spreading tree, of two or three feet in diameter and of proportionable height. The bark is often rougher or more furrowed than the other kinds, and greyish coloured. The leaves are somewhat wedge-shaped or narrowed towards the base, and toothed on their edges and extremities. The acorns are larger and rounder than those of the common White Oak, and have larger and thicker cups, supported often by pairs upon a long, strong footstalk.</p>

                  <p>This grows to the height of sixty or seventy feet, and to three or four feet in diameter, with large spreading branches. The leaves are large, spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and somewhat woolly; their footstalks longer than those of the White Oak. They are irregular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and sometimes pretty deeply sinuated, the angles or productions unequal, generally obtuse, yet with their veins extending in a bristly point. The acorns are roundish and not large, sitting in thick scaly cups. There is, I think, a variety of this of much smaller growth, with larger leaves and different somewhat in the fruit. Our common Black Oak is used much (where Cedar is scarce) for making shingles, and also for rails, &amp;c.</p>

               <div type="species">

The leaves are sinuated, or divided towards their extremities into two or three pretty long, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what finger-shaped lobes, of unequal length, with others shorter, sometimes at the sides; all of which end in a bristly point.

The leaves are wedge-shaped, or narrowed towards the base, and three-pointed, with bristly terminations. The acorns and cups resemble the last mentioned.</p>

                  <p>This often becomes a large tree, of the height of seventy or eighty feet and of four, five, or sometimes six feet in diameter; retaining its thickness to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable height, and without lateral branches, but spreading at the top. The leaves are large, obtuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and but lightly sinuated, the angles acute, each often terminating with several acute, bristly points.

Timber when full of sap and vigour, in all probability, contains also more oily particles, which, in proportion as they abound, are known to add to its durability. With regard to the influence of the moon, it may probably be accounted a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:019068_0144_0FAA0DBA2BB967B8"/>
or whimsical fancy, but that it materially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects timber is a fact well known to those who strip, or; peel bark for the use of tanners; and when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in one case, may probably throw some light upon the other. But further, it is also a fact well known, that timber, whose bark has been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently separated and peeled round at the but, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for deading, as it is termed; if done in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the moon, retains its greenness often a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time; but if in the increase, withers in a much shorter time. From hence, I think, we may conclude, that the sap or juice of trees, has a kind of monthly circulation, or revolution; ascending in the moon's decrease, but descending in the increase. However, be this as it may, the falling of timber in the different phasis of the moon, is considently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, from experience, to materially affect its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability.</p>

                  <p>This grows naturally in Carolina, rising with slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ligneous, climbing stalks, and fastening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by tendrils to any neighbouring support. The leaves are branching and winged, composed general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of two side branches of five leaves each, two or three leaves, and terminating with three; which are small and somewhat toothed. The flowers are produced in loose clusters from the wings of the stalks;

                  <head>2. VITIS vinifera americana. American Grape Vine.</head>
                  <p>There are many varieties of this, which generally rise up with strong stems, climbing by tendrils or claspers upon neighbouring trees for support, often to the height of thirty or forty feet, and of two, three or four inches in diameter; covered with a dark, rough, loose bark. The leaves are generally heart-shaped and somewhat three lobed; sawed on their edges, and downy or hairy underneath. The grapes are produced in bunches, in form of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean kinds, generally between the size of a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Gooseberry: darkish coloured, or with a light bluish cast, and for the most part of an acid agreeable taste.</p>

                  <p>This in manner of growth hath much the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the other kinds. The leaves are generally larger, and smooth, but whitish underneath. The fruit or grapes are about the size of a common cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and have a strong scent, a little approaching to that of a Fox, whence the name of Fox-grape. There are also varieties of this, some with whitish or reddish fruit which is generally most esteemed, and others with black, of which are our largest grapes.</p>

                  <p>This grows naturally in Pennsylvania and Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; rising with a pretty strong stem to the height of ten or twelve feet; and dividing in many branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which are covered with a purplish bark, and armed at each bud with two strong, sharp spines. The leaves are composed of four or five pair of lobes, terminated by an odd one; which are entire and of an oblong egg-shape, placed opposite and sitting close to the common footstalk, which is also set with a few spines underneath. The flowers are produced along the branches, upon short collected footstalks; and those of the female are each succeeded, for the most part, with five distinct, oval capsules, joined by short footstalks to the common receptacle, and spreading above; each containing one roundish, smooth seed.</p>
                  <p>There is said to be another Species, or perhaps Variety, of this in South Carolina, differing in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lobes of their leaves lance-shaped, sawed on their edges and having footstalks.

                  <head>XANTHORHIZA simplicissima. Shurb Yellow Root.</head>
                  <p>This is a small shrub, growing naturally in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. The roots are slender and cylindrical, but sending off side shoots by which it spreads much; the wood of which, together with that of the stems, are of a bright yellow colour. The stems are slender, rising to the height of two feet or more, generally simple, or without branches, and covered with a lightish brown bark. The leaves are compound, consisting of two pair of opposite lobes, terminated by an odd one; the lobes are much and deeply cut or cleft on their edges, (somewhat in form of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Lovage) and joined to very long, common foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalks, coming out from the tops of the stems. The flowers are produced at the top of the former year's growth, in a compound or panicled <hi>racemus;</hi> having their partial footstalks generally three flowered; they
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:019068_0187_0FAA0DDF788FC838"/>
are small and purplish coloured, and are succeeded by little heads of small, compressed capsules, each enclosing one small seed. The flowers on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or small footstalks, are not produced at once, those that are middle-most or terminal come out first and are hermaphrodite, and generally barren; those on the sides come out later, but one of which is generally fruitful; from whence, I had supposed, some of the flowers were female, and to the contrary of which I am not yet fully convinced.</p>
                  <p>This shrub, from the yellowness of its roots and stems, it is highly probable, might be employed to good purpose in dying cloaths, &amp;c. It has hitherto been undescribed by Botanical writers, though nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in some late Catalogues in honour of M. Marbois; but having imposed the former name, before I had heard of this, have chose to retain it as being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive of its qualities and appearance.</p>
