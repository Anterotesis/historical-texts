            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN the ſpirit of truth, and not of adulation, does the following performance ſolicit your attention. Nor is its hope of acquiring ſome ſhare of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance diminiſhed, by the circumſtance of your not having in an official character withheld your ſignature, from ſeveral of the meaſures inveſtigated.</p>
            <p>A reſponſibility in the chief magiſtrate, for the effects of every legiſlative act—an avowal, that unforeſeen conſequences, however miſchievous, ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, for the ſake of conſiſtency in error—that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in ſearch of truth, is to be rejected; are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to which a liberal and enlightened mind will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accede.</p>
            <p>Your general aſſent to laws ought to be aſcribed to republican principles, and not to an indiſcriminate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their contents. To yourſelf therefore, as well as to every other citizen, remains intire the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable birth-right of freedom in the re-examination of public meaſures. For ſurely the right and duties of a citizen cannot be abſorbed by official functions.</p>

Whilſt, under the influence of republicaniſm, you have cautiouſly checked the will of the people, you have alſo reſerved your negative power, to be exerted on great and momentous occaſions, for the preſervation of their rights. Such an occaſion occured in a <hi>direct</hi> attempt upon the principles of repreſentation, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of which ſufficiently evinces, that you cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the <hi>indirect</hi> means by which theſe principles have been ſo much more deeply wounded, than that attempt contemplated. Can it then be deluſion to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a hope, that aſſaults directed againſt the vital organ of popular government, are deſtined to be defeated by the ſame laudable vigilance?</p>

               <head>SECTION I.—NO FREE GOVERNMENT OR THE BLESS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS OF LIBERTY CAN BE PRESERVED TO ANY PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE, BUT BY A FREQUENT RECURRENCE TO FUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.</head>
               <p>THE ſtate of politics at all times, ought to attract the attention of a nation, jealous of its liberty, lately purchaſed at the expence of much blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. To what more important ſubject, can a portion of our attention and enquiries be applied? Private im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, is often confined to the deſtruction of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, whilſt political immorality will ruin a nation. When the honeſt and unſuſpicious, are falling into the ſnares of the ſelfiſh and cunning, it behoves all poſſeſſed of a ſingle ſympathetic ſpark, to ſound the alarm; and when an alarm is ſounded, temerity and folly only, will have to deplore the want of prudence and caution.</p>
               <p>National watchfulneſs is the only preſervative of liberty. A patriot magiſtracy hardly appears to glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the hiſtoric page, once in a century. Shall Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans then rely on a phenomenon to guard their rights? Fanaticiſm alone will fondly wait for a miracle. Or ſhall we call in the aid of plain and unerring arithmetic, from whence to extract a rule for our conduct. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate. How many bad kings for one good one are recorded in hiſtory? Aſcertain this, and the reſult ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:027782_0005_0FD63F90934C75D0"/>
the exact chance for freedom, held by the tenure of a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>implicit</hi> reliance on the integrity of the magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>If to be watchful at all times, is a neceſſary effort of national prudence, the precept is pronounced by the tongue of liberty to be indiſpenſable, at an epoch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. Corrupt morals in a ſtate of infancy, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode a licentious manhood, and a wicked old age.—By giving a proper tone to a young government, and rooting an adminiſtration in the ſound principles of political morality, happineſs will be acquired for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our poſterity. By ſparing the rod, we may ſpoil the child. Like an ill weed which grows apace, it will ſoon become too ſtrong for correction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a bleſſing, it will turn out a curſe to its parents.</p>
               <p>To leave the allegory. As a bad form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may by means of a good adminiſtration, produce national happineſs, ſo a good form of government, may be abuſed into an engine of fraud and corruption. Miſchievous precedents, or innovations upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, are matured by time into municipal regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or fundamental rules. Antiquity will begin to ſhew its ſilvered locks, and under the diſguiſe of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will lay hold of the firſt admiſſible moment to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench itſelf behind the bulwark of preſcription. Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will be arrayed againſt reaſon. Prejudice, intereſt, ridicule, invective, authority and power, will appear as auxiliaries to the former; whilſt the latter will have no ally, except argument, and muſt alſo aſſume the unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant language of reformation. Combating with ſuch odds, a defeat would be almoſt inevitable, and afflicting would be the ſenſations of honeſt men in the reflection, that by their ſupineneſs they have betrayed the moſt ſacred depoſit, inſtead of tranſmitting it unimpaired to poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:027782_0006_0FD63F92221E5C18"/>
Every acquiſition is infallibly loſt by inattention.—Liberty, tho' ineſtimable, is the moſt difficult to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. It is incapable of being ſecured by bars and bolts, and is therefore conſtantly expoſed to the pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of intereſt. It is a general indiviſible property, whence few feel a particular obligation or intereſt, to be militant under its banner. It is committed to the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody of magiſtrates, but in the end they ſeldom fail to betray their truſt, unleſs awed by the ſocial juriſdiction. Are magiſtrates enraptured with her beauties, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous leſt others ſhould participate in her charms? Or do they deteſt a deity, who beſtows liberally upon all, becauſe it is her character to beſtow impartially?</p>
               <p>The aſſaults upon the virtue of men in power, if facts can be aſcertained from effects, muſt be hard to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. But many brilliant examples exiſt, proving that they are not irreſiſtable. A frequent and firm national enquiry into the meaſures of government, will check political vice, and reward political virtue. The ardour of honeſty will be awakened. What incitement to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm exiſts, if the good and bad—the honeſt and knaviſh—the benevolent and miſanthropic, are depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by national ſupineneſs in one common oblivious receptacle? Self intereſt, chicanery, peculation, and not public eſteem, will ſhapen the adminiſtration. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates will provide ſuch a recompence as they love, and when ſordid paſſions are to be gratified, and are their own carvers, what degree of moderation is to be expected? The wheat can only be ſeparated from the chaff by ſifting. Lazineſs in politics is like lazineſs in agriculture. It will expoſe the ſoil to noxious weeds. The wholeſome plants will ſhrink from a ſtate of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate amneſty, and diſdaining a diſhonorable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, will leave the field in the poſſeſſion of tares and thiſtles.</p>
               <p>If theſe principles are political axioms, whence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens it, that the direction in which the American go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027782_0007_0FD63F94DC961998"/>
is moving, hath hardly attracted the public notice of the particular ſtates, or of private individuals? Is this direction invariably right? Is it univerſally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory? Have intereſt, ridicule or invective, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved truth of her articulating powers? Or is the brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten by power or authority?</p>
               <p>That this univerſal ſatisfaction does not exiſt, is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by almoſt every private company. It is often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that the adminiſtration is driving at monarchy—that the legiſlature is corrupt—and that the conſtitution has been more deliberately broken, than it was formed.</p>
               <p>Theſe aſſertions are alarming. They deſerve inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. The national mind is moved, and muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Shew it the good or harm which awaits the community, that it may either rejoice in the one, or repel the other.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of a Preſidential revolution, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per period from whence to look back. Let us conſider whether the retroſpect exhibits encouragement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and to what ultimate point the ſame direction will probably lead us.</p>
               <p>Will you, reader, accompany me in ſuch reflections? Ye ſovereign ſtates, will you contribute your contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of inveſtigation? It may obviate a neceſſity for contingents of another nature, upon ſome occaſion, which may not be very diſtant.</p>

               <p>BUT before we proceed it is proper to form a political compaſs to guide our courſe. If political <hi>principles</hi> exiſt—if the <hi>rights of man,</hi> are words of real mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027782_0008_0FD63F967679D4D0"/>
if there are none favoured of heaven, with an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſupremacy on their foreheads, ſurely there can be no difficulty in ſelecting a few ſimple axioms, beyond the reach of polemical artifice, and containing a degree of internal evidence, compelling indubitable conviction.</p>
               <p>Unhappily we dare not rely intirely on the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States. That hath indeed a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in not having been treated worſe than the holy ſcriptures. Political and religious hereſy, being of kindred families, will act from ſimilar motives. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ever want a text to defend its uſurpations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on orthodox principles either human or divine, becauſe neither have in view the public good. And ſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is the moſt induſtrious principle imaginable, in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out caſuiſtical arguments and diſtinctions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude mankind into a ſtate, the moſt favourable for its deſigns. It would be difficult for inſtance, for a man of underſtanding, whoſe only motive was the common good, to find in the conſtitution, a ſingle expreſſion which contemplated the erection of banks, or other corporations. For corporations are only deeds of gift, or of bargain and ſale, for portions of valuable <hi>common</hi> rights; and <hi>parts</hi> may be diſpoſed of until the whole is diſtributed among a few individuals. But yet, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hereſy, views of intereſt, and a union of talents and induſtry, may puzzle, perplex and miſlead, even a ſound head, and a good heart. Hence ariſes an argument for avoiding ſo broad a theoremic baſis, as the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States.</p>
               <p>A ſelection of plain, tho' great principles, reſulting from the conſtitution, as the theorems to guide our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations into the objects and deſigns of the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, is the only remaining alternative. Without a teſt for truth, ſelf intereſt and innovation, by their wily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, will ſlip out of our graſp. Or by aſſuming new and harmleſs forms, they may withdraw themſelves from the view, even of an inveſtigating eye.</p>

                  <item>1.

                  <item>2. That Congreſs can impoſe taxes for the <hi>common</hi> defence and <hi>general</hi> welfare, of the United States, but not for the benefit of individuals or their <hi>own private emolument.</hi>

               <head>SECTION III.—THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERED.</head>
               <p>THE bank of the United States, is the maſter key of that ſyſtem, which governs the adminiſtration. It could unlock a depoſitory of ſecrets, which would, if expoſed, reflect much light upon the ſubject. But we are confined to the information to be extracted from the law itſelf, and its obvious effects; premiſing however, that ſecrets enacted by law, are ſecret laws. They ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the ignorant, and puniſh the innocent; and are as inevitable, as the ſtroke of death. An inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the object of which is gain, would not have ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly legaliſed the privacy of its tranſactions, unleſs that privacy had begotten gain. The value to ſome, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſecret, is preciſely the amount of a fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent loſs inflicted upon others, who are not ſo.</p>
               <p>It is about to be proved, that a deſign for erecting ariſtocracy and monarchy, is ſubſiſting—that a <hi>money im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,</hi> and not the <hi>public good,</hi> is operating on Congreſs; and that taxes are impoſed upon motives, other than the general welfare. The leading evidence evincing theſe aſſertions, is to be extracted from the bank ſcheme, which was contrived, propoſed, and modelled by the Secretary of the Treaſury, and therefore it is ſelected as the firſt ſubject of inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of banking, is ſimply a reiterated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of obligations for the payment of money. A. gives his <hi>bond</hi> to B. and receives B's <hi>bond</hi> in exchange. But A. pays B. an intereſt, whereas B. pays A. none. A. is the <hi>community,</hi> B. is the <hi>bank.</hi> How muſt this traffic end?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:027782_0011_0FD63FA0676FC788"/>
This idea requires illuſtration. In a barter of two commodities, two intereſts only are concerned, altho' each of theſe intereſts may be compounded of many individuals. Thus buyer and ſeller compriſe many perſons, though they conſiſt of but two claſſes. All thoſe who deal with the bank, conſtitute one claſs, and the ſtockholders, or proprietors of the bank, another. The dealers depoſit their bonds or notes carrying an intereſt, and receive in exchange the bonds or notes of the ſtockholders, carrying no intereſt. And the difference between receiving an intereſt out of paper, whilſt it pays none on ſimilar paper, conſtitutes the great ground of profit to the bank.</p>
               <p>The ſcheme repreſents the idea of a perpetual rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, depoſiting a profit at every revolution. It might have been compared to a ſpecies of hazard, called the A. B. C. table, except that the latter propoſes to the adventurers ſome chance to win; whereas the bank can never loſe. The table bets with its gamblers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every revolution 100 to 102½, ſo that in forty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, the adventurers bet two to one. Yet a chance for winning exiſts. But in that reſpect the compariſon fails. The bank is perpetually betting 100 to 106, the wager is always drawn, and the bank re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the ſix in every hundred, by way of forfeit.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe two perſons were every moment in the year exchanging bonds, one paying an intereſt of ſix per centum, and the other not, how would matters ſtand when a ſettlement took place? The gain acquired by one, would be preciſely ſimilar to that which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the dividend of banks. In a private caſe, it would be called a groſs device, to evade the ſtatutes of uſury; and yet the enactors of thoſe ſtatutes have le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſed the ſame device in the erection of banks, and thus ſubject the whole community to that which would be a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon an individual.</p>
               <p>The bank evidently conſtitutes one claſs, and thoſe who deal with it another. It evidently appears that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027782_0012_0FD63FA2871A11C8"/>
the bank muſt gain. This gain neceſſarily implies a loſs, becauſe the traffic is of an unproductive nature. 'Tis a traffic in ideas, not in ſubſtances. But it is not ſo eaſy to diſcern upon whom this loſs falls. And this is a difficulty, which the favourers of the artifice have taken care to promote, becauſe a detection upon this point would blow up the contrivance.</p>
               <p>And yet a ſmall portion of reflection muſt get over it. The misfortune muſt fall upon ſomebody. The immediate dealers with the bank muſt bear it, or they are reimburſed by thoſe who deal with them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the loſs muſt fall upon the whole community, or a part of it. What defence of the inſtitution would it be, to ſay, that it ſelects a devoted few for annual ruin, whilſt it ſpares the great maſs of the community? If the monſter is to be fed on human labour, it would be fair to determine the victim by lot, as to reſort to a decoy.</p>
               <p>But it would be unjuſt to impeach the bank of an impoſition, not palliated by the ſubterfuge, "that thoſe impoſed on are able to bear the loſs." To this ſpecies of palliation, it is certainly entitled. For if the loſs neceſſarily reſulting from the traffic, had fallen excluſively on the immediate adventurers, inevitable and ſpeedy ruin muſt have enſued from the enormous profit of the bank; and the deſtruction of ſome would have deterred others from adventuring within the reach of this devouring monſter. A contrary effect is clearly obſervable; and therefore the immediate deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt, by ſome circuitous operation, obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſement. Hence the bank may certainly boaſt, that the evils ſhe diſpenſes, like the contents of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora's box, are pretty equally diſtributed.</p>
               <p>Though it might redound to our amuſement to trace this operation, it would contribute but little to our edification. The concluſion will be better evinced
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027782_0013_0FD63FA28A809940"/>
by a few ſtrong lines, than by an aſſemblage of the moſt diverſified colourings. The gain is made. The loſs cannot fall on the immediate gamblers, for two reaſons. They are not ruined, nor do they work. Gain can never ariſe out of nothing, becauſe it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial. It muſt therefore be the product of labour, and labour only; and that which produces the gain, muſt of courſe bear the loſs. The gamblers themſelves are only the brokers between the bank and thoſe who really ſuffer by the inſtitution. Brokers add nothing to the commodity. They carry on the traffic between their employers to a great amount for a profit. If they made no profit, they would ceaſe to purſue the profeſſion. The immediate receivers of the bank pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, circulate it identically, or virtually, among their principals, who pay both their profit, and the gain of the bank. This gain flows in upon the bank in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs devious ſtreams, ſupplied by the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Theſe ſtreams, unleſs thus ſupplied, would have become dry, becauſe they would have exhauſted a few unfed reſervoirs. But they appear to be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible, and therefore they muſt ariſe from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the community, which is the only inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ever running fountain of wealth.</p>
               <p>The principals of theſe brokers, are the original ſellers of whatever labour produces, and the conſumers of the wares the brokers deal in. This definition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the whole agricultural, mechanical, profeſſional and mercantile intereſts of the community, unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the device. And upon this aggregate muſt fall the gain ſo regularly collected by the bank.</p>
               <p>Without perplexing ourſelves, to trace out the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modes, by which the firſt dealers with the bank are reimburſed from the wealth of this aggregate, it may not be amiſs to ſelect one, the features of which are ſo groſs and prominent, as not eaſily to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:027782_0014_0FD63FA3EFC96DD0"/>
The ſyſtem throws into a few hands, a monopoly of the bulk of the circulating medium. If a man could monopolize any neceſſary article of commerce, he would gain, by borrowing money at ſix per centum to effect ſuch an object. In the event, he would not loſe this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. The profits reſulting from his monopoly, would reimburſe it manifold. The intereſt, as well as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, would be reimburſed by thoſe upon whom the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly operated. <hi>Can any monopoly be more diffuſive in its operations, than that of the great bulk of the circulating medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a monoply is a kind of general ſearch warrant for wealth, ſilently penetrating, and conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from, the moſt ſecure funds. The profits of the national labour, are in the ſituation of a treaſure, gradually diminiſhed by ſecret and continual thefts.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</head>
               <p>THE powers of a weapon ought to be thoroughly underſtood, before we venture to try its edge.—A bank is a machine of ſuch wonderful and cunning contrivances, that we muſt be content to proceed much farther in our enquiries, before we ſhall comprehend its mechaniſm, or be able to form a competent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its effects.</p>
               <p>If the reaſonings of the laſt ſection are juſt, we are forcibly impelled to an awful idea. The reader has already exclaimed, that the profits of the bank are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly an indirect tax upon the community. He is right, and it is impoſſible for the moſt cunning argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative deluſion to refute the aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Can the pecuniary neceſſities of a government be ſupplied by any poſſible contrivance, which will not operate as a tax? If an anſwer is given in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, divulge, we reply, the glorious ſecret for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027782_0015_0FD63FA5D9852078"/>
by which they may enjoy all the benefits of good government, without paying for them. If in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, we thus proceed:</p>
               <p>The capital of the United States' bank is ten millions, of which the United States own two. The dividend is eight per centum per annum. This alone is an annual income of 800,000 dollars, of which 160,000 belong to the nation. The whole dividend, though but an article of the income, is conſiderably more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to defray the whole expence of the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it was the property of the continent, it would be thus applied, and in ſuch an event, would the government be carried on, without any expence to the community?</p>
               <p>Except for the unaccountable infatuation which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts upon the ſubject, arguments, as to this point, would appear puerile. Becauſe poſitions, evidently true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no proof.</p>
               <p>If the whole profits of the bank had been raiſed and applied for public uſe, as a part really are, it muſt be admitted, that it would have been an indirect tax, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it is proved, that government poſſeſs a faculty of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting itſelf, by paper ſlight of hand, without burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the community.</p>
               <p>It then occurs to demand, whether the nature of the contribution is altered as to the payers, by a tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe who receive the tribute? Is it the leſs a tax upon the community, becauſe it is received by an individual corporation, conſiſting of a few private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, many of them foreigners?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe we borrow one of thoſe newly invented expreſſions, conveying no determinate idea, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to deceive: And inſtead of calling the bank act a tax law, baptize it thus, "a law exerciſing a <hi>faculty</hi> of government." It muſt yet be confeſſed, that it is a very valuable <hi>faculty.</hi> It is worth to the bank of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027782_0016_0FD63FA8038638C0"/>
United States, an annuity, more than ſufficient to defray the whole expence of civil government, and to all the banks now operating, an income probably equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the public expences, both ordinary and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
               <p>But whatever is its value, it was undoubtedly a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic property, becauſe the legiſlature in exerciſing this faculty, were public, and not private agents. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance then of this faculty by law, was a gift or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and ſale, of ſo much public property to private perſons. If the former, it beſtowed upon them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitouſly, an immenſe revenue, which can only ariſe from the common ſtock of wealth; if the latter, it ſells in a ratio of 800,000 dollars annually of faculty, for the privilege of having 160,000 dollars of the ſame faculty, annually reſtored. In either view, the meaſure was a public folly, and a private gain.</p>
               <p>The public poſſeſs a great variety of valuable facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In parcelling them out among an ariſtocracy, whom we ſee growing up as if by the power of magic, a diſpoſition by portions, would have been leſs grievous than to give them all away at once. The faculties of ſome cities, counties, and even ſtates, beſtowed upon private corporations, would yet have left others in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their rights and privileges. And it would have been more excuſable for the legiſlature of a great nation, to have proſtituted the public intereſt in a few particular inſtances, than to conſtitute itſelf the bawd-general, for ſupplying the inſatiable luſt of an ariſtocracy. The attempt of Appius upon Virginia, was more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than a general ariſtocratical invaſion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional chaſtity. And yet, preferring death to proſtitution, her bright example arouſed the Roman ſpirit, and the virtue of a ſimple maid, reſtored the liberty of a whole people.</p>
               <p>The public faculties are the offsprings of labour.—Leaving therefore unmeaning terms, which may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027782_0017_0FD63FA939B4BC50"/>
or perplex us, we will reſume expreſſions, which convey a determinate idea.</p>
               <p>Bank ſtock is public debt. It is public debt of the worſt kind, ſince it bears an enormous and incomputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intereſt, as will hereafter be ſhewn. Nothing but a tax can pay this intereſt, unleſs it is proved that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt on the funded debt, might have been paid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tax. And if this could be proved, then it would be replied, that the faculty ought to have been dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that uſe.</p>
               <p>The bank might have been ſold to public creditors in lieu of intereſt. If the price had been ten millions of ſix per cents, and the profits eleven per centum, the purchaſers would have made a good bargain, ſuppoſing they had depoſited ten millions more of actual ſpecie, as ſtock upon which to circulate paper. But if they could have circulated ten millions of paper, upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit of not more than one million of ſpecie, as the bank probably does, the bargain would have been a good one, reducing the profit even to eight per centum.—Such a ſoftening meaſure, is ſtated as illuſtrating the perniciouſneſs of the contrivance, and not as allowing that it would have been a ſufficient ground of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where is the merit of a ſyſtem of finance, which uſes public property to increaſe, and not to diminiſh the public burthens?</p>
               <p>Bank ſtock is public debt of the moſt ruinous kind, and yet no conſideration was paid, <hi>really</hi> or <hi>nominally</hi> for it. If the legiſlature had preſented the bank proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with ten millions of funded debt, in lieu of this faculty, the community would have been great gainers, becauſe the profit accruing from the gift, could not have exceeded an average of between four and five per centum. If twenty millions had been ſo preſented, even that would have been better for the community, becauſe the profit would not only have been as low as the gain made by the bank, but it would have been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027782_0018_0FD63FAAFA5B02B8"/>
known and limited—it might have been provided by tax-laws equalizing the burthen—it would have been ſubject to redemption—and above all, it would not have committed a depredation upon the fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of repreſentation.</p>
               <p>Had ſo much public debt been <hi>honeſtly,</hi> and not <hi>artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> accumulated, it muſt have been earned by labour, which would have produced a general diſtribution of it, obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating an exorbitant accumulation of wealth in a few private hands.</p>
               <p>But an effect, which was a leading motive for the contrivance would then have been defeated. Its chief deſign was to make the rich, richer; and the poor, poorer. And thus I prove it.</p>
               <p>Money and credit, or an equivalent for them, were to be depoſited as the only mode of acquiring bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock. The poor had neither to depoſit, the rich poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed both. An excluſion of the one, and a preference of the other, though not expreſſed, was evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, becauſe it unavoidably reſulted from the nature of the contrivance. And the effect anſwers the deſign. A portion of the rich claſs of citizens, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of the device, whilſt labour ſupports it. An annuity to a great amount, is ſuddenly conjured up by law, which is received excluſively by the rich, that is the ariſtocracy. Will it not make them richer? It is paid out of labour, and labour in all countries falls on the poor. Will it not make this claſs poorer? and do ſuch effects tend to correct the principles of either?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a religious ſociety ſhould be excluſively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, and by hook or crook provided with an ample revenue, payable from the labour of all ſuch ſocieties. Would it not become an <hi>eſtabliſhed church,</hi> and would it not impoveriſh and eventually ſwallow up all others? A political ſect, thus incorporated, and thus provided for, will have a political tendency, of a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027782_0019_0FD63FAB036E72D0"/>
nature preciſely ſimilar. No diſtinction exiſts between the cauſes, and none therefore will appear in the effects. And if it be ſaid, that our <hi>political rights</hi> are not worth preſerving, let it be remembered that they are the <hi>ſole guardians</hi> of religious liberty.</p>
               <p>If the ariſtocratical ſect, thus incorporated, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually depoſited ſpecie in their bank, it would yet have remained in their own cuſtody, and under their own direction; for the corporation manages its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Even in this event, labour would have been taxed, to pay to the rich an exorbitant uſurious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, for their own money, in their own pockets, and at their own diſpoſal. But uſury upon actual money, was too ſlow a proceſs for effecting a vaſt diſproportion of wealth. The contrivance is calculated to beſtow upon the rich, intereſt upon the amount of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, not of their caſh. Bank-paper is circulated to an amount, far beyond a depoſit in money. It reſts upon an idea called credit. And all intereſt gotten for this ſurplus of paper, beyond a ſpecie depoſit, is paid by labour to the rich, becauſe they have, what the poor ardently wiſh for; and therefore they ought not to be taxed for wanting it, ſince this precludes even a hope of ſuch an acquiſition.</p>
               <p>How deluſive is a compariſon between bank-debts, and private loans? The latter muſt conſiſt of money or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's worth, and without one, debts between individuals cannot be created; the former may be created, though the bank poſſeſſes neither money or money's worth, and a banker may live upon the labour of others during his whole life, if he can conceal the fraud of his being a bankrupt. The latter are limited within reaſonable bounds, becauſe they are founded on real wealth, which cannot be even doubted by impreſſing hireoglyphicks upon paper; the former may be infinitely multiplied by a printing preſs, and are unlimited ſo long as the nation is able to pay ſix pounds ſpecie, for every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds of idea, which a bank may be pleaſed to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027782_0020_0FD63FAF39316738"/>
emit. In the latter caſe, ſomething is given for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; in the former, the community pays ſomething for nothing.</p>
               <p>But a feature of this monſtrous contrivance is now to be diſcloſed, which expoſes the partiality of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration to a moneyed intereſt, and its real deſign, beyond a remnant of doubt.</p>
               <p>This ſame worſhipful ariſtocracy, favoured of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the bulk of their bank-ſtock, were not even obliged to depoſit money. Public ſecurities car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an intereſt of ſix per centum, for three fourths of the whole amount, are by law receivable as a depoſit. If actual ſpecie had been locked up in the vaults of the bank, to be occaſionally counted by public autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a ſemblance of an excuſe might have been made, by urging, that the intereſt of the money thus depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, was loſt. But <hi>paper certificates</hi> are depoſited as a fund upon which to circulate other paper certificates. Theſe are gaining of the public a never <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> intereſt, whether kept by the body corporate, or the individuals compoſing the body corporate. What an unheard of degree of political iniquity is here diſcloſed? To the ſix per centum paid by government on ſeven millions five hundred thouſand dollars of the public debt, is ſuperadded by miniſterial contrivance, the cuſtomary profit gained by a bank, and the unuſual acquiſitions, amaſſed by this particular ſcheme. Legiſlative power itſelf cannot aſcertain, to what theſe amount. If they extend only to ſix per centum, then twelve per centum is received out of the public labour, by certificate-holders to the amount of 7,500,000 dollars, ſome of whom may poſſibly poſſeſs no other merit, but the fraud of having purchaſed them of the true owners, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing their knowledge of the miniſterial deſigns.</p>
               <p>A depoſit of paper, as a fund on the credit of which to iſſue other paper, is a ruinous feature, exhibited in no other ſcheme of the ſort extant, except that of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027782_0021_0FD63FB0E943C438"/>
United States. Hence the poor compenſation to the public, of locking up ſpecie in the bank ready for an urgency, in lieu of that taken out of circulation, though pretended, does not exiſt. Inſtead of ſupporting the credit of government, government muſt ſupport the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the bank. For if the credit of the government wavers, public paper cannot ſupport the credit of the bank. When government ſhall need help, the bank will need it alſo; nor can the political evils reſulting from being compleatly ſtript of the <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> means of defence, be alleviated by unlocking a hoard of paper certificates. If the bank had really collected the ſpecie into its vaults, government would have been rendered dependent on a private corporation, for the means of national defence. If the bank ſhould diſapprove of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it would withhold the means. Thus it would have become the arbiter of peace and war, and in caſe a combination of foreign potentates, ſhould endeavour to impoſe on America a government of king, lords, and prelates, what would have been the arbitrament of a claſs, from whence thoſe materials muſt have been taken?</p>
               <p>Banking in its <hi>beſt</hi> view, is only a fraud, whereby la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſuffers the impoſition of paying an intereſt on the circulating medium; whereas if ſpecie only circulated, the medium would in paſſing among the rich, often lie in the pockets of the ariſtocracy without gaining an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. But the ariſtocracy, as cunning as rapacious, have contrived this device, to inflict upon labour a tax, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly working for their emolument, whilſt they alſo retain the chief uſe of the caſh, and ſeldom part with its cuſtody.</p>
               <p>The Venitian nobility one day in a year, convert their palaces into gaming houſes, reſerving and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the privilege of cheating the citizens with falſe dice, who are on that occaſion indiſcriminately admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Worthy Venitian ariſtocracy! Three hundred

               <p>THE profits of the bank are then a tax upon the community. But a miſerable excuſe for this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic impoſition is urged, in the aſſertion that it is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. The <hi>effects</hi> are the ſame, whether it is paid willingly or unwillingly. Labour is deprived of its hard earned fruits. A portion of theſe is gotten from it, and beſtowed upon eaſe and affluence. The loſs is the ſame, whether a daring robber, extorts your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty with his piſtol at your breaſt, or whether a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night thief ſecretly filches it away. Are my misfortunes palliated, becauſe I cannot unravel the fraud by which they were brought upon me?</p>
               <p>A wiſe nation and an honeſt man, will view with contempt an apology, founded in a diſtinction between ſecret fraud and open violence.</p>
               <p>Miſerable as the excuſe is, it is not true. Labour which pays the tax, has no volition, or even agency in the tranſaction. It being eſtabliſhed by law, labour muſt pay it of neceſſity, becauſe the law enables the rich, to tranſmute the circulating coin of the nation, to their own paper money, bearing an intereſt.</p>
               <p>The immediate dealers with the bank, do not pay the tax, as hath been proved. If reimburſement had not followed their advance of it, inevitable ruin muſt have enſued, and a general bankruptcy of the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, would have annihilated the traffic.</p>
               <p>A corporation of merchants, and of the rich, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing an unlimited monopoly of the great maſs of the circulating medium, can raiſe or diminiſh the price of all
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027782_0023_0FD63FB3E5BC5EB0"/>
commodities, and in this enormous power is contained an unlimited ſcope, not only for reimburſement, but for profit. Now, labour produces, and pays for the conſumption of all commodities, and out of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both the reimburſements and profits ariſes. The bank is a cloſe party in this monopoliſing conſpiracy, becauſe its own intereſt is combined with the deſigns of the immediate dealers, by two indiſſoluble links. 1ſt. They are the collectors of the tax the bank receives. 2d. Without reimburſement they would fail; an inſtant loſs would thence fall upon the bank, and the crafts-men would in future looſe alſo, the gain of printing pictures for the Epheſians.</p>
               <p>Even a lottery has ever been conſidered by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh parliament, as an article of the ways and means for raiſing a national revenue. The purchaſe of a ticket is really voluntary, but this was never urged as an excuſe for beſtowing its annual product on a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or for excluding it from the catalogue of taxes.</p>
               <p>If the fact had ſupported the excuſe, it might have been illuſtrated by a compariſon. When the Pope was ſelling his <hi>paper indulgencies</hi> over all Europe, did it not operate as a tax? Did it not enrich the church and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh the laity? And was the fraud juſtifiable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was <hi>voluntarily</hi> ſubmitted to; If ſo, let us join in one general condemnation of our anceſtors, for rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves of the impoſition. If not, ſhall we tolerate a political papacy, which is eternally ſelling its <hi>paper indulgencies</hi> to our ruin, and their own emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Eſpecially as it is eaſier to detect a fraud, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the diſpenſer of temporal advantages, than to explode a promiſe of eternal happineſs. The prieſthood in both caſes put on myſtery, the vail of prieſtcraft, and in both call in the aid of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. In one an opponent was branded with the epithet of heretic, and excluded from the pale of the church; in the other, antifederal is vociferated, drowns argument, and excludes from civil offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:027782_0024_0FD63FB54EEF93F0"/>
But the falſhood of the excuſe will appear, from an aſſimilation of the bank tax to the impoſt. The merchants who advance the impoſt, do not pay it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſement, and often with a profit on the advance, is received by them from labour. Is the impoſt a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or a neceſſary tax? The bank-tax is higher upon the capital, than the impoſt. The capitals of all the banks now operating, probably exceed the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of foreign articles imported, and their annual profits, the whole amount of the annual impoſt. Had the mercantile intereſt excluſively borne the burthen of the impoſt, would it not have been unjuſt and ruinous? Does this intereſt bear a heavier tax, without complaint or ruin? If not, who does? Both conſtitute national burthens indiſtinguiſhable in their effects, for neither can be paid but by a national effort; yet more than half of the total is received by private individuals. If no occaſion for the impoſt had exiſted, could it conſtitutionally have been impoſed for twenty years, and beſtowed upon private perſons, for the bleſſed national purpoſe of creating an ariſtocracy?</p>
               <p>All taxation is limited by the ability of the nation to pay. Ability is labour. Whatever of it fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its ſuſtenance, labour can ſpare, is ability. An honeſt policy leaves to labour which earned it, as much of this ability, as is not rendered indiſpenſable by a real national neceſſity. A diſhoneſt policy compriſes its principles in its motto. It exclaims "A national debt is a national bleſſing," and it filches all it can get. In private life, an individual is deſervedly deteſted, who grinds the face of the poor, for the purpoſe of buying power, influence or ſplendour. Airy trifles, weighed againſt moral rectitude! What can be ſaid of a policy, which grinds a nation for ſuch objects? It ſays for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "A nation cannot pay too much for an ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy."</p>
               <p>Can a miniſter create a national ability to pay taxes, by paper ſlight of hand, or cunning contrivances? If
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027782_0025_0FD63FB6E7A2AAE0"/>
he can, ſuch taxes may not fall on labour. If he can, a poor nation may pay as much as a rich one, or more if its miniſter is moſt cunning. If he can, taxation has no boundary, but may be multiplied as indefinitely as human artifice. Then the beſt conjurer is the wiſeſt miniſter, and it would be right to collect all the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, ſlight of hand men, and ſhifters of cups and balls in the nation, into an academy or corporation, for the inſtruction of a diplomatic corps, who will be matter of aſtoniſhment in the preſent times, and of wonder in future ages.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe it had been propoſed to Great Britain, when ſhe commenced the ſubjugation of America, to erect a debt in the very ſame mode, equal to the preſent amount of circulating bank-paper in America, to have beſtowed upon her a monopoly of the circulating medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um—and to have inveſted her with the profits of the contrivance to all eternity. Would not Great Britain have cloſed with the propoſition? Would not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the banking buſineſs have been to her a conqueſt? What did ſhe fight for? Tribute. If it had been paid in this way, would it not have impoveriſhed America, and enriched Britain? Is not this the direct operation of a tribute? America has defeated a nation, but is ſubdued by a corporation. She defended her property againſt open violence, to be cheated of it by private fraud. She was too hard for her enemies, but a junto of falſe friends are too hard for her. The bank with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a pretence of claim upon the community, has found means to occupy the ſtation preciſely, which Great-Britain was ſtriving to fill.</p>
               <p>And if America had ſubmitted to pay a tribute to Britain, ſuch a mode of raiſing it, would have been the worſt poſſible tax, which could have been impoſed. No check upon the quantity of paper circulated would have exiſted, except the extent of the national ability to pay for it; and the tax might have been ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by increaſing this paper. So ſtands the tax
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027782_0026_0FD63FB938681040"/>
paid to the corporation. Its books are placed by law beyond the reach of legiſlative inſpection, and an intire union of intereſts, among every member of the junto, is a motive ſtrong enough to produce an increaſe of the tax, and a concealment of its extent.</p>
               <p>The people have not intruſted the Senate of the United States, with a power of originating money-bills, from a jealouſy in the tender caſe of taxation, againſt the leaſt degree of ariſtocratical aſcendency. But this ariſtocratical corporation, containing no repreſentative feature, can increaſe or diminiſh a tax at pleaſure, without the aſſent or knowledge of the people. They poſſeſs this important legiſlative power, ſubject to one only reſtraint. The quantity of paper is unavoidably limited by the national ability to pay for it. How came this limit to exiſt, if the profits of the bank aroſe out of paper ſlight of hand, and were not burthenſome upon the national ability? Scepticiſm itſelf, will no longer deny that they are a tax.</p>
               <p>Is this a ſyſtem of national charity? To filch from the poor principalities for the rich, whence princes themſelves naturally ſprout up. Is the religion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, or the religion of nature, acting as it does by an hidden impulſe upon the mind, ſatisfied with ſuch charity? Is the tribute due to Ceſar, or are the ſcanty, uncertain, occaſional donations of oſtentation, a reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement for a permanent and growing oppreſſion? Is the conſcience of this ſyſtem ſatisfied, by the ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hard gotten private alms, of a penny for each pilfered pound, in the place of political juſtice, which filches nothing?</p>
               <p>The maxim "that an individual had better ſuffer a misfortune, than a whole community," is reverſed, ſince the community is ſacrificed for the emolument of a few individuals. Morals and maxims withdraw from the defence of the contrivance, and a miſconſtruction of the ſcripture which ſaith, "unto every one that hath
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027782_0027_0FD63FBA1BC3BE08"/>
ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance, but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath," is the only remaining ſubterfuge.</p>

               <p>AND yet its continuance ſhall not be commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the frauds of a bank. I would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on my readers an endleſs taſk. It is only deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſelect and exhibit ſo many of its miſchiefs as will illuſtrate the adminiſtration. For this a pamphlet will ſuffice, whereas a ſimple vocabulary of its tricks and ſins would fill a volume.</p>
               <p>The contrivance is now to be exhibited in a point of view yet more alarming. 'Tis the ſummit of a climax, ſufficient to ſtrike a whole community with conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If a number of the members of Congreſs are ſtock-holders, or bank directors, then an illegitimate intereſt is operating on the national legiſlature—then the bank hath ſeduced away from their natural and conſtitutional allegiance, the repreſentatives of the ſtates—and then, even foreigners—our late moſt malignant and inveterate enemy—have obtained an influence on our national councils, ſo far as they have obtained bank ſtock. The Engliſh who could not conquer us, may buy us. Fooliſh Engliſh, to expend an hundred millions in fighting for the power of legiſlation, when a twentieth part of the money, will peaceably obtain it by purchaſe! But you have ſeen your error, whereas we are entering into ours.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe for argument ſake, that a majority of ſuch members did not exiſt. It is owing only to the curteſy of the ſcheme, ſince in addition to the ſtockholders, the bank could elect all its directors out of Congreſs, of which it regularly gives us ſix ſamples, three in each houſe. And more it would elect, if more it needed, for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027782_0028_0FD63FBDA04B1318"/>
there is no conſtitutional or legal reſtraint upon its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. To what an humble ſtation hath the American legiſlature dwindled down, within four years of its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; its independency is held by curteſy of a corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And an adminiſtration will call itſelf federal, and a lover of liberty, when it has deſtroyed its fundamental principle.</p>
               <p>An excluſive private intereſt, too often outweighs a common public obligation. What we can enjoy alone we value moſt, and are moſt eager to attain. Each man's ſhare of liberty, is held in ſo general a partnerſhip, that it is often diſregarded, under a ſtronger inducement. It cannot be depoſited in a vault, nor will it produce him an enormous annuity in hard money.</p>
               <p>Hence when paper men get into Congreſs, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are metamorphoſed into paper men after they get there, it is obvious that they will be influenced by their perſonal private intereſt, producing them an immenſe profit in caſh, rather than the public good. If the latter ſuffers, they will conſider their own acquiſitions in money, as a kind of boot, compenſating them abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their portions of the common loſs. One partner may thrive and the reſt be ruined. And upon ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples it is, that excluſions from the legiſlature are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>That an abundance of paper men have been in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, can never be denied. An unnatural alliance exiſts between certificate and ſtockholders; unnatural, as I ſhall take occaſion to ſhew. But the interpoſition of a third power will often reconcile contradictions, and a ſovereign hath been known to manage two kingdoms, of different languages.</p>
               <p>The public money is lodged in the bank. The higher the taxes are, the more of this money is therein depoſited. The more of this money is depoſited in the bank, the more paper the bank can circulate on its credit, and the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027782_0029_0FD63FBF701AAE98"/>
greater will be its profits. If the bank will ſtick by a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a miniſter may ſtick by a bank. The amount of taxes and loans are propoſed by the miniſter's eſtimates. When theſe get into Congreſs, they meet with a great number of paper men, who have a private intereſt in the accumulation of public burthens, and thus eſcape the ſtrict diſcuſſion, to be expected from unbiaſſed repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives. If a miniſter ſhould in this way douceur the bank and member-ſtockholders, the bank and ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may in ſome other douceur him and his friends. Occaſional accommodations of money, operating to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an influence in Congreſs, may be eaſily obtained by means of a good underſtanding, and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is eaſily formed between good friends, united by the ſtrongeſt of all ties—mutual ſupport.</p>
               <p>And mutual ſupport is neceſſary. The egregious impoſitions of a bank, cannot expect a long continuance, but by the help of miniſterial influence; and miniſterial influence reſts, for its ſupport, on paper evolutions. They are partners in a game, knowing each other's hands, and playing into them. Let us win the public money, ſays the bank, and you ſhall certainly win an ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy out of the ſtockholders. Beſides you may ſcatter the public money in the bank and its branches, from Boſton to Charleſton, ſo that it never can be counted; perplex your ſtatements, ſo that nobody can underſtand them, and we can always bring you off without detection, by boaſting of an intuitive knowledge, or inward light, making the whole matter as pellucid as the meridian ſun. Our votes in Congreſs count as well as others.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that poſſibilities are here ſtated. When facts are aſſerted, they reſult from the ſtatute book, or are of public notoriety. Apprehenſions are hazarded, for the purpoſe of ſubmiting it to the public mine, whether it will remain expoſed to the moſt imminent danger, or rid itſelf of ſo diſquieting a ſituation, by ſubjoining new checks for the recovery of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027782_0030_0FD63FC074252AB8"/>
violated rights, and the reſtraint of unconſtitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Such would be only an expoſition of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which never contemplated a ſyſtem ſtriking at the root of liberty.</p>
               <p>A nation riſks too much, by laying heaps of public wealth in the way of her ſervants, which they may take up, and put in their pockets, without being ſeen, and without account. Such trials of integrity, involve too ſerious and fatal conſequences for national amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>A part of the paper ſyſtem, as the miniſter hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly announced, contemplated the introduction of foreigners into the American ſpeculations—Conſider the effect of this. Paper men get into Congreſs, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the legiſlature—The bank governs the paper men—A majority of ſtockholders govern the bank—And foreigners may conſtitute this majority—Therefore fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners may guide the legiſlature of America. Every great national queſtion may be influenced by them. Is a treaty to be made reſpecting commerce or territory—are regulations concerning trade under conſideration—or is a propoſition for aboliſhing banks and ſtockjobbing to be decided upon, and a Britiſh influence may poſſibly give the caſting vote in every queſtion. If the queſtion ſhould relate to a war with Britain, the public ſituation would be abſolutely farcical. Specie being expelled by bank paper, a war could not be carried on, but by the help of ſuch paper. A majority of the ſtock may be held by Britiſh ſubjects, who would be more likely to embarraſs public meaſures, by demanding the debt due to the bank, into which the nation is already plunged, than to furniſh the means of attacking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. What a train of humiliating reflections are ſuggeſted by this idea? Forbear to indulge your grief. Let an effeminate impreſſion be ſuppreſſed by a manly reſolution, to lend your aid in deſtroying a ſyſtem, by which even Britain may be better repreſented in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and have more influence in the great queſtion of peace or war, than any ſingle ſtate.</p>

               <head>SECTION VII.—THE FOREGOING FACTS APPLIED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INVESTIGATION.</head>
               <p>BUT it is neceſſary to unload the memory, before we proceed farther, by an application of the facts which have been diſcloſed and impreſſed, to the text which was ſelected as a guide for our enquiries.</p>
               <p>It was aſſumed as a poſition, "That the conſtitution contemplates a republican form of government, flowing from, and depending on the people, and that a mode of adminiſtration deſtructive of ſuch dependence, and introductory of <hi>monarchical ingredients,</hi> innovates upon, and ſubverts the conſtitution."</p>
               <p>Now let me aſk, whether an ariſtocracy, is not only an ingredient, but the harbinger of monarchy? In this view it is unimportant to decide, whether the profits of the bank, are actually a tax upon the people or not. It is enough for our purpoſe, that the inſtitution tends
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027782_0032_0FD63FC36EA6C790"/>
to accumulate great wealth in the hands of a few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals; and that it is only calculated for the admiſſion of the rich. Nor is it neceſſary here to contend, that it acts with double force, in continually reducing the poor, whilſt it is exalting the rich.</p>
               <p>Let me further demand, what conſtitutes a real ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy? Names, or wealth united with excluſive pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. America recoils againſt titles. A conſciouſneſs of this, hath arreſted a propoſition in the Senate for their introduction, which, it is ſaid, came from a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Virginia, in violation of the ſentiment of that ſtate, and remains yet, to be decided upon when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall be ripe. Though the Senate did not dare to paſs it, they could not bear to reject it. Is it not puerile to ſpurn at the ſhadow, whilſt we erect by law the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Which is moſt to be dreaded; titles without wealth, or exorbitant wealth without titles? Have the <hi>words,</hi> prince, lord, <hi>highneſs</hi> or <hi>protector,</hi> a magical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our minds, or can they lay a ſpell upon our exertions? The moſt honorable and beſt earned title exiſting (and to the propriety even of this, I do not mean to ſubſcribe) is that of the Cincinnati. This title does neither influence the legiſlature, nor plunder labour. Who are moſt to be dreaded, the <hi>nominal</hi> or <hi>real</hi> lords of America? It is evident that exorbitant wealth conſtitutes the ſubſtance and danger of ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Money, in a ſtate of civilization is power. If we execrate the ſhadow, what epithet is too hard for an adminiſtration, which is labouring to introduce the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? The ſhadow is an ugly, yet harmleſs picture, fit only to frighten children; the fell monſter itſelf is good cauſe of alarm to men. In a land of liberty, the picture diſguſts, though incapable of doing miſchief, and is therefore excluded. Shall we conſult our ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet neglect our ſafety? Whilſt the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inhibits a nobility even <hi>nominally,</hi> are its principles permiſſive of its erection <hi>in reality?</hi> Does it reject the <hi>term</hi> "murder," and yet allow the crime to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated?</p>

A democratic republic is endangered by an immenſe diſproportion in wealth. In a ſtate of nature, enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſtrength poſſeſſed by one or ſeveral individuals, would conſtitute a monarchy, or an ariſtocracy—in a ſtate of civilization, ſimilar conſequences will reſult from enormous wealth. But the deity ſeems to have indicated his will in favour of liberty, by equaliſing the one, and limiting the other. The acquiſitions of an <hi>honeſt induſtry</hi> can ſeldom become dangerous to public or private happineſs, whereas the accumulations of <hi>fraud</hi> or <hi>violence,</hi> conſtantly diminiſh both. And providence viſibly expreſſes its diſapprobation of ſuch attempts, by raiſing up an extravagant heir to diſſipate ill-gotten and diſproportionate wealth; a <hi>natural effect,</hi> of which ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracies are ſo ſenſible, that they conſtantly counteract it by artificial regulations, eſtabliſhing perpetuities.</p>
               <p>Tyrants and ſlaves—an ariſtocracy enormouſly rich, and a peaſantry wretchedly poor, approximate in morals. Is it from a ſociety thus compoſed, that the bleſſings of political morality are expected to reſult? The compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is ſtealing upon us like death. The bank is the time of the body politic. It will lead it immaturely to the decrepitude of old age, and deſert it in the hour of diſſolution. Is this a direction for a wiſe people to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in? If the community will madly preſs forward to this goal, the ſooner ſhe arrives the better; there Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix-like ſhe will expire, with a conſolatory hope that a ſounder offspring will ariſe out of her aſhes.</p>
               <p>A miniſter intoxicated with influence, will exclaim, "Public debt is a public bleſſing," for taxes are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to induſtry. Where does the conſtitution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template an influential character in the perſon of a Secretary of the Treaſury, entitling him to preſcribe to Congreſs political dogmas? Or whence ariſes the right of the federal government, to apply ſtimulants to induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Does the conſtitution inveſt it with ſuch a power; if ſo, what is become of the liberty of labour? A whore will adminiſter provocatives to luſt, by the rule of her

own inſatiable appetite, and not the ability of her para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and when his ſtrength and health are exhauſted, will deſert him with contempt. Did labour intend to plan itſelf under the whip of an avaricious, inſatiable, and luxurious ariſtocracy?</p>
               <p>Labour, in the erection of a government, after deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the neceſſary expence of ſupporting it, deſigned to ſecure ſafety to itſelf, in the enjoyment of its own fruits. The ſtimulating ſyſtem fruſtrates this object, and changes government into its maſter, brandiſhing the laſh of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and leaving to labour what meaſure of ſuſtenance it pleaſes. Inſtead of the owners ſparing to government, government ſpares to the owners. The ſyſtem it is true, will make men leſs induſtrious in the preſervation of liberty. An urgent preſſure for food and raiment, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to inſtil into the mind the liberal ſentiments of freedom. A beaſt of burthen is more remarkable for its patience than its ſpirit. An ariſtocracy, therefore have good reaſon to exclaim "a national debt is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bleſſing," and in purſuance of their maxim, to create one that is fictitious, payable to themſelves out of the hard earned fruits of labour. To them it is a mine, yielding gold without work. By loading labour with ſtimulants, a coinage for their uſe is continually proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a tame and broken ſpirited ſubmiſſion to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, will be effectually ſecured.</p>
               <p>A nation oppreſſed by debt, real or fictitious, is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The plebians of this age are too wiſe to be individually cozened by the patricians, ſo that the latter are obliged to create a fictitious debt, by the help of law, impoſing generally upon the former, both an uſurious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound intereſt. It is time to retreat to the ſacred mount, if no other expedient is left, and there aſſert the rights of juſtice.</p>
               <p>But perhaps benevolence is at the bottom of this bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrivance, and though the ariſtocracy are ſpurring
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027782_0035_0FD63FC75CB1C788"/>
up labour to induſtry, by large annual draughts from its product, they may entertain a ſecret purpoſe of making an unexpected reſtoration of theſe draughts to the true owners. A ſurpriſe ſo agreeable, would create a day of jubilee, and perhaps the community, in its hour of good humour, might preſent the ſeveral banks with a continuation of their charters, provided they would thenceforward pay all the expences of government.—But what a degree of prodigality would it be, to farm out a revenue for half its annual product?</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition aſſumed, was, "that Congreſs can impoſe taxes for the common defence and general welfare of the United States, but not for the benefit of individuals, or their own private emolument."</p>
               <p>Although in applying the facts to the firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was not neceſſary to aſſert, that the profits of the bank are ſubſtantially a tax, yet we muſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the arguments urged to prove it, and rely that they have left on the mind of the reader an indelible conviction.</p>
               <p>And then it follows, that the moſt alarming infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the conſtitution, in the moſt dangerous and tender point, exiſts in the bank law.</p>
               <p>To thoſe recollected, ſubjoin another argument. Banks, all confeſs, baniſh ſpecie. It is the nature of ſpecie to equalize itſelf throughout the commercial world, and therefore whatever is baniſhed from any country, creates a <hi>neceſſity</hi> pro tanto. This <hi>neceſſity</hi> can only be ſupplied by ſome <hi>ſubſtitute,</hi> and bank paper is with us the only ſubſtitute. The nation therefore, by the contrivance, is <hi>compelled</hi> either to ſuffer the <hi>neceſſity</hi> or reſort to the <hi>ſubſtitute.</hi> If the loſs reſulting from the want of a circulating medium, is greater than the price demanded by the bank for its paper, people are impelled by the motive of intereſt to buy it. A want is artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally created, producing an alternative, conſiſting, on both ſides, of evil; the bank calculating, that of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:027782_0036_0FD63FCAC0268748"/>
evils, the leaſt would be choſen. When all the <hi>circulating</hi> ſpecie is baniſhed, the nation <hi>muſt</hi> pay for the whole of its <hi>circulating</hi> medium. If a part, they <hi>muſt</hi> pay for ſo much as will ſupply that part. In proportion as a bank can inflict on the community, the misfortune of loſing its circulating ſpecie, will its profit accumulate. A total loſs, the depth of misfortune to the one, is the ſummit of proſperity to the other. In an affair of the utmoſt national conſequence, the intereſt of a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the intereſt of the nation, are preciſely in oppoſition, and the affair is managed excluſively by the corporation. So long as there is ſpecie enough for the national occaſions, bank paper will bear no price, or but little can be ſold. Is not a preſſing <hi>need,</hi> a tax? An impoſt is founded on a <hi>need</hi> for imported articles. Home manufactures or forbearance, may evade it. Which will preſs moſt, the <hi>need</hi> for imported articles, or for a circulating medium, and how is the latter to be evaded?</p>
               <p>Life and property, are the two great objects of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſolicitude. Government ſeldom delights in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blood, and hence our ſafety on that ſcore. But its bowels often yearn for human wealth. Checks againſt this unhappy inclination, are conſidered as the moſt important, and are the moſt numerous in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It exhibits a degree of caution, amounting to ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>Of what avail are theſe checks, if they are to be eva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded by mere names? Inſtead of uſing the word "tax," the word "bank," is reſorted to. Suppoſe the title of the law had been, <q>An act for raiſing an annual ſupply of money for public purpoſes, by the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a bank.</q> Would the money raiſed have been a tax? Or, ſuppoſe the law had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <q>An act for taxing the community by the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a bank, and dividing the money ſo raiſed,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027782_0037_0FD63FCC895177B0"/>
among ſundry members of Congreſs, and certain other individuals therein named.</q> This title preciſely fits the law as it ſtands, and as it operates.</p>
               <p>What then has become of the conſtitution? The rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of money is the eſſence of a tax law; this act raiſes money, poſſeſſing the eſſence, though not the name. Sundry members of the legiſlature who impoſe the tax, receive a portion of it, and private individuals the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue. How does this redound to the <hi>common defence,</hi> or <hi>general welfare</hi> of the United States?</p>
               <p>In a ſtamp act, the word "tax," might be avoided, and that contrivance might be as conſtitutionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to, for the emolument of Congreſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>And if a depoſit ſhould be neceſſary, permit me to ſuggeſt an admirable hint. By the bank law, three fourths of the depoſit, might conſiſt of certificates, which are evidences of a depoſit, heretofore made for public ſervice. When a depoſit of theſe is made in the bank, an evidence is received of this ſecond depoſit. Let this ſecond evidence be depoſited, as ſtock in the ſtamp-office, and a third evidence taken out. Erect a new contrivance, where this third evidence may be depoſited as ſtock alſo, and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> For the one fourth ſpecie depoſited in the bank, the proprietors do not probably now gain a profit, of above <hi>cent. per cent.</hi> Whereas one or two other depoſitories of <hi>evidence</hi> as <hi>ſtock,</hi> will produce an appreciating effect, the reverſe of the depreciating operations during the late war. Or the idea will be better exemplified, by reminding my readers of doubling the grains of corn, for every nail on a horſe's ſhoe. This ſimilitude will fit at both ends. It exhibits the ſtock neceſſary to ſet out with, and alſo the gainfulneſs of ſuch operations.</p>

               <p>IT was farther aſſumed, <q>that the right of legiſlation reſided and yet reſides, in the people of the United States. That this right is periodically delegated by election to <hi>their</hi> repreſentatives.

               <p>Can you poſſibly, reader, comprehend a difference between the good of bank directors and ſtock holders, and the good of the community?

               <p>Reaſoning, to prove ſelf evident propoſitions, though apparently ſuperfluous, may yet be neceſſary by way of parapet, to defend them againſt the aſſaults of overbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wealth and power.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution, thoroughly impreſſed with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a ſimilitude of intereſts, of burthens, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and even of habits, between the people and their repreſentatives, was eſſentially neceſſary for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of liberty, and the diſpenſation of civil happineſs, reſorts to numerous precautions for its attainment.</p>
               <p>Having this end in view, it preſcribes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no perſon ſhall be a repreſentative, who has not been ſeven years a citizen of the United States.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That each repreſentative, muſt be an inhabitant of the ſtate in which he is choſen.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:027782_0039_0FD63FCFCB288D58"/>
3. That the repreſentation ſhall be in proportion to numbers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That no repreſentative ſhall be appointed to any office created, or the emoluments whereof have been increaſed, during the period for which he was elected; and that no perſon holding an office ſhall be a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative.</p>
               <p>The purpoſe of theſe fundamental rules, was to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a legitimate legiſlature, by excluding every ſpecies of undue influence then foreſeen.</p>
               <p>The idea of a bank, does not appear to have been contemplated or diſcuſſed in the minuteſt degree by the convention which framed the conſtitution. And not a trace of ſuch an idea, is to be found in the inſtrument reſulting from their deliberations.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who argue in favour of the conſtitutionality of the corporation, are reduced to the narrow ground of aſſerting, that a power is tacitly implied, conflicting and ſubverting the moſt fundamental principles, earneſtly and loudly expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Conſtructive powers, are like conſtructive treaſons. Have we ſecured our lives againſt the latter, and left our property, which ſupports life, expoſed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?</p>
               <p>From the bank contrivance, the following infractions of the cleareſt conſtitutional principles, obviouſly enſue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Members of Congreſs may vote for the erection of a <hi>gainful</hi> project, and be the <hi>receivers</hi> of the gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may impoſe a tax on the community or a a part of it, and inſtead of ſharing in the burthen, ſhare in the plunder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The higher and more unneceſſary the taxes and loans are, the more public money will be depoſited in the bank, and the greater will be the profit of the bank-members
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027782_0040_0FD63FD109E700F0"/>
of Congreſs, who nevertheleſs vote for taxes and loans.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A member of Congreſs, debauched by a profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able banking intereſt, ceaſes to be a <hi>citizen</hi> of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or an <hi>inhabitant</hi> of the ſtate which chooſes him, <hi>as to the purpoſes</hi> of the conſtitution. He becomes a citizen, and inhabitant of Carpenters Hall.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Being a member of a corporation, conſiſting chiefly or in part of foreigners, he is more under the influence of foreigners, than of thoſe who elected him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The conſtitution aims at a <hi>real</hi> repreſentation of the ſtates in proportion to numbers, making no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for members from corporations; and yet if the members of this corporation keep their ſeats in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, it is moderate to aſſert that it will be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented than any ſtate. For ſurely it will be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a man poſſeſſes as much fidelity to his own intereſt, as to the intereſt of his conſtituents. And hence the evident ſtruggle in the conſtitution to ſecure a common intereſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The bank can only gain its repreſentation, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the repreſentatives of the ſtates from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral allegiance; thus a ſtate may be deprived of the whole or a part of her repreſentation, and the appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment according to numbers is defeated. It would be better to allow the bank members, than to permit it to plunder the ſtates of their ſeveral quotas.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It was evidently deſigned, that the Senate as judges of impeachments, ſhould be <hi>conſtitutionally</hi> preſerved in a ſtate of impartiality. Impeachments originate in the houſe of repreſentatives, and the crimes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by this proceſs, will moſtly be compriſed in a miſapplication of public money. But if thoſe who are to inquire into ſuch miſapplications, to impeach, and to decide upon impeachments, may in conſequence of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027782_0041_0FD63FD3746A8C70"/>
banking and paper ſyſtems, be gainers by the miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, it is obvious that the check provided by this article of the conſtitution, upon a ſpecies of criminali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo dangerous as to have attracted the particular attention of a general convention, is intirely defeated. If accomplices are to ſet enquiries on foot,—to accuſe—and to decide, no prophetical ſpirit is neceſſary to foreſee the deciſion. Can a contrivance be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, by which a judiciary, the power of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends even to the puniſhment of undefined crimes, may be influenced out of its integrity and independence? The fountain of juſtice ought to be pure and uncorrupt. An influence which may ſway a fearful tribunal, not only for the acquital of the guilty, but for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the innocent, was never contemplated by the conſtitution. Bank directors, ſtock holders, and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intereſt, may be more likely by their judgments to diſqualify honeſt patriots from holding, "any office of honour, truſt or profit under the United States," who ſhall obſtruct peculations from public labour in any ſhape, than to remedy frauds favouring a monied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in general, and accruing to their own emolument in particular. A tribunal, which may try a preſident, ought to be as free from ſuſpicion, as Caeſars wife.</p>
               <p>But leaving an endleſs enumeration of conſtitutional violations, we will adventure a general obſervation; that the contrivance is a vehicle of undue influence, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſenſibly, and often irreſiſtibly, upon almoſt every important queſtion which can occur in Congreſs. It remains with the community to decide whether the impulſe tends to their good, and whether, if it does not, government is not converted into an uſurpation, in one of its moſt eſſential qualities?</p>
               <p>Members of Congreſs, who are alſo members of the bank, are under a triple bondage. If they diſpleaſe the miniſter, he may not only leſſen the trade in public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which the bank now monopoliſes, but he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027782_0042_0FD63FD523283E80"/>
the money to another place of depoſit, and he may refuſe the inſtitution his ſupporting influence, when its conſtitutionality is queſtioned. The miniſter is by law, let into a conſiderable portion of bank ſecrets. This knowledge is a conjurer's wand, with which the ſpirits may be raiſed or exorciſed, juſt as the magician pleaſes. Such repreſentatives, whilſt they are making laws to govern a nation, are themſelves liable to laws enacted by a corporation; for the bank can make bye laws. And if the national laws do not pleaſe the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, it may revenge itſelf through the medium of its bye laws, upon the national repreſentatives for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting them. But a colliſion of this kind is not likely to happen, as a common intereſt guides the corporation collectively and individually. A third maſter, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intereſt preſents itſelf. It does not offer the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential elaſtic, which the others can liberally beſtow, and is to maintain a combat at the odds of two to one. No bondage is ſo ſeldom rebelled againſt, as one which produces money. Mankind daily ſell their beſt ſervices and exertions, and the higheſt bidder is uſually the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer.</p>
               <p>The bank realizes the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation upon a member of Congreſs. He goes one thing, and by adminiſtering to him quantum ſufficit of paper, he is converted to another. A tranſubſtantiated or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual legiſlature, was juſt what the Engliſh deſigned to impoſe on America. In what part of the conſtitution is a doctrine ſanctioned, which juſtifies the epithet of rebel, beſtowed during the war by the enemy, upon thoſe who oppoſed ſuch a legiſlature?</p>
               <p>If the bank—the paper ſyſtem—and the miniſter, can influence a majority of the members of Congreſs, or even a ſingle member, where are ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the ſtates, as are clearly contemplated by the conſtitution? Againſt the evil not a ſingle check exiſts. Influence is a courtly term for corruption. It is never
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027782_0043_0FD63FD7B2090178"/>
neceſſary to induce a national repreſentation, to purſue the national good. And although it is only uſed, for the purpoſe of obtaining excluſive benefits for the few at the expence of the many, yet the few, counting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reconciliation to abuſes, produced by habit, will ſoon begin to inſinuate, that influence, alias, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an indiſpenſable attribute of good government.</p>
               <p>Even ſchool boys ridicule and contemn the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which guides the Britiſh parliament, according to the will of a miniſter. They have ſufficient penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſcern, that the ſyſtem is a cheat, exhibiting the picture of liberty, in lieu of the ſubſtance. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the two caſes, and point out, if you can, a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Antient and modern tyranny have reſorted to differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent modes for effecting the ſame end. The former, unpractiſed in the arts of diſſimulation, uſed open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The latter, ſkilful in deception, has changed the old ſyſtem, and reſorts to the wily tricks of private influence. One depended upon downright fighting, and an action in the open field, generally proclaimed the tyrant; the other prefers the generalſhip of fiſcal ambuſcade, and the tyrant is often concealed from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view, long after he is deſpotic. A defeat could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy the one, but a detection may overſet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Search, and you will inevitably find a preſent acting uſurpation; for if the proceedings of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are inconſiſtent with the principles of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, there is nothing to juſtify them.</p>
               <p>Slavery, when impoſed by antient ambition, was ſoftened by a military generoſity of diſpoſition; but from the modern ſordid, money-loving meanneſs of mind, what melioration can be expected?</p>

               <head>SECTION IX.—THE FUNDING SYSTEM.</head>
               <p>IT hath paſſed, irrevocably paſſed. Being compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of materials originally honeſt, and conſiſting at this time in a great meaſure of ſuch materials, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably impoſſible to unravel and remedy the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fraud.</p>
               <p>It remains however an indelible hieroglyphic of the principles and deſigns of adminiſtration, and in that view deſerves to be decyphered.</p>
               <p>The perſon who framed the ſyſtem, was certainly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of contemplating, and of guiding its effects. Had a motive of impartiality and public good preſided at its formation, the ſeveral ſtates, the commercial, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricultural, mechanical and profeſſional intereſts, all of which are too buſily engaged in a variety of <hi>uſeful</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, to hunt out miniſterial ſecrets, would have been plainly forewarned of the deſign, and publicly cautioned to preſerve their paper property. But this would have violated the miniſterial deſigns. It would have obviated the contemplated intention, of erecting an enormous ariſtocracy or monied intereſt, becauſe the public debt, like other property, would have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſiderably diſperſed.</p>
               <p>It was and is the faſhion of thinking, that a public debt unequally held, gives permanency and weight to government. That is, to uſe plain terms, it will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble government to controul the will of the people, by counterbalancing it with the weight of wealth. The conſtitution is compiled upon a principle preciſely in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this idea. The ſovereignty of the people gave it birth, and it acknowledges their parental au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This is a deſign of a few individuals, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to appropriate to themſelves the management of the national offspring, that they may change its nature, and debauch its affections from the great object of its
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027782_0045_0FD63FDAACCBE928"/>
political duty. It is an attempt to tranſplant the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from democratic ground, in which it might flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, to an ariſtocratical ſoil, in which it muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>And hence the funding ſyſtem. It was ſo contrived as to enable ſpeculators and monied men, to defraud the great bulk of the community of their paper proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As to transfer it, from thoſe who earned it, to thoſe who pilfered it, either by ſuggeſting falſehoods or concealing truths. As to concentrate it in a few hands, ſo that it could be applied with impreſſion, and poſſeſs activity as a political machine. And as to leave the true owners, by way of retribution for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, a burthenſome tax.</p>
               <p>Speculators could calculate events in Congreſs. They had leiſure to pry into accounts. They could even interpret the ſilence of a miniſter by watching indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Silence, was a negative conſecration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed multitude to the luſt of rapacity. A general, taking a city, condemns it to be plundered, if he does not actively interpoſe for its protection.</p>
               <p>The nation, but juſt emerged from the unforeſeen misfortunes of paper money, are ſuddenly overwhelmed by the ruin of a paper policy. The <hi>accidental</hi> bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of paper acquiſitions, gave the hint for a <hi>ſyſtem.</hi> It ſet out with the plauſible pretence of curing an evil, and it applies a worſe evil. As if fire would cure a burn. The wounds ſuffered by individuals, from paper money, were healing; but an accidental misfortune is now converted into a ſyſtem, by which a few individuals ſpeculate on a nation; the old wounds are made to bleed afreſh, and new ones are indiſcriminately inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Of this ſyſtem, the aſſumption is a ſtriking feature. For this there was no general petition from the people. No urgency preſſed it. But it favoured the object of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027782_0046_0FD63FDF2DC9B5D0"/>
adminiſtration. State debts ſold at a low rate, and therefore might eaſily be monopolized. To diſſolve all money relationſhip, between individuals, and the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtates, would on the one hand diminiſh the ſtate power, and tend to conſolidation, and on the other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an undue influence, by which the conſolidated pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be managed.</p>
               <p>If the payment of public debts had been an object, accident had already effected, that which ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would have dictated. Congreſs poſſeſs the power of indirect, and the States that of direct taxation. Hence the public debt could have been diffuſed upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of the nation, ſo as to have been leſs burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome upon an excluſive branch of thoſe reſources, by leaving the States reſpectively to provide for State debts. And an impoſt might have been equivalent to thoſe of the union.</p>
               <p>A recurrence to direct taxation by Congreſs, will ſwallow up the little ſovereignty, now left to the once ſovereign individual States; and every accumulation of the debts of the union, is an impulſe towards that end.</p>
               <p>Hence all aſſumptions, and hence the enormous loans which have been negociated. In the power of money, is the confidence of adminiſtration placed. By aſſuming all money negociations, a face of buſineſs, and activity, will be beſtowed on the Federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The excluſive payment of debts, and impoſition of taxes, will exhibit it as the only political object, to intereſt the attention of individuals; whilſt the ſtate governments will become only ſpeculative common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, to be read for amuſement like Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Oceana, or Moore's Utopia. Without pulſation, without elaſticity they will dwindle gradually into a tale that has been told, and their parts will crumble and diſſipate, like a corporation of beavers, whoſe waters have been drained away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:027782_0047_0FD63FE1A198FF78"/>
Does this ſyſtem comport with the conſtitution, where it guarantees to each State a republican form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If the term <hi>"form,"</hi> means <hi>ſhadow,</hi> it does; but if the guarantee extends to <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert, that it does not.</p>
               <p>A money ſyſtem may be called the natural enemy of State conſtitutions—of State laws—of State police (for we dare not aſpire to an higher expreſſion) and of State diſpoſitions. Accumulations of enormous wealth in a few hands, by legal legerdemain, is deſtructive of that equality among citizens, which the State conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contemplate—is worſe than <hi>limited</hi> ſinecures, which they reprobate—defeat the effects of State laws for the diviſion of property in caſes of inteſtacy—and wound our feelings, by converting our equals of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, into our lords of to-morrow. A few dwarfs are ſuddenly metamorphoſed into giants, by a paper necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, and the reſt of the community whom it makes more dwarfiſh, both really and comparatively, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted by ſyren notes, into an inſenſibility of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>If many individuals in four years, have acquired from 100,000 to 1,000,000 of dollars, how much will they gain in twenty years? What has been, and will be the impreſſion upon the community? Which is moſt to be deplored; Great Britain, oppreſſed for the ſupport of her royal brood, or America, fleeced by her brood of ſpeculators?</p>
               <p>A lineament of the ſyſtem, is alſo exhibited in the ſinking fund. Even its name was a fraud upon the community. It ought to have been denominated "the raiſing fund," for it was deſigned to raiſe the price of certificates. It is the pap of paper, upon which the child was to ſubſiſt, until it was old enough to be wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This artifice is ſo groſs, that it will at once be ſeen through a few plain facts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:027782_0048_0FD63FE1A497C088"/>
The ſinking fund was erected <hi>in</hi> 1790, conſiſting of about 1,300,000 dollars, which the miniſter <hi>then</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as a <hi>ſurplus</hi> of revenue, beyond the public oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Leſs than 1,000,000 of it had been applied in January 1793; between which time, and the erection of the fund, nearly that ſum was expended in <hi>periodical</hi> purchaſes of certificates. <hi>In</hi> 1790 <hi>alſo,</hi> the miniſter commenced the borrowing of money in Holland, and drawing it to this country, <hi>without law,</hi> and <hi>without the ſanction of the Preſident;</hi> by which means, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even to the preſent year, monies have been obtained to a much greater amount, than the whole ſinking fund.</p>
               <p>Apply to theſe facts, the following queſtions.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>ſurplus</hi> of revenue exiſted, why was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney borrowed, and drawn <hi>illegally</hi> hither from Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? If not, why was the fact officially aſſerted? How was the debt <hi>ſunk,</hi> by the erection of a fund, producing the neceſſity of incuring a new debt, to a greater amount than the fund itſelf? If <hi>ſinking</hi> the debt was the ſimple object, why is it that the <hi>ſinking</hi> fund has not been ſooner applied? Does the paying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Holland for monies to replace this fund, whilſt the fund is lying dead here at a loſs of intereſt, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards <hi>ſinking</hi> the debt? Was the miniſter ſo wide of the truth, when he called the ſinking fund <hi>"a ſurplus,"</hi> as to have been obliged to divert both that, and monies borrowed, for the <hi>preſcribed</hi> purpoſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the French debt, to current governmental occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? or were no certificates to be purchaſed?</p>
               <p>But if keeping up, or raiſing the price of certificates be conſidered as the primary object, all theſe difficulties are ſolved. The <hi>occaſional</hi> recurrences to the ſinking fund are explained. And the miniſterial financierings, ſhrink to political artifices, which incurred an enormous national expence, in the purchaſe of the ariſtocratical
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027782_0049_0FD63FE30514CFD0"/>
deſideratum. Artifices, turned into laws, by an illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate legiſlature.</p>
               <p>The reſemblance between monarchical or ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical contrivances, and the adminiſtration of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not leſſened, by playing off upon America, the Engliſh bubble of a ſinking fund. When theirs was eſtabliſhed, their debt was moderate, but ſince this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of fund hath been operating, it has ſwelled to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred millions of pounds ſterling. Under the operation of our ſinking fund, the public debt, has been continually accumulating alſo, and a proportional augmentation, will undoubtedly in leſs than a century, enable us to contend with England itſelf, for the firſt rank among the honourable ſociety of national ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts.</p>
               <p>The aera when the government began to act, was the moment of leaſt ſuſpicion. At that unwary moment, an <hi>uſurping</hi> ſyſtem could be moſt ſafely introduced, and precedents for expounding the conſtitution eſtabliſhed, which might be afterwards quoted. Relying upon the unlimited national confidence which then exiſted, the ſyſtem dictated an attempt to bind future legiſlatures, and to ſecure perpetually to the nation the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of a public debt, by rendering a great proportion of it ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeemable. The conſtitution limits the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs "to the <hi>payment</hi> of the debts of the United States," and whilſt the echo of the mandate is yet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating in our ears, the funding ſyſtem declares that they ſhall <hi>not be paid.</hi> What barrier, will not rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ambition overleap?</p>
               <p>Funding, banking, aſſuming, loaning, have compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fiſcal and political perplexity. The fiſcal, which could moſt eaſily have been explained, ſince figures can exhibit an account of money, is not even underſtood by the members of Congreſs. And the political, though better underſtood, is ſtill a capital auxiliary towards the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027782_0050_0FD63FE4C3A0F868"/>
general obſcurity. <hi>Perplexity</hi> in money ſtatements is ground enough for ſuſpicion. Detection would expel ſuſpicion to make room for certainty. And the want of ſimplicity in politics, is ever a badge of deſign.</p>
               <p>The funding ſyſtem was intended to effect, what the bank was contrived to accelerate.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Accumulation of great wealth in a few hands.</item>
                  <item>2. A political moneyed engine.</item>

               </list>
               <p>And hence the tone of this inſtrument alſo, in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral vibrations, harmonizes with the perilous deſign, radically to deſtroy the conſtitution, and to erect upon its ruins an uſurpation, not ſanctioned by the national will, or acknowledging the fundamental principle; <hi>that the people are the only legitimate fountain of civil government.</hi>

               <head>SECTION X.—THE REMEDY.</head>
               <p>TO determine whether a remedy to theſe threatening evils is neceſſary or not, the inquiry ought to be brought to the following ſimple point. Whether Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is now governed according to the ſyſtem of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or the ſyſtem of an adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>This latter ſyſtem is indeed a riddle, but its effects furniſh the ſolution. By its fruits ſhall it be known. Effects are the language in which a political deſign ſpeaks, and furniſh a conſtruction, ſurpaſſing <hi>profeſſions</hi> in veracity, as far as the permanency of things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of words.</p>
               <p>If the conſtitution meditates the producing of great
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027782_0051_0FD63FE9E6BF8A58"/>
inequality of wealth among citizens—the enriching of a favoured few at the public expence—the impoſition of an enormous tax for private benefit, and not for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral welfare—the eſtabliſhment of corporations, with gainful rights and privileges, which neceſſarily dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the general ſtock of rights and privileges, from whence they are deducted—the transferring of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per property of the citizens into a few hands without value received—the erection of a fund, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſinking the public debt, whereas its true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to raiſe the value of that very paper, thus filch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the real owners, at the public expence—the rendering the debt of the United States irredeemable by law—the giving to foreigners an immenſe, indirect and ſecret influence over our national counſels—and above all, the introduction of a monied and undue influence into the legiſlature; an influence which ſubſiſts at the public expence, inſtead of being actuated by the public good; if the conſtitution meditates ſuch deſigns, then the point is determined one way, and it muſt be conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that America is governed according to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if it does not, candor will acknowledge, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica is governed according to a ſyſtem of an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>To come at the truth, ſearch our political ſcripture, conſider it text by text, and diſcover where theſe deſigns have been ſo covertly concealed, as to have eſcaped the penetration of every convention which ſifted and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the inſtrument; and as to remain a monument of a treaſonable intention in the general convention, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and impoſe upon their conſtituents.</p>
               <p>If we rely on the united integrity and wiſdom of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, we ſhall reject overſtrained conſtructions, tending to impeach theſe qualities, and ſeek for the plain and conſiſtent meaning.</p>
               <p>After having aſcertained the principles of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, let it be conſidered, whether the ſyſtem of the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027782_0052_0FD63FEB2DB2E9E0"/>
adminiſtration may not be overturned, and the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill remain unhurt? If ſo, is not that ſyſtem a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the conſtitution?</p>
               <p>Then it ought to be deſtroyed. America has aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a character upon the theatre of the world, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour—fame and political philoſophy, call upon her to ſupport. She is the inventor of principles, aſſerting the equal rights of man, and exploding king-craft, prieſt-craft, nobility-craft and miniſter-craft. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon her to prove by example, that her the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory is practically ſound. Otherwiſe ſhe betrays man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, after having conſtituted herſelf the vindicator of their rights. Inſtead of honour, ſhe will then deſerve reproach; and her future fame will be that of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arnold for inſtance, who has betrayed the cauſe he undertook to defend, and deſerted over to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he engaged to defeat.</p>
               <p>A diviſion of power among king, lords, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is ſetting out in government with an allotment of parties. It is providing the materials for civil diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Power will fluctuate like wealth, if it is propoſed as the ſubject of controverſy among three contending intereſts. And every fluctuation muſt diſorder the fanciful idea of the <hi>balance.</hi> A preciſe equipoiſe among theſe three intereſts, from which only the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good is expected to reſult, could not exiſt above a moment in an age. Whereas by taking the people as the only genuine and legitimate fountain of power, and by avoiding legal artifices producing an inequality of wealth or privileges, we eſcape the black train of evils recorded in hiſtory, as having been in moſt ages and governments, engendered by combinations of nobles to oppreſs the people; and by more juſtifiable combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people to reduce the nobles. Evils, which are the natural effect of the whimſical balancing notion, and which invariably end in deſpotiſm. Nobility is the cauſe of theſe evils, and of courſe the ſeed of tyranny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:027782_0053_0FD63FECAEA7FC28"/>
As a rivalſhip for power, is the uniform conſequence of three branches of government, it muſt inevitably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the balance, and produce a continual political fermentation. And the conteſt will not be allayed by reflecting, that thoſe for whoſe good the ſcheme is ſaid to have been invented, are ſure of being degraded to the deſpicable ſtate of a mere tool, to be uſed by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and artifice, for the attainment of their own ſelfiſh purpoſes.</p>
               <p>The people are the natural body politic; king, lords and commons, are artificial ſtructures. Thoſe who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour art at the expence of nature, conſider the people as a mere maſs of matter, upon parts of which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert a plaſtic political-craft, and form a ſort of intaglio. The reſidue of the maſs is conſidered only as a ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of materials, to mend, patch, and ſupport the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or ſecreted parts, as they happen to impair each other by their colliſions.</p>
               <p>King, lords and commons are a fleet, conſiſting of an admiral ſhip, firſt rates and frigates, and the people are the foreſts, out of which this fleet is built and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; to be cut, hacked and hewed, as the occaſions of the fleet ſhall require. Further by way of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating myſelf to thoſe poiſing ideas; the people in ſuch a ſyſtem, may be likened to a balance maſter, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering about with a ladder upon his chin, a chair mounted on the ladder, and a ſword on the chair. Can the equilibration be long ſuſtained? Inſtead of ſuch mountebank pantomimes, is it not adviſable, leſt they fall upon you, to ſlip from under them, and ſo let all three fall to the ground. And then, a natural poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which only can produce ſtability, may be reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>This balancing whim hath been tried by many nations, and if all have failed either to find or maintain the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, it is time to conclude, that it is an attempt to put
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:027782_0054_0FD63FF2BB62BA70"/>
fetters on air, or a ſearch after the philoſopher's ſtone. That it is founded in ſpeculation and not in principle. That the idea of forming a government by the help of a pair of ſcales, conſtructed for weighing power, is more fanciful than ſolid. And that the multiplied examples of thoſe who have failed, ought to deter the ſlighteſt degree of prudence, from renewing an experiment, invariably unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>By adhering to the idea, that the people are the only genuine fountain of power, a conſtitution is immortal; for if a <hi>change</hi> is made in its parts by the public will, it only proves that this <hi>fundamental</hi> principle continues unimpaired. Such would be a plain conſtitution, not poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the drugs of a ſpeculating policy. A change of times, temper, and circumſtances, may often require a change of political regulations. By clinging to this ſimple principle, a peculiar ſituation may be gratified, without internal commotion; whereas a <hi>mixed</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple—a political ſalmagundi, is ſeldom brought back to its primitive parts but by a civil war.</p>
               <p>Who is to ſuperintend the political tripod? If a member of it is from time to time to adjuſt the weights, he will be for ever filching from the other two, to add to his own ſcale. Thus the equilibrium is loſt and then the effects of the machine are wide of every calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>The perplexity of this mechaniſm requires frequent repairs, and yet its delicacy makes it unſafe to mend it. Whereas from ſimplicity, both ſtrength and duration, are moſt likely to reſult.</p>
               <p>The preciſe adjuſtment of theſe balances, is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, ſurpaſſing human intellectual powers, as far as the preciſe aſcertainment of the true religion. As to both, no two perſons would hardly agree in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and when there are as many opinions as there
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027782_0055_0FD63FF49C125338"/>
are men, what is the chance for ſtumbling on the right? Sincerity in political <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, will not render its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to ſociety leſs baneful.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the graces—the graces, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually rung in our ears, but conveying no perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous idea, the manners it will produce can never be foreſeen; and if one in a thouſand ſucceeds, all he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires is a ſpecies of ceremonious tinſelled frippery of geſture of little worth either to himſelf or others; whereas a deportment, founded in moral rectitude, is the baſis of individual happineſs, and the diſpenſer of bleſſings to others. The balances—the balances, are the graces—the graces of government. They are a confuſed aſſemblage of notions, conveying no diſtinct idea, and compoſed by the rule of fancy. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <q>that the people are the only legitimate foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of power,</q> and of courſe the only ſafe corrector of its abuſe, is a political guide, ſurpaſſing the one in point of public ſafety, as far as true morality exceeds the other in reſpect to private manners.</p>
               <p>Obvious is the vanity of an expectation, that one equal conſtituent member of a government, is a ſufficient and ſafe check upon two others; as is the folly of depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſocial and natural rights, under a ſteward-ſhip, as unreſtrained, as if the proprietors had travelled into a far country. Whether is it moſt likely, that one member will enter on the perilous undertaking of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling the wicked deſigns of the other two, or that motives of intereſt and ſafety ſhould dictate to all, the policy of a triple alliance? The example of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain carries this idea beyond conjecture.</p>
               <p>Can the majority of the people deſign to oppreſs? Does hiſtory exhibit ſuch a caſe? The writers in favour of monarchy are reduced to the miſerable ſhift, of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the mobs of cities in the place of nations, in order to conjure up the idea of a popular deſpotiſm, which cannot, as America is ſituated, exiſt. The many
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027782_0056_0FD63FF77AC983C8"/>
have no motive to oppreſs the few. Temptations to fraud are in an inverſe proportion, to the multitude who are ſharers in the plunder, and the diminution of the booty to be divided. A combination of the great bulk of the community, to erect a deſpotiſm over an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable number of individuals, though it would not exhibit the extreme caſe, of a tyrannic nation, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering over one man, would yet preſent the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous object, of an hundred perſons, owning a ſingle ſlave.</p>
               <p>But whither are we going? Did America fight for a revolution of dominating families, or of principles? If of principles define and compare them with the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now avowed, by words, in books, in newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, and by actions, all evincing a concerted deſign. Seriouſly concerted as the deſign is, I will believe that America is not ſufficiently regenerated, for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of king, lords and commons. She yet knows well, that <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> religions—biſhops—tythes—and ſtanding armies, being ſcions of the ſame ſtock, ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ſprout up together with ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>The people are the only ſafe guardians of their own liberty, and the ſocial juriſdiction, the only impartial corrector of unconſtitutional political deſigns.</p>

               <head>SECTION XI.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</head>
               <p>THE people are the only ſafe guardians of their own liberty. The component parts of government are the creatures of the conſtitution. A ſubjection of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to the created, is a reverſal of the courſe of nature. The conſtitution is a limitation to legiſlative power. It inſulates arbitrary deſigns, and continually pronounces, "thus far ſhalt thou go." But ſuppoſe a legiſlature ſhould go further. Is the veto abortive? Is it only an empty
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027782_0057_0FD63FF8DAB7DBE8"/>
echo of a nation's laſt dying words? or is it to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and by whom?</p>
               <p>Without legiſlative encroachment or connivance, no infringement upon the conſtitution can happen. The laws will act upon and reſtrain individuals, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the courts of juſtice; but the conſtitution only can act upon the legiſlature, by the enforcement of the ſocial juriſdiction. The laws being competent to every other object of good government, the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution muſt have been excluſively deſigned for the caſe, to which it is now applied. Until a violation of the principles of the conſtitution appears, no occaſion for reſorting to the remedy exiſts; and when it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to aſſert that there is no mode of getting at the remedy, or that the body preſuppoſed by the violation, to be vitiated, are yet to enforce it upon themſelves, is making the conſtitution a dead letter.</p>
               <p>Therefore if liberty is a national object, the nation itſelf muſt watch over the conſtitution, preſerve it from violation, and ſupply its defects, or admit it to be the Lethe of the community, producing an intire forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the rights of man.</p>
               <p>The national judgment or will may be brought to act in two modes, without recurring to a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By cautiouſly electing members of Congreſs, of a ſimilarity of intereſts—of burthens—of benefits—and of habits with the electors. For an unbiaſſed judgment upon good information, will correct political abuſes, and invent new checks againſt their repetition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Through the organs of ſtate legiſlatures.</p>
               <p>The firſt will operate ſlowly. The people may be deceived by profeſſions, and a repreſentative though ſound at firſt is ſometimes debauched. But yet as the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027782_0058_0FD63FFB22DA5148"/>
people when informed, are almoſt invariably right, and as a repreſentative is often firm, it deſerves the moſt ſedulous attention.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a ſecurity for liberty of the happieſt texture which could have been deviſed.</p>
               <p>The ſtate legiſlatures are the people themſelves in a ſtate of refinement, poſſeſſing ſuperior information, and exhibiting the national ſuffrage in the faireſt and ſafeſt mode.</p>
               <p>They are annual conventions, ſubject to no undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, not participating of loaves and fiſhes, and actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the motive of public good.</p>
               <p>Holding their power by an annual tenure, they are frequently accountable to the people, often changed, and incapable of forming combinations for their private emolument, at the public expence.</p>
               <p>Being more immediately within the view of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, ſhould they miſinterpret the doings of the national government, or miſrepreſent the public mind, a detection, or a contradiction, would be almoſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous.</p>
               <p>As electors of ſenators, they conſtitute a chief link connecting the general and ſtate governments, through which the conduct of the former may be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and the will of the people reacted; ſo as to fill up in ſome meaſure, the great ſpace between Congreſs and the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They may operate deciſively upon the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by conſtituting the ſenate according to a republican ſtandard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And finally the ſtate legiſlatures have at leaſt as good a right to judge of every infraction of the conſtitution, as Congreſs itſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:027782_0059_0FD63FFCD0847C30"/>
The alarming mode of thinking avowed by the ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, <q>that they are only reſponſible to God and their own conſciences,</q> inſtead of weakening the argument, is an additional reaſon for clinging to every means, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to produce an <hi>effectual</hi> reſponſibility in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs, to the conſtitution, and to the people who made it. Whilſt the avowal goes to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every principle of liberty—to the annihilation of the conſtitution—and is in fact a rebellion againſt the firſt principles of liberty, the <hi>act</hi> of ſhutting the ſenate doors accords with the <hi>doctrine,</hi> and exhibits one of its effects, by obſtructing the evidence upon which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility can only be enforced. If a juriſdiction is compelled to decide upon incomplete evidence, a power to impoſe ſuch a neceſſity, inſtead of being amenable to that juriſdiction, is ſuperior to it; and by concealing a part, aſſumes a right of with-holding the whole teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Of what avail is a right of deciſion, when the grounds upon which to exert human reaſon and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are with-held either completely or partially?</p>
               <p>A diſavowal of every ſpecies of reſponſibility to <hi>ſocial</hi> obligations, is a diſavowal of all claim to ſocial confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

            <div n="12" type="section">
               <head>SECTION XII.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</head>
               <p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL deſigns have been demonſtrated; the corrective power is found; and it now remains to ſpecify the remedies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>natural intereſt</hi> of every country, ought exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to legiſlate. A complete transfer of this power to an <hi>artificial intereſt,</hi> is a thorough legiſlative corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A partial tranſfer, is a legiſlative taint. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural intereſt of a country includes whatever may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, without the direct aid of municipal law, as agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027782_0060_0FD63FFDEC5F3CD8"/>
commerce, manufactures and arts. An artificial intereſt, whatever is immediately created by law. As public debt, public officers, and private banks.</p>
               <p>If this idea is not a <hi>principle</hi> of the conſtitution, and a neceſſary <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the preſervation of liberty, upon what grounds were public officers excluded from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and a variety of precautions introduced for the purpoſe of preventing an undue influence from creeping into that body? No admiſſion of an artificial intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the legiſlature, is recognized by the conſtitution, and unleſs the <hi>principle</hi> of the excluſion, and not the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples adduced, is conſidered as fundamental (the gift of preſcience not having preſided at the formation of the conſtitution) then the legiſlative branch may evade it without reſtriction, by creating an artificial intereſt not foreſeen or contemplated, and beſtowing upon it a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative influence.</p>
               <p>For example. Congreſs impoſe taxes and borrow money. The higher the tax, and the more they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the more they may receive as ſtock-holders. Which violates the <hi>principle</hi> of the conſtitution moſt ſorely, the caſe it ſtates, of excluding a member becauſe he receives a <hi>fixed</hi> ſalary as an officer of government; or the caſe unforeſeen, of a member's receiving <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unlimited</hi> gain from the public labour, and in part from the public purſe, depending on his own vote?</p>
               <p>Again. Public monies are to be accounted for to Congreſs. Suppoſe they ſhould be employed in favori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to the bank, or in keeping up the price of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. Will certificate or ſtock-holders, who receive the money, be very inexorable in detecting and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a miſapplication? Or being bound by number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ties of the ſtrongeſt intereſt, in the cloſeſt alliance with a miniſter of finance, is not an explanatory and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening effect upon their minds rather to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027782_0061_0FD63FFF777EA270"/>
if incomprehenſible accounts of public monies ſhould be exhibited.</p>
               <p>It is the <hi>chief principle</hi> of the conſtitution, that the natural, and not an artificial intereſt, ſhould be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the legiſlature. They are uſually in oppoſition to, if not at enmity with, each other; becauſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſtantly ſubſiſts upon the former. Therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ought to be limited and reſtrained by the ſimple rule of the public good. But if it legiſlates, it is ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no reſtraint or limitation.</p>
               <p>Slavery is only a domination of an artificial, over the natural intereſt of a nation. In whatever ſhape that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial intereſt appears, the effect is the ſame. And if the artificial intereſt poſſeſſes a power of erecting itſelf, and of legiſlating to preſerve and ſupport itſelf, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is already enſlaved.</p>
               <p>Public creditors and ſtock-holders ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Congreſs, upon the ſame principle as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officers are excluded, becauſe all may acquire pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic monies by their own votes, and the acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the two former being behind the curtain, are moſt to be apprehended. Would ſuch characters have been fit perſons to form a conſtitution for America, and if not, are they proper guardians, of that which they could not have been entruſted to enact?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe for inſtance, whilſt the funding and aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laws were under diſcuſſion, members of Congreſs had held paper, the value of which was to be greatly enhanced by funding and aſſuming. Would ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have been impartial judges of the propriety of theſe meaſures? or of the propoſition to make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to the original holders for their loſs, leaving ſtill to the purchaſers a handſome gratuity? Could not members of Congreſs upon that occaſion have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven by ſpeculators, with their projects? Or whilſt the queſtions were under conſideration, if members had
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027782_0062_0FD64001B4E74238"/>
drawn the wages paid by their country for impartiality, and inveſted them in the purchaſe of a perſonal intereſt on one ſide of the queſtion, could a greater degree of legiſlative corruption have been conceived? When the bank law was before Congreſs, were certificate holders impartial legiſlators, ſince an effect of it, was to increaſe the intereſt on 7,500,000 dollars of certificates, from ſix to at leaſt <hi>twelve per centum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Illuſtrations reſulting from an actual ſtate of things, and drawn from laws, ſo important in their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, enable us to look forward for future effects, upon better grounds than conjecture, and bring the queſtion to this iſſue. Ought Congreſs to decide upon the moſt important national regulations, from motives of public good, or ought they to be governed, or even biaſſed by thoſe of private intereſt?</p>
               <p>Natural deafneſs would be conſidered as an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable objection to a candidate for a ſeat in Congreſs, and yet it would be preferable to an artificial deafneſs, as far as an equal chance of doing right, is preferable to an automaton member, whoſe motions are governed by a ſecret impulſe, when that impulſe is ſelf-intereſt.</p>
               <p>Laws then ought to be made by the natural or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſt of a nation, and every artificial, local and particular intereſt, ought to depend upon the juſtice and integrity of that which is natural or general, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this every individual participates, whereas a few perſons only are concerned in the others; becauſe the ſmaller the number, and the more excluſive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the greater the temptation to injuſtice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; becauſe national confidence in the important matter of legiſlation, can only reſide in the nation itſelf; and becauſe, when a power to legiſlate, is the offspring of legiſlation and not of the conſtitution, legiſlation which gave, can reſume the power, can transfer it from one excluſive intereſt to another, and can cauſe politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027782_0063_0FD6400292BC1CB0"/>
principles, intended to be made conſtitutionally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, to fluctuate. The power of legiſlation, by the ſeveral paper laws, is in fact and ſubſtance (for we are regardleſs of form) transferred from the nation to a paper junto. And if the bank and certificate artificial intereſts, were in a ſtate of warfare, legal transfers of this power, and fluctuations of political principles, would preſently exemplify the objects of a legiſlative power, flowing in fact, though not in form, out of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation.</p>
               <p>If this is not the principle of excluſions from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, upon what baſis do they reſt? Admiting it to be ſo, is not the artificial, excluſive, private paper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt completely embraced by it?</p>
               <p>When ſuch an intereſt ſeduces a part of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the general or national intereſt, into its views or deſigns, liberty is dangerouſly wounded; but when a majority of ſuch repreſentatives is thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, liberty is theoretically annihilated.</p>
               <p>An unanſwerable illuſtration of this doctrine reſults from the recollection, that the paper intereſt is tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. It is a bird of paſſage, regardleſs of climes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of national feelings—of national attachments—or of that amor patriae, which is the moſt tender pledge of legiſlative kindneſs. Inſtead of poſſeſſing perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, it may connect itſelf occaſionally with French, Spaniſh, Dutch, or Engliſh politics. Are theſe ſuch ſupports as the conſtitution ſolicits? And what muſt be the views of an adminiſtration, which has ſelected an itinerant, unfeeling viſitant, as the guardian of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns? Of the public good, paper is a moſt unnatural guardian. It is a rapacious calculator of intereſt, whoſe conſcience is ſeared by its acquiſitions and its hopes. In Congreſs, it is an inexorable creditor, with an execution or a deed of truſt in its hand, ready to ſeize and ſell—with a power to borrow money for its
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027782_0064_0FD640059854AB10"/>
own purpoſes, at any loſs to the debtor—and able to perplex its demands and add to its uſury, by ſly tricks or legiſlative contrivances.</p>
               <p>Hence the depoſiting of certificates in the national bank, by which the paper more than doubled intereſt—hence the enormous loans made of the bank, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt, whilſt it poſſeſſed and uſed an enormous ſum of public money, carrying no intereſt—hence the continual foreign loans, whilſt the nation is amuſed with a ſinking fund, with compliments to the trade of financiering, and with official recommendations from the miniſter, conveyed through the pureſt channel, to commence the diſcharge of the public debt—and hence that aſſemblage of contrivances, placing the people in a ſtate of utter darkneſs, as to the diſpoſition of their money.</p>
               <p>If we tempt men's deſires, by hopes of boundleſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, the conſtant incitements of private intereſt, will leave no interval of time or reflection, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the public good; a reflection, out of which, if it is juſt, ariſes a ſtrong argument for expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling every ſpecies of private undue influence out of Congreſs, that the attention of this body may be bent to the national welfare.</p>
               <p>The expulſion of paper men out of Congreſs would bring theſe obſervations to the teſt of an impartial le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate legiſlature. Is ſuch an event deſirable? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate it, and behold its effects. If the paper intereſt would be expelled from Congreſs—if the incorporating uſurpation, and all conſtructive contrivances, violating republican principles, would be reſtrained—if any other miſconſtrued or doubtful expreſſions in the conſtitution would be explained, and new ſecurities for liberty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed—and if ſimplicity in the finances would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; ſuch deciſions would prove the truth and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my arguments. I challenge the ariſtocracy to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027782_0065_0FD640082662B0D0"/>
ſubmit to this fair and honeſt trial. A deciſion by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in its own favour, is no proof at all. If they ſhrink from ſo unexceptionable a propoſition, and will continue both judge and jury in their own cauſe, it can only flow from a <hi>conſciouſneſs,</hi> which will not eſcape the notice of the community, in conſidering whether real reforms are deſirable, and whether it will ſtop at ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary anticipations of its wiſhes. <hi>Such a legiſlature would alſo repeal the bank law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What! exclaims the appalled ariſtocracy, will you alſo invade rights of private property, <hi>as by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed?</hi> Yes, <hi>If they are interdicted by the principles of the conſtitution, they are wrongs, and not rights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſubject deſerves a further examination. It may illuſtrate and unravel the unconſtitutional deſigns of a monarchical faction.</p>
               <p>We hear on all hands of the <hi>ſacredneſs</hi> of private property, held by <hi>legiſlative</hi> ſanction; of the <hi>inviolabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>legiſlative</hi> faith; and it is even aſſerted, that Congreſs ought never to repeal a law, by which they have beſtowed a valuable boon upon an individual. Congreſs have themſelves plainly expreſſed their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage in favour of theſe doctrines, by pledging the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith, that the excluſive privileges of the bank ſhall be enjoyed for twenty years <hi>unrivalled,</hi> and by making a portion of the public debt <hi>irredeemable,</hi> in virtue of their conſtitutional power <hi>to redeem.</hi> It is evident that theſe doctrines are invented to prop the laws, and the laws grounded in a contemplation of the doctrines. Whence both the doctrines and the laws are clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable to a common ſource.</p>
               <p>A legiſlature influenced by private motives, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt legiſlative ſanctions, and debaſe conſtitutional barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Thoſe who invent wrongs for their own uſe, will alſo invent doctrines to ſupport thoſe wrongs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:027782_0066_0FD640093B0A97F0"/>
Combining the doctrine and laws, they engender a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect claim by the legiſlature, of a power to uſurp upon the rights of the nation, Provided, the depredation is ſold or given to an individual or a corporation. It is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which proſtrates every conſtitutional fence, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or capable of being deviſed for the preſervation of liberty and property, at the feet of a legiſlature. They may parcel out public property and public rights, which are the only wares they deal in, until none worth having remain. They may endow an ariſtocracy at the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expence, and if the inviolability of legiſlative faith is to obviate a reclamation, then the ariſtocracy is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. Congreſs may even diſtribute among their baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards the revenues of cities, countries or ſtates in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, through the medium of paper, banks, coals, or any neceſſary of life; and an example for it is to be found in a ſyſtem, which is obviouſly the polar ſtar of the politics of government. Nay they may divide the fruit of the national labour among themſelves, not for twenty years only, but for ever. The limitation of the bank tax was merely arbitrary; and if the inviolability of legiſlative faith, is to ſanction the contrivance for twenty years, a precedent exiſts for conveying the whole national ability to a ſingle corporation, in tail ſucceſſional, for all eternity.</p>
               <p>This legal immutability, ſuppoſes conſtitutional mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability. Congreſs are mounted by it to a pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over a national convention. It goes to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>legal</hi> wrongs, beyond a revolution itſelf. It is an aſſumption of a power, not actually poſſeſſed by any exiſting generation of mankind, and which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf could not beſtow even on a general conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It renders conſtitutional rights <hi>violable,</hi> by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that legal rights are <hi>inviolable;</hi> thus in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repealing political goſpel, by form of law. And is indeed a doctrine ſo replete with evil and abſurdity, as to have been avowed but ſeldom, ſince the times of the Medes and Perſians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:027782_0067_0FD6400AB6359810"/>
But the Medes and Perſians were more conſiſtent than Congreſs. Immutability was a concomitant of their laws univerſally. Whereas with us the whole doctrine is monopoliſed by thoſe, who can ſtrip the nation of its wealth or rights by form of law. Laws of this kind are called deeds, and the ſign, ſeal and deliver of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, cloſes the conveyance for ever. As if all laws did not in ſome way affect private perſons. As if to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the nation <hi>individually,</hi> they muſt be plundered <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively.</hi> As if it was a conſolation to a man, whom you are about to deſtroy on one ſcore, to declare him ſafe as to another.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution empowers, Congreſs to make laws, not to make deeds. Mutability is attached to legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Otherwiſe each ſucceſſive Congreſs would have its power narrowed by the preceding, though derived from the ſame ſource, and held by the ſame tenure. To keep faith to the bank law, we muſt be guilty of a breach of faith to the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>To return more immediately to the ſubject. The conſtitution in the fifth article, recognizes the ſtate le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures, as ſtate conventions, and Congreſs as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral convention. Congreſs, united with two thirds of the ſtate legiſlatures, may alter the conſtitution. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated, as they are in this important inſtance, as the organs of the people, can it be improper for them to make known the public will, or to reconſider emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the conſtitution, of which they are ultimately to judge? The power of forcing Congreſs, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of two thirds, immeaſurably tranſcends a mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.</p>
               <p>A genuine, impartial, unadulterated legiſlature, would fairly conſider, and impartially determine queſtions of a national magnitude, exceeded by none. Therefore, the remedies preſenting themſelves are;</p>

               <p>National wealth, and national rights, tottering on the brink of perdition, irreſiſtibly ſolicited our firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and all poſſible haſte was made to exhibit their danger, without diſtracting the public attention, by compelling it to view the Proteus in too great a variety of ſhapes.</p>
               <p>This important duty being diſcharged, it may not be amiſs to continue our enquiries concerning the public or private morality of this inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The bank may buy and ſell lands including their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to the amount of 15,000,000 of dollars. But if they exceed their capital, who is to know it? They are not to diſcloſe the extent of their landed eſtate, even to the miniſter; and no power, can require ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of them. If an exceſs is diſcovered, and could be proved, which is almoſt impoſſible, no penalty is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined or forfeiture incurred; and the effect of ſuch a diſcovery would have been eaſily fruſtrated, had a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture followed it, by a fraudulent exerciſe of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027782_0069_0FD64010C13F7D10"/>
to ſell. In this view the bank law is a ſtatute of mortmain, and the lands of the community may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſwallowed up by a corporation, which does not propoſe in exchange for them, either political or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation. Perpetuities of landed eſtates, devolving by ſucceſſion, are eſtabliſhed, to the diſcouragement of commerce and induſtry; to the impoveriſhment of the laity; and to the aggrandiſement of the bank mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant miniſtry. It is an incorporated feudal tenure, and the community is ſubjected to homage and fealty, for their circulating medium, as well as their lands.</p>
               <p>The bank dividends are not to be coextenſive with the real profits, but are to be regulated by the directors. Hence the extent of the impoſition is concealed from the public. The community loſe the chance of having all they pay thrown back into circulation, by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance or luxury of individuals. An <hi>accumulating</hi> fund, which may make the corporation richer than the nation, and of courſe more powerful, is a branch of the ſcheme. It may conſtantly retain, what the nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſupplies. Thus the amuſements of mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in calculating the effects of compound intereſt, are to be realized at the national expence; and a fund is ſecured for extending the mortmain buſineſs, or with which to buy a new charter at the end of twenty years by public or private negociations, if the bank ſhould not then have members enough in Congreſs to give it to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The body corporate can either extend or diminiſh its profits. This is a kind of laſh capable of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to their refractory bodies natural, either in or out of Congreſs, to whip them in, to the incorporated mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The ſupremacy of the body politic over its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is by this means effectually eſtabliſhed, and a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted impetus ſecured to it. In this part of the ſcheme is alſo to be diſcerned an unneceſſary precaution, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has evinced, in caſe things ſhould go badly. In this event, the corporation by its directors, had nothing to do, but to declare an exorbitant dividend, and then
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027782_0070_0FD640122F20FCB8"/>
to ſell out individually to the unwary, the bank ſtock, thus enhanced in price.</p>
               <p>The debts are not to exceed 10,000,000 of dollars, <hi>over and above the money depoſited in the bank for ſafe-keeping,</hi> and over and above 5,000,000 <hi>worth</hi> of lands. Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as it is to aſcertain what may be the ſtock, property and debts of the bank by law, yet no penalty exiſts for enforcing obedience to the law, except that if the bank incurs debts beyond 10,000,000, they ſhall actually pay them. The profit of the bank ariſes out of paper, money, or debts, bearing no intereſt. Where is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of paying £100, and receiving £106 for ſo doing? The traffic of the bank is under no limitation, but the national ability to bear it. The partial power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, conferred upon a member of the coalition, by way of national ſecurity, might have been exemplified by a common proverb, except for the indelicacy of the terms.</p>
               <p>Why does the law hold out an idea of limiting the acquiſitions of the bank? If they are honeſt, to limit them was unjuſt; if diſhoneſt, it ſhould acquire nothing. If the gain came from abroad, it was reſtraining a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional good; but if the reſtraint admits that it was to come out of the nation, it is a tax when not a penny was due, and not a penny of public money could Congreſs beſtow, in liberality to the rich. If the gain was not like to be ſo enormous, as to endanger the <hi>common-wealth,</hi> it required no limitation, If it was, why erect a miſchief in order to reſtrain it—why extend it ſo enormouſly—or why reſtrain it with fetters of ſand? This pretence of a limitation tells a tale. It confeſſes that the gain is enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous—that it is paid at the public expence—and that the contrivance contains ſome lurking miſchief.</p>
               <p>But the law provides that the bank may lend to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to any amount. Its acquiſitions in this mode are rendered indefinite, if any definition could before have been diſcerned. And here the contrivance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027782_0071_0FD64013BB8872B0"/>
its views, exhibits an unlimited ſcope of deſigns, and contemplates a direct operation on government it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Bank people in Congreſs, may in this caſe, vote that government ſhould make unneceſſary loans of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the purpoſes of extending their capital—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their profits—and acquiring an influence. The eagerneſs to put this part of the ſyſtem into a train, hath already explained its objects. Two millions four hundred thouſand dollars have been already borrowed by government of the bank upon intereſt, and a further loan of 800,000 dollars was ſanctioned at the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, although above 1,300,000 dollars of public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was at that time lying dead in ſundry banks. By a ſimilar trick, the bank of England has indiſſolubly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected itſelf with that government, and a <hi>perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal</hi> of its charter is inſured. Although its dividends have never been lower than five and an half <hi>per centum,</hi> it hath alſo gotten more than <hi>cent. per cent.</hi> on its capital in a government debt. Great as this property is, it is far outſtripped by the American bank, as will preſently be ſhown. In that country, an enormous profit, and an undue legiſlative influence, have flowed from the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. In this, the uſe of ſimilar means, clearly indicates an intention to attain ſimilar ends. With this difference, that our inſtitution exceeds enormity itſelf.</p>
               <p>The twenty five bank directors may be paid by the corporation much or little as they chooſe; and whether paid or not, the whole of them may be taken out of the Senate, which conſiſts of thirty members. Even the preſident of the United States may be choſen, and act as a bank director. In what part of the conſtitution is the flaw to be found, permiting infractions of its own principles, ſo egregious? If bank directors ſerve the bank without wages, whilſt they demand wages of the nation, their affection for or intereſt in the one, muſt be greater that their affection for, or intereſt in, the other. And if wages are their object, they will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to their earnings. Something beyond, "Well
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027782_0072_0FD6401A1228AA98"/>
done thoſe good and faithful ſervants," will be expected for doubling the talents.</p>
               <p>The intimation that the profits of the bank are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, deſerves an expoſition by items. Premiſing, that a perſon out of the ſecret, is confined to ſuch items only, as are of public notoriety, ſo that thoſe of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate nature, will remain uncalculated.</p>
               <p>Three fourths of the bank depoſit, are to conſiſt of certificates, and one fourth of ſpecie. Suppoſe £100 thus depoſited. The dividend at the end of the year was was eight <hi>per centum.</hi> The £75 of certificates were gaining an intereſt of ſix <hi>per cent per annum,</hi> ſo that the whole profit is made out of the £25 ſpecie, which is all the perſon making the depoſit loſes the uſe of. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſum the profit in one year is above <hi>thirty per centum.</hi> But the bank began to operate when only one fourth of the ſtock ſubſcribed was depoſited, four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalments of ſix months each being allowed, and yet the dividends have been made upon the total ſtock ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Hence only £12 10 0. actual caſh for each £100 ſtock, was depoſited during the whole of the firſt year, and this received and uſance of £8, as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the directors, excluſive of the gain in lands, debts, ſpeculations, and loans for the incorporated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. Are not the talents doubled? and may not the bank exclaim, "Well done thou good and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?"</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>ſix per centum</hi> upon certificates, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a portion of the total gain, made by the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet there was gain enough to conſtitute the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends, excluſive of this <hi>ſix per centum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would hardly be aſſerted, that the profit of a bank, favoured of government, would be only <hi>two per centum,</hi> ſuppoſing the ſtock to have conſiſted of ſpecie, ſo as not to get an intereſt, both by circulating paper on its cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and alſo as a debt due by government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:027782_0073_0FD6401C16955388"/>
But the fact ſhould not reſt upon a ſuppoſition which can be denied.</p>
               <p>Excluſive of the dividends, and all other gains, the bank had already lent to government on the firſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1793, 2,400,000 dollars, for which it was then receiving intereſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore the profits, ſupplying not only this loan, but alſo the dividends, it follows obviouſly, that the intereſt upon the certificates was more than doubled at the national expence; and conſequently that the 7,500,000 dollars of public debt depoſited, was inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly conjured up by what is called financiering ſkill and federation, to between fifteen and thirty millions.</p>
               <p>The preciſe amount cannot be aſcertained, becauſe both the item of lands acquired, and that important ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of private debts due to the bank, are left out of the calculation; both being of a ſecret nature.</p>
               <p>As the republic did not depoſit her two millions of ſtock, all the ſpecie of the whole bank ſubſcription, ſuppoſing every ſhilling paid, amounted to 2,000,000 of dollars; and out of it the directors have not only made a dividend of <hi>eight per centum</hi> on 10,000,000 which is a gain of 800,000 dollars <hi>per annum,</hi> but have alſo lent the government 2,400,000 dollars. The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents are trebled in two years. It is not ſaid, that the bank had ſold its certificates previous to January 1793.</p>
               <p>The capital of the bank of England was £10,000,000 ſterling. It has only been able to lend to that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from its inſtitution, about £.12,000,000, and its dividends have long been as low as <hi>five and an half per centum.</hi> The ſpecie capital of the United States bank was only 2,000,000 of dollars, and in leſs than two years, it lent 2,400,000 to government, and divided <hi>eight per</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:027782_0074_0FD6401C1AA457D0"/>
                  <hi>centum</hi> on 10,000,000. How far, arithmeticians, does the copy outſtrip the original?</p>
               <p>Did or did not the bank lend to the public 2,000,000 in actual ſpecie, to depoſit for the public ſtock. If it did, ignorant as we are of the other items of profit, its enormity is ſufficiently evinced. If it did not, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public was defrauded in a variety of ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Had actual caſh been borrowed elſewhere and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, the bank might have extended its buſineſs, to the increaſe of the profits, of which the public would have received a fifth part; whereas 60,000 dollars are now annually paid for no advantage, four-fifths of which are divided among the private ſubſcribers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The credit of the bank reſts upon the credit of the republic, as to 7,500,000 dollars of certificate ſtock, and whilſt individuals are depoſiting the credit of the republic for three-fourths of their ſubſcriptions, the republic is prohibited from depoſiting her own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, for any proportion of hers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further, although the credit of the bank reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of the government, yet the government is made to borrow 2,000,000 of bank credit, which itſelf erected, ſuſtains and can annihilate, and for theſe nothings, to pay annually 60,000 ſomethings. When this is done upon an aſſertion, "that the credit of the bank is neceſſary to ſupport the credit of the nation," preciſely the reverſe of the truth, may it not be pronounced, that there is verity in the charge, "that the public good is ſacrificed to this inſtitution."</p>
               <p n="4">4. But that which carries the impoſition to the moſt extravagant degree, is, that the public (if the bank did not lend actual caſh) pays intereſt for the <hi>credit</hi> of the bank, whilſt the bank pays none, for the <hi>money</hi> of the public. The ſecretary reported, that on the 1ſt of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027782_0075_0FD6401D72B9A438"/>
January 1793, 1,229,517 dollars 20 cents, of public money, in the bank of the United States, excluſive of 614,593 dollars 2 cents, which he reported to be due for bills drawn for foreign loans, negociated by that bank; and excluſive of 158,778 dollars 25 cents, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in other banks. And on that day the public was paying intereſt to the bank of the United States for 2,400,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>If the bank advanced this large ſum to the public in actual caſh, whilſt it was hourly lending to individuals alſo, it muſt either have been drained of its caſh, or its profits muſt have exceeded imagination; it is therefore probable, that it was diſcounting from the uſe of the 1,229,517 dollars 20 cents of public money, whilſt it was receiving intereſt of the public. If it lent only 2,000,000 of credit, and laid out the 2,000,000 of caſh which it ought to have lent in certificates, and depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the certificates as a fund upon which to circulate paper, what would be the annual gain upon the ſame 2,000,000? Anſwer. 60,000 dollars intereſt for the credit lent, 60,000 for the certificates bought, and 120,000 for 4,000,000 of paper circulated on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. Excluding the idea of certificates, <hi>eighteen per centum per annum</hi> is paid. The reſources of <hi>no body</hi> muſt be very great. I acknowledge that one fifth of theſe gains conſtitute an article of thoſe reſources.</p>
               <p>Let the fact be either way, the enormity of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is evinced by leſs than a moiety of the items. Suppoſe we had the reſt? It is not ſurpriſing, that the public, thought one fifth owners of the machine, are allowed no directors. For what would come of it, if the whole ſecret was known?</p>
               <p>And this is a contrivance for erecting <hi>"an active ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital."</hi> It is indeed an appoſite expreſſion. In <hi>activity</hi> it is a perpetual motion, collecting wealth for an ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, and impoveriſhing all other claſſes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. How does the filching annually an enormous
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027782_0076_0FD6401F64D7B788"/>
ſum from their capitals, to conſtitute annual dividends for a few rich individuals, and to erect an incorporated monſter, ſecretly and conſtantly ingulphing real proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and national reſources, in the abyſs of perpetuity, favour agriculture, commerce or manufactures?</p>
               <p>It would be better for the community, if ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions were thrown into the ſea. Though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty would be loſt, liberty would be preſerved. Now its wealth foſters its natural enemy, whilſt the general welfare is impoveriſhed, and the common ſtrength, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled. The ſinew of defence is transfering to thoſe, from whom we have moſt cauſe to fear offence. And the duſt of a few new terms, interſperſed with the jargon of a ſyſtem, whoſe principle is perplexity, and whoſe deſign is treachery, is expected to hide from the public view, the ambuſcade which lurks behind.</p>
               <p>The bank having the monopoly of the bulk of the circulating medium, may occaſionally increaſe or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the quantity. It may diminiſh the quantity, thus enhance its value, and purchaſe with its own paper, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates or other property, which are depreciated, in the ſame proportion, as the medium is appretiated. It may then increaſe the quantity of this circulating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, leſſen its value, appretiate certificates or other property of courſe, and then ſell a <hi>portion</hi> of the ſame certificates or other property, to take in the paper which the <hi>whole</hi> coſt. If the law prohibiting this incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted traffic in <hi>certificates,</hi> could even diſcover the fact, yet the traffic would ſtill have open to it, the endleſs liſt of whatever is valuable. And the individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not even nominally reſtrained.</p>
               <p>This is a compleat commercial deſpotiſm. Every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant is ſecured beyond the reach of government, and yet the bank can ruin almoſt any merchant, without even a power in government to ſave him. A reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble claſs of citizens, are thus cajoled by a few of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027782_0077_0FD64022D62EA660"/>
who enjoy ſome excluſive fruits from the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, into an approbation of the moſt unreſtrained ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of indirect and ſecret power over their property; whilſt the ſame men would ſpurn at the ſame thing, if exhibited in a ſimple incorporated ſociety, for enriching or impoveriſhing, <hi>whomſoever it might pleaſe the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> Honeſty, induſtry, and punctuality, are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a ſecurity for ſucceſs. Profit is to be made by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior cunning and intrigue in finding out bank ſecrets. The profits of trade will no longer be an honourable compenſation, for ſupplying the mutual wants of diſtant nations. They will conſiſt chiefly of mean pilferings from our next neighbours. The reputable and uſeful ſociety of merchants, will dwindle into a diſhoneſt aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of ſpeculators, for <hi>tricking</hi> each other, as well as the whole community, of their money, by a trade in ideas.</p>
               <p>The circulating medium is the ſoul and food of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. A corporation, poſſeſſing a power over the ſoul, can animate, or annihilate the body at pleaſure. By with-holding its food, they may ſtarve commerce; by glutting it, they may produce a mercantile pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. A foreknowledge of theſe effects, is an unlimited power of taxation. In a civilized ſociety, the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting medium, is alſo the ſoul of agriculture, arts and manufactures. All the faculties of the nation are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the regimen of an incorporated quackery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of purſuing a natural impulſe, in ſearch of their own ſubſiſtence. If the phyſician was honeſt, yet an artificial regimen in a ſtate of health, produces debility, and haſtens diſſolution; but when his fees depend on the irregularity of his preſcriptions, and when he is a mere Hiccius Doccius of a fellow, he will ſoon deſtroy the ſoundeſt conſtitution.</p>
               <p>A monopoly of the circulating medium, is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal power of embargo, over trade, agriculture, and manufactures, depoſited in the hands of a few private
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027782_0078_0FD640256521DFE8"/>
citizens. In what place does the conſtitution contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate ſuch a power, and if the place can be found, why does it ſo cautiouſly deviſe checks reſtraining go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment within certain limits, whilſt this power, ſo greatly tranſcending any right devolved upon govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf, is left uncontrolled?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a monopoly of gold was beſtowed on one corporation—of ſilver on another—of the Engliſh and French trades on others; proceeding to parcel out all the branches of trade, agriculture, arts, and almoſt ſciences, among ſo many ſimilar miniſterial contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. It might enrich the members of the ſeveral corporations, but the public would exclaim, trade is ruined—the national happineſs is deſtroyed. And yet ſuch a ſyſtem would be more juſt than the bank contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, in being more general—in producing ſome little competition—and in being leſs an engine of political deſigns and legiſlative corruption. The monopoly of the circulating medium involves a monopoly of all theſe objects. The bank has a fluſh of trumps, with palm, the knave, at their head, which loos the reſt of the community; and if it does not ſeize the whole ſtake at one graſp, it is on account of the obvious impolicy of deſtroying the hen which lays the golden eggs.</p>
               <p>The little ſpecie left by the ſyſtem in circulation, is only a kind of ſmall change, or a ſort of permiſſive bank alms, as it pays them no tax, and is too inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in its amount, to impugn a ſingle important ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, flowing from the monopoly of the circulating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</p>
               <p>The calamities of the laſt war, reſulting from the baniſhment of ſpecie by a paper medium, were proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly equivalent to thoſe produced by the ſword. The banking contrivances are rapidly reducing us again, to the ſame ruinous and miſerable ſituation.</p>

               <head>SECTION XIV.—THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</head>
               <p>THE tax paid to the bank as inevitably falls upon labour ultimately, as the impoſt does; nor has labour in either caſe the ſmalleſt chance of exerting any degree of volition; it can only exert its induſtry, to pay a debt impoſed upon it by law, which it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily diſcharge.</p>
               <p>The whole groſs value of the exports from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, for twelve months previous to October 179<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, was 17,371,551 dollars. This was the product of labour, excluſive of its food. And out of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount muſt be deducted the freight, commiſſions, clothing, tools, liquors, and other neceſſaries, which it muſt pay for. Conjecture that an annual profit is made by labour beyond its annual needs, even of 8,000,000. One days profit requires four day's work. Taking theſe data, and narrowing the profit of the bank down to its ſimple annual dividend, labour muſt toil at leaſt forty-nine days in each year to raiſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend of the bank of the United States, amounting to 800,000 dollars. And if the profits of all the banks amount to 2,000,000 annually, labour muſt toil ninety-one days every year to pay them. Recollect that the preſent annual expenditure of the nation, intereſt, and the expences of government included, exceeds 5,000,000 of dollars, and then conſider the preſent ſtate of labour. Suppoſe a law was propoſed, a neceſſary effect of which would be, that a few rich men ſhould work ninety-one days in the year for the reſt of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                  </gap> finitely contracted. But the principle would remain unchanged, though the caſe would be altered greatly for the better. If the profit made by labour extended even to 10,000,000 annually, the bank of the United States would be receiving <hi>eight per centum</hi> annually, in its dividends only, out of this profit. And if the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027782_0080_0FD64028AD8A6AB0"/>
of this, and the other banks, extend to 17,371,551 dollars, and their dividends amount to <hi>eight per centum</hi> upon an average, then labour pays that enormous inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to banks, upon the <hi>groſs</hi> amount of her exports. But if we add to the dividends, every other item of profit, and allow the community a maintenance, it is within bounds to conjecture, that <hi>forty per centum</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her nett profit, is annually paid by the community to the ſeveral banks.</p>
               <p>And what compenſation do the banks make to the community for thoſe enormous gains and excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges? Have they made a buſhel of wheat or a horn tooth comb? Actual ſpecie is but a repreſentative of real wealth. But it is equivalent thereto, becauſe it can transfer real wealth to us from a foreign nation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as bank paper can neither increaſe our exports, or pay for our imports, ſince its currency is local. The bank is therefore an incorporation of ſinecures, quartered upon labour, and may be juſtly ſtiled, the Iriſh eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of America.</p>
               <p>Debt is ſervice or labour, and ſervice or labour is ſlavery. And ſo is ſlavery defined in the fourth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſtitution. For money being the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of labour, and the only medium by which debt can be paid, the creditor is in fact the maſter of the debtor, for the quantum of ſervice or labour, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſcharge that debt. If ſo, the United States are by the bank contrivances, placed preciſely in the ſituation of a ſlave, who has purchaſed of his maſter about four day's freedom in each week; becauſe for more than one day in each week, they owe ſervice to the bank of the United States, and for about two days, to the ſeveral banks now operating. How improperly then do we ſpeak? Inſtead of ſaying, "the bank of the United States," it would be more proper to ſay, "the United States of the bank."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:027782_0081_0FD6402CDBB9EA68"/>
And the law enacts that we ſhall be the United States of the bank for twenty years. During ſo long a leaſe without impeachment of waſte, the tenant will either ruin the eſtate, or provide for the purchaſe in fee. If the <hi>product</hi> of the eſtate, and not its <hi>improvement,</hi> had not been the object, wherefore were other tenants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded? This wiſe excluſion of partners in ſpoiling the nation, evinces the truth of the line of argument I have adopted by diſcloſing the deſign of the contrivance.</p>
               <p>The law of primogeniture and firſt fruits is revived. The bank is the firſt born of legiſlation, with an intail for 20 years, and more than a chance for the reverſion in fee. Or it is rather an heir apparent, in poſſeſſion of the regency, on account of the parent's idiocy.</p>
               <p>A <hi>pretence</hi> of rendering ſome compenſation to the community, for its pre-eminent powers, and exorbitant acquiſitions, was neceſſary to lull enquiry into a coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe ſtate. And therefore it is alleged that the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enables merchants to extend commerce, to give better prices for commodities, and to encourage indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. And England is reſorted to, as an example pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe allegations.</p>
               <p>Merchants are brokers, honourable and uſeful, whilſt adhering to a ſteady line of commerce, and ſupplying the wants of a nation, but pernicious and dangerous, whilſt ſpeculating indiſcriminately on foes and friends for the acquiſition of wealth, and aſpiring to excluſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and prerogatives.</p>
               <p>They are of a claſs unproductive, and therefore if ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals are to be raiſed at the public expence, it would be more beneficial to commerce, to beſtow them on agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture or manufactures, which alone create the real fund for an extenſion of commerce, for the purpoſe of enabling them to make laſting and productive improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Taking from the productive claſs therefore, to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027782_0082_0FD64031168073C8"/>
beſtow upon the unproductive is inverting the courſe of nature, when an extenſion of commerce is the object.</p>
               <p>A reaction of theſe capitals as an incitement to indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, cannot be a <hi>permanent</hi> effect from a bank. The quantity of paper which can be circulated, is limited by the national ability to pay for it, and the employment it can find. Specie is liable to the latter limit only, and therefore more ſpecie than paper, can find employment in a nation, becauſe for ſpecie there is nothing to pay. If a member of the commercial world, poſſeſſes ſpecie ſufficient for its occaſions, and banks are eſtabliſhed which emit paper equal in amount to this ſpecie, the latter muſt depart for want of employment. If more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is emited, a momentary and unnatural ſpur may be given to induſtry, at the commencement of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it would be fleeting and tranſitory, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the true level of circulating medium has regulated itſelf, things at beſt, would ſubſide to their uſual courſe. But they will ſink lower, becauſe the community having exchanged ſpecie for paper, hath loſt a long ſtring of advantages poſſeſſed by the former over the latter; and becauſe worſted as it is in numberleſs ways by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, labour will moreover be burthened with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>ſix per centum</hi> on the amount of the circulating paper, whereas the national labour paid nothing for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. How compleatly is ſuch a community jockeyed?</p>
               <p>Again. <hi>Laſting improvements</hi> can never be produced by bank contrivances, on account of the rapidity with which bank paper, whilſt it is alive, is paſſed from hand to hand. Laſting and productive improvements in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and agriculture, require the uſe of a capital for ſeveral years, becauſe profit from labour flows in ſlowly. And ſuch capitals our banks never furniſh. The contrivance is only adapted for ſudden ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to favour a quick and rapid ſucceſſion of good bargains; and to enable the bank to gain compound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by renewing its paper three or four times a year.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027782_0083_0FD640326DE88488"/>
The medium for ſuch a traffic being local alſo, the gain reſulting from it muſt not only be filched from citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but inſtead of producing, it muſt obſtruct laſting improvements, and diſcourage, by impoveriſhing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. And merchants, from an honourable profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will be converted in a ſet of contemptible gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe two or three large ſtates, Maſſachuſetts and New-York, or Virginia and North Carolina, for inſtance, ſhould deſtroy banks, and inhibit the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all bank notes by making it felony; would not ſuch ſtates become a reſervoir for the ſpecie of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And would not the effects be ſo ſorely felt by the ſiſter ſtates, as ſoon to deſtroy the banking ſyſtems throughout the union? The United States, as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the commercial world, will ſpeedily occupy a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar pre-eminent ſtation, over ſiſter nations, by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing banks. For ſpecie will ever flow, where it can find employment.</p>
               <p>In lieu of this ſyſtem is ſubſtituted a corporation of rich men, poſſeſſing a power of expelling the only uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal medium of commerce, of ſubſtituting a local me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium in its ſtead, having a monopoly of this local medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and thus compleatly enabled to regulate the price of every ſpecies of produce. The lower this produce can be bought, the higher are their gains; becauſe thoſe who buy bank paper at a premium, cannot pay the premium, and muſt ceaſe to deal at the paper ſhop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can ſell it at a higher price than they gave. The bank ſells the commodity by wholeſale, and are paid a wholeſale profit. The dealers will then retail it, getting an advance upon the whole firſt coſt, and ſince the commodity will not do for tranſportation, the nation as the only conſumers, pay this double profit. Will the bank exert the power of regulating the price of labour, for the purpoſe of raiſing it; and is a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly a good ſubſtitute for a competition? Reflect. Can
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027782_0084_0FD64034BA76EF28"/>
the bank cauſe the price of produce or of paper, to fluctuate? What muſt be the effect of this power? and compare the price of wheat in 1789, when there was a partial and local ſcarcity in France, with the price of the ſame article in 1792, when a general European ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and warfare united to enhance it. Not forgetting that many of theſe contrivances, have been erected in the interim.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that the price of our exports abroad, and not the banking operations at home, can only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their value. Out of that price muſt be deducted, freight, profit and commiſſion; and to theſe deductions are ſuperadded the dividends and other profits of banks. Will deductions raiſe the price?</p>
               <p>Mercantile or ſpeculating people can only borrow of the bank, becauſe of its ſhort credit; and to lend to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo as to aid laſting improvements or encourage induſtry, is never a purpoſe of thoſe who deal in bank paper. In no ſtate does the legal intereſt for money exceed <hi>ſix per centum,</hi> and this intereſt muſt be paid to the bank; therefore no perſon will borrow of the bank to lend again, when he can gain nothing. In all ſtates, where the legal intereſt is ſtill lower, a loſs would obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enſue. As would alſo be the caſe, wherever that is the legal rate; becauſe the bank, by calling in loans ſeveral times a year, manages to gain more than <hi>ſix per centum per annum,</hi> which being a ſhift to evade, would not in a private caſe be tolerated by, a ſtatute of uſury. Therefore bank paper is a proper medium for <hi>ſudden ſtrokes</hi> at good bargains <hi>only.</hi> Theſe ſtrokes fall upon citizens <hi>only,</hi> and conſtitute a mode for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of induſtry, novel and incomprehenſible to thoſe who receive, but clear and conſpicuous to thoſe who inflict the ſtroke.</p>
               <p>Labour is burthened with a compound intereſt on this bank medium, under the pretences of encouraging induſtry, and furniſhing a capital for improvement,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:027782_0085_0FD64034C3D46C48"/>
which are obviouſly deceitful and fallacious. If labour had received the loans of the bank, and had thus eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the gain which it pays to thoſe who do, yet it muſt have paid the bank profits. The dividends are <hi>eight per centum,</hi> excluſive of other great acquiſitions before ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Can agriculture or manufactures afford to pay ſuch an intereſt for a capital? The returns made by laſting improvements, bear no ſimiltude to thoſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating rogueries. Who will lend for the purpoſe of encouraging induſtry, or to aid laſting improvements, at <hi>five per centum,</hi> when by inveſting his money in bank ſtock, he will certainly gain above <hi>eight per centum;</hi> Private loans are thus annihilated, and no ſubſtitute for the attainment of ſuch objects propoſed. A rate of bank profit, exceeding the rate of legal intereſt, muſt draw the national money to this vortex of impoſition.</p>
               <p>Banks are money brokers, receiving exorbitant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. A kind of treaſurers of the whole circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting medium, receiving <hi>annually</hi> of the nation, among whom it circulates, above <hi>ſix per centum</hi> on its amount. In leſs than ſeventeen years, they gain the intire total. Enough to ſupport at leaſt a ſeven years war, with 20,000 men conſtantly in the field. What an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idea? Suppoſe government and the bank ſhould coaleſce, and form a treaty with ſome foreign poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, to deſtroy what they have already united to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe? Are uſurpations more eaſily corrected in a ſtate of maturity, than at their commencement?</p>
               <p>It is pleaſant to obſerve the dilemma to which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are reduced by the contrivance. The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in terms framed from a conſideration of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs heretofore produced by paper mediums, ſtrives moſt carefully to interdict them in future. In <hi>dealing out power</hi> to Congreſs relative to a currency, it permits that body "to <hi>coin</hi> money;" and <hi>in reſtraining</hi> the power of the ſtates, it prohibits them from "<hi>coining</hi> money, <hi>emitting bills of credit, or</hi> making any thing a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027782_0086_0FD64036314CBA40"/>
tender but gold and ſilver." In not giving the power of eſtabliſhing a paper currency to the one, and in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it expreſly from the other, the conſtitution deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſecure the ſociety againſt the frauds and vices of paper tricks. That circulating paper medium of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind was intended to be inhibited, is obvious from the diſtinction, between ſuch a medium, and making <hi>any thing</hi> a tender. Both are ſeparately condemned; and the medium, though unaccompanied with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is expreſsly forbidden. The tender is indeed an aggravation of that which is miſchievous without the tender. The ſtates being reſtrained from eſtabliſhing a paper currency, could not empower a corporation to do it. They could not beſtow, what they did not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. But, alas! poor Congreſs! having broken the conſtitution themſelves, they are obliged to wink upon its flagrant breach by moſt of the ſtates, which have, without any bad intention, followed their baneful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. With grief muſt Congreſs ſuffer their twenty years monopoly to be broken in upon, and ſnacks of the national plunder to fall to the ſhare of rival corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. It muſt however be confeſſed, that the conteſt is unequal, ſince the good things redounding from the public purſe, are excluſively enjoyed by the purſe bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Had the ſtates gone into the ſyſtem of their own head, and not as blind tranſcribers of the example ſet by the higher powers, we ſhould have heard clamourings, which could not now be uttered by a party of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</p>
               <p>Ignorant as we are of the effects of banking in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it is neceſſary to take ſome notice of an example quoted in favour of the contrivance. Bold aſſertions may be hazarded, when the proof is beyond our reach; and therefore the quotation. But if England may be likened unto a ſeigniory poſſeſſed of profitable eſtates, pouring into its lap their products in conſtant ſtreams of wealth—if the riches of the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies roll into her treaſury—if ſhe is the tax gatherer of Ireland
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027782_0087_0FD640366B171CD8"/>
and Scotland—if ſhe ſhares in the fiſheries—if ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unrivalled in manufactures and unequalled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce—if her labouring claſs of citizens are induſtrious and her ſoil exuberant, why is her proſperity (if ſhe is proſperous) attributed to her banking contrivances. Whilſt a glare of imaginary proſperity is painted by terms, the offsprings of invention, to tempt the nation, a productive cauſe equally falſe is credited for it, to miſlead us. If effects, bearing a faint reſemblance, to the high colourings in which they are depicted, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, they are accounted for by an unſeen ſpeculating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, without reſorting to a ſingle obvious cauſe.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, ſuppoſe we were to conſider the poor rates, and the rate of luxury in England, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors of banking ſchemes. Redundant wealth and pinching want, would turn out to be the effects in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling out the neceſſaries of life; and tyranny and ſlavery the diviſion they make, of what they term, "civil rights." Nothing could have deprived the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh (the nation not the court) of enjoying diffuſively their excluſive advantages, but a ſyſtem conſtantly pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging from labour, to aggrandize wealth. Unleſs, therefore, America is languiſhing for a peaſantry, wretchedly poor, and an ariſtocracy luxuriouſly rich and arrogantly proud, this Engliſh precedent has been unfortunately adduced, and more unfortunately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
               <p>But to conſider how the bank will affect liberty at its extremities, when it hath ſtruck at its heart, by corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the legiſlature itſelf, is really ſuperfluous. It is therefore time to diſmiſs the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Subjoining, that the public wealth is pillaged to the extent of the national ability, and that no food for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation remains, except the public territory.</p>
               <p>If thoſe who have pledged this territory for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the debt, by <hi>legiſlative faith,</hi> ſhould now
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027782_0088_0FD624E21ED97218"/>
pervert the arms and treaties of the nation, to the breaking of this faith, for the purpoſe of acquiring principalities out of the national territory for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves—If thoſe who call themſelves federal, ſhould league with Indians and foreigners, to remove the land marks of union, and to revoke a fundamental ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſecurity of independency itſelf, it would both explode their profeſſions, and prove the juſtneſs of my arguments.</p>

               <head>SECTION XV.—THE PRESENT STATE OF PARTIES CONSIDERED.</head>
               <p>FROM a colliſion of parties truth flaſhes forth, and the community is the great arbiter between them. Parties are counſel on oppoſite ſides, capable, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reaſoning, of enlightening, or by buffoonery, ſophiſms and perplexity, of inſulting the judge. A ſong in the place of an explanation, or farcical newſpaper ebullitions, inſtead of definitions and illuſtrations, muſt awaken the idea of a merry Andrew, entertaining a mob by his tricks and grimace, whilſt his accomplices are picking their pockets.</p>
               <p>A party however muſt ſignify, a confederation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals for the private and excluſive benefit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not for the public good. If then the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this confederation is in conflict with the public good, thoſe who oppoſe it, deſerve rather the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of "a band of patriots," than the epithet of "a party," they are not contending for the benefit of a part, but of the whole community.</p>
               <p>It is of importance to the community to diſcern, what intereſt falls within this definition of a party, and what line of politics, as excluded by it, is intitled to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:027782_0089_0FD6403AD308ECC0"/>
And firſt let us find out the deſign of thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of the meaſures of adminiſtration. Are they in ſearch of loaves and fiſhes? If ſo, let the community demand, what thoſe loaves are? The poſſeſſors of them can beſt tell. <hi>Legal ſalaries</hi> of office are too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to conſtitute an object for avarice, or to be a fund for thoſe enormous acquiſitions, which have not eſcaped the eye of America. Is the favour of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration lucrative, or in any mode beneficial? Tell us, in what way, and to what extent, ye who know, that we may diſcern the undue ſelfiſh influence, operating upon thoſe who complain of its meaſures.</p>
               <p>If the government is already a government of loaves and fiſhes, then the neceſſity of an immediate reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is admitted, becauſe time ſanctifies abuſes; if not, the motives which actuate thoſe who are ſtriving to prevent its becoming ſo, muſt be pure and patriotic.</p>
               <p>The bank, 'tis aſſerted, is unconſtitutional—that it is a burthenſome and fraudulent tax—that it impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes all claſſes of the community, except a ſelected few—that it ſubverts the principles of repreſentation—and that with other meaſures of adminiſtration, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds unerringly and infallibly to ariſtocracy and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Now what <hi>excluſive</hi> intereſt can a party, ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern or northern, compounded of States or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, have in defeating ſuch deſigns? There is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in diſcerning an intereſt of <hi>immenſe magnitude,</hi> and of an <hi>excluſive nature,</hi> reſiding in a party, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a contrivance, of ſo gainful a nature.</p>
               <p>Can a majority of the people of a ſingle ſtate, Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts for inſtance, be intereſted in the ſupport of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for amaſſing wealth in a few hands, and levelled at the fundamental principles of civil liberty?</p>
               <p>The agricultural, profeſſional, and mechanical inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the community, at whatever point of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027782_0090_0FD6403C8AE598B8"/>
they reſide, are ſo obviouſly in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is neceſſary to diſcloſe the arts, by which they have been diſunited.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Public abuſes combine for mutual ſupport, and the greateſt will be ſelected as the patron of the reſt. Hence not only ſtock-holders themſelves, but public officers who wiſh for higher ſalaries—paper men and ſpeculators, who will gain by an increaſe of the public debt, and by the diſſipation of the finances—and all who languiſh after ariſtocracy and monarchy, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted under the auſpices of a chief. And hence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and vociferous cry, in favour of the meaſures of the adminiſtration. A liſt of ſtock and certificate holders would explain it, to be the voice of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and not of impartial approbation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A party will receive with open arms recruits of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very character. Among others the old tories are moſt cordially enliſted. They naturally fall to thoſe, who are gaining by intrigue, what they fought for in vain. They are gratifying their paſſions without any expence to their principles. A victory, after a defeat, is the more pleaſing, as being a retalliation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this moſt worſhipful ſociety, an endeavour is made to aſſociate the Preſident. The aſſociates aſſume the character of being the ſupporters, of that which they are undermining, becauſe they know his attatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the conſtitution and good government. By geting poſſeſſion of the fortreſs, whilſt the commandant is unſuſpicious of the fraud, it will be more eaſy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it to an enemy, or ſieze it for themſelves. They ſtile themſelves "federaliſts," though it is obvious that they diſregard the conſtitution, in its principles, as well as letter. The artifice is ſtale; the Neros and Caligulas of Rome, were perpetually vociferating the terms "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public and republican," long after the government was deſpotic.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:027782_0091_0FD6403DE3469FD8"/>
4. Honeſt men, when deceived, are the beſt ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of knavery; hence the party, by a demarcation of fallacious intereſts, is ſtriving to convert that cordial union, which was founded in times of diſtreſs—ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by mutual ſufferings, and ſealed by compact, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt inveterate enmity. And a concord of hearts, habits—and of intereſt, which really exiſts between the great bulk of the citizens of every ſtate, is the devoted victim of machinations, deſigned to enrich and aggrandize a few. The ariſtocratical intereſt is a kind of flying ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, whoſe object it is to divide the great maſs of the people, by a geographical line, and to cajole one diviſion, that it may live at free quarter on the labour of both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The party boaſt of the preſent flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our country, and aſcribe it to their own politics. Honeſty though devoid of modeſty, would have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that peace, induſtry, and an increaſed population, rather than paper contrivances, were the real grounds of national proſperity. Cauſes, which in many Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean countries, have ſo far ſurmounted political oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as to exhibit a high degree of agricultural and mechanical improvement. But by adducing an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a parallel between the preſent times, and times of war, it is confeſſed, that a ſufficient degree of ſimilitude exiſts to bear a compariſon. It is admitted, that the community which is warring againſt monarchy and ariſtocracy, armed with paper only, does indeed occupy a ſituation, preferable to a neceſſity of fighting againſt the ſame enemies, armed with the inſtruments of death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The party call themſelves the government, and then demand of the public a confidence in the magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Had they demanded a critical inveſtigation of their conduct, it would have been a better proof of integrity. But faith, and not truth, is their political motto. King craft, like religions eſtabliſhed by law, ſubſtitutes my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the place of knowledge. It depends, not upon an enlightened conviction, but upon a blind idolatry.

Confidence or faith, is moſt clamourouſly inſiſted on, when it is leaſt merited. <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> and not confidence, is inculcated by the conſtitution. But if an uninformed faith is ſtill demanded, let us know with preciſſion, how far it is to go—how many arguments it ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute—how many proofs it can ſmother—and how much miſchief it can juſtify. And the blindeſt faith may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps diſcover, that it is already time to open its eyes and look about.</p>
               <p n="7">7. An unnatural alliance between ſtock and certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate holders has been effected; unnatural ſo far excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as certificates are depoſited as bank ſtock. By this means a real debt is interwoven with an artificial debt. A conſtitutional demand is linked in brotherhood, with an unconſtitutional contrivance. A juſt claim upon the public ability is rendered precarious, by burthening that ability with an unjuſt and exorbitant tax. Real credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are decoyed into a belief, that the beſt means of ſecuring themſelves, is to impoſe on their debtor a debt to a vaſt amount, founded upon fiction, but yet ſecured by a mortgage in the nature of a rent charge for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. Thoſe who have the ſecurity of the preſent conſtitution, are ſeduced into meaſures, ſubverſive of conſtitutional ſanctions, and if they ſucceed, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their own ſecurity. In ſhort, a combination with a party, whoſe exiſtence is precarious, hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to an union with the whole community, whoſe will is law.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is even pretended, that the community do not feel their taxes; and inferred, that not feeling they do not pay them. A ſtate of political apathy is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to liberty. If the community can only judge by their feelings, it is better to bring them to their ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, through the medium of their underſtandings, than to leave them in ſuch a ſtate of ſtupefaction, until their natural, as well as their political arteries, are pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the goads of deſpotiſm. And if they are inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the impoſt, becauſe it operates only on conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

of imported articles; yet they will certainly feel the bank tax, which is moreover an exciſe upon labour in every article it produces.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A great merit is claimed by the ariſtocracy, on account of their being addicted to an, "energetic go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment." What latitude is concealed under this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expreſſion, cannot be diſcovered. Judging by the extent to which they have already puſhed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, we may fairly conſtrue it thus; "a power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs diſcontent and commotion, excited by oppreſſion, and to ſuſtain the oppreſſion." For when did a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment want energy to do juſtice, in times of peace and proſperity? "Submit quietly and peaceably to to the bleſſings of an energetic government," is the language of the king of Pruſſia, whilſt he is marching an army into Poland, for the purpoſes of plunder and deſpotiſm.</p>
               <p>When theſe arts are exploded, thoſe who by intrigue and deception, have really formed themſelves into a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful party, will turn out by right and nature, to be a mere junto, operating upon a whole ſociety, for their own ſelfiſh purpoſes. And however their leader, like a young prince, may be flattered with the tongue of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt into a good opinion of himſelf; and though his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants may at firſt paſs him upon the world for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious parts and aſtoniſhing integrity; yet manhood in the one, and the effects of the other's policy, will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unmaſk the deception, and exhibit them as prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of another ſort.</p>
               <p>Raiſing up an ariſtocracy, and ſevering the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into the two orders of nobles and people, is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a faction to teize and torment the public mind, by perpetual tricks and artifices, for appropriating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the purſe and power of the nation. This ſcheme has operated, and is yet operating. The wealth alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy amaſſed by ſpecious frauds, hath produced viſibly its
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:027782_0094_0FD640447A302DE0"/>
natural effects, by corrupting thoſe principles of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and republicaniſm, which are the only pledge of public liberty and private happineſs.</p>
               <p>What can the people of any ſtate gain by ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and paper repreſentatives? Decency and cunning in government, is the utmoſt poſſible acquiſition. Will a ſoul be ſo fooliſh, as to truſt in a band and ſurplice for ſalvation, or a body ſo inſane, as to rely for health in a full-bottomed wig? And will a ſoul, a body, or a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be conſoled by the reflection, that it is deſtroyed <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum artem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what can the author gain by ſucceſs? If he is poor, what is his object? If rich, what influences him? If he is an officer of government, will he gain prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If not, does he propoſe to erect an office for himſelf? Does he favour national profuſion? Or is eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy the language of public rapacity? Will deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm contend for liberty, and <hi>legal</hi> equality? Do his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments inliſt him with a party, ſtruggling for <hi>excluſive</hi> gains; or is he telling a ſalvation of which he can only participate with the community in general? Is he not labouring to defend the conſtitution againſt the moſt fatal attacks, and are not the remedies propoſed of a general, and not a local nature? Whilſt he deplores his want of ability and information, equal to a taſk, which no one elſe hath undertaken, and ſolicits a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his errors, he boldly aſſerts, that he is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by no unchaſte deſign, and that he has written in the ſpirit of truth.</p>
               <p>An adminiſtration without a maxim, would be like a ſhip without a rudder. From the effects of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, and not from its profeſſions, is this governing maxim to be collected. Of the following maxims ſelect the moſt appoſite. <q>Honeſty is the beſt policy? Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and knowledge preſerve liberty. Divide and conquer. A public debt is a public bleſſing.</q>

The model of Nebuchadnezzar's image ſeems to be the idol of adminiſtration; but although the head was of gold, and the feet of clay, let it be remembered, that the clay contained a mixture of iron, and that one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cataſtrophe humbled the gold itſelf to the duſt.</p>
               <p>The natural intereſts, and the honeſt politics of the nation will unite, and prevent the erection of an image, which all muſt fall down and worſhip. The attempt to ſet it up, violates the conſtitution, and therefore fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſm will be ſtrenuous to defend its own work. And even antifederaliſm will join in the good cauſe, ſince the principles it profeſſes are alſo violated. The artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a party, foment a diſunion between them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to dupe and to uſe both.</p>
