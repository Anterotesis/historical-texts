            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>CHRIST our Lord, to whom every knee muſt bow, and every tongue confeſs, either in mercy or in judgment, came down from his father's glory, took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our nature and ſuffered death for us, to reſtore to us that firſt life of meekneſs, purity and love, that being dead to ſin, we ſhould live unto righteouſneſs. Leaving us an example, ſaith the Apoſtle, that we ſhould follow his ſteps. He poſitively enjoins us, to love our enemies, to bleſs them that curſe us; to do good to thoſe that hate us, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe us and perſecute us. A new command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you. The meek, the merciful and the pure in heart are by him pronounced to be the particular objects of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. Theſe are the watch words of Chriſtianity to all the true followers of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, War requires of its votaries that they kill, deſtroy, lay waſte, and to the utmoſt of their power diſtreſs and annoy, and in every way and manner deprive thoſe they eſteem their enemies of ſupport and comfort. Now reader, conſider the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; look at the ſuffering and diſtreſs which has, and continues to deſolate this once highly favoured land; numbers of human beings, equally with our ſelves the objects of redeeming grace, are daily hurried into eternity, many, its to be feared, in an unprepared ſtate; and if upon comparing the one with the other we feel compunction, if we are moved with compaſſion toward our fellow-men, let us cheriſh this ſenſation; it is a call from the God of Love, the beneficent father of mankind, whom the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates, under the appellation of love. God is Love—and he that dwelleth in God dwelleth in love and God in him.</p>

               <head>THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE of WAR, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>WAR, conſidered in itſelf, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated and determined deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of human beings, of creatures originally <hi>formed after the image of God,</hi> and whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, for that reaſon, is ſecured by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven itſelf within the ſence of this righteous law, that <hi>at the hand of every man's brother, the life of man ſhall be required.</hi> And though this created image of our holy God muſt be owned to have been ſo wretchedly defaced, as to retain but a very faint reſemblance of its divine original; yet as the higheſt enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that heavenly law, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for the ſecurity of life, it is moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly renewed by the incarnation of the ſon of God, and the indwelling of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle James, <hi>chap.</hi> 4th, hath anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the queſtion with reſpect to the cauſe of war, in ſo preciſe and determinate a manner as to preclude all difficulty and doubt about it; <hi>from whence comes wars and fighting amongſt you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>come they not hence, even of your

luſts, that war in your members: Ye kill and deſire to have, and cannot obtain: Ye fight and war, yet have not, becauſe ye aſk amiſs,</hi> becauſe ye have no reſpect to the will of <hi>the Lord that reigneth,</hi> but forſaking the <hi>Supreme Good</hi> in whom alone your happineſs conſiſts, ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an earthly and deceitful good and think only of procuring it by your power. James iv, 3. <hi>Ye aſk and receive not, becauſe ye aſk amiſs,</hi> from a ſuppoſed reſpect to <hi>the Lord that reigneth,</hi> but, too generally, for animal and ſenſual enjoyment, <hi>that ye may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> In this very explicit and true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, war, like all other evils, is deſcribed as centering in itſelf; and the end of it is declared to be gratification of thoſe very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and paſſions, from which it derives its birth; for in this unhappy circle, which is indeed the great circle of the hiſtory of man, the fatal miſchief proceeds. <hi>War is the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable union between the ſenſual and malignant paſſions; war protracted to a certain period, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily compels peace; peace revives and extends trade and commerce; trade and commerce give new life, vigour, and ſcope to the ſenſual and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant paſſions, and theſe naturally tend to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate another war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſorders of nature and of life are wholly the effects of ſin, of a voluntary aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and alienation from the life, light and love of God; in perfect union, with which perfect peace and happineſs are only to be found; hence that diſcordance of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

elements, which brings forth peſtilence, famine, earthquakes, ſtorms,,and tempeſts; hence, in the corporal part of the human frame, pain, ſickneſs, and death; in the mental, ſenſuality, pride, and malignity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the ſelfiſh and wrathful paſſions, that between individuals, engender envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, injury, reſentment, and revenge; and between nations, a peculiar kind of enmity and wrong, that iſſues in war. Surrounded with evil as men are, and full of evil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what would become of the whole wretched race, at any given inſtant of time, at this very moment for example, if the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that evil were not continually ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and directed by infinite power; ſo as to become continually ſubſervient to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of infinite wiſdom, righteouſneſs, and love.</p>
               <p>It would be needleſs to mention the nature of that univerſal redemption which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the goſpel; if in this age of levity we were not ſo apt to forget it. It is, in general, a full reſtoration of the life of God in the ſoul; the life of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which was once the life and perfection of fallen man, which the Son of God, the bruiſer of the ſerpent, has by his ſuffering, been reſtoring, to human nature from the time in which Adam fell.</p>
               <p>When the Son of God became incarnate, what was implied in this reſtoration as the effect of its influence upon man, was fully
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015737_0006_0F9A231CEED0AA38"/>
evident from our bleſſed Saviour's doctrine and his life; namely, the conqueſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the world, the death of the will, and of all the appetites and paſſions of fallen animal nature, through faith in his name—not an hiſtorical and ſpeculative faith, a mere rational aſſent to the truth of a well atteſted hiſtory of facts and doctrines; but a full, ardent, continual deſire of the <hi>life of Chriſt,</hi> as begotten and formed in the ſoul, by the continual operation of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus what was at firſt the perſonal duties of ſingle christians, when they were ſcattered over the face of the earth, and were only parts of different nations, became afterwards national duties, when whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons became chriſtians. If, therefore, <hi>to love our enemy, to forgive him, to do him good, and pray for him;</hi> it to <hi>overcome the world,</hi> whoſe power conſiſts in <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life,</hi> are chriſtian perſonal duties, if to <hi>love the Lord our God, with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, and with all our ſtrength, and our fellow-creatures as ourſelves,</hi> is the purity and perfection of the chriſtian perſonal life, the ſame muſt alſo be true of a chriſtian national duty; for a chriſtian nation differs no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from a chriſtian person, than as the whole differs from one of the parts of which it eſſentially conſiſts.</p>
               <p>It would be needleſs to propoſe this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the conſideration of experimental

chriſtians, who know with certainty, that human nature left to itſelf, has no power but that of producing mere evil, and that every thing within it and without it, that is either great or good, is the free gift of grace, the unmerited bounty of redeeming love. But the true chriſtian ſpirit being much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the earth, true chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as its inſeparable companion, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with it, and men ſeem to be gone back again to their old animal life; and tho' in ſpeculation and idea they proſeſs an aſſent to the truths of revelation, yet in heart and practice they are apt to conſider the courſe of all things as connected only with temporal good and evil, and themſelves as the center and circumference, the firſt cauſe, and the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That property is confounded, ſcattered, and deſtroyed; that laws are trampled under foot, government deſpiſed, and the ties of all civil and domeſtic order broken into pieces; that fruitful countries are made deſarts, and ſtately cities a heap of ruins, that matrons and virgins are violated; and neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of unoffending infancy, nor the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of decrepit age, afford protection from the rage and thirſt for blood; this is but the mortal progeny of this ſeeming womb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of miſchief; the worſt, even the dreadful effect it has upon the immortal ſoul, is ſtill behind; and tho' remote from thoſe ſenſes and paſſions that are exerciſed only by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good and evil, muſt yet, upon the leaſt recollection, impreſs with horror every mind that believes there is a righteous God, and a ſtate of retribution, that is to laſt forever. Under theſe conſiderations, what muſt the real chriſtian feel; he who is fully convinced that the fall of man, is a fall from meekneſs, purity, and love, into ſenſuality, pride, and wrath; that the Son of God became incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſuffered and died to reſtore that firſt life of meekneſs, purity, and love; and

that for theſe in whom the reſtoration of that life is not begun, in the preſent ſtate the Son of God incarnate, it is to be feared, ſuffered and died in vain. What muſt he feel for thoſe immortal ſpirits, who in the earlieſt dawn of their day of purification, are by hundreds and thouſands driven into eternity, in the bitterneſs of enmity and wrath—ſome inflamed with drunkenneſs, ſome fired with luſt; and all ſtained with blood? In thoſe direful conflicts, which are maintained with ſo much rage, that when the vanquiſhed, at laſt, retreats with the loſs of <hi>twenty thouſand human beings,</hi> the victor finds he has purchaſed ſome little advantage, at the expence of more than half that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note n="*" place="bottom">Smollet, in his Hiſtory of England, ſpeaking of the battle of Cunerfdorf, where the Pruſſians, attacked the Muſcovites, in the year I759, ſays, <q>The carnage was truly horrible, above twenty thouſand Pruſſians lay dead on the field.

them from diſtant lands, and through the perils of long ſeas, to viſit ſtrangers, with thoſe glad tidings of <hi>peace and ſalvation,</hi> to all the world, which angels from heaven, and ſhepherds on earth, proclaimed at the birth of Chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">It is frequently urged in favour of war, that our Saviour near the time of his paſſion, gave directions to his diſciples to take their ſwords. The paſſage is as follows, <hi>Luke</hi> xxii, 35. "When I ſent you without purſe, or ſcrip, lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid, Nothing. Then be ſaid into them, But now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his ſcrip; and he that hath no ſword let him ſell his garment, and buy one. And they ſaid, Lord, behold here are two ſwords. And he ſaid unto them, It is enough." Now from what follows in the context, it appears this paſſage ought not to be taken literally, but rather as ſome annoters ſay, to be underſtood as an emblem of the dangerous ſituation they were in, as we find at <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi, 51. "And behold, one of them which were with Jeſus, ſtretched out his hand, and drew his ſword, and ſtruck a ſervant of the high prieſt, and ſmote off his ear. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Put up again thy ſword into his place; for all they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword" This agrees with the anſwer made by our Saviour to Pilate. <hi>John</hi> xviii, 36. "My king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight; that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.</note>.</p>
               <p>But to know when her chriſtianity admits of war, chriſtianity is to be conſidered as in its right ſtate; now the true ſtate of the world, turned chriſtian, is thus deſcribed by the great Goſpel-prophet, ſhewed what a change it was to make in the fallen ſtate
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015737_0017_0F9A2326AE60A670"/>
of the world; <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, in the laſt days, that the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and all nations ſhall flow into it, and many people ſhall ſay, Let us go up to the mountain of the Lord's houſe, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths,</hi> Iſa. ii, 2. Now what follows from this going up of the nations to the mountain of the Lord's houſe, the holy prophet expreſly tells you in the following words: <hi>They ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks; nation ſhall not lift up its ſword againſt nation, ☞ neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi> Iſa. ii, 4. Mic. iv, 3. This is the prophet's true Chriſtendom, with one and the ſame eſſential divine mark ſet upon it; as when the Lamb of God ſaid, <hi>By this ſhall all men know, that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another, as I have loved you,</hi> John xiii, 34. Chritſ's kingdom is no where come, but where the works of the devil are deſtroyed, and men are turned from the power of ſatan unto God—God is only another name for the higheſt and only good, and the higheſt and only good means nothing elſe but love, with all its works. Would you farther ſee when and where the kingdoms of this fallen world are become a kingdom of God, the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophet tells you, that it is then and there where all enmity ceaſeth. <hi>The wolf, faith he, ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lye down with the kid; the caſt and the young
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015737_0018_0F9A23276E6190D0"/>
lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them. The cow and the bear ſhall feed, and their young ones ſhall lye down together; and the lion ſhall like the the ox. The ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the aſp, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den—for they ſhall not</hi> hurt <hi>and</hi> deſtroy <hi>in all my holy mountain,</hi> Iſa. xi, 6. See here a kingdom of God on the earth; it is nothing elſe but a kingdom of meer love, where all hurt and deſtroying is done away, and every work of enmity changed into one united power of heavenly love—but obſerve again and again, whence this comes to paſs, that God's kingdom on earth is, and can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the power of reigning love; the prophet tells tells us, it is becauſe in the days of his kingdom <hi>the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Hence we are enjoined, by our bleſſed Saviour, to pray for, and continually to watch over every ſuggeſtion of our corrupt minds, which may impede the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe gracious promiſes; <hi>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is done in heaven.</hi> The frequent accounts we meet with in the Old Teſtament, of wars being carried on in the time of the law, gives no ſanction to the ſame practice under the goſpel; as this laſt diſpenſation is a wonderous diſplay of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benignity and love, pronouncing thoſe only bleſſed, who are found in the actual

poſſeſſion of that poverty of ſpirit, that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and purity of heart, which was pointed out in types and ceremonies, under the law; hence the goſpel diſpenſation is declared to be <hi>the bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God,</hi> Heb. vii, I9.</p>
               <p>We are chriſtians, not Jews, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required to attend to the inſtruction and practice of our great and good exampler, Jeſus Chriſt, who was declared from heaven to be <hi>the beloved Son of God</hi>; and whole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on earth was uſhered in by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and heavenly hoſt, with a publication of <hi>peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> The prophecies which preceded our Saviour's coming, clearly pointed to the greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the diſpenſation, which was to take place when He, <hi>the peaceable Shiloh, the deſire of nations ſhould come,</hi> unto whom the gathering of the people was to be, <hi>Hag.</hi> ii, 7.</p>
               <p>The primitive chriſtians bore a teſtimony to the inconſiſtency of war with the goſpel. Robert Barclay, in his Apology, ſays, <q>That this was the judgment of moſt (if not all) the ancient fathers, (ſo called) the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt.

For ſeeing that it is plain, that thoſe things which were in the Old Teſtament, were figures of things to be done in the New Teſtament; therefore we muſt needs ſay, that corporal wars being then done, were figures of the chriſtian wars againſt ſin and the devil, for the heavenly country, which is our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q>

               <p>Hence we have reaſon to believe, that the injunction and allowance granted to the Jews, of making war upon their enemies, and one upon another; was in conſequence of that hardneſs of heart, which prevailed amongſt them; and that this permiſſion was granted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015737_0025_0F9A232D6E1E84C0"/>
from the ſame motive, as that mentioned by our Lord, when the Jews were pleading the licence given them by Moſes, to put away their wives, and marry other women: <hi>Mark</hi> x, 5. <q>For the hardneſs of your hearts, Moſes wrote you this precept; but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female—what therefore God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder.</q> This, as well as war, ſlavery, an other practices of the like nature, were a violence upon that union, purity, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, which ſubſiſted in the beginning, in the original conſtitution of things, whilſt man retained his primitive innocency. And that the ſpilling of human blood was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the eyes of perfect Purity, who the apoſtle denominates under the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, <hi>God is Love,</hi> appears from the prohibition laid upon king David, not to build an houſe unto God, on account of his having been concerned in the deſtruction of ſo many of his fellow creatures, as himſelf declared, I <hi>Chron.</hi> xxii, 8. <q>The word of the Lord came to me, ſaying, Thou haſt ſhed blood abundantly, and haſt made great wars; thou ſhalt not build an houſe unto my name, becauſe thou haſt ſhed much blood upon the earth in my ſight.</q>

Indeed nothing can more clearly and poſſitively militate againſt the ſlavery of the Negroes, than the ſeveral declarations lately publiſhed, with ſo great an appearance of ſolemnity, thro' all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, viz. <q>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with certain unalienable rights; that among theſe are life, liberty, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of happineſs.</q> And <q>That all men are oy nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which when they enter into a ſtate of ſociety they cannot by any compact, deprive or divert their property, namely the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and poſſeſſing property, and purſuing and obtaining happineſs and ſafety.</q> That after theſe, and other declarations of the ſame kind, have been ſo publickly made to the world, Slavery ſhould continue in its full force in the Colonies; and even in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, its bands ſhould, by Law, be farther eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,<note n="*" place="bottom">By a Law of the Province of North-Carolina, May I777.

               <p>From the experience of others, we may deduce a proper application to ourſelves: We read <hi>Jerm.</hi> xxxiv, 8. that the Jewiſh people, a little before the Babylonian Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, acknowledged the duty which lay upon them, of proclaiming liberty to thoſe of their brethren who had been forceably kept in ſervitude, beyond the term limited by the Moſaic Law; for the performance of which they had made a covenant before the Lord; but upon the danger appearing to be over, by the retreat of the king of Babylon, they cauſed the ſervants and hand-maids whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them again into ſubjection. Where-upon the prophet pronounces the judgment, threatned by the Lord, againſt thoſe who had thus falſified their covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> xxxiv, II. <q>Ye have made a covenant before me, but ye turned and polluted my name, and cauſed every man his ſervant, and every man his hand-maid—to return and brought them into ſubjection.</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus faith the Lord, <q>Ye have not

                     <p>About the Year I749; I failed from Liverpool to the coaſt of Guinea, ſometime after our arrival, I was ordered to go up the country a conſiderable diſtance, upon having notice from one of the Negro Kings, that he had a parcel of Slaves to diſpoſe of, I received my inſtructions and went carrying with me an account of ſuch goods we had on board, to exchange for the Slaves we intended to purchaſe; upon being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I preſented him with a ſmall caſe of Spirits, a Gun, and ſome triſles, which having accepted, and underſtood by an interpreter what goods we had, the next day was appointed for viewing the Slaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here how ſhall I relate the affecting ſight I there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, the ſilent ſorrow which appeared in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the afflicted father, and the painful anguiſh of the tender mother, expecting to be forever ſeparated from their tender offspring; the diſtreſſed maid wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hands in preſage of her future wretchedneſs, and the general cry of the innocent, from a fearful apprehenſion of the perpetual ſlavery to which they were doomed. I purchaſed eleven, who I conducted ty'd, two and two to our ſhip. Being but a ſmall veſſel (ninety ton) we ſoon purchaſed our cargo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one hundred and ſeventy Slaves, whom thou may'ſt reader range in thy view, as they were ſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two and two together, pent up within the narrow confines of the main deck, with the complicated diſtreſs of ſickneſs, chains and contempt; deprived of every fond and ſocial tie and in a great meaſure reduced to a ſtate of deſparation. We had not been a fortnight at Sea, before the fatal conſequence of this deſpair appeared, they formed a deſign of recovering their natural right, liberty, by raiſing and murdering every man on board; but the goodneſs of the Almighty ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their ſcheme abortive and his mercy ſpared us to have time to repent: The plot was diſcovered; the ringleader tied by the two thumbs over the barricado door, at Sun-riſe received a number of laſhes, in this ſituation he remain till Sun ſet, expoſed to the inſults and barbarity of the brutal crew of Sailors with full leave to exerciſe their cruelty at pleaſure: The eonſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was, that next morning the miſerable ſufferer was found dead, flead from the ſhoulders to the waiſt.

               <p>Doctor Cheyne, in his Eſſay of health and long life, ſays.

It has often raiſed in me, ſays the Doctor, the moſt melancholly reflections, to ſee the virtuous and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, bound in ſuch chains and fetters, as nothing leſs than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could releaſe them from.</p>
               <p>It is pretended. that drams comfort, warm, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend from the ſeverity of weather, to which men are ſometimes expoſed; without which they ſay, they ſhould periſh with cold; which is probably, in a great meaſure, true of thoſe who are habituated to drink them; the blood of ſuch being thereby ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifeleſs in the midſt of ſummer, without frequent repetitions; this is what ſome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are ſober perſons to endure cold and hardſhips; their vital heat not being extinguiſhed by intemperance, does by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually ſecure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the falſe flaſh of a dram. Beſides, it is well known, that men did not periſh in the coldeſt countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had, of the undoubted truth of this, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hudſon's bay, page I99: Where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, "That the natives of the very cold coaſt of

And as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious effects of ſpirituous liquors in very hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, (as on the coaſt of Guinea,) it is obſerved, that the French and Portugueſe, who do not indulge in diſtilled ſpirits, are healthy compared with the Engliſh; who, drinking freely of ſpirits &amp;c. die faſt.</p>
               <p>The unhappy dram-drinkers are ſo abſolutely bound in ſlavery to theſe infernal ſpirits, that they ſeem to have loſt the power of delivering themſelves from this worſt of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of thoſe, who have it in their power to withhold this deſtructive man bane, either as parents, maſters, or rulers to the people committed to their truſt This is a caſe ſo calamitous to mankind, that to have a thorough ſenſe of it, and yet not to remonſtrate, nor earneſtly caution againſt it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind perſon of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous precipice or pit. Yet, alas how unconcerned are the greateſt part of mankind at this enormous ruin of multitudes! In trials for life, what diligence is uſed to find the occaſion of the loſs of one ſubject. What care will not a faithful Phyſician beſtow for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of one life. How did the wiſe Romans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, who ſaved the life of one Roman citizen. But in the preſent caſe it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thouſand, but probably no leſs than a million that periſh yearly.</p>
               <p>The miſtaken uſe and grievous abuſe of rum and either diſtilled ſpirits, in no caſe appears more palpably than at the time of harveſt, a buſineſs which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Moſaic diſpenſation were enjoined to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

many, from a miſtaken perſuaſion that hard labour, particularly that of the harveſt field, cannot be carried on without uſing a quantity of rum or other diſtilled ſpirits. In ſupport of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died at thoſe times through the extream heat and fatigue, and it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that many more would die, if a plentiful uſe of ſpirituous liquors was not allowed, but this is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notion. it being much more likely that the free uſe of rum occaſioned the death of thoſe people, the quantity they had ſwallowed down, ſending a great flow of ſpirits into the head in proportion to the ſtrength of their body cauſed them to ſtrain their ſtrength beyond what nature could bear; and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the repeated large quantities of ſpirit commonly drank during the whole time of harveſt, keeps up the blood in ſo continual a ferment and fever, that people cannot have a proper re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe weighty conſiderations have induced ſome well minded people to endeavour to induce, by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and under theſe attempts experience has made it manifeſt that very little or no ſtrong liquor is neceſſary at thoſe times; indeed they have been convinced that the harvest, and other labourious work, can be very well managed without making uſe of any ſpirituous liquors at all. If ſuch labour was carried on with ſteadineſs and proper moderation, there would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be no need of a recruit of ſtrength being fought for by that means; more frequent intervals of reſt with a little food oftener allowed the reapers, and ſmall drinks, ſuch as molaſſes and water, either alone or made more agreable with a little cyder, ſmall beer, or even milk and water would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's ſatisfaction and their own advantage, and the overplus wages they would receive to the value of the ſpirits uſually given them, might be ſufficient to purchaſe bread for their families.

Several perſons who from a perſuaſion that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of giving ſpirituous liquors to labourers was exeeding hurtful, have made it a condition with thoſe they have employed, not to uſe any ſpirituous liquors in their field; theſe have had their work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to good ſatisfaction and without any damage enſuing to their labourers. Nay. where they have remained any conſiderable time with ſuch employers, they have generally acknowledged themſelves ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the benefit ariſing from having thus totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained the uſe of thoſe liquors.</p>
               <p>Should this practice take place, it would prove a great bleſſing particularly to the labouring people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one half of whom (a phyſician of this country hath given as his ſentiment) die ſooner than they otherwise would do, ſolely by the uſe of ſpirituous liquors. Beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it would diſcourage the diſtillation of rye and other grain; a practice which is not only a great hurt to the poor in raiſing the price of bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but muſt alſo be very offenſive to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the great and good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the family of mankind, that people ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their earthly and corrupt wiſdom, pervert their Maker's benevolent intention, in converting the grain he hath given to us as the ſtaff of life, unto a fiery ſpirit, ſo deſtructive of the human frame and attended with the other dreadful conſquences already mentioned. Here it may be noted, that any quantity of good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes will by diſtillation, yield more than the ſame quantity of proof ſpirit. And that a conſiderable quantity of molaſſes if taken with bread at one time, as the Indians will ſometimes do, will not intoxicate, the ſpirituous parts in the molaſſes being properly united by our good and wiſe creator with the earthy and balſamick parts, ſo as to make it quite friendly to our nature; but when by diſtilation the ſpirituous parts are ſeparated from the other parts, that meaſure of ſpirits proceeding from the ſame quantity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, becomes a fiery liquid. deſtructive of the human frame.

eſteem as to be twice publiſhed in this city, at page 7I of the Engliſh Edition ſays, <q>many imagine that hard labour could not be ſupported without drinking ſtrong liquors. This, tho' a common is a very erronous notion, men who never taſted ſtrong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily.<note n="*" place="bottom">The few of thoſe who notwithſtanding their exceſs in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirituous liquors, from the uncommon ſtrength of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, may have attained to conſiderable age, would doubtleſs have lived much longer if they had lived temperate liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſuppoſe ſtrong liquors did enable a man to do more work, they muſt nevertheleſs waſte the powers of life, and of courſe occaſion premature old age. They keep up a conſtant fever, which waſtes the ſpirits, heats and inflames the blood and prediſpoſes the body to numberleſs diſeaſes. At page the ſame author tells us, that all intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquors may be conſidered as poiſons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſguiſed, that is their real character, and ſooner or later they will have their effect.</q>

               <p>Amongſt the ſeveral prejudices in favour of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken uſe of ſpirituous liquors. there is none gives it a greater ſanction or ſupport, than the prevailing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even with perſons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed with water, is the beſt and ſafeſt liquor that can be drank; hence confirming the opinion, that ſpirit in one form or other is neceſſary. To ſuch who have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, and think they cannot habituate themſelves to drink water, there may appear to be ſome kind of plea in this argument, eſpecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cyder, or other fermented li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that are dead, hard, ſour, or not properly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But if thoſe perſons ſuffered the weight of the ſubject, and the encouragement they thereby give to the uſe of theſe deſtructive ſpirits, to take proper place with them, it might ſuggeſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, if not neceſſity of introducing a more ſalutary practice.</p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:015737_0046_0F9A233EAD999968"/>That pure fluid (water) which the benevolent father of the family of mankind, points out for general uſe, is ſo analegous to the human frame, that people might with ſafety gradually uſe themſelves to it. Dr. Cheyne obſerves, that without all doubt, water is the primitive original beverage, as it is the only ſimple fluid ſitted for diluting, moiſtening and cooling; the ends of drink, appointed by nature, and he adds happy had it been for the race of mankind, if other mixed and artificial liquors had never been invented. Water alone is ſuſficient and effectual for all the purpoſes of human want in drink: Strong liquors were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for common uſe. Speaking of the effect of wine, which he ſays to have been ſo much in uſe at the time he wrote, that the better fort of people ſcarcely diluted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <q>That as natural cauſes will always produce their proper effects, their blood was inflamed into gout, ſtone, and rheumatiſm, raging fevers, pleurifies, &amp;c. Water is the only diſolvent or menſtrum and the moſt certain diluter of all bodies proper for food.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Doctor Short, in his diſcoorſe of the inward uſe of water, ſpeaks much in its commendation. He ſays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excellency of water, from the longevity and healthfulneſs of thoſe who at firſt had no better liquor, and the health and ſtrength of body and ſerenty of mind, of theſe who at this day have no other common liquor to drink, of this the common people amongſt the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Scotland, are a ſufficient inſtance, amongſt whom it is no rarity to find perſons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy ſtrong and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty ſix or forty. The Doctor ſays, There is a ridiculous maxim uſed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not ſit for buſineſs. I ſay, ſays he, it is water only that can enduce its drinkers with the ſtrongeſt bodies and moſt robuſt conſtitutions, where exerciſe or labour is joined with it, ſince it bell aſſits the ſtomach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the ſmalleſt particles, that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015737_0047_0F9A233F6D91E4C0"/>
they may better paſs the ſtrainers of the body, which ſeparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the ſides of the veſſels, and exerciſe invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the fibres and muſles; whereas the rapid motion of the blood excited by drinking ſpirituous liquors, can not fail of being prejudicial to the body, it will cauſe the watery parts to diſſipate, and the remaining to grow thick and tough, and the event be obſtructions, inflammations, impoſthumations &amp;c.—and tho' ſtrong liquors afford a greater flow of ſpirits for a ſhort time, yet this is always followed with as much lowneſs of ſpirit; ſo that to gain a neceſſary ſtock of ſpirits, the perſon is obliged to repeat the ſame force, till he learns a cuſtom of drinking drams. In this we are confirmed, if we conſider the great ſtrength and hardineſs of poor ruſticks in many parts of the world, whole provisions is moſtly vegetable food, and their drink water. The doctor adds, that it often happens that perſons of tender, weakly, crazy conſtitutions, by ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raining from ſtrong liquors and accuſtoming themſelves to drink water, make a ſhift to ſpin out many years.</p>
               <p>After deſcribing the many diſtempers produced by drinking malt or other ſermented liquors he adds, that ſeeing conſtitutions differ, it is not to be expected that ſpirituous liquors ſhould produce all the ſame ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in one and the ſame perſon, yet that all drinkers have ſeveral of them; and if they come not to that height, its becauſe they afterwards uſe great exerciſe or hard labour, with ſometimes thin diluting liquors, which prevent their immediate hurting.</p>
               <p>And with reſpect to ſuch well diſpoſed people, who ſtill retain a favourable opinion of the uſe of ſpirits mixed with water, ought they not, even from a love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to endeavour to refrain from it, on account of the effect their example may have in incouraging others in the uſe of ſpirituous, liquors, agreable to the example left us by the apoſtle Paul, I Cor. VIII, I3. <hi>If meat make my brother to offend I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtands, left I make my brother to offend.</hi> How much more ought they to refrain from that which
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015737_0048_0F9A23402E68DFE8"/>
tends to eſtablish mankind, in a practice ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſtructive, more eſpecially when they conſider the danger themſelves are in of encreaſing the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſpirit with their water, as it has been obſerved, that the uſe of this mixture is particularly apt, almoſt imperceptible to gain upon thoſe that uſe it, ſo that many otherwiſe good and judicious people have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily to themſelves and others, fallen, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon herd, a ſacrifice to this might devourer.</p>
               <p>A very eminent phyſician has given the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for the benefit of thoſe who have not wiſdom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice of drinking diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, viz. By degrees to mix water with the ſpirit, to leſſen the quantity every day, and keep to the ſame quantity of water, till in about the courſe of a week, nothing of the dram kind be uſed along with water. By this means the perſon will ſuffer no inconveniency, but reap great benefit upon leaving off drams or ſpirits as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the ſtomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be a ſervice. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite always increaſes in a few days after leaving off drams, unleſs by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the ſtomach is deſtroyed. And when the ſtomach is thus affected a cup of carduus, camomile tea, wormwood or centaury every morning faſting and every evening will be found a good remedy.</p>
