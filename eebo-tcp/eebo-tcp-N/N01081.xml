            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001289_0004_0FB22B2E16021820"/>
Words of our Lord, in the Prologue to this Prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>After this</hi> Manner <hi>therefore Pray ye, i. e.</hi> conſonant, and agreeable here-unto: Nor know I any inconvenience, if the very Words be uſed, as the caſe may require.</p>
                  <p>In this Prayer may be conſidered. (1.) The Preface, in which God is deſcribed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Relation to us, [<hi>Our Father,</hi>] an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Relation, Inviting and Encouraging all his Children to make their Addreſſes to Him, with <hi>Confidence</hi>; That he bears like affections, &amp; incomparably greater, than any Earthly Parents can do to their Children: And with <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that they ſhall be heard, in all Things they call upon Him for, which are according to his Will, in the Name of His Son.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is here farther deſcribed in Relation to his own Severeign Majeſty, [<hi>Which art in Heaven,</hi>] admoniſhing us to keep our Diſtance when we come before Him; <hi>not to be raſh with our Mouth, or let our heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and we are upon Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) As to the <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, we are directed, That the things which regard the Glory of God, have the <hi>Deference</hi> and <hi>Preference,</hi> to thoſe of our own Neceſſities. Hence we firſt Pray, for the Sanctification of the Name of God, and the Eſtabliſhing of the Kingdom of his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before other things.</p>

                  <p>The coming of this Kingdom is,</p>

Faith in God is a Foundation-ſtone; <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that He is.</hi> Now when a People do believe in God, and do believe in Jeſus, the Chriſt of God, the Lords Chriſt, the Kingdom of God is come amongſt them; when they acknowledge no God but He who is the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; When they do embrace, profeſs and contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints; and what they do believe in their heart, they are ready when orderly called to it, to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof with their mouth unto Salvation.

                  <p>WISDOM is commended in this Chapter, for its Uſefulneſs to Men, in ſeveral Caſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that it doth direct them how to deport themſelves, towards <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>; ſo as to keep them in their <hi>Obedience,</hi> grounded on the Oath of God, which they have ſolemnly taken, Namely, <hi>The Oath of Allegiance,</hi> which Subjects Swear to their Prince; <hi>I counſel thee to keep the Kings Commandment, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Oath of God,</hi> v. 2. And that they may avoid thoſe dangers, and precipices which fooliſh men, through their folly and indiſcretion do caſt themſelves into: <hi>Be not haſty to go out of his ſight: ſtand not in an Evil thing: for he doeth whatſoever
<pb facs="unknown:001289_0026_0FB276BB13D9D920"/>
pleaſeth him. Whoſo keepeth the Commandment ſhall feel no evil thing,</hi>: v. 3, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wiſdom furniſhes men with Expedients in their Preparations, for the prevention of thoſe Unhappy Accidents and evil Occurrents, which do frequently happen in this changeable World, and are many, unforeſeen, intricate, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be avoided: <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It teaches how to make a right Judgment of the Proſperity, and Impunity of wicked men; That notwithſtanding their preſent Immunity from puniſhment, &amp; proſperous Succeſſes; they ſhall not always eſcape: but are in due Time Snared &amp; Taken in the Work of their own hands.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an Evil Work is not ſpeedily Executed.</hi>] Sentence againſt every Evil Work is paſſed in <hi>Foro Coeli,</hi> in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it is the Execution that is ſuſpended.</p>
                  <p>GOD has determined in his Eternal Counſel to puniſh Sin; and the act is no ſooner commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the Sinner becomes obnoxious; Guilt commences againſt him, and the Man is Self-condemn'd; Condemned in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; if Conſcience be awake to do its Office, and tho' the Puniſhment be defer'd, Conſcience keeps him in ſafe Cuſtody.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Therefore the Heart of the Sons of men,</hi>] That is, (ſays a Learned Man) <hi>Illorum qui ſunt nutriti in carnalitate, et ſunt filij hominum, non D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> no farther. God had determin'd to bring Evil upon <hi>Ahab</hi> and his houſe; yet the evil determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was defer'd all his days upon his Humiliation, 1 King. 21.29. <hi>Becauſe he humbled himſelf before me; I will not bring the Evil in his dayes, but in his Sons days will I bring the evil upon his Houſe.</hi> The doomed <hi>Amorites</hi> were reſpited from deſtruction, four Generations through the Patience of God. Forty years Patience paſs'd between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> threatned, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſtroy'd: All the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berers of the ground are not preſently cut down, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.8. Some Reaſons why all Sinners are not preſently puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>God forbears to puniſh ſpeedily, that men may have a ſpace to Reform, and grow better. I gave her ſpace to repent,</hi> Rev. 2.21. <hi>Differt paenam dum Expectat poenitentiam</hi>: So <hi>Hierom</hi>: He deferreth the puniſhment, while he Expecteth Repentance. Puniſhment is not the primary intention of the Supream Law-giver: The Law of God (as other Laws) binds to Obedience; Puniſhment is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded in a Secondary way, to reduce men to their Duty: Hence God warns, and waits before He ſtrikes. We read of the Riches of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.4. It is the forbearance of God which makes Him rich in Souls, the Salvation of Thouſands of Souls is owing to the forbearance and long-ſuffering of God. It is the Patience of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001289_0029_0FB276C3F453A528"/>
the good Shepherd that ſeeks, finds, and brings home the wandring Sheep; when impatience would eaſily neglect, and deſpiſe a ſingle Sheep. The patient Father Receives, Cloaths, Feaſts the Prodigal Son, and makes Apology for him too, to his diſcontented Brother. Had <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> been cut off in the full carreer of his Sin, we ſhould not have heard of his Repentance, Reſtauration, and Reformation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God ſometimes ſpares wicked men, that they may be Improved as Inſtruments to puniſh others.</hi> He lets looſe the Nations, and ſuffers them to break in upon one another, that they may afflict, vex and puniſh one another. God made a Rod of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to ſcourge the Hypocriſy of his own People, Iſa. 10.5. <hi>O Aſſyrian the rod of mine anger.</hi> The great Invader of the Peace &amp; quiet of <hi>Europe,</hi> as juſtly deſerves to be called, <hi>Flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Dei,</hi> as ever <hi>Totilas</hi> did, as if raiſed up on purpoſe to diſquiet the Nations. When God has done his Work by ſuch Inſtruments, He will do his Work upon them; He will puniſh them: <hi>When the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Sion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria,</hi> v. 12. Thus <hi>Caeſar,</hi> after all his Slaughters and bloud-ſhed, it came at laſt to his own turn, he was ignominiouſly ſlain in the <hi>Senate-houſe,</hi> by ſome of his pretended friends.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb facs="unknown:001289_0030_0FB276C5949E7528"/>3. <hi>Wicked men may in ſome ſenſe be Spared, yet not Exempted from Puniſhment.</hi> Wickedneſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries its puniſhment along with it: Guilt laſhes the Conſcience with inviſible Strokes; a guilty Conſcience is its own Tormentor; no fury like it. Hence Wicked men are likened to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea, when it cannot reſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. When <hi>Paul</hi> a Priſoner reaſoned of Judgment to come, <hi>Felix,</hi> though a Judge, trembled; the Lion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was awakened, and began to roar. After <hi>Nero</hi> had Murdered his Mother, he was ever haunted and tormented with her Ghoſt: Sin not repented of lies gnawing, and feeding as a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the Entrails. Now we ſee the Out-ward Splendor and Grandieur of Wicked men, but we ſee not the inward inquietude, and anxiety of their Minds; we ſee the Silk Stocking, but not the Ulcerated Legg under it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The time wicked men are Spared, is not ſo long as we think for.</hi> We reckon time by ſhort and ſcanty meaſures, and a little time ſeems long to us: Gods forbearance of Sinners, though for many years, is nothing compared with his dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>A thouſand years are but as one day,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.8. Now what is mans Life? <hi>It is eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

part of mans ſhort Life, his Sin unrepented of, finds him out. The Malefactor is not acquitted becauſe the Execution is defer'd unto the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The proper Time for the Puniſhment of Wicked men, is not yet come.</hi> That is another reaſon why they are forborn: <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon.</hi> They are not yet ripe for deſtruction, they have not yet filled up the meaſure of their Sin: The iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was not full in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. Some fill up their meaſure ſooner than others, and ſo bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. They who live under plenty of means, under the light, and influences of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ordinances, their Sins are ſooner ripe for Puniſhment. Others have not the like advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and they are the longer borne with: <hi>The times of Ignorance God wincked at,</hi> Act. 17.30. Or wicked men may be ſpared for a time, that their Puniſhment may be the more remarkable; they ſhall be made Examples: God ſees their day is coming in which his Juſtice will ride tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, in their deſtruction. <hi>Now is the End come upon thee, and I will ſend mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways,</hi> Ezek. 7.3.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly; <hi>Why may it not be to give a check to the Eagerneſs, and Haſtineſs of men to purſue and ſatisfy their own Revenges, under the plauſible preſence of Juſtice, and to teach us Clemency and forbearance?</hi>

Now he that ſhall break this Chain, and conſider only ſome parts by themſelves, ſhall never be able to connect and reconcile them to the Grand deſign of Providence. While the Houſe is in building (perhaps it is the ſame Learned mans ſimilitude) the Materials lie here and there in heaps, in a diſorderly and uncomely manner, but when the Houſe is finiſh'd, a beautiful fabrick preſents it ſelf to our Eye: we often judge before the time, and ſo make falſe Judgments.
